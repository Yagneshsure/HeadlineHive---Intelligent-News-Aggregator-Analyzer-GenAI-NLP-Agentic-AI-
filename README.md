# HeadlineHive - Intelligent-News-Aggregator-Analyzer-GenAI-NLP-Agentic-AI-
HeadlineHive is a cutting-edge platform that automatically scrapes news websites and social media feeds, structuring collected data in both NoSQL and SQL databases. It performs thorough exploratory data analysis (EDA) and analyzes emerging trends using advanced natural language processing (NLP) techniques combined with Generative AI (GenAI) for intelligent summary generation.

Leveraging agentic AI, HeadlineHive autonomously generates comprehensive reports and tracks topics over time without manual intervention. The system integrates data scraping, ETL (extract, transform, load) processes, sophisticated data modeling, and dashboard visualization to deliver actionable insights.

Core capabilities include:

Automated data scraping from diverse news and social platforms

Hybrid storage with SQL and NoSQL databases for flexibility and scalability

Robust exploratory data analysis to uncover patterns and trends

NLP-driven content understanding and GenAI-based summary creation

Agentic AI-enabled autonomous report generation and real-time topic tracking

Interactive dashboards for dynamic visualization of news flows and analytics

This project combines state-of-the-art AI technologies and data engineering principles to empower users with an intelligent, autonomous news aggregation and analysis tool.
