      "title": "Posting Guidelines - Read Before Submitting",
      "text": "#Posting Rules\n\n## 1. No jokes/memes\n\nIf your post is a joke or meme, it does not belong here. This includes posts about politicians, celebrities, movies or products that flopped, bad business/PR decisions, countries in turmoil, etc. \n\n## 2. Titles\n\nTitles must only be informative and descriptive (who, what, where, when, why) not editorialized (\"I bet he lost his job!\") - do not include personal opinions or other commentary in your titles.   \n\nExamples of bad titles:  \n\n* I don't know if this belongs here, but it's cool! (x-post r/funny)\n\n* What could go wrong? \n\n* Building Failure\n\n\nA good title reads like a newspaper headline, or Wikipedia article. If you don't know the specifics about the failure, then describe the events that take place in the video/image instead. Examples of good titles:  \n\n* [The Montreal Biosphère in flames after being ignited by welding work on the acrylic covering](https://www.reddit.com/r/CatastrophicFailure/comments/6ynxoi/the_montreal_biosph%C3%A8re_in_flames_after_being/)  \n\n* [Aftermath of the Oroville Dam Spillway incident](https://www.reddit.com/r/CatastrophicFailure/comments/5x3daa/aftermath_of_the_oroville_dam_spillway_incident/)  \n\n* [Explostion of the “Warburg” steam locomotive. June 1st, 1869, in Altenbeken, Germany](https://www.reddit.com/r/CatastrophicFailure/comments/6qkgb5/explostion_of_the_warburg_steam_locomotive_june/)  \n\n* [Huge crane collapses carrying bridge section](https://www.reddit.com/r/CatastrophicFailure/comments/6ajq61/huge_crane_collapses_carrying_bridge_section/)\n\nIf it is a cross-post you should post that as a comment and not part of the title\n\n\n## 3. Mundane Failures\n\nAvoid posting mundane, everyday occurences like car crashes unless there is something spectacular about your submission. [Nearly 1.3 million people die in road crashes each year,](https://www.asirt.org/safe-travel/road-safety-facts/) and there are many other subreddits already dedicated to this topic such as r/dashcam, r/racecrashes, and /r/carcrash   \n\nWhile there are some examples of extraordinary crashes posted here, in general they would probably be better suited for those other subreddits:   \n\n* [Truck full of ethanol can't stop after crashing](https://www.reddit.com/r/CatastrophicFailure/comments/50ec1z/truck_full_of_ethanol_cant_stop_after_crashing/)  \n\n* [Two lane truck accident in China](https://www.reddit.com/r/CatastrophicFailure/comments/6ggkv3/two_lane_truck_accident_in_china/)\n\n\n## 4. Compilations\n\nCompilations and montages are not allowed on r/CatastrophicFailure. Any video that is a collection of clips from multiple incidents, including top 10 lists are considered compilations.  \nIf your submission contains footage of **one** incident but compiled from multiple sources or angles, those are fine to post. \n\n\n## 5. Be Respectful\n\nAlways be respectful in the comments section of a thread, especially if people were injured or killed. \n\n## 6. Objects, Not People\n\nThe focus of this subreddit is on machines, buildings, or objects breaking, not people breaking. If the only notable thing in your submission is injury/death, it probably would go better in another subreddit.\n\n\n#Flair Rules\nAll posts should have an appropriate flair applied to them by the submitter, please follow these 4 steps to determine if your thread needs a fatality/injury flair. You can set this by clicking the \"flair\" button under the title of your submission. \n\n1. If your submission depicts people dying, you must apply the \"Visible Fatalities\" flair to your post and tag it \"NSFW\"    \n2. If your submission depicts people visibly being seriously injured, you must apply the \"Visible Injuries\" flair to your post and tag it \"NSFW\"  \n3. If your submission depicts a situation where people were killed, but those people are not directly visible you must apply the \"Fatalities\" flair to your post (eg. the Hindenburg Disaster, or a plane crash)  \n4. If your submission does not require one of those tags, you should pick any of the other flairs to describe what type of failure occurred",

Then, medical records comes in and refuses to allow me (mom) to offer a more reliable phone number for us to be reached at.  The number the hospital had on file was our home phone, which we don't answer due to constant telemarketing calls.  I was told that I could not speak and that this information needed to come from my daughter who is over 18.  Then, medical records, turns to my husband and says - so you are the subscriber for the insurance and you will be covering all outstanding balances on bills, right?  So, not allowed to speak, except to assume responsibility for the bills, nice!\n\nFinally, we were asked to sit in waiting area after tests were done.  The PA came into the packed waiting room and delivered my daughter's test results to us in front of the entire waiting room.  BTW, we observed other patients have the same thing happen.  So, now the entire ER waiting room knows exactly what's wrong with my daughter and we (my daughter, myself and my husband) know what's wrong with every other patient in the waiting room.  But hey, a reliable phone number is not allowed.  WTF?",
