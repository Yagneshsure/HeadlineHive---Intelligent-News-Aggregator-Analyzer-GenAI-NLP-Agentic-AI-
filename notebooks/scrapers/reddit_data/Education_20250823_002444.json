      "text": "I heard this fascinating explanation of why education is failing kids and from everything I've learned and seen about this topic it feels spot on, but I'd like to get others' viewpoints on it. It basically went, \"10-20 years ago, it was the parent/student's job to keep up with the *one* teacher's curriculum, now it's the teacher's job to keep up with *each and every* student's own speed/style of learning.\" So the responsibility has shifted from the student/parent entirely onto the teacher, but since one single teacher obviously can't keep up with 30-40 individual kid's learning, they've all been left behind. What do you think about this explanation?",

      "title": "AI is ruining education",
      "text": "The current school system is a mess already but the added use of AI on students homework and papers is just the cherry on top. Don’t get me wrong, Ai can be useful for teaching moments, I know so many college students that use it to teach them higher subjects. Let’s face it, in college your physics professor may have to teach 3 chapters a week and you may not understand all the material— so you use chatgpt and go over it, this is a benefit. It’s not entirely bad. Where I draw the line is when it becomes a constant cheating resource. Cheating used to be hard. It was even harder than actually learning the material. Now it’s accessible to all anywhere anytime. \n\nThis brings me to my current issue. I work at an elementary school as a teachers aid. I grade papers often and homework often. Our students are using Ai on almost everything. Google has turned into Ai slop and you can’t look up something without an ai response. My kids will look up their social studies questions and instead of looking through their book, they will write down whatever the Ai said. When I go over the questions with them, they cannot tell me how they got their answer. They don’t even know half of the vocabulary the Ai uses. Our K-12 students are using Ai to do their homework and classroom assignments. Now you can say this is a skill issue and I should just block google— but that’s the problem. I literally cannot. They need google to access literally everything. Whether it be iready, amplify, renaissance, THEY NEED IT!!! \n\nNow I was a kid too, I used to cheat too! But back then you had to jump through so many hoops to do so, to the point where you learned so much about the topic because of all the quizlets you had to sort through. \n\nIt’s sad seeing how most of my students cannot think for themselves. They have a hard time formulating their own opinions and thinking deeper about questions. We are headed toward a dark path where our students are being told education does not matter, working hard does not matter, why when we have this amazing robot that give us all the answers?? I know this sounds corny as hell but these are our future doctors, lawyers, educators. And if it’s not these kids it’s gonna be the Ai robot performing your surgery. This post is not meant to fear monger it’s meant to grab the attention of someone in a higher position who can advocate for these kids. \n\nOur children cannot read, write or formulate an opinion. They’re being passed on to the next grade and they are unprepared every time. They will never know the value of working towards something ever again and they will never have to think for themselves ever again. Their brains will turn into mush and they will not speak up against propaganda. We challenge our kids to think and to formulate opinions so that they can understand how important their voice is. But what happens when that voice is told not to speak? why? because it doesn’t have to anymore. We have these amazing robot that will do that for you. \n\nAi is immobilizing our children so that they will be easier to control. As if our education system wasn’t so messed up already. You may think this post is bat sh*t crazy and liberal leftist propaganda or whatever but this is real and it’s happening now. We have failed our children and if we don’t do something to prevent them from relying on Ai we will have a generation of voters and workers that will be easily misinformed and mislead.",

Programs across the U.S. are going to be impacted by the anarchy in the Department of Education and children covered by IEPs.  \n\nThis isn’t about panicking parents but about waking them up to the fact that their kids could be forced out of these critical programs just because it’s too resource intensive and that most parents of special needs kids aren’t independently wealthy and can’t afford to self fund the programs needed for their kids.  \n\nHow can I make the argument for this to be discrimination against special needs kids?  Instead of going after government programs that benefit the oil and gas industry or the defense industry they are looking at gutting education of all programs.

      "text": "During the 1970s, groups of people involved in educational policy were asked to participate in a series of discussions on whether the Office of Education then housed under Health, Education and Welfare (HEW) cabinet Department should be made into its own department. I had been on the staff of a House education subcommittee and later on the staff of Council of Chief State School Officers and was invited to participate. Prior to 1965, education was primarily funded by state governments. Schools in poorer states lacked resources, infrastructure, and qualified teachers in many subjects. The Elementary & Secondary Education Act of 1965 (ESEA) was passed to address those deficiencies. For the first time, the federal government poured $billions in funds and programs. A consequence of that was state education funding receded in favor of federal dollars. Federal initiatives like Head Start improved reading, mathematics, and graduation rates.  ESEA helped in new school construction, supplies and curriculum. Each year it became bigger and better. After a couple of years, legislation to create the Department of Education became law. \n\nIf they abolish DOE, millions of children will lose Head Start and a chance to succeed. Schools which are struggling now will be in worse shape. Literacy rates will fall. Reading and writing at base level.  Libraries will close.  Your children will be at a disadvantage.",

      "text": "https://www.edweek.org/policy-politics/opinion-how-the-supreme-court-is-making-public-education-itself-unconstitutional/2025/07\n\n>On June 27, the Supreme Court released its decision in Mahmoud v. Taylor. The decision has not received the attention it merits. A close reading of the conservative majority’s opinion suggests that the high court is moving toward determining that public schooling violates the First Amendment of the Constitution. The decision could mean the end of public education in America.\n\nThe author goes through the background and much of the public discussion around the case, then points out that there is some language in the ruling that attacks public education more fundamentally.\n\n>Within the court’s majority opinion, however, lies a deeper threat to the existence of public schools. Because the court determined that exposure to objectionable material violates parents’ rights, policies involving that exposure are subject to “strict scrutiny,” the highest standard of judicial review. This level of judicial review requires that the government must demonstrate that the policy in question both serves an interest of the “highest order” and is “narrowly tailored” to achieve that interest.\n\n>The Supreme Court would, no doubt, agree that an educated citizenry is a public interest “of the highest order.” What the court does not address is whether public school systems are “narrowly tailored” to achieve the state’s goals.\n\nThe author discusses the history of public education in the United States, and then concludes:  \n\n>All this history is at risk of being jettisoned. Instead, the court has determined that the need to protect students from being exposed to ideas hostile to their family’s religious beliefs trumps everything else. Under the court’s new rules, no curriculum could ever be constitutional unless parents are always informed in advance and can protect their children from anything objectionable to their specific religious beliefs.\n\n>Given this burden, states may be forced to find a more “narrowly tailored” approach to educating citizens. And before we know it, one of America’s greatest successes, one of the most popular American institutions, and one of the few we still share in common, will be gone.",

      "title": "What killed the quality of education in the US?",
      "text": "I am in a unique position to answer this for many reasons, but here goes.\n\n1. Standardized testing is a scam.  \nThe reality is testing was brought in as a way to kill the joy of learning.  There is no teacher who was around before \"high stakes\" testing, who can say testing has done anything other than kill the joy of learning.  \n\nLearning is not algorithmic or formulaic, and oftentimes learning is done when the learner does not realize they are learning.  Now contrast that with the current state of \"we have to cover the entire curriculum in a couple of months whether students understand it or not\".\n\nIf you enjoyed a class it was typically because you had interesting and challenging activities, not because you were completing rigorous assignments or worksheets by a prescribed deadline in preparation for an assessment.  There is little, if any, flexibility to pursue these assignments any more.  \n\nThe joy of learning has been supplanted by the need to prepare students for their state testing.\n\n2. Self-serving attempts to unethically obtain money and power.  \nA huge part (far, far too large) of the public school budget goes to educational materials.  The books that are purchased are largely unnecessary and extremely costly.  The saying \"there is no money in education\" needs to be amended  with \"except in the case of bribes and kickbacks for textbooks and other materials.\"  My school had the most success in our district, but we did not even use the textbook that was purchased for us by the District.  We did not use ANY of the \"materials\" purchased by the District for a shockingly inflated price.  It was all a waste, and I am pretty sure the District knew it, but the bribes from the Companies kept them silent.  \n  \nA decent part of the public education budget has been diverted to pay for designing, administering, and scoring tests that fail to measure what they should be measuring.  We have never seen a single question from our state exam - not a single question.  When you cannot be transparent, there is usually a reason for it - in this case I will again employ the \"never ascribe to malice, what can be attributed to incompetence\".  Then I look at the State education administration, and that rings true - but at the same time malice seems to be ever present.\n\nFacilities are stunningly overpriced and terribly constructed.  Perhaps we should again amend the phrase of \"there is no money in education\" to include \"except in fraudulent construction while overcharging to cover the bribes you paid to District officials\".  If parents knew the conditions that their children are spending 8 hours a day in, there would be a revolution.\n\nSchool lunches are inedible.  Oh sure everyone like to complain about school meals, but if you want to complain - look at the cost of those \"meals\"!  Between the middling quality, highly suspect nutritional claims,  dubious preparation cleanliness, and cost to taxpayers it is really an National embarrassment.  Go to Europe, and look at their meals AND compare the cost - you will quickly realize that our kids are being deprived of decent nutrition (and taste) so that they do NOT establish healthy and long-lived eating habits.\n\n3. You  \nYes, this is hardest pill to swallow, but YOU are the problem.  You do not value education; you value grades and money.  That is the fundamental problem.  You lionize parasitic morons like Elon Musk and Trump.  The understanding is that half of American likely voters will vote for Trump.  That is shockingly transparent indicator of ignorance, hate, and being grifted.  I apologize if that offends you - the truth hurts sometimes.\n\nThe people of almost every other Developed nation were stunned when saw who America had elected in 2016.  They are even more stunned that he could be the leader of the United States, given that he is an avowed dictator, a convicted felon, an admitted rapist, likely child rapist and pedophile, confirmed serial conman at commercial, retail, and financial levels.  Yet one out of two likely voters in the US will vote for this person in a few months.  \n\nWhen I was a little kid, my cartoons had classical music woven throughout each episode.  Kids shows were designed to educate, admittedly with a dose of sugar to make those lessons more palatable.  Now, well it appears that kids shows are mere commercial delivery mechanisms.\n\nThere has also been a clear rejection of Science and all that it has brought us (the US and the People).  Vaccines are somehow evil and the \"government\" is forcing vaccines on the people.  Climate change is not real, but made up to support those lofty environmental and ecological science researcher salaries of $35k.  Even if climate change is real, it is not affecting us, even though we have had the hottest days on record for more than a year so far and some of the worst storms to date in the last few years.  I think you see my point - when scientist are telling you something they are just telling you what the data is saying to them.  Yet to many Americans, they are somehow motivated by destroying jobs and the US economy to further their evil aims.\n\nWhen was the last time the average American read a book on an academic topic?  It sounds like the setup to a joke, because we know the answer and it is not what we want it to hear.  Until we establish a society in which educational pursuits are not a \"waste of time\", and one in which critical thinking is valued instead of being openly and explicitly mocked there really is no hope for the future.",

We are so used to working harder that we forgot there was such a thing as working smarter.  Can a country be anything other than the sum of its \"people\" ?  Its not industry that makes a great country it is the sum of its people in all areas of interest.  Industry only benefits a small segment of the American population.  Sometimes those in power try to kill the spirit by capitalizing on our fears.  The rhetoric of a mad man shaping, shapeless lives.\n\nSo i ask, would a great country want to make \"business\" class and its mogul a ruling class? Or, would we want a leader who wants his people to get a chance at a good education? We can be more than baby makers and worker bees. To be clear, education is not just what is in books.  Its way more than letters on a page or a diploma.  It is an opportunity to ingest, more than food, that can make for achieving the best version of ourselves.  Like money can buy you a boat but there is no Greatness about that.. Is everyone rooting for someone other than themselves? I understand there are people who do not want to spend time learning but there are people who are and were never afforded the time to learn or given information that could transform their world and making the world around them a better place to live, for all.

      "text": "Here’s mine. I believe that standardized testing is a good thing. Generally speaking, I believe that the scores are accurate and reflect a student’s abilities and the aggregate performance in a school. \n\nWithout standardized testing, I’ve observed an insane amount of randomness in classrooms. Say one classroom in 4th grade teaching fractions and another in 4th grade avoiding them entirely. Though a test shouldn’t represent all of the learning a kid engages with in a year, standardized tests help teachers work backwards and be more strategic about their pacing and instructional priorities. Yes, things like place value should be a priority and deserve more attention. The data can help teachers be more reflective and recognize blind spots in their instruction.\n\nWhen effectively used, I’ve also seen the data from standardized tests serve to support students in their development, and help them gain access to needed resources, such as RTI, after school tutoring, etc. The data can help give a more objective sense of what students need. Without having clear academic data, kids fall through the cracks.\n\nStandardized tests fail if they take the joy out of the classroom. Say if they stress out a staff, cause teachers to focus more on drill and kill vs. building relationships.\n\nBut they can be extremely useful when used properly.\n\nAlso, I keep seeing a myth that standardized test scores and funding are intertwined. Somehow that low performing schools get their funding cut? In my experience, low performing public schools receive more money compared to high performing schools. A program known as CSI literally gives a pocket of money to the lowest performing schools in the US.\n\nWrote more than I should have, wow! What’s your unpopular opinion?",

The payout would be $15K for pay levels eight or lower, $20K for levels nine to 12, and $25K for levels 13 or higher.[\\[3\\]](https://thehill.com/homenews/education/5172753-education-department-staffer-buyouts-trump-administration-cuts/)[\\[4\\]](https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/policy/education/3334238/education-department-offers-employees-buyout-up-to-25000/)\n* Certain employees are ineligible for the buyout, including those employed for less than three years, recent bonus recipients, those who received student loan repayment benefits in the last three years, and individuals using disability retirement.[\\[3\\]](https://thehill.com/homenews/education/5172753-education-department-staffer-buyouts-trump-administration-cuts/)[\\[5\\]](https://www.newsmax.com/us/education-department-buyout-offer-workforce-cuts/2025/02/28/id/1200909/)\n* The agreement also includes a clause requiring employees to repay the buyout if they work for the federal government within the next five years, and those who accept the voluntary separation forfeit unemployment benefits.[\\[2\\]](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/feb/28/department-of-education-buyout-email)[\\[6\\]](https://x.com/Griffith2020/status/1895930296542875706)\n* The department has already placed dozens of employees on administrative leave and terminated 39 probationary employees while canceling $900M in research funding through the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE).[\\[2\\]](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/feb/28/department-of-education-buyout-email)[\\[3\\]](https://thehill.com/homenews/education/5172753-education-department-staffer-buyouts-trump-administration-cuts/)\n* This comes as [Linda McMahon, Trump's nominee for Education Secretary](https://verity.news/story/2024/trump-nominates-linda-mcmahon-for-education-secretary), has expressed support for dismantling the department, though complete elimination would require congressional approval.

The ED, a bloated, problematic institution, has overseen a drop to 40th in global education rankings while spending more per pupil than any other nation. While Trump can't abolish it outright, he's implementing his duty to slash as much of its woke essence as possible until Congress steps up and abolishes it entirely\n\n# Democratic narrative\n\nCritics of the ED have rightly pointed to its need for some reform, but their faith should not be placed in Trump's end-it-all approach. Despite its flaws, the ED ensures civil rights enforcement, funds for low-income and disabled kids, and vital data — roles that states can't fully replace. Dismantling it risks unequal education access and chaos, hitting vulnerable students hardest while solving little.",

Tuition is about $60k (total for all kids). While we can afford it, I have a hard time wrapping my mind around this because I wonder if it would be best to put this money aside from them and into a high yield saving account so that they have money for college or even a down payment on their first home. So… was private worth it for you and your family? \n\nDid you or your child (whoever went to a private school):\n\n- acquire a helpful/influential network of people through the school?\n- receive a lot of support when it came time to apply for college?\n- have a great college resume because of all the extracurriculars and coursework offered at the school?\n- feel that you learned great life skills at the school that may be commonly overlooked in public schools?\n- feel like you were “seen” and not lost in the crowd?\n- feel ready for college?\n- AND THE BIG Q: could you have accomplished all this at a public school? \n\nSuper interested in your thoughts!",

I have family friends as well who have taught for 20+ years and everyone is leaving in droves!!! For many reasons im sure. The pay is awful, the students are becoming uncontrollable, also the risk of just being shot in a school here is a high possibility.\n\nSomething I am gathering is that these kids for some reason dont know how to write a full sentence, can barely read, and dont have many critical thinking skills. I think a heavy part is social media, however, reading and typing is a HUGE part of social media (commenting/texting/DMing/reading comments/reading basic captions on posts). I think “No kid left behind” has completely screwed us. The thought of being held back used to scare the hell out of me throughout my WHOLE school career. And i grew up with early early social media introductions. My coworker will bring in the math homework her 6th grader has and when i tell you it’s LITERALLY just coloring in patterns. No math equations, no +,-,x, or division. \n\nAs a 24 year old Gen Z in an alright public school, my peers and I in 2nd grade were reading at a 5th grade + reading level, we could draft and write a 5 paragraph essay in 45 minutes, cursive was highly encouraged but kinda fell off, we still had to be able to read it.\n\nHow have we regressed so bad? How do we fix it? Even if you arent a student/teacher, you should be extremely ALARMED!! These are our children we are failing. These are our future doctors, nurses, lawyers, salesmen, TEACHERS, policemen/women. I dont want to be under the knife of a doctor who couldn’t read till he was in high school. \n\n(DISCLAIMER!!!!): I understand there are kids who dont have the resources to further their education and are at a disadvantage, this is not directed towards these students!! I hear that there are very privileged students who just dont apply themselves!!\n\nEDIT******: I didnt realize so many of yall would be pissy by me asking a question and giving my personal experience😂 Yall so pressed. If you dont like that i asked a question, gave my personal experience, and state what i see, i couldn’t care less. Keep it moving",

Ron DeSantis targeting “woke ideologies” in higher education.\n\nGeneral education courses are the bread & butter of many departments. Due to continual state level budgets cuts university departments have become predatory upon each other, charging for things which were once just done as a matter of principle. \n\nRegardless of how people feel about gen ed, these courses serve a vital role in keeping people educated about history, culture, language, philosophy, literature, and music. These classes are the front lines of defense against ideologies which would seek to restrict or limit access to Humanity's past, to restrict access to the ideas and concepts and knowledge which brought us to this point in human history. \n\nWe may not have enjoyed these classes. We may have nodded off and questioned why these classes were useful, or felt these classes were pointless. They are not. These classes are the breadcrumb trail we use to find out where we were and to not forget the reasons why we made past choices, e. g. why slavery existed, why racism is bad, how colonialism still impacts society today, etc. \n\nThere is a reason why some people want to not only control the message, but also eradicate the message.

Regardless of where you stand ideologically, the reality is that if that happens, each state will be left to navigate education on its own—without federal standards, support, or enforcement.\n\nThat’s a recipe for fragmentation, inequality, and chaos—especially for students with disabilities who rely on federally protected IEPs and 504 plans under IDEA, Section 504, and the ADA.\n\nSo I wrote a petition calling on states to create an Interstate Education Coalition. The goal is to ensure that:\n\t•\tAcademic standards don’t erode.\n\t•\tDiplomas and credits remain portable across state lines.\n\t•\tTeachers are supported and can work across state borders.\n\t•\tDisability protections are honored fully, even without federal enforcement.\n\nIf we’re going to localize education, let’s not isolate it. Let’s work together across states to do it better.\n\nIf this resonates with you, please consider signing and sharing:\n\nhttps://chng.it/ZhKpy4KS7V",

I am really troubled how much of my son’s elementary school curriculum is taught via laptop and “smart boards” (ie, TVs). \n\nThis cannot be an effective way for children to learn. \n\nWe need notebooks, textbooks, white/blackboards, pens and pencils, etc.\n\nBecause I’m a Luddite? no. Because physical media, writing especially, are more effective in triggering memory and retaining information. It instills a discipline and a foundation that then makes digital tools (and they are TOOLS) accelerators later in their educational careers. \n\nI understand teacher find laptops easier for grading and tracking progress. I buy that from an administrative standpoint, but cannot be at the expense of more effective learning. \n\nThis is an opportunity for a company to offer a paper based curriculum with digital tooling to ease administrative stuff (AI assisted OCR to grade, tracking tools, etc)",

      "text": "Recent research has quantified the costs and savings of offering a free first year of university education in the U.S. Using open-source virtual classes and national exam proctoring, the total cost would be $331 million—less than 1% of the U.S. Department of Education’s annual budget. In contrast, students would save $63.4 billion per year in tuition and living expenses.

      "text": "I live in the U.S., in a community with better-than-average schools and plentiful resources. Yesterday my wife and I had a standard scheduled meeting at the local high school, about the progress of our 14-year-old daughter, that left me a bit worried and unnerved .\n\nOur daughter is kind and well-adjusted and shows real consideration for others. We often hear how pleasant she is to be around (she is!), and that's terrific. She's pretty damn decent at math and a good speller and not a bad writer and I'm proud of her for all of that, and tell her so.\n\nBut you know those filmed street interviews where random passersby are asked super simple trivia questions and they have no clue, and you want to tear your hair out with vicarious embarrassment? Yeah. The way things are going, that's going to be her.\n\nThere are so many basic things re, for instance, history and geography, that she doesn't know. Examples: At 14, she doesn't know what the capital of our state is, and barely came up with the correct answer when asked to name the capital of the U.S. She has no idea when World War II started or ended, can't begin to tell the differences between capitalism and communism, can't tell the Revolutionary War from the Civil War, hasn't even *heard* of key figures like Albert Einstein or John F. Kennedy or Bill Gates, etc.\n\nI'm not asking her to describe nuclear fission or solve Fermat's Theorem. I'm talking about everyday stuff that I thought was (or ought to be) part of what halfway educated citizens know. Even at 14.\n\nThe teachers say she's doing great, that she's always cooperative and attentive, that she's \"in the top half of her class.\" On one level, that's satisfying to hear, but if the latter part is true, I also find it frightening and depressing.\n\nI knew *so much more* about the world when I was her age. So did our older daughters, now 19 and 22. (The middle one is even a trivia fiend who can give me a run for my money when we watch Jeopardy together.)\n\nAccording to the teachers, the current generation learns \"differently\" and finds it harder to focus and retain things. I'm told that it should all turn out fine and that I have no real cause for concern. Don't I? What does that stance say about our education system and our collective future? Am I a jerk, or way off base, for worrying about my daughter and about the low, low expectations that today's society seems to impose on students?",

Also, reallowing trade programs to flourish in public schools to catch any student who aren’t interested in research or education but want to have a career path that will show them the results of there work (i.e. A general contractor sees their project move along in steps and gives them dopamine when the project completes each step).

Trump's plan is to reduce this bloat while empowering states to make the decisions. It's at the local level that overhauls will be made to make America's education great once again.\n\n[U.S. Department of Education](https://www.ed.gov/about/news/speech/secretary-mcmahon-our-departments-final-mission)\n\n# Left narrative\n\nTrump's plan to slash the Department of Education will have so many devastating consequences around the country. For instance, what about the large numbers of disabled children around the US who rely on federal funding for their education? Like Trump's other cuts, the plan appears to be to act now and think later.",

      "text": "This move is consistent with the current administration divisive policies. Instead of focusing on America as a whole, there seems to be general policy of dividing Americans.  The view of generations of educational thinkers in the United States has been that education is essential to maintain our democracy. It is my view, and the view of many educators, that there should be federal standards of learning in the United States. \n\n\n\nhttps://www.yahoo.com/news/emergency-appeal-trump-asks-supreme-150120281.html\n\n\nExcerpts:\n\nU.S. District Judge Myong Joun said the White House's decision to fire more than 1,300 workers in March has prevented the federal government from effectively implementing legally required programs and services. Such changes can't be made without the approval of Congress, which created the department in 1979, Joun ruled.\n\nThe Boston-based 1st U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals backed that decision. The court said the administration provided no evidence to counter Joun's \"record-based findings about the disabling impact\" of the mass firings and the transfer of some functions to other agencies.\n\n\"What is at stake in this case, the District Court found, was whether a nearly half-century-old cabinet department would be permitted to carry out its statutorily assigned functions or prevented from doing so by a mass termination of employees aimed at implementing the effective closure of that department,\" Judge David Barron wrote for the panel of three circuit judges.\n\nThe Trump administration on June 6 asked the Supreme Court to let it dismantle the Education Department and fire hundreds of its workers.\n\nPresident Donald Trump is trying to fulfil his campaign promise to end the Education Department and move school policy to the states.",

And that $167.12 million encompassed 39% of NEA’s total spending in 2024.\n\nIt’s no surprise, given NEA’s failure to prioritize teachers and their needs. Its federal filing revealed the following:\n\nJust 9% of NEA’s spending is on teacher representation, which should be its core focus.\nIts spending on politics and other contributions is more than four times higher than its spending on representation.\n\nNEA lavishes six-figure salaries on 410 of its own officers and employees.\n\nThe union spent nearly $5.3 million on travel and food for unspecified purposes.\n\nAnd while membership decreases, NEA dues increase – meaning it’s charging those members that remain more to cover its exorbitant spending.",

It feels like a college degree is somewhat meaningless now in the sense you could go a super niche route and make it by without or you need to commit and get an even higher level of education. Times just seem super tough. **Edit:** My point is more about how a Bachelor's degree has become the baseline. In many fields, especially those that are more liberal arts-oriented, what truly distinguishes candidates now? Should experience, specialized certifications, or even further education be valued more? Are we shifting toward a model where niche skills and real-world application outweigh traditional degrees? I'd love to hear perspectives on what actually creates opportunities today.",

Let's focus on what's next when this all shakes out. Our focus is needed. Our attention is needed here. On the future we hope to create. Look around this globe and take note of who's doing what right. We have every country represented in this nation. Let's take advantage of this opportunity and focus on this future we want to build. \n\nEdit; Looking at comments it seems many have missed the point. Or may have just become so argumentative over the past few years to think clearly? The point was not the sh*t  on Finland or raise them up as an ultimate goal but to look at what is being done right, what's working in other parts of the world. American exceptionalism has somehow become ingrained in folks to the point of missing the point. We will have an opportunity soon to do things differently. How do we want that to look? Think beyond tests. What's working now? What just isn't and hasn't since forever. We are not built to sit all day.",

When I took math, chemistry, and other STEM subjects it was fairly eye opening. Learning chemistry really opened up my eyes and connected the dots for me on many things: I understood why soda cans get colder when you open them and why it can be cloudy all day but only rain when the sun goes down. Many other things about our world started to make sense to me. I had similar experience with math. And it seems like many of my classmates did the same thing. \n\nMy kids going through college are not having these epiphanies. My wife is doing a career change and after a year of chemistry and 2 years of bio, when I mentioned these things she is not getting it. Her grades are excellent and she can do the work, so it's not a learning or intelligence issue.\n\nI feel like education has gotten better and technology is being used to add more learning tools. I think the learning is better. But the application to real life seems to be missing.\n\nIs this not an issue? If it is an issue, is the cause how these subjects are being taught? Is there less curiosity about how the world works?",

      "text": "# The Facts - [read here ](https://verity.news/story/2025/education-dept-cuts-half-its-workforce-in-dramatic-downsizing?p=re3892)\n\n* The US Department of Education has announced plans to cut its workforce from 4,133 to some 2,183 employees. 1.3K workers will reportedly be laid off, while nearly 600 others quit voluntarily over the past seven weeks.\n* Those being let go by the department will be placed on leave from March 21, and will receive full pay and benefits until June 9, along with severance or retirement benefits. The department is also ending leases on buildings in cities such as New York, Boston, and Chicago.\n* Secretary of Education Linda McMahon stated that the department will continue to deliver all statutory programs, including formula funding, student loans, Pell Grants, and funding for special needs students, despite staff cuts.[U.S. Department of Education](https://www.ed.gov/about/news/press-release/us-department-of-education-initiates-reduction-force)\n* The Department, which handles $1.6T in federal student loans and enforces civil rights for students with disabilities, provides less than 10% of the US's public school funding. Most education funding comes from state and local taxes.\n* Its Office of Civil Rights faced particularly steep cuts, with regional centers being shuttered or reduced to minimal staffing in New York, San Francisco, and Boston, raising concerns about its ability to process civil rights probes.\n* The announcement prompted the temporary closure of all department offices in Washington, DC, as well as regional offices for security reasons, with employees instructed to take their laptops home and leave their office buildings by 6 pm.\n\n# Republican narrative\n\nTrump's education reforms, including Department of Education layoffs and reduced overhead for research grants, represent essential market corrections to an inefficient system. Removing bureaucratic bloat and redirecting funds to states promises to improve student outcomes while addressing higher education's declining productivity and escalating costs.\n\n# Democratic narrative\n\nGutting the Education Department threatens America's foundational promise of equal opportunity. By slashing its workforce and canceling programs that help disadvantaged students, disabled children, and aspiring college graduates, Trump's administration risks dismantling vital safeguards that level the educational playing field—potentially widening inequality and undermining America's global competitiveness.\n\n# Sources\n\n[U.S. Department of Education](https://www.ed.gov/about/news/press-release/us-department-of-education-initiates-reduction-force)\n\n[Newsmax](https://www.newsmax.com/us/education-department-donald-trump-usaid/2025/03/11/id/1202393/)\n\n[Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/mar/11/us-education-department-layoffs)\n\n[CBS](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/department-of-education-job-cuts/)\n\n[New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/11/us/politics/trump-education-department-firings.html)\n\n[Daily Wire](https://www.dailywire.com/news/education-dept-staff-expected-to-be-slashed-by-half-as-trump-mulls-closing-it)",

      "text": "Hey guys, I've spent some time looking this up, and I've even read a few other things on reddit, but I haven't found an answer that makes a lot of sense.\n\nAs the question states, I'm curious why education is so heavily focused on memorization in school. Make no mistake, I'm not asking about things like 2+2 or the alphabet. I totally understand  that you need a basic level of knowledge to draw from for everyday use.\n\nI'm more curious why I was forced to memorize how to graph a polynomial function on my TI 83 calculator in applied math, or all 6 of the gas laws and when/how to use them in chemistry, or a kinematics equation for physics. \n\nAs someone who wasn't diagnosed with ADHD until the age of 26, I always struggled with memorizing long equations like these. It felt very unfair that I was seen as stupid, (even called so at least twice) by some teachers in highschool. I'm perfectly capable of doing these equations, but I could never remember the order of operations when writing them out. \n\nFor example, I can't remember that the combined gas law is (P1V1)/T1=(P2V2)/T2 without reading it, but I know what each part is, how to find it, and how to use them in the equation.\n\nNow that I'm an HVAC tech, it's even worse with the number of codes I'm forced to memorize for my job, which is absolutely insane to me as I have a physical code book that I can look that shit up in.\n\nNever made sense to me, and with my ADHD, it always seemed insurmountable to try and memorize dozens of formulas that long without being able to reference anything. Just bugs that I'm seen as stupid, when I can't memorizing things for the life of me. Why isn't being to apply that knowledge good enough?",

      "text": "[Edit to clarify: I'm interested more philosophically what public educators think in general. I include my info more to share why this is is on my mind. I'm adjusting the wording below to make that clearer.]\n\nFor those of you in public education: What do you think about parents who fight school districts to get free and appropriate public education for their children when the mainstream classroom isn't working for them? Is it ethical to sue a school district?\n\nI see both sides: On one side, any funding spent on one specific child is funding that isn't spent on other people's children... and if a family \"lawyered up\" then those funds would be an issue, too. One the other side, if those of us with \"lawyer money\" use it to force school districts to do better (rather than using that money to pay for a private school/homeschool), that could help improve systems for all families, including those who have no option but the public schools.\n\nPublic education has always been a value of mine; generally speaking, I feel like if one CAN make the public schools work for their child, they SHOULD make the public schools work for their child, because public education goes downhill when it's only accessed by those without other options. \n\nAND, my child is a human being, not a symbol of my values. His needs come first. And from what I've read for children with his suspected condition, public school is often impossible and/or a big struggle. So this is fresh on my mind as we are about to enter the public school system.",

      "text": "In the grim landscape of contemporary education, we find ourselves confronted with a paradox that would be laughable were it not so tragic. Despite unprecedented access to information, despite billions poured into educational technology, despite endless administrative pontification about \"literacy goals,\" we have produced a generation increasingly alienated from the written word. The evidence surrounds us like the ruins of some once-great civilization: plummeting reading scores, collapsing attention spans, and the quiet death of intellectual curiosity.\n\nThe culprit is not, as some techno-utopians or nostalgic reactionaries might have you believe, the existence of smartphones or social media or artificial intelligence. No, the murder weapon belongs to a far more insidious perpetrator: the unholy alliance between corporate educational publishers, data-obsessed administrators, and the grim machinations of standardized educational policy. The fingerprints of this cartel are all over the crime scene.\n\nWhen the Common Core State Standards arrived with messianic promises of educational salvation, they carried within them the seeds of reading's destruction. By dramatically shifting elementary education away from narrative comprehension toward \"informational texts,\" they effectively conducted a lobotomy on the developing mind's relationship with story.

They tell you how a student performed *once*, not if they truly understood, stayed engaged, or can apply it a month later.\n\nI’ve watched students ace an exam and forget 50% by the next week (I've been that student).  \nI’ve seen others become deeply engaged and improve, but their grades lag behind until the end of the term (I've also been that one).\n\nIf we care about ***actual learning***, we need to start tracking comprehension and engagement in real time when there’s still a chance to fix things, not after it’s too late.\n\nFor those teaching or running programs:  \nIf grades disappeared tomorrow, what’s the one signal you’d use to measure real learning?",

      "title": "Consequences of eliminating Department of Education!!",
      "text": "A Quick question about the subject to ChatGPT lead to this answer and I am really worried!!\n\n\nEliminating the U.S. Department of Education (ED) would have far-reaching consequences, affecting federal education funding, policy enforcement, civil rights protections, and overall educational quality. Here are some key potential consequences:\n\n1. Loss of Federal Education Funding and Programs\n\t•\tThe ED administers billions in funding for K-12 and higher education, including Title I funds for low-income schools, special education funding (IDEA), and Pell Grants for college students.\n\t•\tWithout these funds, states and local school districts would have to find alternative funding sources, potentially leading to budget shortfalls, teacher layoffs, and cuts to programs.\n\n2. Increased Inequality Between States\n\t•\tFederal oversight helps ensure that states provide equal access to quality education, particularly for disadvantaged students.\n\t•\tIf the ED is removed, education policies would be left to states, which could result in greater disparities in school quality between wealthy and poor states or districts.\n\n3. Weakening of Civil Rights Protections\n\t•\tThe ED’s Office for Civil Rights (OCR) enforces laws protecting students from discrimination based on race, disability, or gender (e.g., Title IX, Americans with Disabilities Act).\n\t•\tWithout this federal enforcement, students facing discrimination might have fewer options for legal recourse, leading to increased educational inequities.\n\n4. Lack of National Education Standards and Coordination\n\t•\tThe ED plays a key role in setting and encouraging national education standards (e.g., Common Core, No Child Left Behind, Every Student Succeeds Act).\n\t•\tWithout it, states may create inconsistent curriculums, making it harder for students who move between states to stay on track academically.\n\n5. Impact on Higher Education\n\t•\tFederal student loans and grants (like Pell Grants and FAFSA) are administered by the ED.\n\t•\tWithout federal oversight, student loan programs could become privatized, potentially leading to higher interest rates, reduced access to aid, and predatory lending practices.\n\n6. Increased Burden on States and Local Governments\n\t•\tStates would have to take full responsibility for funding and regulating education, which could strain state budgets and create inconsistencies in how education is managed.\n\t•\tWealthier states might thrive, while poorer states struggle to maintain school quality.\n\n7. Reduced Federal Disaster and Emergency Support\n\t•\tThe ED helps coordinate school responses to natural disasters, pandemics, and national crises (e.g., COVID-19 relief funding for schools).\n\t•\tWithout federal coordination, responses would be fragmented, leading to delays and inefficiencies in reopening schools or providing resources during crises.\n\n8. Uncertain Future for Special Education\n\t•\tThe Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) mandates that schools provide services for students with disabilities.\n\t•\tWithout federal enforcement and funding, some states might fail to meet these obligations, leaving students with disabilities at a disadvantage.\n\nConclusion\n\nWhile some argue that eliminating the Department of Education would reduce federal overreach and give states more control, it would also likely increase inequality, reduce funding for schools, weaken civil rights protections, and create a fragmented education system. The absence of a federal education department could make it more difficult to ensure that all American students receive a high-quality education, regardless of where they live.",

      "text": "https://calmatters.org/education/higher-education/2024/12/competency-based-education/\n\nThis immediately comes to mind a model for doing this.  Classes are held but the teacher acts more like a TA, answering questions and giving students 1:1 time.  There are no homeworks and no midterms, instead you can take exams at the testing center, available every day(testing center is a room where you have to give up any devices and take the exam while proctored).  Similarly classes are available year round, with different teachers staffing the center for this subject.  \n\nFail an exam and you perhaps have a delay before taking it again (and it's a random draw from a question bank or something), but it doesn't slap your transcript with F/C/B and harm your chances in the future.  \n\nFinacial aid etc require some minimum rate of completion of credits (passing exams) but if you can afford it you can take any length of time.  \n\nIs the model we have just an accident of history?  Why doesn't it already work like this?",

      "text": "I was a full time teacher for 25 years in a poor rural district. For my first 16 years, any behavior incidents serious enough for parent contact were strictly under the purview of school site administrators. They decided the consequences. They called the parents. They documented. They set up and moderated any needed meetings. They contacted any support person appropriate to attend the meeting such as an academic counselor, socio-emotional counselor, and special education professional. \n\nBehavior at our schools, district-wide, was really good. I enjoyed my four years of subbing at any of the district schools (It took four years for there to be an opening for full time). Even better, we had excellent test scores. Our schools won awards. Graduates were accepted at top ten colleges. \n\nAfter a sweeping administrative change in 2014, my last nine years were pure hell. Teachers were expected to pick up ALL the behavior responsibilities listed in the 1st paragraph.  Teachers just didn't have the time, nor the actual authority to follow through on all of these time-sucking tasks.  All it took was one phone call from a parent to an administrator to derail all our efforts anyway.\n\nI still have no idea what the administrators now do to earn their bloated paychecks.  They have zero oversight.  As long as they turn in their paperwork on time, however inaccurate, no one checks to make sure they are doing their jobs.\n\nOur classrooms are now pure chaos. Bullying is rampant. Girls are constantly sexually harassed. Objects fly across the classroom. Rooms are cleared while a lone student has a table-turning tantrum. NONE of this used to happen. It became too dangerous to be a teacher in my district, so I retired early.\n\nWorst of all, we are graduating functionally illiterate adults. Our test scores are in the toilet. Our home values are dropping. My community is sinking fast.",

      "text": "Yes, ease of access to guns is THE major reason for school shootings. But there is an underlying issue here I have never ever seen mentioned by anyone: problematic behavior by children, including bullying.\n\nEveryone who has been a part of the the public education system knows this exists. Rampant bullying and misbehavior by kids who know there won't be any consequences are widespread. Almost every kid who decides to bring guns to schools has 2 common experiences: bad parenting (either abusive parenting or parents who allow easy access to guns) and being a social outcast. We often think of social outcast as a mental problem with the child, but never see or discuss its reality. \n\nI've seen schools where it's almost run like a gang. These outcasts often have been through things that would constitute physical or sexual assault in any other part of society but its just swept away as \"kids will be kids\" and never mentioned.\n\nThe kids being assholes to other students are also often the same ones who act up with their teachers. Teachers who truly want to help educate children but having to deal with these type of kids and their parents often leads to just a complete loss of their love for teaching.\n\nThere is ZERO accountability for misbehavior in most of the schools I've seen. Teachers and children are left to fend for themselves. These problem children know they will get into barely any trouble so they just keeping upping their antics until things go really wrong. That includes being a insufferable asshole to all teachers around them and literal psychopathic behavior with other kids when no one is looking.\n\nIn NO OTHER PART OF THE WORLD would kids be able to act up in the presence of a teacher, only for the teacher to be completely unable to do anything. If you see schools in China or Europe, you can see the level of respect children give teachers, and that's because not being respectful has some real consequences. \n\nBut not in the USA. \n\nWhy is this never mentioned or discussed? There need to be real and long lasting consequences for kids being disrespectful to teachers or abusive to their peers. Until this happens, our education system will continue being a daycare for older kids instead of institutions of learning.",

Charter school isn't an option financially so I feel like I'll have to send my kids to this school district when the time comes.\n\nHow do my husband and I keep them from mixing in with the wrong crowd and picking up bad behaviors when they're in an under-funded, run down, frankly bad school for 8 hours a day with a large majority of peers from really rough neighborhoods? I mean, they'll have to make friends at some point. The odds of them associating with troublemakers are a lot higher than if we lived in a better district. Any advice?",

It was surrounded by dairies and almond orchards that depended upon undocumented workers for labor.  When the young mother of two students, a K and 2nd grader, was on the verge of deportation (she received a letter with a date to report to ICE), the community united to keep her in the community.  They chipped in for a good lawyer, wrote letters, and called their representatives.  We held a fundraiser in the school gym.  And we prevailed.\n\nI'm utterly positive that nearly every one of those families voted for Trump - even though they must remember just how invested we all were in keeping that mother with her family.  I don't understand how that happens, but memories are a funny thing.  \n\nAt least we knew we wouldn't witness her arrest at the school as she dropped off her kids.  If I had, I would have probably quit as a teacher on the spot.  That kind of trauma wouldn't have been what I signed up for.",

I'd have expected the US school system to try to improve that, but in recent years, I've heard schools in the US are actually lowering standards in order to show that they have more students graduating high school.  For instance, [this article](https://capitalresearch.org/article/teachers-unions-and-the-lowering-of-standards-part-3/), [this article](https://smartclassroommanagement.com/2022/09/09/low-standards-destroying-schools/), and [this article](https://www.economist.com/united-states/2024/03/10/new-numbers-show-falling-standards-in-american-high-schools) (behind a paywall from The Economist) mention it.  In particular, I'm a software engineer, and I'm not sure there are very many young people these days going into STEM (science, technology, engineering, & math) careers, which I think are important in providing technological innovation which is important for society and the economy today.  It would be good to ensure we have plenty of local talent in the country for the various companies that need it, but with basic schooling through high school lowering standards, my concern is that young people will have more of a struggle learning skills needed for jobs, and employers may have a more difficult time finding good employees they need.",

Chancellor of New York City public schools David Banks has said that he is considering a ban on classroom phone access that would affect 1.1 million students, though the ban will not be in place at the start of the school year. In June his counterparts in Los Angeles approved a similar crackdown, affecting more than 400,000 students and starting in January 2025. More than a dozen states have now enacted school phone restrictions in the U.S. And the U.K. issued new guidelines for schools on phone bans this past February.\"\n\nWe summarize what the evidence shows about how these phone bans impact student performance and mental health.[ Read more at the link](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/do-school-phone-bans-help-students/?utm_campaign=socialflow&utm_medium=social&utm_source=reddit).\n\nIs your district considering a similar ban? Is there already one in place? If so, how is it going?",

      "title": "Why we should start schools and jobs at 10 AM instead of 8 AM",
      "text": "Hey everyone,\n\nI’ve been thinking about something that could really change the game for all of us, and I want to share it with you—why aren’t schools and jobs starting at 10 AM instead of 8 AM? Let’s break it down and explore why this simple change could make a huge difference for productivity, mental health, and overall quality of life.\n\nWhy 10 AM?\nThe 8 AM start time might have made sense during the Industrial Revolution, when people worked in factories, but it’s not a good fit for today’s world. Now, we’re in an age of knowledge work, creative industries, and tech—fields that require a clear, rested mind to function well. Starting earlier just doesn’t align with how our bodies work naturally.\n\nScience Behind It:\nThere’s a lot of research showing the benefits of later start times, particularly for adolescents and young adults. According to studies from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the majority of teenagers (about 70%) don’t get enough sleep because school starts too early. This leads to a variety of issues, including:\n• Decreased academic performance: Research shows that later start times improve test scores and overall student achievement.\n• Improved mental health: Teens who sleep more are less prone to depression and anxiety.\n• Increased focus and energy: More sleep means people can focus better and have higher productivity.\n\nEven for adults, pushing work hours back makes sense. A Harvard Business Review study found that employees who start later are often more engaged and productive, as they’re less stressed and more rested. Sleep deprivation costs businesses $63 billion a year due to lost productivity!\n\nSo, What’s the Problem?\nThe main problem is inertia—the fact that we’re stuck with a system designed for another time. Changing long-established work patterns can be met with resistance from employers, schools, and even parents who are used to the 8 AM routine. But if we take a closer look, we can see that the potential benefits far outweigh the initial challenges.\n\nSome challenges include:\n• Adapting schedules: Schools and workplaces would need to shift schedules and transportation.\n• Perception of laziness: Some might argue that starting later makes people less “disciplined,” but in reality, it’s about working smarter, not harder.\n\nThe Big Win:\nShifting to a 10 AM start time is practical, especially when we consider that most modern jobs and education don’t require the old-school factory mentality. We’ll all get more sleep, reduce stress, increase productivity, and ultimately create a happier, healthier society.\n\nI truly believe this is a change that could benefit everyone—students, workers, and families. And it’s something that can be easily adjusted to fit into our current system without major overhaul.\n\nWould you support this shift? Do you think it’s feasible for your school or workplace? Let’s talk about the potential benefits, challenges, and how we can push for change.\n\nPlease note that ChatGPT helped me formulate this text. I’m not a good English speaker. I just used AI for the message",

      "text": "From our [article](https://www.silive.com/education/2025/05/ny-set-to-become-largest-state-in-us-to-enact-school-cellphone-ban.html?utm_source=redditsocial&utm_campaign=redditor) that went up today: \n\nGov. Kathy Hochul announced on Tuesday that New York will become the largest state in the nation to require statewide, bell-to-bell restrictions on smartphones in K-12 schools.\n\n“New York was the first state to target addictive social media feeds — and now we’re the largest state to restrict smartphones in schools throughout the entire school day,” Hochul said. “I know our young people succeed when they’re learning and growing, not clicking and scrolling — and that’s why New York continues to lead the nation on protecting our kids in the digital age.”\n\nThe cellphone ban is [part of an agreement and enactment of the state budget](https://www.silive.com/education/2025/04/ny-budget-includes-bell-to-bell-cell-phone-ban-in-schools.html), which included a $13.5 million investment to help schools implement the ban. The tentative budget agreement will go to the state legislature for a full vote.\n\nThe proposed cellphone ban in New York schools would be in place starting in the 2025-2026 school year and apply to all schools in public school districts. Charter schools and Boards of Cooperative Educational Services would also be under this requirement.\n\nAbout the ban: Every student would be required to disconnect from their device during school hours bell-to-bell. This means there will be no unsanctioned use of smartphones and other internet-enabled devices on school grounds K-12 schools for the entire school day — including settings like classrooms, lunch, and study hall periods.\n\nThe policy proposed by the governor clarifies that students will be able to have access to simple cellphones without internet capability, as well as internet-enabled devices officially provided by their school for classroom instruction, like laptops or tablets used as part of lesson plans. Schools would also be required to give parents a way to contact their kids during the day when necessary.",

In some US schools, people get a 4.0 just for showing up, participating, and turning in homework. Meanwhile, at my school, you basically have to get 100% in every exam, test, and assignment ***in every subject*** just to get a 4.0 GPA equivalent.\n\nTo make it worse, in the U.S. it seems like getting 90% on a test is considered normal or even “average,” whereas here in Europe, if you score anything above 70%, you’re basically a genius. So obviously, GPAs look a lot higher on paper in the U.S., even though the grading is way more lenient.\n\nIt just feels unfair, like European students might be working harder and learning more, but we end up with lower GPAs that don’t reflect that. **How do universities even compare international students fairly when the systems are so different?** \n\nAnyone else feel this?

I believe that schools should collect information, advice, and resources that would prove useful to alums during their ascent into adulthood, and either have a page on their website dedicated to these resources, or send seniors off after graduation with this compiled knowledge base. The compiling and publication of this knowledge could take on many forms, from a senior project every graduated class gets to research and do for themselves, to something that the school builds and passes down to each class, to the aforementioned dedicated page on school websites. Whatever form it took, the main concept and goal would be building a comprehensive resource for the future reference of graduated students.

      "text": "This fall, my husband and I will be looking at schools for my daughter for when she goes into kindergarten. \n\nI went through a phase for a few years where I was adamant that I wanted to homeschool our kids because I didn't believe that traditional methods of education were good for them. I watched a TED talk on how schools kill creativity, got really into podcasts that demonized traditional school and glorified educating your kids out in nature, read a book about how kids learn, and really wanted something different for our kids than traditional education. However, in the past year or so, I've realized that homeschooling is definitely not the path our family should take because of my personality and shortcomings as well as my oldest's personality. She has also really thrived at her traditional preschool and learned far more than I would have taught her at home and has grown socially and emotionally.\n\nWe are very fortunate that we have basically every type of school in our area to choose from. A classical charter school, religious schools (we are Catholic), a Waldorf school, Montessori, and we have several very highly rated public schools within a 10-15 minute drive of our house. The public schools seem really great and the parents that I've spoken to that have their kids there speak very highly of them, so we are really leaning toward that route for kindergarten. \n\nMy biggest concern is how much screen time kids are getting in public schools and whether or not that will harm or help them. We are living in a much different time than when I was in school, so it's a challenge to navigate this. I don't want to fear technology though, because I can see how some of it can be extremely helpful in education. For example, my CPA study software has an AI tool that has been so helpful in helping me understand concepts better. I'd love some reassurance from those of you out there that are more knowledgeable than me about the current state of our education.",

      "text": "It teaches teenagers that every social hiccup needs an authority figure to fix it, instead of learning to resolve conflict or tolerate discomfort, they learn to snitch, blame, dramatize, and outsource responsibility.\n\n“mediation” in teen drama rarely helps. It turns into a performative punishment session where whoever plays the victim better wins, and social tensions just get worse. Teens figure out fast that they can weaponize school staff to punish people they don’t like. Suddenly, a normal falling out becomes a formal meeting because someone wanted to play power games. Half the time, kids walk out more pissed off than they went in.\n\nThis kind of overreach also enables manipulation. Students quickly realize they can weaponize counselors to target people they don’t like, turning school staff into pawns in their popularity contests.\n\nSocial friction isn’t bullying. Not being invited, being disliked, or having a falling out is not a crisis. It’s adolescence.\n\nUnless someone’s being harassed or threatened, counselors should stay out of it. Let kids figure out how to handle their own messes.",

The “Save Texas Schools” coalition, which includes educators, parents, and local leaders, argues that vouchers would divert essential funding from already under-resourced public schools, especially in rural areas where public education is often the only option. The article highlights the broad, bipartisan opposition to the measure, noting that even some conservative lawmakers remain skeptical due to concerns about long-term impacts on local school systems. \n\n\n\nhttps://www.chron.com/politics/article/save-texas-schools-vouchers-20181988.php",

      "text": "TLDR: father with sole custody doesn’t make his daughter go to school or make up her missed work and now he’s mad at the school that she’s failed half of her classes. Again. When he asked me what to do, I told him it was his fault she didn’t go to school and, as a result, didn’t pass her classes. \n\nI (38F) have been in education for more years than I care to admit. One of my friends consistently allows his (37M) child (15F) to skip school. The child failed half of her classes last year and failed the same number this year. He had the audacity to blame the child. He told her, “see, I told you if you didn’t go to school, you would end up failing.” Then, with 4 days left before summer, he called the school/teachers to see what could be done about her grades. Nothing! Nothing can be done at this point. He’s irate that they won’t help him and his daughter…\n\nHe reached out to me for advice, again, and this time I flat out told him that it is his fault she failed. That he is the parent and responsible for making his child go to school. I asked, “Where were you all year long? Why weren’t you checking grades all along? Why didn’t you have the school’s app to track grades? Why didn’t you send the kid to school instead of letting her skip? What consequences were put in place for not going to school and making good grades?” In short, why aren’t you worried about being a parent? Because, if parents aren’t doing their jobs at home, teachers can’t do their job at school. He had a million excuses and never took any responsibility for this outcome.\n\nHe wanted to argue, but I pointed out that 1. HE ASKED me for my opinion so I am not giving unsolicited advice and 2. grades were sent home all year long… academic progress letters were sent home multiple times… teachers called you (if you had a working number on file)… teachers emailed (again, if the correct info was available)… data was collected… conferences were held… interventions were put in place… What were YOU doing, my guy???\n\nThis is the SECOND year of high school we have had this discussion. (Not to mention the many discussions we had over the course of middle school). I was very gentle about it every other time, but, now that it has happened again, and he blamed her, I just laid it out for him - this is YOUR fault.\n\nHe blew up at me, to the point that my boyfriend got involved it was so bad, and now he’s telling our friend group that IATAH for accusing him of letting his daughter fail school. I had screenshots so when they started in on me, I just replied with those so they could see that part of the conversation in black and white. The majority of our friends agree with me, but the ones who don’t are incredibly vocal and now I am starting to question my professional and personal judgement. AITAH? (Either way, I am fairly certain our friendship is over, and that is okay with me).\n\nSome questions you may have: He has sole custody and mom has every other weekend visitation. He pretty much always lets her do whatever she wants because he doesn’t want her to go live with her mom full time. He’s obsessed with being the parent she chooses. And, to be honest, I now believe some control issues (having mom at his will) are playing into this behavior as well. I don’t know why mom doesn’t have custody - other than what he has told me, which may or may not be true - and I don’t know if she has the means to take him back to court. The daughter doesn’t have any health issues, mental illnesses, or learning disabilities. They live in the school zone but he insists on driving her to school every morning even though the bus is available. When she asks to stay home, he doesn’t have to get up after his night shift so it’s more convenient for him to not take her. The mother is aware of the situation.\n\nUPDATE: our group chat received the following message, “Just talked to the graduation coach & he said that X is still on track to graduate without any extra intervention like Saturday/Summer School. He will be working with her over the next 2 years to make sure she does graduate on time. He assured me that right now there is no need to worry about her not graduating.  She does have to pass for the next 2 years. He also set her up with counseling for missing school.”\n\nI hope this is true, but I really have no way of knowing. I do know 6 failed academic classes would impact graduation where I teach… I guess only time will tell, but hopefully this helps get them both on track.",

      "text": "My high school was not in the greatest area. It fed into different economic neighborhoods. There were a lot of kids who were badly behaved. And some good kids. \nI was in honors classes and mostly away from bad kids. However, my school worked oddly. You could either be in a club homeroom\nor regular homeroom. It was unspoken that club homerooms were for good kids and regular for bad. You had a study hall with that homeroom.\nMy father did not allow too many extracurriculars. I was to come home, study, and help around the house.  I was allowed to be in chorus because chorus met during school hours.  I wanted to join a club homeroom for art and my father said no clubs during study hall. He didn’t understand it was a study hall.\nFor an entire year, I remember only really getting work done in the regular homeroom study hall if I got permission to go to the computer lab. \nThe study hall/homeroom was made up of kids who were bad. They were not college-bound. They didn’t do homework.  They would talk loudly, play games, get in arguments with teachers, bully each other, and since I was the only kid studying/doing homework bc I was scared of my father…..they were intrigued by me. They’d come up and ask what I was doing. I would not talk to them or just motion I was busy. \nIt gets worse. Some kids made fun of me behind my back and I had to hear it. Yeah I was quiet sorry it bothered you.  Weirdos. Then one girl one day threatened to beat up my mom and devoted a whole study hall to telling us that my mom is a white bitch. I am not making it up. \nI was pissed at my dad….The next year he let me join a club homeroom & none of this happened. Some kids from that homeroom are in state prison now.  I’m saying schools shouldn’t allow kids who want to study and get work done to ever be with such disruptive folks.",

      "title": "\"alternative\" behavioral schools schools - what the h*ll?",
      "text": "Er, hi. I went to an alternative school. That is to say--not specifically special education alone, but focused on both neurodivergent or delinquent students. Here's the thing: these schools are a nightmare.  \nNot in a flashy, abusive way.  \nBut in the way that there's thousands if not millions of students being pushed through them every year, but they exist primarily as a means to shuffle kids out of the way of the \"real\" schools and limit their futures rather than educate. Every year that goes by I realize how drastically my life was affected growing up in these--no real expectation I would or could ever attend college or learn a trade. It was like a holding pen for kids that don't fit in.  \nFrankly it's been 10 years and I still think about it every day. It's a horrific liminal space where kids futures go to die, but that's not what bothers me.  \nWhat bothers me is I've never met someone who went to one that I don't personally already know. What bothers me is I've literally never heard a single person talk about what these schools are doing. What bothers me is they never seem to face any consequences for their complete neglect of their students and their students outcomes. The schools are \\*bureaucratically designed for this.\\* They regularly change locations, names, or structure. No alumni, no reunions, nobody tracking what happens to the students after they get out.  \nThe teachers themselves are actually fine, usually. Some of the best people I've ever known, when they actually stick around--the turnover rate is huge.  \nI don't...know what to do about it? This problem feels too big, and too invisible to most of the world, for me to bring any awareness to it on my own. But I've never seen a single other person talk about it. Millions of kids with their prospects dwindling by the minute and all I can do is sit here and say \"that's rough buddy, been there too.\"  \nI've never even seen this category of schools mentioned in \\*fiction,\\* let alone real life.  \nHas anyone else even heard of these? Was my childhood even real? Maybe some of the schools are fine and I had bad luck, but I've been to 4, and they were all nightmares.\n\nedit--awkward double word in title, what?  \nedit 2 - I figured I should probably provide a clearer picture: Not a public school. Usually pulling kids in from all over the county. Kids are sheperded from classroom to classroom by paras. There are generally no clubs, extracurriculars, sports, no electives. No SATs, no college prep, no honors. They often run out of converted office buildings or warehouses because they have so little money. The students have no privacy, freedom, or agency. The food is the actual worst thing I've ever seen in my life (generally microwavable meals heated up and then given to students oddly cold.)  \nThere were no language classes. We had a music class at one of them, but it was more of a \"watch musicals\" class.  \nAt one point, I'm not kidding, they painted all the walls grey and then changed the dress code to all plain grey crew-neck T-shirts--I didn't think much of it at the time but that's something out of a dystopian novel. (It was allegedly to stop bullying over branded clothes, and I think grey was meant to be...non-stimulating? But there are definitely less insane ways to do that.)\n\nNot every kid from them slips through the cracks--I served a full military contract and work as an author and freelance writer now. I know a couple people who've gone on to be successful artists.  \nBut I don't know how to stress how few opportunities I had growing up compared to a \"normal\" kid at one of these schools; and that most people don't seem to know they exist.\n\nedit 3: these are NOT:  \ntrade schools  \npublic alternative schools  \nartsy schools  \nthey also aren't all high schools. They run the gambit. Elementary to high school, sometimes even kindergarten.  \nschools offering alternative styles of education (like self guided, on the job, or other things)  \nI am specifically referring to:  \nschools that neurodivergent and problematic kids get dumped into when they prove too troublesome for regular schooling. It is not a choice on the parents' part or the child's, generally. It has little to do with their grades (although that's obviously a factor considering many of the students have developmental disorders.) The specialty IEP program one commenter mentioned indeed describes a major aspect of these schools--but they also just had a bunch of truants there or kids that got kicked out of public school for semi-violent offenses.  \nedit 4 - these kids are not all violent offenders or disruptors.  \nI literally knew a Jehovah's Witness with an anxiety disorder and irritable bowel syndrome. It turns out they don't mix well. He needed a school environment where he'd always be in 100 feet of a bathroom.  \nBecause of this, he got almost none of the opportunities afforded to a normal high school student.\n\nfinal edit - wow, a lot of you guys are really convinced that every single kid in one of these schools is there because they're a violent offender, or entirely unable to function in a classroom setting, huh? That's not the reality. Most of these kids are somewhat neurodivergent, or again--occasionally just \\*severe truants\\*. Some are people who've had violent outbursts in the past that have learned to self regulate--yet are rarely allowed to leave.  \nI can't believe a community of supposed educators (and people who claim to care about education) have such a narrow view of an incredibly large and diverse group of literal children. That's...really sad, actually.",

      "text": "My daughter has just finished 5th grade, somewhat successfully.  Like her father, she also has pretty big problems with executive functioning, though this term is new to me.  You might guess ADHD, but  she isn't hyperactive and doesn't especially lack attention, she just can't keep track of things.  So I don't know.   We haven't pursued ADHD testing because it's really expensive and a very long wait and so far I've thought, what's it going to tell us that we don't know?\n\nHer grades don't reflect her intelligence, which I know because the comments for every subject were \"grade was affected by missing assignments\". She does well on tests.  She's overall a happy kid, lots of friends, no home stress, likes school. Her father and I are divorced but we co-parent well enough and she's close to both of us.\n\nWe found out a few days ago that in spite of outside math classes and her overall A- in math, she has been put in the lower math track (\"Guided\" vs \"Independent\", which, when you put it like that, isn't too surprising).  We've been told this isn't necessarily permanent.  Now I am not a tiger mom in any sense, I don't need her to be a brain surgeon.  But I want her to have options, which means good classes and good grades to get into good college eventually, and I don't want her to be bored.  If she was having a hard time with the work that would be one thing, but that's not it.  It's that she's having a hard time keeping track of deadlines and managing time.\n\nWe've tried a lot of the basic things recommended by previous teachers.  We make lists, we have routines, we put stuff on whiteboards, we have the analog clock you can draw on to see time pass.  I tried to set up executive function coaching but it's been hard to find a person with availability.\n\nAnyway, since the math track thing happened, her father is very interested in private school.  There is a great one nearby with availability, and he says he can pay for it (we normally split all expenses but I can't afford this.)  There are a few things I don't like about this.\n\n1. I think public school is a good thing on principle, and so does he (or at least he used to).  I hate the idea of private school, I feel like it's elitist and snobby.  We're in Massachusetts so the schools are already good, and we're already in a really good, well-funded district, that we chose intentionally. It's already as rich and snobby as public schools get.\n2. I don't see why a private school would help with her particular problems.  Okay I guess the teacher student ratio is lower, but it was already pretty good?\n3. I really hate the idea of taking her away from daily contact with her friends and all the kids she's known since kindergarten. I know she'll survive and she can even still see them, nobody's moving away, But it's tough when you're 11.\n\nI don't know if any of these are good enough reasons, when it boils down to just my personal values and her friends.  Thank you for any advice.",

      "text": "I asked in r/ScienceBasedParenting and got nothing but a 20 comment thread arguing about whether my son is autistic 🙄.  \nAnyhoo, my son is only just 2 but he’s left me wondering about how he knows/understands what he does almost since the newborn stage. He’s not super out there doing crazy savant stuff, he's mostly just a really sweet normal kid (albeit a lot more switched on), but it’s become pretty apparent that he’s very, very smart and there’s a couple key things he’s done that tell me he’s likely legitimately gifted (not just advanced etc). BUT he’s also quite interested in people and is very social (it’s a core interest of his along with more academic stuff—hard to weight them at such an early age but I’d say 50-50). I do not want to isolate this kid. But I also don’t want to choose the wrong education for him.\n\nSchools around here need years of advance planning, but I found an amazing one that aligns with my values. It’s very difficult to get in and there are fees just to apply of course. The day I was filling out the paperwork he read his first word by himself (hence why some strange internet dude decided to diagnose him with autism & hyperlexia without asking whether he had any signs of either of those conditions😣). Like I said, theres been a lot of things that made me get the feeling he was jst a lot more switched on, but this was one of a couple key things that told my objective brain this is likely true. He likely is actually gifted.\n\nI’m completely aware there’s no way to tell for sure, and assessing him is the last thing on my mind, but I do want to make the best decisions for him going forward. I’ve read primary kids don’t need gifted programs. And I’d love if that was the case (I actually hate the idea of labelling him and sorting him out of the grouP—it seems sad and potentially super toxic). Someone recommended a book about the 5 levels of gifted, but at this point I see things my son has done essentially on every level so it’s not a huge help. The school I want to send him to doesn’t have a gifted program, but they work one-on-one with kids and closely with parents. Kids also have the opportunity to do private tutelage in music etc during class hours. I feel like this would be an amazing place for him but I don’t know the first thing about these kids’ needs. Do they actually need a “gifted” program???\n\nCan anyone advise/put my mind at ease?  \nThanks in advance!\n\nUpdate 2: It turns out I was panicking about schooling because he’s learning at a school level now. So, he needs school material now… I intuitively understood that and was freaking out about education (because he’s essentially entering kindergarten/grade 1 learning right now). Thanks to some resources I got through private messages I’ve figured out with pretty excellent surety where he’s at/what he’ll need in future! \n\nEDIT 1: HYPERLEXIA US NOT EARLY READING—PLEASE ASK THE NEXT PERSON WHO IS READING EARLY YOU TRY TO DIAGNOSE WITH AUTISM WHETHER THEY UNDERSTAND WHAT THEY READ, WHETHER THEY WERE TAUGHT TO READ, AND WHETHER THEY HAVE ANY DEVELOPMENTAL DELAYS LIKE SPEACH. IF THEIR READING MAKES NO SENSE, IT MAY BE HYPERLEXIA.\n\nEARLY READING IS THE FIRST REALLY CONCRETE SIGN OF GIFTEDNESS. SO GET YOUR KNOWLEDGE STRAIGHT BEFORE PLAYING DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOANALYST.",

Historically, conservatives, libertarians, and Republicans have been the most vocal proponents of voucher programs, while progressive liberals and Democrats have traditionally been their most vocal opponents (Democrats, however, have been comparatively more supportive of charter schools, as long as they are nonprofit). However, there does seem to be somewhat of a shift regarding this issue, with pluralities across ideological and partisan boundaries coming out more in favor of school choice (https://www.federationforchildren.org/new-poll-school-choice-support-soars-from-2020/).\n\nAt first blush, it would seem like increased choice in education (provided it comes with accountability and transparency) would seem like an anodyne cause that most Americans can get behind.

      "text": "Basically theirs this new private school called Alpha that uses Ai tutoring to teach kids. \n\nThe Ai tutoring meets kids at their level. So for example a 5th graders might be doing 8th grade math but 4th grade reading. This ensures that the kids are actually learning on their level and can progress to their needs. \n\nAlso there aren’t any grades or anything like that just learning. The kids spend two hours a day learning academic stuff and then spend the rest of the day learning life skills and doing projects. Like coding an app, starting a business, making a taco truck and doing business research on that and then selling tacos at a park, ect. \n\nThe results are in and apparently students in this school do around 635% (this seems a little too good to be true not gonna lie but I’m just going based off what I saw)  better then regular students scoring in the top 2%. \n\nThey also have teachers but they’re called guides and they help them get started and with projects. They act more like emotional support than instructors basically.\n\nThey also don’t have the classroom set up. Just a bunch of comfy chairs and desks do work and they can freely move across the room. To they have large incentive to move forward because their pushed on to the next grade if the Ai thinks they learned everything they need to so no bored basically just getting stuff done. They also have a lot of breaks and recess and stuff. \n\nThis is so successful that states like California and other are thinking of trying it in public education.\n\nI know some people don’t like AI but this reality. We have to adapt to it because it’s not going away. This will give students the personal care teachers simply cant provide. One teacher cant cater to 30 students it’s just not possible but if they acted more as a guide and the academic part was specific to the student it could work. Plus the results don’t lie this seems to work a lot better than regular school. Ai is the only solution to give people personal instruction with the funds that schools have and I think the future is gonna be bright for it. The only question is how will this look on a massive scale. \n\nEdit: A lot of you said since this is a private school for wealthy people their is a bias in the results of the students which I agree with. In public schools students have more diverse backgrounds and they can’t turn away students due to poor test score like private ones. \n\nThis idea is very new and theirs not that much research if this could work on a massive scale and the demands of that public education often has.\n\nI think the idea still stands strong though. Using Ai to allow students to have a personalized education could be a good solution. Teachers can’t cater to 30 students needs. Some need more help some need the material to go quicker. This seems like it’s a good financial option that’s worth a test. If it works then that great but if it doesn’t then maybe it’s time to come up with a new solution. \n\nEdit of edit: After reading everyones comments I’ve come to the conclusion that. \n\n- Alpha’s results look promising, especially for motivated, well-supported students but it lack an evidence of students scoring well because of Ai or because they came from affluent families with resources. \n\t\n- It’s too early to say they are “better” than traditional schools across the board since this concept is so new and hasn’t been tested yet.\n\t\n- A fair comparison would require controlled studies in diverse public settings with children of all economic background.\n\n\n- And yes the Forbes article although it does provide some potential concerns does not interview any outside scores or go into depth about facts and statistics meaning it could be biased. \n\nWe will have to wait and see how beneficial Ai will be and how it will change the roles of teachers and students.",

For some professions, there seems to be a salary range; for example, data analysts typically earn between $75k and $220k depending on experience. Finance and software roles also fall within a similar range, between $85k and $250k. Many of my friends work in analytics, software, finance, etc., and none of them attended an Ivy League college, yet they’re making around $150k to $220k. So, I’m wondering: if they had attended an Ivy League school, would they be making more money than they are now? Thanks !",

      "text": "My kids are in early elementary, private school. It’s a great school with teachers that care about the kids, low student/teacher ratio, ranks high in academics but also teaches the whole child/keeps in mind these are children, has a big emphasis on community and parent involvement. We love the school… but having a hard time with something new…\n\nThe school is undergoing a remodeling process for the next 3-4 years and they moved the entire school to small (but brand new) trailers on a field at a high school campus (separate from the high school kids of course). \n\nThe classrooms are obviously very much smaller, more than half the size probably. And there is no longer a play structure, swings, slides, monkey bars, sand box.\nBecause it’s a high school. But there are very big outdoor spaces available, mostly concrete paths and gardens and a big field. A gym they are allowed to use. \n\nIn addition, parents are no longer able to walk kids to class or come on campus at all anymore as it’s a high secure campus. Drop off/pickup is via a car line with passes. You’re not allowed out of your car. If you do need to come on campus (like dropping off a forgotten backpack) you have to have your ID verified to get a pass and a staff member will come to your car. \n\nIt’s very unfamiliar to what we signed up for where you could have a two minute chat with a teacher at the classroom door or talk to another parent in the parking lot for 10 minutes. \n\nI’m having a hard time with this setup. They said, of course, when the remodel is done, everything will go back to normal, but it will take a couple years. \n\nThinking back as a KID, if your school was remodeling and all the grades were moved to trailers for the next THREE years, same teachers, and you still had a lot of open outdoor space but no longer had access to a large playground or swings or monkey bars, would you have still loved your very early elementary years at school? Is a playground and swings, or a very large classroom important? Was your parents walking you to school very important?\n\nIf you had a memorable elementary school experience, one that you hope for all kids, what was it that made it so special? What do you remember most about your school from your elementary years, specifically kinder through 4th grade? Was it the friends you made even if you’re no longer in contact with them? The warmth of the teachers? The outside spaces, looking for bugs or playing on the play structure? Playing in the sand? Your parents walking you to school or your classroom? The special events like field days or Christmas concerts or walkathons? Being in the classroom, learning to read and write or math and science? What was the joy that brought you to love your school?",

      "text": "Just my theory, is it that more kids are homeschooling, doing school online, and going to private or charter schools?  I know a little of it may be due to declining birth rates... But when I go through my big town (I teach a public school by the way), I see so many more private charter schools pop up. I also see advertisements for online school and homeschool groups.  I'm thinking this may be a big chunk of the cause.  Could I be wrong, yes!   I just see so many more options for students they I did when I was younger.  I graduated in 2000 and there were never as many options as now.  What are your thoughts?\n\nTo add:  One thing that makes me suspicious is that those in charge of public education will rarely admit, \"oh ya, it's because people are enrolling in other options\". They will persuade us to think it's all because of lower birth rates.  Yes, there are times where demographics move out and you have less kids in certain areas (like closer to downtowns or areas not a desirable.    It may be a \"small part\" of birth rates. But by my theory is that more are going elsewhere and students are \"scattered\" with so many options.  It's like a town that has too many of the same type of restaurants and too many restaurants in general.  Things become scattered and people say it's because \"people are moving out of this town\".  It's also like a \"dry cleaner\" venue opening up on every block in town. Even if you have a town \"booming\" and increasing in population that's just too many dry cleaners.  Options are good but it's becoming an eye opener and interesting what's happening.",

      "text": "Our neighbourhood has a \"bad\" school - in that test scores are low and the majority of the kids come from quite low SES backgrounds. (our nice neighbourhood borders quite a poor area).  All of the other neighbour kids went to french immersion to avoid it.  Two of my kids went to charter-type schools instead because they want to study certain subject matter but my third kid (10 yrs old) wanted to stay at her original school.  (The charter-type school and the french immersion are both now full for her grade level and she can't apply for late entry).  \n\nI wanted to believe that despite the bad test results and struggles of many of the kids, the situation would be fine for her and she would learn from the diversity, but I'm starting to feel like I sacrificed my kid's education to support an ideal.  I spent a day in her classroom this week and the teaching/learning level was so low.  My kid does fine, but I look at what she's learning - how her writing is being challenged etc and it's such a low level compared to my other kids.  She's one of the strongest students in the class so she just gets perfect on everything even though it's really middling work. I also see how she doesn't really fit in to any group and struggles a bit socially.  She's a floater and she can chat with lots of kids, but doesn't really fit any of the groups to have great buddies (did have a BFF but then mean girl stuff hit).  \n\nI should add that while she's actually 2E - ADHD-inattentive-type and gifted - and so she is NOT receptive to our family doing any kind of academic work with her.  Probably like most kids, she REALLY doesn't want to listen to my advice about writing papers etc. \n\nI wish I had another school choice, but save moving, we're really stuck.  Can the school extend for her or is this as good as it gets?",

What if school districts built small accessory dwelling units (ADUs) on school property and offered them as free or low-cost housing for teachers?

Teachers would save on housing costs, reduce commute times, and feel more connected to the school community.

      "text": "**Proposal: Fellowship Retreat as a Graduation Requirement**\n\n**Overview:** The \"Fellowship Retreat\" is a proposed rite of passage for high school seniors, aimed at instilling gratitude, self-reliance, and a foundational understanding of material and communal life. It is not a class, not a lecture, and not ideological in purpose. It is an experience — one that simulates essential simplicity and temporary poverty, not for shame, but for perspective. Participation would be required for graduation, but performance or outcome would not be graded.\n\n**Purpose:**\n\n* To cultivate empathy across class boundaries\n* To provide students with first-hand awareness of the value of basic goods, services, and cooperation\n* To break the illusion of unearned abundance\n* To counteract cultural detachment from poverty without romanticizing it\n* To serve as a secular, equitable rite of maturity\n\n**Structure:**\n\n* Duration: 14 days (\"Fortnight of Fellowship\")\n* Environment: A minimally-equipped retreat center or compound removed from commercial infrastructure\n* Resources: Basic food rations, shelter, hygiene access, and simple work tasks to sustain the space\n* Rules: No digital devices, no outside contact, no lectures, no motivational posters — only the experience\n* Participation Verification: Twice-daily ID check-ins via a kiosk system\n* Community Size: Small cohort pods (10-15 students max) to ensure self-management and cooperation\n\n**What It Is Not:**\n\n* Not a punishment\n* Not political indoctrination\n* Not a simulation of homelessness\n* Not a military or boot-camp environment\n* Not focused on productivity or outcomes\n\n**Benefits:**\n\n* Builds baseline social humility\n* Prepares students to enter adulthood with lived context, not abstract awareness\n* Dismantles class ignorance among the affluent, and validates the lived knowledge of the working class\n* Reduces ideological polarization by grounding empathy in shared experience\n\n**Name Justification:** \"Fellowship Retreat\" implies a neutral, shared experience — neither religious nor authoritarian. It emphasizes collective endurance and reflection over isolation or indoctrination.\n\n**Next Steps:**\n\n* Form a student-led proposal committee\n* Draft policy recommendations for district-level review\n* Solicit feedback from educators, parents, and community leaders\n* Pilot the program with volunteer participants\n\n**Closing Thought:** In a world increasingly abstracted from consequence, the Fellowship Retreat offers a pragmatic inoculation: a controlled, communal brush with scarcity and interdependence. It is not a solution to poverty — it is a mirror held up to privilege. A mandatory experience of humility that leaves no ideological fingerprint.\n\nLet them endure, and let them remember.",

We are Orthodox Christians, and while we respect all faith traditions, we believe our child should have the freedom to explore spiritual questions independently, without being formally taught specific religious beliefs in school.\n\nWith that in mind, I wanted to ask: is it possible for students to opt out of religious classes, Mass, or school-led prayers if a family prefers a more neutral approach to faith instruction?",

      "text": "A computer science student at Columbia University said he has been kicked out by the school after he built an artificial intelligence tool to cheat in tech job interviews and documented the fallout online.\n\nChungin “Roy” Lee, a second-year undergraduate, garnered online attention after he claimed to have fooled four of the world’s biggest companies using Interview Coder, a desktop app he created to discreetly solve technical coding questions.\n\nIn a now-removed YouTube video, Lee 21, recorded himself using the tool during an internship interview with Amazon. His app, which he said took only four days to build, allows users to take screenshots of problems without being detected by their browsers. It then processes the images using AI to spit out solutions in real time.\n\nIt was a stunt that highlighted the proliferation of generative AI technology in everything from schoolwork to technical jobs, as users discover new tools to help them cover for their lack of skill or knowledge or to otherwise enhance their abilities. As such tools advance, schools and workplaces have struggled to accurately detect their use.“I think 99% people probably haven’t realized how far-reaching this could be,” Lee told NBC News. “In the past, you could have built an invisible desktop assistant, and you also could have used LLMs [large language models] to solve problems. But now that people are putting the two together, I think no form of online assessment is safe.”\n\nLee, who is in New York City, said he got the internship offer from Amazon this year. In February, he went online to broadcast that he “used AI to pass my Amazon Interview.” (The video got about 100,000 views before YouTube removed it, citing a copyright claim by Amazon.)\n\nAs a result of his publicized stunt, Columbia University ushered Lee through a disciplinary process that resulted in a yearlong suspension, he said. A spokesperson for the university declined to comment on individual students, citing Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act regulations.\n\nhttps://www.nbcnews.com/tech/tech-news/columbia-university-student-trolls-big-tech-ai-tool-job-applications-rcna198454\n\nhttps://www.efinancialcareers.com/news/ai-for-leetcode-coding-tests-chungin-lee\n\nMarch 2025",

How do you soilder yourself through tough assignments when you can just ask AI, the temptation is just too much to resist. Another question is how valuable is that education when that answer is on fingertips.  I don't deny education is not valuable my assertion is we need to figure out what parts of education are still valuable and what are no longer as useful. For example, memorizing multiplication tables till 20 is much less useful with advent of calculator but mathematical thinking is very much useful. Universities cannot adopt fast enough and I think Universities need to pivot. I think 4 year bachelors degree will be outdated very soon and we will need 2 or 3 year  degree which will teach the core concepts.",

I’ve been looking into a few schools so far UMKC, Missouri State, and the University of Arkansas but I’m still pretty open to options.\n\nWhat I’m hoping to find is a school that has a good balance: a good nursing program but also an active social/party scene. For reference, my GPA is currently a 3.2, but I still have 6–7 prerequisites left to take (depending on the school), so I’m aiming to raise it. This fall I’ll be taking my EMT classes, and I’m planning to apply for EMT positions in the winter. I’m hoping that kind of experience will look good on my applications.\n\nThe part that stresses me out is that I really don’t want to get declined and have to wait an extra year to apply. Since I may need an extra semester to finish my prereqs, I’m especially interested in programs that offer two admission cycles per year (fall and spring) so I’d have more flexibility. If anyone has recommendations for universities with nursing programs that might be a good fit, I’d love to hear them!",

      "text": "Here’s a copy of what was sent from the Trump administration to educational institutions receiving federal funds. \n\nU.S. Department of Education Directs Schools to End Racial Preferences\n\nThe U.S. Department of Education has sent a Dear Colleague Letter to educational institutions receiving federal funds notifying them that they must cease using race preferences and stereotypes as a factor in their admissions, hiring, promotion, compensation, scholarships, prizes, administrative support, sanctions, discipline, and beyond.\n\nInstitutions that fail to comply may, consistent with applicable law, face investigation and loss of federal funding. The Department will begin assessing compliance beginning no later than 14 days from issuance of the letter.\n\n“With this guidance, the Trump Administration is directing schools to end the use of racial preferences and race stereotypes in their programs and activities—a victory for justice, civil rights laws, and the Constitution,” said Acting Assistant Secretary for Civil Rights Craig Trainor. “For decades, schools have been operating on the pretext that selecting students for ‘diversity’ or similar euphemisms is not selecting them based on race. No longer. Students should be assessed according to merit, accomplishment, and character—not prejudged by the color of their skin. The Office for Civil Rights will enforce that commitment.”\n\nIn Students for Fair Admissions v. Harvard, the U.S. Supreme Court not only ended racial preferences in school admissions, but articulated a general legal principle on the law of race, color, and national origin discrimination—namely, where an educational institution treats a person of one race differently than it treats another, and race is a factor in the different treatment, the educational institution has violated the law. By allowing this principle to guide vigorous enforcement efforts, the Trump Education Department will ensure that America’s educational institutions will again embrace merit, equality of opportunity, and academic and professional excellence.\n\nThe letter calls upon all educational institutions to cease illegal use of race in:\n\nAdmissions: The Dear Colleague Letter clarifies the legal framework established by the Supreme Court in Students v. Harvard; closes legal loopholes that colleges, universities, and other educational institutions with selective enrollment have been exploiting to continue taking race into account in admissions; and announces the Department’s intention to enforce the law to the utmost degree. Schools that fail to comply risk losing access to federal funds.\nHiring, Compensation, Promotion, Scholarships, Prizes, Sanctions, and Discipline: Schools, including elementary, middle, and high schools, may no longer make decisions or operate programs based on race or race stereotypes in any of these categories or they risk losing access to federal funds.\nThe DEI regime at educational entities has been accompanied by widespread censorship to establish a repressive viewpoint monoculture on our campuses and in our schools. This has taken many forms, including deplatforming speakers who articulate a competing view, using DEI offices and “bias response teams” to investigate those who object to a school’s racial ideology, and compelling speech in the form of “diversity statements” and other loyalty tests. Ending the use of race preferences and race stereotyping in our schools is therefore also an important first step toward restoring norms of free inquiry and truth-seeking.\n\nAnyone who believes that a covered entity has violated these legal rules may file a complaint with the Department of Education’s Office of Civil Rights. Information about filing a complaint with OCR is available at How to File a Discrimination Complaint with the Office for Civil Rights on the OCR website.\n\nBackground\n\n \n\nThe Supreme Court ruled in June 2023 in Students for Fair Admissions v. Harvard that Harvard’s and the University of North Carolina’s use of racial considerations in admissions, which the universities justified on “diversity” and “representativeness” grounds, in fact operated to illegally discriminate against white and Asian applicants and racially stereotype all applicants. The Universities “concluded, wrongly, that the touchstone of an individual’s identity is not challenges bested, skills built, or lessons learned but the color of their skin. Our constitutional history does not tolerate that choice,” for “[t]he entire point of the Equal Protection Clause” is that “treating someone differently because of their skin color is not like treating them differently because they are from a city or from a suburb, or because they play the violin poorly or well.” Rather, “an individual’s race may never be used against him in the admissions process” and, in particular, “may not operate as a stereotype” in evaluating individual admissions candidates.",

It’s trying to break it.\n\nThe administration’s allies have not been shy about that fact. “To scare universities straight,” Max Eden, then a senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute, wrote in December, Education Secretary Linda McMahon “should start by taking a prize scalp. She should simply destroy Columbia University.” She should do this, he argued, whether or not the school cooperated with any civil-rights investigation.\n\n...by continuing to punish Columbia even after the school gave in to its demands, the administration also appears to have overplayed its hand.

In my experience all of our teachers follow the old model imposing their ideas on students and not willing to change even the tiniest bit in their approach towards teaching or the curriculum . What if we begin an initiative where students itself learns some topic of their interests relevant in their field i.e for example one student might be knowledgeable in Digital forensics and the other might be more into penetration testing .What if they share this knowledge in ways which their peers will understand as it is easier for students to get along well and motivate each other . The teacher would act as a guide to keep them on track and check their progress often providing them with supplements . I honestly think this can make college life much more interesting and fun to learn .  What do you guys think",

This is supossed to be really useful because in theory, when we apply for college, having a US diploma is going to hold much more weight than a diploma from my country. \n\n  \nInitially, I joined the program because I wanted to take the classes they had. They had 2 compulsory classes, and then we could choose 4 elective classes. I wanted to take the Animation class, since it's what I want to study in my higher education, and I thought that having a diploma that stated that I had some foundations studying that would be beneficial.\n\n  \nUnfortunately, not everything goes to plan, and one year into my two year program I find out that Animation, the main thing I wanted to study, was archived and no longer available. So, I started to wonder if continuing this program was actually worth it. It put a lot of aditional stress mentally that prevented me from working efficiently on other projects. Moreover, the program makes us pay by class. This means that I could save money if I dropped now. The only thing holding me back from doing that is the US diploma. The thing is, I am planning to go to an Italian university to study art, so I don't know how much a US diploma would matter there.\n\nThis brings me to my question. Is a US diploma really that much more helpful at getting you into college, or is it not worth it for my situation? Should I just cancel the program now and use the money I saved for animation or Italian courses (since I need to know Italian for the university I want to apply to)?",

It’s not what I want to do anymore, I thought it was when I appplied for it. I’ve realised that what really interests me is media production, specifically videography and video editing.\n\nI’ve found a two-year full-time college course in media production that looks like it would could help. It’s very practical, hands-on film projects, technical workshops (lighting, editing, sound, directing), and even a work placement. I don’t have access to good equipment right now, and I really benefit from structured learning with deadlines, feedback, and support, something I’ve always struggled to recreate when self-teaching.\n\nThat said, I’ve already spent 5 years in university now (plus 3 in college before that) and I've got nothing to show for it. I feel kind of awkward and embarrassed at the idea of going back to college at this point. I worry I’ll feel stuck in the same loop or judged for still not having a stable career from my previous education.\n\nSo I’m wondering is going back worth it right now? Or would I be better off waiting, trying to build skills on my own first, or finding a different route?\n\nThanks in advance!",

      "text": "I’m researching MSW programs and I can across Liberty University. I’m familiar with Liberty as I went to Christian schools from 2nd-12th grade and this school was heavily promoted as I got to high school (this was before online programs were as big as they were now). Ever since I started college, I’ve been to all secular schools as I needed a change of environment and I happen to enjoy my time being at those institutions. Now that I’m a year away from finally getting my bachelor’s after so many years, I’m looking for an online MSW program so I can continue my studies and eventually become an LCSW. I prefer a secular school, but I’m open to return to a Christian school if that means being able to get my degree online in my price range.\n\nIf there’s anyone in the program now or graduated from the program, what’s the curriculum like? Is the work material centered around Christ or is it similar to a secular college or university? I’m curious to know people’s experiences.",

      "text": "I’ve got two kids — my daughter’s 12, my son’s 6. She writes sci-fi about teenagers exploring black holes. He dismantles anything with screws and just asked why clouds don’t fall. Minecraft is his personal universe. He’s the architect, the philosopher, the god of dirt blocks. For the longest time, I thought my job as a dad was to “support their interests.” You know — don’t push, just let them grow. Be chill. Trust the process. But something’s been bugging me. Why does my daughter ask questions that sound like teenage Sartre, then totally forget them five minutes later? Why does my son go deep in games, but freeze when it’s time to count apples? So I went down the neuroscience rabbit hole. Ended up reading a paper called \"Neural, genetic, and cognitive signatures of creativity\". And holy shit. Turns out, genius-level creativity isn’t about a “smarter brain.” It’s about networks syncing in weird ways. The DMN (daydreams, memories, imagination) and the FPCN (focus, logic, control) — normally they don’t get along. But in creative minds? They’re jazz. One plays. One keeps time. It flows. And here’s what hit me: Genes don’t give you a script. They give you rules for how your brain can build itself — if the environment lets it. So now I’m looking at my kids differently. They’re not sponges soaking up facts. They’re orchestras tuning themselves in real time. And I’m either helping that tune come together — or I’m just yelling “QUIET!” over the solo. What if most kids are potential geniuses — and we just drown them in worksheets and “sit still”? Has anyone actually tried teaching around how their kid thinks — not just around what they “struggle” with?",

      "title": "My stance on multiple statewide cell phone bans",
      "text": "**There is a TL;DR at the bottom of this post!!! Feel free to skip if you don't want to read in detail.**\n\nAs you all may know, many states have been implementing a phone ban this upcoming school year. While this seems like a great idea, there may be some things left out of consideration. Honestly I have mixed opinions on the topic and was wondering how everyone feels about this. Both eduactors and students are encouraged to share their opinions in my comments under this post.\n\nSome background on me: I graduated high school in 2024 and now am a sophomore in university. I have absolutely no reason to defend or support this but I feel inclined to speak on this as an outer perspective.  I am not an educator trying to fight for attention from students, and I am also not a student that is trying to get my cell phone back in the classroom.\n\nMy first point is that the restrictions, at least in my school, on school owned devices were honestly debilitating. We were issued chromebooks that had extensive blocks on google and close to no downloading capability. Oftentimes the topics that we discussed in class owuld get flagged, causing either a complete block in the school related search or students getting in trouble from administrators due to the inappropriate searches that they were making. You couldn't look up the novel *Moby Dick* or research the author Charles Dickens because the word dick was in the name. We would completely be barred from even looking it up. In addition to this, more complex ideas in novels were also harder to research as well. There was one time that in my AP English class that we were reading *Hamlet* and if we typed something about Ophelia's suicide, a guidance counselor came to do a wellness check. In other words, there was absoluetly no privacy on those computers. While nobody should expect to have guaranteed privacy on a device owned essentially by the state, it is still sickening to see that anyone can see anything on these devices. If only school owned devices are going to be allowed in classrooms, I believe that there should be a level of privacy that students should be able to have on the only device that they are allowed to be on. One last thing I want to talk about regarding restrictions is that in my senior year when I was reviewing my college applications, some of them would actually be blocked against school wifi. This is completely and utterly ridiculous. There were moments that I had free time in class, but when I made an attempt to check my applications, they would be blocked. If the blocks and privacy on devices were looked into more intuitively, I would be completely in support of only ahving school issued devices in school, but until they can let go of that power trip I don't think that it would be wise.\n\nMy second point comes from a something that may be graphic or an adult topic. In my second year of high school, there was a school sh\\*\\*ting in one of the schools in my district. While I cannot vouch for anything that was felt to any students on site where it happened, I remember very graphically how the situation impacted students on my own campus. The school district, in my opinion, handled the situation extremely poorly. The school district took the wifi down for students in the entire district and it only added to the calamitous nature of the situation. Kids were getting called out to go home, teachers were in shock about the situation, and the students who stayed didn't have internet access and were all in fear that maybe there was a chance that the shooter would come to our campus too. I do not know what the intention was behind turning off the internet, but if I were to have one guess, it was to keep the students clueless. The funny thing about that is that we were not. I think that it is unfair that the state believes that keeping students in fear and confusion is better off than letting them contact their families or potentially saying their last goodbyes if they really thought that their lives were in danger. The time it took to catch the shooter was not immediate in the shooting that I am talking about and there were rumors that he had fled closer to other campuses. I believe that students should have the right to know what is going on in their environments, not shut away from the world to \"protect\" them.\n\nLastly, I want to address the amount of funding and time that would be required day to day due to implementations of the ban. Some friends that I had who went to a different school than I did had the unfortunate opportunity to use phone pouches toward the end of the 2025 Spring semester. Essentially, they would lock the device up in the morning and an administrator would unlock the device at the end of the day. That is wasted time in terms of both the staff that is in control of unlocking and for the students. Whether the district or school chooses to do that before or after dismissal, there would have to be many staff members in charge of unlocking those pouches at the end of the day in order for it to not take long.  On top of that, those pouches cost 30 dollars per pouch. Depending on the size of the school, that is likely to be tens of thousands of dollars. If they have that money to spend on anti cell phone use pouches, I think that the districts and the state are better off using that money to invest into making school more engaging.\n\nI will now address what I agree with for the phone ban. Students, please don't hate me.\n\nIn my years of high school, people were on their phones a lot. I will not say that I was not on my phone as well, but I'd like to think that I was on it less than others in my classes. I felt for some teachers that actually had engaging lessons who tried to teach, but aside from that I think that a lot of people used their phones to be motivation to complete their work. I had classes where the first half of the 90 minute class period were productive, but beyond those 45 minutes we would have no work. As bleak as it sounds, the truth is that the phones caused a lot of students \"lock in\" better in the beginning so that everything planned for the class would get finished fast. I've had many teachers who effectively kept students off of their phones so I don't really understand how some teachers can and some teachers can't enforce it. If it really becomes a problem, I don't think that it warrants a phone being locked out for good all day. Putting phones in wall hanging calculator pouches worked great in the classes where teachers implemented it. Taking phones up also worked in most of the classes that I was in that did it. I think those are very reasonable alternatives to the all day ban.\n\nTL;DR I think that a phone ban would be a waste of resources, bad in emergency situations, and that a lot of school owned devices have a lack of privacy and are ineffective in the classroom. Phone use in classrooms is currently an issue even in a student's opinion, but I believe that there are better options in terms of lowering the use rate.\n\nedit: I'm only talking about htis right now because a lot of my underclassmen have beenhaving very wild discourse about thier opinions and are taking it a little too far.",

      "title": "The Entire System is messed up...",
      "text": "Here's an essay I wrote on how I truely feel within these moments, and some unpopular opinions that have been dwelling in my mind lately:\n\nThe System Is a Cage, and I’m Done Pretending It’s Not\n\nEvery day, I wake up and wonder what the hell the point of all this is. Not just school, not just homework — I mean everything. This whole system — the one built on schedules, tests, pressure, and pretending to be okay — feels like a joke no one’s laughing at. A simulation designed to suck the soul out of anyone who dares to think for themselves.\n\nI sit in maths class, staring at trig functions I’ll never use, learning formulas that vanish from memory the second the exam ends. We all pretend it matters — that getting the answer right on a piece of paper somehow proves our worth. But ask an adult if they remember any of it, and they’ll shrug: “I don’t know, it was too long ago.” Exactly. So why am I being crushed under the weight of something they don’t even remember?\n\nIt’s always the same advice: “Do well in school, get into university, get a job, work hard, retire, die.” The rat race. The never-ending treadmill. And for what? A paycheck and a life spent following orders in a system I didn’t choose? I don’t want it. I never wanted it.\n\nAnd yet… I’m trapped. Trapped by expectations. By parents who chose my subjects. By teachers who think obedience equals intelligence. By a society that mistakes routine for purpose. I’m told I’ll understand “when I’m older,” but all I see are adults who sacrificed their dreams to survive. And now they want me to do the same?\n\nNo. I want out.\n\nIn a single week, I taught myself how to build websites. I came up with a business idea. On my own. No school. No textbook. Just me, my curiosity, and the internet. That felt real. That felt alive. But none of that matters to the system. It doesn’t reward thinking. As Rockefeller allegedly said — “I don’t want a nation of thinkers. I want a nation of workers.” And that’s exactly what school creates: workers, not dreamers.\n\nI go to a Christian school, but I don’t believe in God. I’m surrounded by people who would rather judge than understand, who would rather quote a verse than listen to my truth. I feel like screaming — screaming that this is all nonsense — but I know if I did, I’d be silenced. Expelled. Condemned.\n\nSo I smile. I act happy. I nod when they talk about exams and careers and “God’s plan.” But inside? I’m crumbling. Every moment feels like a performance in a play I never auditioned for.\n\nI watch TikToks, not for fun, but to escape. To scroll past the emptiness. Hoping the next video will numb me. Hoping time will just pause — or maybe disappear entirely.\n\nI feel like I’m having a midlife crisis at 17. How messed up is that?\n\nI don’t even know who I am anymore. I’m a creative soul in a system built to erase individuality. I want to speak, but I’m always shushed. I want to choose, but my choices are made for me. I want to live — actually live — but I’m being taught how to survive instead.\n\nAnd the scariest part? When I die, I believe there will be nothing. No heaven. No meaning. Just silence. And if that’s true — if this is all there is — then why are we wasting our precious lives in classrooms, chasing grades, being good little workers?\n\nWhat’s the point?\n\nNo, really — what. is. the. point?\n\nIf you’ve ever asked yourself that, if you’ve ever felt the weight of the absurdity pressing down on your chest like it’s trying to crush the light out of you — then you know. You understand. And maybe, just maybe, that understanding is the beginning of freedom.\n\nBecause if the system’s a lie — then we get to create our own truth.",

Plus, I have no student debt.\n\nDespite my own experience, I used to believe post-secondary education was still worth it for most people. But today, I met some folks from another department at my company. Many of them have bachelor’s degrees from business schools and reputable universities—yet they’re all stuck in low-level roles, doing tedious work that the rest of us avoid.\n\nThese aren’t arts degrees either. These are business grads.\nIs this common? Has post-secondary education really become so useless?",

      "text": "As a new-ish mom, I’ve been thinking about education a lot. When I reflect on my personal education experience, the thing that bothers me the most was that I was never taught how to think. There was always a right or wrong answer, and that was it. It was a mentality I carried through university and even into my career. It even took another 10 years until I had a job that forced me to think critically for the first time ever. It was the most liberating and eye-opening experience ever. I can’t believe it took me 33 years to open my mind in that way. That’s probably a rant for another post, though. Anyway, I’m wondering if there are schools that teach kids how to think critically in this way. What would they be called? Do they have a certain philosophy?",

      "text": "I think the incentives are completely wrong in education and it’s failing both students and teachers.\n\nAs the title suggests, I got into teaching because I was passionate about my subject area and wanted to help young people learn from my experiences and expertise. Yet in my time, I’ve found it’s mostly about being a carer to 25 kids at a time. I think this is a big reason why so many teachers feel emotionally burned out and ultimately leave the profession. So you end up with a lot of teachers who can’t teach but are good at handling the admin and behaviour management side of the job.\n\nThe system also fails students by increasingly prioritising a false interpretation of wellbeing over setting them up for success in the future. The intentions are there, but we’re doing it wrong. We’re there for their every need and all this does is perpetuate their learned helplessness. It’s a severely short-sighted approach and it sets students up for failure in the real world. Real wellbeing comes from the sense of pride and accomplishment we get when we overcoming challenges. Not by never feeling discomfort.\n\nAnyway, I'd love it if you would have a read of my article and let me know what you think, whether you agree or not. Thanks everyone\n\n[Why Bad Incentives Are Failing Teachers and Students](https://psychupyourlife.com/why-bad-incentives-are-failing-teachers-and-students/)\n\nPS: I'm Australian but from what I can tell, this is a universal issue... a western education system issue at least. Perhaps the education department overhaul will help, perhaps it'll make it worse, I'd love to hear your thoughts. Cheers.",

Public schools are stretched thin, and time constraints mean K–12 usually runs out of steam by 1945. We spend *months* on the colonies, native America and the American Revolution, but barely touch these topics that play a bigger role in modern life at the pressing moment.\n\nSo many of the problems we are dealing with now are results of actions taken decades ago, from Reagan's domestic budget cuts, the end of the Soviet Union, the whole Gaza/west bank situation, even the endless gender war posts that flood r/GenZ have roots/echoes to the feminist movement and white backlash to it during the 70s.\n\nThat lack of context shows up *everywhere,* especially in modern political discourse. People throw around phrases like “cut big government”, “end American imperialism” without realizing we've been through *waves* of this already, with actual outcomes we could study and learn from.\n\nI know people our age who straight-up refuse to watch anything made before 2000 because it's lame.

      "text": "I teach academic 11th grade and as a little April fools prank, I handed out blank paper and told the kids that they will be writing a 5 paragraph essay due at the end of class on the novel we've been reading for weeks now.  \n\n45 minutes to write 5 paragraphs on the book.  I know that's a big ask in today's society, and I would never throw this on them last minute, but wow, did it really show me where these kids are at mentally and academically.\n\nThe looks of shock, horror, and disgust was followed by a cacophony of \"FUCK NO, I AIN'T DOIN THAT\" and \"Can we use ChatGPT?\" \n\nA few put their heads back down on their desks.  Some didn't even hear me because they had their headphones in and were on their phones, even after being told to remove them.\n\nI mean, I don't know about yall, but by the end of 11th grade year I could crank out a 5 paragraph essay on any topic because we wrote and wrote a lot.  Our writing was graded on accuracy and fluency, not just completion.\n\nI worry about the future of some of these kids.  But it's April, and in a little less than 2 months they will not longer be my problem!",

To say we will have BRAODCAST DAILY LESSONS to INSPIRE national appreciation is absolutely 3rd reich/north Korea. I dont have words and I want to throw up. I dont even know what to do. SEL is going to be eliminated. Non-english language classes are going to be eliminated. Non-american history is going to be eliminated. What is HAPPENING?!?!

Taylor](https://www.scotusblog.com/cases/case-files/mahmoud-v-taylor/) late this morning which rules that parents can opt their children out of a Maryland school district's LGBT-themed curriculum materials over religious objections, reversing an appeals court ruling. This was a 6-3 decision as was expected. This issues a preliminary injunction against the district and remands the case back to the lower court for a final decision on whether Montgomery County, Md., must provide an opt-out option for parents.  \n\nIn the meantime, the school district must notify parents in advance of the books being read and allow them to remove their children from the classroom. The district’s lack of such an option likely substantially burdens parents’ constitutional right to freely exercise their religion,  Alito wrote in the majority opinion.

      "text": "For reference, I teach freshmen and sophomores at a well-respected state university in my area. I teach classes that are only required for students in my major, so I am not even dealing with GenEd students. These students want to pursue a career in this field.  \n\nMy students complain about literally any amount of homework. Some of them even explicitly say, \"We weren't given this type of homework in high school,\" to about 30 minutes of work over a two day period. I keep trying to tell them that real work in this field can mean 5-7 hour days of working on the same issue. If they aren't cut out to do my small assignment before each class, they absolutely will not make it in this field. Colleagues of mine assign closer to 2-3 hours of homework every other day (as many major-specific courses do), and I have tried warning my students. \n\nEven past their apathy, though, their skills are closer to what I'd expect from high school freshman and sophomores. They brag about never reading books because of Covid in middle and high school. They don't do long-form reading. When I assign them a couple of pages to read before a class, most of them won't even read, and the ones that do cannot tell me a single important thing about it. It is like they actually lack reading comprehension. On our exam that we just gave, there was a bonus question that said, \"interpret your findings,\" and almost all of them left it blank. They did all the methodical and algorthmic things decently well, but no one in that class has any idea was it means. \n\nThey don't think. They don't really experience thought the way they're supposed to. It is like it's a bunch of brains on autopilot. With high school, I can almost maybe understand not caring because you're required to be there. But, with college, most of my students are paying to be here. Even then, they complain about every amount of work that they have to do, and then can't even do their work with any level of academic rigor. \n\nI am a very nice teacher, but I tell them at the beginning of every semester what my expectations are. I have failed students in the past, and I will continue to fail students right now. I know a lot of high schools try to push students through to graduation, but, in university, I have pretty much free reign of who I pass and fail. But despite them watching about 3-4 of their friends fail out of our department every semester, none of them change anything and just hope they skate by. I just don't get it.",

Those are often things you are born with. It’s not anyone’s fault someone has a learning disability. I have two sons. One son breezes through school and crushes math. We don’t have to study other than doing homework. My other son requires that I study with him a lot. He simply does not retain information as easily as my other son. They have the same environment. Some people will never be able to do calculus. It’s not for lack of support that someone with a 45 IQ, can’t follow a Stephen Hawkins lecture. People won’t admit it because you aren’t allowed to say that not every student can be a doctor.

I hope enough teachers can come together with a plan. Cause if we protest this enough we could throw a wrench in Trumps plans and easily cripple the nation.\n\n As parents scramble, they then have to call in to work or go in late  as they struggle to find childcare for their kids who can't go to school...cause we all just stay home in protest and have to close the school... and then they'll realize how much they rely on teachers and public education. Corporations and companies would hopefully apply pressure cause none of their workers come in cause they have no where to take their kids. By just refusing to work for a while until Trump walks it back or reinstates the DoE.... Teachers could massively influence the course of this nation.\n\nIdk what I'll do... but i think stage a nayionwode walk out. And then a national strike for a few days or a week.

I brought up how I never studied education or anything, so my credentials are really in theatre rather than education. She said it was different, but I feel like she just felt kind of bad because she realized that I’m sort of in a similar boat as this other teacher. \n\nToday, I went to a staff party, and my boss was talking about how a lot of teachers don’t study education and they think that just because they know about a field that means they can teach. She’s the one who hired me (like she conducted the interview herself and everything), so she knows that I don’t have an education degree and just sorta fell into teaching out of college. \n\nSo, this just made me wonder if there is a general consensus about teachers that didn’t study education/didn’t necessarily set out to be teachers originally but end up teaching in their field of study.",

It’s not that people don’t see that things are truly heading towards a calamity, it’s that nothing seems to be being done in the slightest to stop it.\n\nI seriously question how education and society more generally will function when some of the few people left holding it together retire/leave the mortal coil. Everyone in America and the Western World more generally has taken it for granted for far too long that things will continue to function, somehow someway, and it will all work out in the end. WHY DOES ANYONE THINK THIS IS A GUARANTEE? \n\nIt’s gotten to the point where I actively refuse to have children and bring them into this hellscape of our own creating, and frankly am Ai or bust. Either it will fix everything or burn it all down. Either seems preferable to this current slow frog march into the abyss.\n\nI know this sounds pessimistic as all hell, but I’m really at the deepest deficit of hope I’ve ever had for what was once a meaningful career and frankly way of life.

I mentioned that I should not have reviewed the structure of a paragraph before asking the students to write a paragraph for the first time all year.

All students are in their least restrictive environment and the best environment for them according to data and past school years.

      "text": "I’m a professor at a “top 10” liberal arts college. I’ve spent half of my career in my primary area of research and the other half learning about effective educational strategies. Decades upon decades of research has demonstrated that the single most important thing educators can do to help their students learn is to not ask them to study more advanced material before mastering (to a sufficient degree) less advanced material. This is how you keep students in their “zone of proximal development”. (An example: a student who hasn’t mastered their times tables is going to be lost in algebra. Another example: a student who can’t write a coherent sentence is going to be overwhelmed by the idea of writing a coherent paragraph.) And yet, if this subreddit is any indication, passing students from one grade to the next, with almost no regard for what they actually know, seems to be the current norm in primary and secondary schools. I think that many teachers would like to hold students back but administrators/parents won’t let them. What, if anything, can we do to fix this situation? And how can I, as a college professor, help?",

I heard that they could still get deported, but I’m not sure if that’s true but that terrifies me if it actually is because most of my family immigrated here (aunts, uncles, grandparents, etc.).\n\nI found out that due to him winning, FASFA will NOT exist anymore. High schoolers who are going to college can’t use it to help pay for college which is heartbreaking because I come from a low income household and the city I live in has faced economic challenges like poverty.\n\nEDIT II: I was very very worried about my future, but I’m not as worried anymore. Thank youuu for all the comments!! There’s mixed opinions about me becoming a teacher, some telling me to not do it, but I’m not sure if I want to do that since I am highly passionate about what I want to do. The only other major I’m passionate in is something in art, but that doesn’t pay well either😭. I live in Massachusetts and I’ve done my research, apparently it’s a great place to teach here and it’s also a blue state.",

      "text": "This post outlines a step-by-step process of what to do. Please read through the post. I know there was push back about national blackout days, I have provided more to a linked post in that section. PLEASE read the link before making a comment about a dress-up day. \n\nTLDR; See bottom of the post. Above any edits.\n\n\\###1) Organization \n\nRight now our biggest weakness is a lack of organization. We need to get the word out. We need to tell as many people as possible. In order for this to be effective, we need as many teachers participating as possible. Not everyone uses Reddit. \n\n\\*\\*\\*Each person that sees this should A) crosslink to another subreddit, b) share it on at least 2 different platforms, and c) tell at least 3 people.\\*\\*\\*\n\nWhen sharing this information, remember, \\*Admin is not your friend.\\* have these conversations behind closed-doors and do not send a direct link or share with admin. It may also not be a good idea to forward this through the school email. \n\n\\###2) Assess the situation \n\n\\*\\*A national blackout day\\*\\* (everyone wears black) the day immediately after the decision is made.  \n\nA national blackout day will allow each of us to \\*assess our school\\*, \\*build awareness\\*, and generate more force behind the upcoming national sick days. This is NOT ABOUT SOLIDARITY. This is about GATHERING INFORMATION, ASSESSING THE SCHOOL, and IMPROVING COORDINATION. I have explained my thinking in more detail in a previous post \\[here\\]([https://www.reddit.com/r/Teachers/s/gctsnpMCCH](https://www.reddit.com/r/Teachers/s/gctsnpMCCH))\n\n\\###3) Share information \n\nAt the end of business day on the national blackout day. Everyone share their information on r/Teachers . Me or someone else will create a post to measure blackout effectiveness. \n\n   First layer comment (comment directly for my post) should be all 50 states. \n\nSecond layer comment (comment to the state) is the school district. \n\nThird layer comment (comment within school district) will be the school. \n\nThe school layer post should be from a \\*throwaway account\\* -  XX school 75% of people wore black. \n\n\\*This is not intended to distinguish between 60% and 65%. This is to help us identify misinformation.\\*\n\nIn my last post, I read that some states and districts have penalties for sick outs. A school/ school district will not fire 20% of its staff. This is why it is important to do the blackout and share information. \\*Apes together strong\\*\n\n\\###3) Defend the DoE\n\n\\*\\*National sick days\\*\\*\n\n\\*\\*Two consecutive national sick days\\*\\* will have a stronger impact, especially if they are mid-week. Doing this mid-week will also prevent negative propaganda that we are looking for an extended weekend. We will need at least 24hrs after the blackout day to communicate, assess data, and continue to rally teachers. \n\n\n\n\\###4) Timing have created a schedule below to help us coordinate our efforts. \n\n||\n||\n|Closure Day|Blackout Day|Communication via r/Teachers|Sick-Out|\n|\\*Monday 3/10\\*|Wed|Thu|Tue-Wed 3/18-3/19|\n|\\*Tuesday 3/11\\*|Thur|Thu|Tue-Wed 3/18-3/19|\n|Wednesday|Thu|Thu|Tue-Wed (following week)|\n|Thursday|Fri|Fri|Tue-Wed (following week)|\n|Friday|Mon|Mon|Wed-Thu (SAME week)|\n|Monday (any Other)|Tue|Tue|Wed-Thu (SAME week)|\n|Tuesday (other)|Wed|Wed|Tue-Wed (following week)|\n\n\\*3/10 and 3/11 are different schedules to give us more time to bring teachers to the event.\n\nIf the DoE is dismantled, on a random Tuesday, the blackout happens the Wednesday the day after, communication about how the blackout went will happen the same Wednesday, and the sick-outs will happen Tuesday and Wednesday the following week. \n\n  \n\n\nTLDR; \n\n\\*Organization\\* through sharing this through word of mouth and different social cites\n\n\\*Assess the situation\\* through a national blackout day\n\n\\*Communicate\\* results of a national blackout date on r/Teachers \n\n\\*Defend the DoE\\* through sick-out days and further action. \n\n\\*Schedule of events\\* see above",

      "text": "I’ve met educators who say “they’ll never go back to school” even to advance columns on the salary schedule. Some educators I know just have their credential and didn’t take any units after getting their credential.  \n\nI have a hard time grasping this concept as I feel like it’s such a good investment in order to be put in the higher salary scale. I feel like there’s a lot of options for getting units like online classes, and professional development courses that have academic units, or even going to conferences that give graduate credit. I just feel like it isn’t that hard, but I’ve encountered so many educators who just won’t do the little work for a big pay off.\n\nUpdate:\nThank you for all your comments and discussion! I realized my post might have been a bit condescending and could have been worded differently. I appreciate the perspective of everyone and the reality check not everywhere is where I'm at. For context, I'm in California and the difference from the furthest left column to the furthest can be up to $30k in some districts. For my area specifically, it made sense to just take some classes to me advance on the salary schedule and hearing some of my colleagues not taking advantage of it was jarring to me. A lot of the furthest right columns here don't require a doctorate either, but usually just units or units above an MA.",

On one hand, it provides me with a level of documentation I wouldn’t otherwise have for any incidents that occur within the classroom, and it protects not only the students, but me as well. However, on the other hand, I hate the idea of having someone watching me teach 24/7. Granted, I don’t have anything to hide. I’m a damn good teacher, but it kind of feels like a smack in the face, and like there is now a blatant lack of respect and a distrust for special education teachers as a whole. I do understand why they are putting the cameras in the classrooms, but idk. It just really gives me the ick. Things happen in regular education classrooms too. Why not put cameras in all classrooms? Why single us out? I feel like we are now being micromanaged to the nth degree, and like we aren’t being treated like the professionals that we are. \n\nEdit: I want to make something clear.

Especially FL, NC, and GA. And what educators are in high demand? Foreign language, special education, and STEM. \n\nHowever, that doesn't mean that there are 55k jobs open right now. Rather than spend the money to pay for the educators needed, many districts are increasing class sizes, reducing the number of teachers they claim to need, and are cutting positions all in the name of saving money.

Low salaries and being the whipping boys of politicians and groups like Moms For Liberty make the career field undesirable. \n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yu9tfmjcJc4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yu9tfmjcJc4)",

      "text": "I am SO embarrassed. I let one of my staff get under my skin after months of playing nice and trying to work with them. So my pot finally boiled over and I said “I don’t give a shit…” about something they kept throwing in my face. No students were present but other staff saw me using lively hand gestures with them while I was saying it. The staff I was speaking to immediately wrote an incident report while I was on a field trip and now I am having to deal with the aftermath of being spoken to by admin, admin’s boss, and seeking advice from a union rep. I now have to write a draft rebuttal. Any advice? For those that have been written up, how did you get over the embarrassment? \n\nPost Update: WOW! I cannot thank you all enough for taking the time to comment on my post. I received some very valuable advice, had some good laughs, and am reminded of all the amazingly helpful, kind, smart teachers we have out there. Thank you from the bottom of my heart.\n\nI am newish to Reddit and still learning how it all works but if I can add an update with the final outcome (i.e. if I am non-reelect or I resign, etc.) at the end of the school year I will. \n\nA little more context though - I recently changed districts and am not yet tenured in the new district. I’ve always had glowing reviews in all previous evaluations from my old district but unfortunately I’m in new territory and probationary. I did let administration know that I said that word. They did follow protocol and complete an incident report that will be going in my file. I did write a response to the complaint that I believe will be attached to the other documents and I will request it be removed from my file if there is an opportunity in the future. I wish I could go into more detail at this time as it would make for a really good read but I need to protect my anonymity for now.\n\nThank you again and happy holidays to you and yours!",

      "title": "What to Expect in Education from a 2nd Trump Admin",
      "text": "I recently read an article on what lawyers are [expecting for higher education from a 2nd Trump admin](https://www.law360.com/articles/2263023/what-higher-education-can-expect-from-a-2nd-trump-admin). However, I think it applies pretty broadly to all education in the US. The article is paywalled, so I'll summarize here with some of my own thoughts.\n\n**DEI**\n\nThe most visible plank in the Trump/Project 2025 platform as it applies to education is destroying the US Department of Education. I've given my summary of what that [might look like here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Teachers/comments/1gnfa8z/comment/lwaeqiz/) (INAL, but I follow politics pretty closely on certain issues).\n\nThis article mostly focuses on one aspect of the DoED's mission which is to monitor and enforce access to education and prohibiting discrimination. To the right, this is effectively DEI and thus a target for their culture wars.\n\nEven outside abolishing the DoED to weaken minority protections, the article expects Republicans to vigorously go after schools based on the 2023 SCOTUS case [Students for Fair Admissions v Harvard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Students_for_Fair_Admissions_v._Harvard). If you're not familiar, this SCOTUS case decided that considering race as part of admissions violated the Equal Protection Claus of the 14th amendment - effectively overturning previous SCOTUS decisions which determined that considering race was acceptable in certain circumstances.\n\nSo, the article says, we should expect Republicans to aggressively target schools under this ruling. Adding a bit of my own expectations here, I expect they won't be successful in winning many cases. But that's not really the point for them. Rather, Republicans will likely bring suit against schools that they don't like in order to entangle them in expensive lawsuits and drain them of funds - all at taxpayer expense. Missouri's current Attorney's General, Andrew Bailey, has been [especially pernicious with this](https://www.ksdk.com/article/news/education/missouri-attorney-general-accuses-schools-of-religious-and-race-based-discrimination/63-39bfc798-a067-445f-993f-960f14b79b2e).\n\nCurrently, schools have been able to interpret the SCOTUS ruling quite narrowly as it only applied to admissions. Schools are still able to consider race in other respects, such as financial aid. However, the article predicts that Republicans will be bringing a wave of lawsuits targeting this as well. And they are almost certain to be successful.\n\n**Funding**\n\nPerhaps one of the most important things the article says to expect is cuts to federal funding. One of the ways this may play out is by targeting endowment funds of universities. Trump's administration is going to face a very early challenge because they are proposing unrealistic tax cuts that need to be paid for. Thus, the article expects that Republicans could simply try to increase taxes on these funds to make up for tax cuts elsewhere. The article suggests this is likely as Trump has explicitly stated he wants to use this as a weapon against schools with DEI initiatives. His VP authored a 2023 bill that would increase the taxes on endowments from the current 1.4% to 35% on private colleges and universities.\n\nTrump has also threatened to weaponize the DOJ to go after the tax-exempt status of organizations he disagrees with.\n\nAdding my own commentary: The shuttering of the DoED will also have some impacts to funding. Schools do receive some funding from the federal government. But I think one of the more pernicious impacts is that the DoED will no longer be able to oversee student loans. I haven't seen an explicit plan for this, but my expectation is that this means selling off current loans to private loan companies like MOHELA. This will likely give a massive cash infusion that Trump will be able to tout in the short term, but deprive the government from the long term income in the future, thereby setting the country up for another financial crisis.\n\n**Campus Protests**\n\nThe next major thing the article says to expect is increased scrutiny on campus protests - largely related to alleged antisemitism. From what I've seen, antisemitism is a *serious* problem\\* associated with protests related to Israel/Palestine. However, Republicans will likely be using this as a way to target liberal students with a broad brush, as well as foreign students attending US universities and chill free speech. Trump has [called for deporting students participating in such protests](https://thehill.com/homenews/education/4993239-student-protesters-palestinians-israel-gaza-trump-crackdown/); something [also called for by his new pick for Attorney General](https://truthout.org/articles/trumps-ag-pick-pam-bondi-once-called-for-deporting-student-protesters/), Pam Bondi.\n\n**Title IX**\n\nThe Biden administration added sexual orientation and sexual orientation to the protected classes under Title IX this year, which was consistent with the SCOTUS's ruling in Bostock v. Clayton County. Trump has promised to reverse such protections so Republicans will likely try to remove this, but it's not clear how successful they will be. What I suspect is more likely is that we will simply find the DOJ too busy with suing schools for alleged DEI programs to be available to help students protected under this expansion, making it much harder to hold schools that discriminate accountable.\n\nThe article also expects we'll see a rollback in other Title IX protections regarding sexual misconduct investigations. Previously, Title IX required that hearings be held in a venue where all parties could be present, thus continuing to give the perpetrator access to their victims which makes victims less likely to report and pursue charges. This was recently reversed, but the article expects that this will be reinstituted. Similarly, there was a recent ban on having a single investigator, which will likely also be targeted.\n\nETA:\n\n\\* - Lots of people putting words in my mouth on what I refer to when I say antisemitism is a serious problem. I'm not talking about holding Israel responsible for war crimes which they've absolutely committed.\n\n* I'm referring to things like glorifying terrorism against Israeli citizens even though a large number of Israeli oppose what their government is doing.\n* I'm referring to adoption of slogans like \"Globalize the Intifada\" which are explicit calls for violence globally against Jews that have nothing to do with Israel.\n* I'm referring to Jewish students at Cornell being called \"excrement on the face of the earth\" and threatened with rape and beheading.\n* I'm referring to students at New York City college having to lock themselves in the school library as a pro-Palestine mob chased them.\n* I'm referring to a Jewish student at Columbia university who was beaten with a Palestinian flag.\n* I'm referring to things like what happened at UCLA where pro-Palestine students graffitied campus buildings with swastikas and set up \"checkpoints\" to prevent Jewish students from attending classes.\n* I'm talking about students at these protests throwing Nazi salutes.\n* I'm referring to Northwestern university's faculty excluding Jewish members from an advisory committee on Preventing Antisemitism and Hate regarding student protests.\n* I'm talking about right wing antisemitic groups using these rallies to recruit.\n\nDislike for Israel and its actions has spilled over into overt antisemitism against Jews at large.\n\nHowever, that was not the primary point of including this segment. Rather, the point was that Republicans will be trying to use the student protests at large and things that *aren't* antisemitism as excuses to defund universities. In fact, this is already in action. A [\"report\" released by Republicans on 10/30/2024 is 325 pages of supposed antisemitic problems on campuses](https://edworkforce.house.gov/uploadedfiles/10.30.24_committee_on_education_and_the_workforce_republican_staff_report_-_antisemitism_on_college_campuses_exposed.pdf) (both by student groups and administrations) but, by and large, labels anything anti-Israel as antisemitic.\n\nThere is a large overlap between antisemitism and anti-Israel sentiment. The left wants to ignore this or engage in whataboutism and the right wants to exploit it.",

      "text": "When I started teaching a decade ago, I had never even heard of students on modified curriculum. Now it seems like the number of students with this accommodation increase every year! This year we have 5 different students between two teachers on modified curriculum and one that is “trialing” it. They are not all on the same level. That means we are not only expected to plan, teach and asses our grade level content, we also have to find similar activities and materials 2-4 grade levels behind. It is absolutely insane. \n\nWhat is the purpose of this? If the child is so far behind, they need to be presented entirely different material, why are they in my gen Ed classroom? And I don’t say that to sound unaccepting. I am just not a special education teacher. I and the teachers I work with feel like we have no idea how to help these kids and it’s a disservice to all! To the child, because I’m guessing here on how to help them not to mention I really don’t have time to give them the instruction they need. A disservice to the other students that have less of my time and attention because 2-3 of their classmates can’t do ANYTHING without our help. And lastly to the teacher, expecting us to be able to teach 3 grade levels at once and holding us accountable for the progress of a child you know came to me several grade levels behind. \n\nMy partner teacher has handled this longer than I have and she does a great job creating similar things at a lower level for the activities we do. She also buys them workbooks out of her own money that are on their level. I just don’t understand why we’re doing this. The answer has to be money, right? It’s too expensive to actually fund a program and have qualified sped teachers running it. But this inclusion at all costs is just not something I can get behind, but I feel like it’s not acceptable to say that out loud.",

      "title": "I'm so tired of there being no nuance in education",
      "text": "This is sparked by yet another debate over kids with disabilities. \n\nI'm so tired of the debate being \"No kids with any disabilities in any gen ed class\" and \"Full inclusion, let's throw everyone in the same room and tell the teacher to figure it out!\" \n\nThere was a post on tik tok (I know, first mistake) in which someone said that research is showing that inclusion is not actually working.\n\nThe response was a woman virtue signalling, replying that she absolutely couldn't believe he'd say this and that ALL kids should be welcome in \"your community\". She got angry at a comment that a kid who lacks basic life skills like tying shoes and writing his own name shouldn't be in the mainstream 7th grade class and said \"Wow, I didn't know only people who can tie their shoes can be in your community!\". She of course completely ignored the illiteracy, and didn't address that yes. A 7th grader SHOULD be able to tie their shoes and if they can't it's either a CPS case or a sign of serious disability. \n\nI KNOW schools did this well before. I had a friend who came to my honors science class even though she was in the self contained special ed room for the rest of the day. She struggled with a lot of life skills but she was a science genius. My cousin is autistic and can barely talk for a lot of her early years. It gave her severe anxiety and so she struggled in whole group settings. She ended up doing better in AP classes than gen ed because they were just smaller, and most people were quieter because they were trying to get good grades. It wasn't weird when they were doing a group project and she actually just wanted to do the project. What was best for her was small groups until she could take small but intense AP classes. Mainstream inclusion probably would have made her drop out, especially with the behaviors we have now. I had a student a couple years ago who was going to be placed in self contained because other teachers said she was too low to function. She just had VERY bad anxiety. She COULD talk, she just didn't talk to them. She COULD settle down and do the work, but she basically froze up if she got nervous. My sister is similar so I guess I knew how to deal with it. She was totally fine in my class and I showed them the evidence of her completing everything. She didn't need self contained classes, but a small group version of the normal curriculum would have been great for her. \n\nThere HAS to be nuance in the conversation. Inclusion is awesome for some kids. When our school tried putting all IEP kids in a different ELA class, I fought for some of them to come to me instead because they were better off. A girl with audio processing could absolutely do well in gen-ed. I just had to write the directions very specifically and give an example--which I do anyway. She ended up being one of my best writers. Another boy was willing to work hard to stay with his friends, and ended up going up several years in his reading level once he was no longer being separated from everyone else. He took a little longer than others but he could do it. The next year I had a kid who was very shy but was pretty smart once you got him talking. I put him with a high-performing but also shy kid and they both excelled. \n\nI also have students who will never do well in a gen ed setting, no matter what. I had a girl who  had no impulse control and was illiterate. She couldn't read so any time we were reading or writing in class, she would just get angry and would find reasons to curse you out or fight someone to get out of the situation. She had the maturity of a toddler, and was in massive trouble all the time. When we switched to small group, she thrived and spent her 8th grade year without a single write up. I currently have a young man who is trying, but absolutely cannot keep up with even a modified gen ed class. You can read him a 1st grade level sentence and he won't be able to tell you what it meant. I've tried drilling certain vocab and he can only remember it for about 2 minutes before forgetting. He plays with dolls and tries to force the other students to play pretend games with him (he's a superhero and they're the bad guy, he wants to chase them around. Things you'd expect from kinders). He's clearly starting to be aware that the other kids are only tolerating him. Even though no one bullies him and they often humor him, he's figuring out that he doesn't really have friends. He never understands anything that's going on, but he keeps getting in trouble for bad grades. He WANTS to be good so damn bad. He WANTS to do what he's supposed to and often he does try. But he simply doesn't have the capacity, and instead of being in a small group with the 5 other people in his grade who are similar, they split them all into different gen ed classes. Honestly he's lucky--the rest of the classes aren't as nice to the other kids at a similar level and they're getting in fights due to bullying. He's miserable, and teachers are frustrated. He NEEDS something else. \n\nAn IEP is supposed to be individual. So why can't we make placement by skill part of that like it used to be at my middle school. A kid might need to practice phonics but they can go into science and explain to you the complex chain of proteins that create DNA off the top of their head because they watched a youtube video about it. A kid might need to be in basic maths classes like addition while being able to write essays well above grade level. Maybe they can spout off historical events like a pro, but can't do anything in an art class due to fine motor control problems. Kids are people, and we're okay with adults only understanding one or two subjects as teachers (ask an ELA teacher like me about math, or a math teacher how to write your essay and see what happens) but kids are just \"the bottom 1% in the school\" or \"totally fine to take all their classes with everyone else\"",

      "text": "(This is a bit of a rant but I don't have anywhere else to let it out.)\n\n\nFirst, none of them have a full understanding of what the DoE actually does and they have accepted whatever made up facts are being presented to them. They throw out arbitrary budget numbers that an entire 30 seconds spent on Google debunks. But when it comes down to it, there are three types of people. \n\n- Parents who have completely deflected any responsibility they have in their lack of interest, investment and involvement in their own child's education. They place the blame of poor test scores, poor classroom performance and poor behavior solely on the back of teachers and educators. Parents of millennials refuse to acknowledge that they were the initial generation of parents to become self involved; sometimes due to the outbreak of single parents households and the need to work constantly to just feed their families or the boom of cheap technology and the internet. Adults who became parents in the early 00s and 10s have completely disassociated with the fact that they started handing screens to their kids and allowing technology to raise their own children. Instead of asking their children to see their homework, reading to them, helping them study for spelling tests and more, they sit on the couch scrolling Facebook and Tik Tok and hand an iPad to their 8 year old and then wonder why that child's teacher can't help them spell their own name (looking at your Bradleigh). \n\n- Educators fighting against the establishment because they don’t agree with it for numerous reasons. This can be old heads who hated the evolution of behavior management as it went away from suspending students for every single infraction or loathed the inclusion of special education students into gen ed classes because they were a “challenge.” Or this is the current/younger former educators who found themselves getting sucked down into the anti-woke culture war that brain washed them into thinking public education is horrible and we should go back to one room school houses where kids spend their days reading, writing and learning to sow.\n\n- Adults without children who have no idea what the hell they’re talking about. They get their news from sources that just make up facts. They believe anything that supports their established viewpoints against the “woke” government and educational system. They believed schools had littered boxes installed, that middle school teachers were promoting sex transitions and that teachers tell students if they don’t go to college they’ll fail at life and end up doing meth on the streets. This also includes adults who didn’t take school seriously at all, are struggling to be successful in life and blame their teachers for failing them.\n\n\nThe biggest problem is, they know they have educators by the heart strings. What do I mean by that? They know that the reason we do this job is for the students. We aren’t the UAW who is going to walk away from the assembly line and not feel like they are letting down someone who needs them. We have students where school is the only place they feel safe or accepted or loved. It feels like walking out, even for righteous reasons, is letting them down in a way. They know that about teachers and educators and they use it to do whatever they want to the educational system. Nothing will change until we decide that what is best for our students is most likely going to be walking away from them for a short time to force the hand of those making decisions. Enough parents have to have their kids at home for enough days and they will be the ones screaming for change.",

So, opinions of Trump and his/Republicans’ motives aside, how does the Department of Education actually affect what happens in your classroom?\n\nEdit: Thank you to everybody who explained how the DoEd primarily distributes funding to support poorer schools and students with disabilities. While much of my school was located in a wealthy area, we did have students from low income households. As a teacher I was never involved in funding programs in my school. If I had an IEP, I followed it because I cared about my students and respected the Spec Ed specialists in my school. While it admittedly shows a lack of civic responsibility, it shouldn’t be that surprising that I wouldn’t know how the DoEd was affecting my students, if not my lesson plans.",

We can see it from math scores to kids gaining weight and having no friends to parents not being involved in their lives or care if they are passing.\n\nIt seems that the education field in the US at the least seems to be having an everything crisis. With tha in mind, it's not an important discussion in the media of how millions of Americans reading at an elementary grade letter. What exactly also caused this cultural change of parents not caring as much on their child's livelihood? Even if we were to properly fund the school system, it wouldn't affect how kids are acting like psycho's, from not attending school to causing another school shooting.\n\nI also noticed how there is a wider education gap. While millions of suffering, we are also seeing the Top 30 universities having acceptance rates of less than 10% to join, were we now have students not getting accepted despite taking 10+ APs and almost perfect SAT scores. So you're either having medicore education and don't care or your working yourself to death to get into a state-flagship.\n\nI don't want to give my own anecdote as a student, as I didn't learn anything during my time at a charter school, and became homeschooled (both terrible things). But I wanted to know if there have been discussions from teachers or researchers on this trend in the last 30 years.",

In urban spaces, the structure was tighter, expectations clearer, and while the work was hard, I felt deeply seen. I knew I was showing up for students who looked like me — being the teacher I wish I had. The impact was soul-deep.\n\nNow in the suburban setting, things are looser — routines are lax, and while the environment might feel “easier” in some ways, the cultural disconnect is real. I’m constantly aware of how my presence disrupts the norm — sometimes in good ways, but also in ways that feel isolating.\n\nSo I’m asking: Do you feel like we’re more needed where we can affirm and uplift our own? Or is it just as powerful (if not more so) to be in spaces where Blackness is rarely represented and often misunderstood?\n\nWould love to hear from educators who are navigating this same terrain.

It also could spill into reading comprehension, because to understand the current sentence, you have to hold the previous sentence in your head.\n\nIt is an interesting idea.

It's that TikTok brainrot \"sprinkle sprinkle\" nonsense (I had to literally search to find out exactly what she was talking about). Likewise, lot's of boys are Tate fans. My sister told me one of her friends is planning to drop out of school the moment she finds an \"older provider man\". \n\nKids (not even necessarily 16-year-old teenagers, but kids as young as 10) are obsessed with money, aesthetics, skincare, etc. I had my things at that age too. But it's quite different. I remember that girls from my high school took a job on the side to be able to buy their first luxury purse. Now, everyone is getting themselves into serious debt in the pursuit of this stuff - or worse, doing something at the very least legally questionable on the side.\n\nIt's really bad. Please share your experiences. For context: this is in Europe, so I can only imagine what it may be like in North America, or elsewhere.",

We should also abolish school choice.\n\nI want 100% of education resources out into local public schools. The most efficient way to run things like schools is to pool all resources into one place. Likewise, private schools create a two tiered system that disadvantages working class students. It also creates class segregation.\n\nWhich brings me to another point. Local property taxes should not be the primary funding mechanism for schools. At least as much only should come from the state and federal government to even out the disparities between communities.\n\nI may come off as a bit reactionary when I talk about pedagogy (chalk and talk and drill and kill work, sorry, not sorry). But my economic views are about as far left as you can go. School is for everyone, everyone should get an equal education, and the rich have no right to opt out if that system. Honestly, medicine should be the same way: everyone gets the same, tax funded and government issued insurance, everyone gets the same care.\n\nHonestly I think private school abolition should be an issue that public sector teacher's unions should embrace.",

      "text": "When trying to address the issues with teaching, I feel like so many teachers forget what being a kid was like. \n\n\"Kids only pay attention 25% of the time\" yeah. Same. I spent most of high school zoned out, drawing single anime eyes, and writing naruto fanfiction in my \"social studies\" notebook. I'd frantically jot down some notes, and glance at my friend's notebook for the rest. We just had to hope we hadn't zoned out at the same time. It wasn't that we were locked it 100% of the time--we would just get in trouble if we yelled \"Wait! I'm not done! Go back!\" and then when the teacher moved it anyway say \"Fine, I'm not doing this shit anyway! You just want me to fail!\" \n\nThe difference isn't the inherent nature of kids, it's who the responsibility was placed on for them to learn. Now, them learning is a favor to us, rather than us doing a service for them. \n\n\"The laptops are the reason they aren't learning!\" like no. I've tried the paper route. It ends up with wasted sheets balled up and thrown at each other, and hundreds of pencils broken and thrown across the room. I'll take the off task kid just playing that one sled game they're obsessed with. The issue isn't that their work is on a computer. The issue is that there's no consequences for not doing the work. We didn't do our assignments because someone used paper to print them, we did our assignments because if not we'd fail the class, and fail the grade, and have to go to Summer school. REAL Summer school, not a fun camp where you do 2 hours of online work that you don't even have to really do and then play games and go on field trips. \n\n\"The kids use such foul language!\" so did you. You'd just get in trouble for saying it in front of adults. I was listening to hollywood undead as a kid, but I didn't yell \"When I start drinking, my dick does all my thinking\" at the top of my lungs. Not because I didn't have it stuck in my head, but because I would have been suspended, and that suspension would have been spent scrubbing every surface in the house and whatever other annoying chores my parents could think up. \n\nThe kids aren't different, and technology isn't the devil. The education system has placed the burden of learning on teachers instead of students and their families. That's it. That's the difference. And you can have kids write their essays in blood on ancient papyrus, but they'll still be copying if from chat GPT until you have a culture that values education for the sake of gaining understanding and a system that holds the people who can actually change a kid (the family) accountable for failing that child. \n\nEdit: some of y'all have worse reading comprehension than your students. What I didn't say is that behavior isn't worse than it was before, or that phones aren't decreasing attention spans. What I did say is that a lack of boundaries caused by societal changes is the issue. Everyone saying \"I NEVER cursed.\" Is both lying in my assumption and severely missing the point. There's nothing wrong with cursing, but it needs a time and place. There's nothing wrong with zoning out, but when you do, it's your fault. And I'd bet every teacher on this thread is also addicted to their phones, but they don't act out like the students do. My point is that acting like the kids wouldn't be pretty much the same as us if dropped on pretty much the same structure and environment is missing the point. A kid with no phone would still be worse than a kid who had a phone 15 years ago, because the kid 15 years ago got in trouble when he misbehaved and the kid now thinks it's funny that he bit a teacher in 6th grade.",

I made a glaring mistake and I am ashamed I didn't try to hard\n\nSecond Edit: Somehow this made it out to Reddit proper and we are getting a wide range of opinions on this post. While I appreciate the perspective - a lot of you are disrespectful to other teachers who probably put so much time, life, and effort into making sure students are educated. I feel as though it enforces many of our worldviews that the outside perspective is anti-education and anti-teacher. Despite all the arrows towards them they still show up and do their best every day. I don't care what is said about me (none of you know me from this short post), but I feel anger at the dispariaging remarks to teachers overall.

Not every employee who elects to take the buyout would be eligible for a $25,000 payment, however. The memo says the award would be \"the equivalent of severance pay or $25,000, whichever is less.\"\n\nThere are more caveats: Those eligible must have been employed by the federal government for at least three consecutive years. They also cannot have received a student loan repayment benefit in the last three years. Other types of awards – including relocation, recruitment or retention bonuses – would be disqualifying for some.\n\nSo basically the Dept. of Ed employees are told to take a crappy deal or wait to see if they are fired. \n\nGot to love the new regime.

Education's problems are much bigger and have been in process for decades.\n\nThe current rush to fill teachers' work lives with ever increasing data management, meetings, trainings, etc, is a symptom of the system breaking down. When things are going poorly, you start looking at ever smaller areas to try and staunch the bleeding. (If you've ever had a budget problem, you'll know what I'm talking about). \n\nTeachers used to be \"local experts\" in a community because they had specialized knowledge about subjects (high school) or child development and skills building (elementary / middle). That isn't the case now with information access. Everyone can find (true or not true) information, and that part of a teacher's job is no longer trusted. Parents largely don't consider teachers experts in anything, and neither does the broader community. We aren't listened to by our administrators and not valued enough to live where we teach in many places. Kids are encouraged to consider teachers as just adults with opinions rather than professionals. \n\nOur economy depends on parents being able to work, and schools are great at housing kids for several hours a day. Now that day includes breakfast and sometimes dinner. It also includes mental health, social workers, and law enforcement. But those non-curricular parts are encroaching on content.  Additionally, student work is no longer required. It's becoming day care with a dollop of education.  \n\nSociety has prioritized student perceptions of life over the actual ability to deal with life. Why? I don't really know. We are no longer allowed to challenge student perceptions.  Parents often don't back teachers, and our observations about students are discounted. If we aren't trusted regarding a student's progress, then what's the point? Why is it the teacher's job, increasingly, to show that heaven and earth have been moved to educate a child who has not participated at all?\n\nAll of the above have taken years to appear. We didn't get to this place in a few months or even a handful of years. For that reason, I don't think ANY politician can \"solve\" this. Education is at a huge inflection point because of human change, technological innovation, changing values, and other forces.  It might be that these forces - particularly technology - will do to education what it has done to video and music and fundamentally change the institution.",

Maybe the added embarrassment of being a 13 year old in a class with 8 year olds will reinforce them to get their shit together. Then, no matter how long it takes them, or how old they are when they finally graduate, they actually know how to read, how to do math, and all the other basic principles needed to begin their lives as educated people who can positively contribute to society.\n\nEdit: A lot of concerns about IEP’s or special education, I believe these things can still exist alongside this education model.

I had no idea how bad it has gotten.\n\nFor some background, I’m a parent of two kids that go to public school. We live in a school district with a good reputation, located in the suburbs near a city in the northeast.  One child is in 10th grade and one in 4th.  Both of my kids do well in school.  Neither have any behavioral problems going on.  They both have always gotten good feedback at parent teacher conferences.  And I personally think that their homework seems MUCH more difficult and intense than mine ever was.  And they tend to do well with these assignments, although they often need help from us.  One of our kids did fall behind on reading after Covid and had to be given some assistance but she’s since caught up and can read at her grade level. \n\nNow, I’m not privy to what goes on in the classroom or in other kids homes, but I would be shocked to hear that some of the stories I’ve read are going on in my kids classrooms.  Things like children physically assaulting teachers, or urinating on teachers, or kids that are so unruly that they disrupt the entire class regularly with no repercussions, or the majority of kids being grade levels behind on reading and math.  Things like that.  Just generally all signs of a broken system that isn’t working as intended.  Things way above and beyond a couple bad apples. \n\nNow granted, I could be wrong, like I said, I’m not there in the classroom.  That’s why I write this post in the first place.  I suppose my question is whether the problems I’m reading about in the United States school system are universal or are they likely coming from schools that do not have the same standards that my local school district appears to have?",

So much has changed tech-wise, and the new district has an incredibly rigorous curriculum which is going to require additional training in my end. There are now book bans, which I’ve never had. I normally would run some clubs and be super involved, but I’ve got a child now and worry about how I’m going to manage all of this. I’m trying to focus on the positives only.",

      "text": "This is not a new tale, nor one of any rarity but I wish to share it here to gain more insight and strengthen the understanding I have, especially from a German perspective. I am Irish Palestinian. \n\nI live in Berlin, Germany but I am from Ireland. I moved to Berlin 6 months ago and started worked in a Cosmospolitan International Kindegarten, one that promotes empathy, equity and excellence in education.\n\nRecently, I was brought in for a meeting, to discuss the end of my probation contract ending, we had planned this would be a discussion about my contract and perhaps furthering my time at the school as the feedback thus far had been very positive. Instead, the heads told me there was two topics to discuss, the first being that my choice of expression was being deemed as \"too political\" in such sensitive times. I wear a Palestine necklace, have done for 5 years now, a gift from my late father to my mother when they met. It's the shape of the map of Palestine. They also commented that a projected I launched, to promote diversity within the class group, was also deemed to be too political. My collage was a few images of who I am, including a Palestinian and Irish flag, and an image of me at a charity run for Palestine, you can see solidarity symbolism in this photo such as my friend wearing a Keffiyeh and I am wearing a Free Palestine tshirt. This example of my collage was shared with the parents, heads and teams as an example to get the families involved in our group class chat on a school platform. Parents had already began to send back their child's heritage and background for the presentations we wished to conduct. In the meeting, they told me that what I do in my free time in up to me, but in the sphere of the kindergarten they prefer to keep the space and their teachers neutral. This project also came from the inclusion and diversity department, a resource from the school's resources.\n\nThey then told me, they decided not to continue my contract, giving me two months notice, instead of the two weeks they are contracted to give, but asked how my stay until the end of term may be made easier.\n\nI know they can end my contract for whatever reason but naturally I felt embarrassed, marginalised and furious that my identity and heritage was brought up, with such insensitivity, (I was not invited to bring a third party, and struggled to take my own minutes) and without warning to at least give me a chance to discuss the matter. They told me the children should not have to worry about such matters and of course I explained that it was never my intention nor have I ever brought politics into the space, because they children I teach are four years old.\n\nSince the meeting, I have decided to explore legal options, they are aware of this and since have put me on temporary leave, suspending me access to all platforms, parents have contacted me to show support and fight my corner and the school told them they were planning to end my contract anyway. I've also heard from other sources that they are now starting a smear campaign about me in the school, saying i reacted very poorly in the meeting, which was the real reason they decided to terminate my contract, and they are apparently saying that I was highly active in the politcal sphere in Berlin and thus a danger to the children. They school have also not responded to any of my email's, most importantly they have also refused to share their minutes of the meeting.\n\nI know what to expect in Germany, especially in this place of such prestigious notable berlins children attend, of course there are zionists among them but as a teacher, an educator, in a place that celebrates diversity and inclusion, I am going to fight this or at least publicise and shame them. The entitlement of these people makes me sick to my stomach and most of all, the children have suffered greatly to have my just wiped off the map. Our roots are deeper than they can ever ever ever fathom.\n\nAny input is appreciated, thanks for reading. Thoughts, support and leads are welcome.",

They do a raffle which normally consists of smalls prizes like $10 gift cards, T shirts, coffee mugs, etc. Previous years have had 5 or so winners so no big money was spent. \n\nAt the beginning of the raffle, our superintendent mentioned this year we would have a “big prize” that may or may not be a car. We were all super confused because our district? Giving away a car? The same district the starts teachers at $45,000/year??? No way. \n\nSo he does the drawings for the smaller prizes, then comes the “big prize” drawing and this time he mentions it **is** a car. My name gets picked! They have me come up to the front and say they are bringing the car out now. I’m super nervous and excited because wtf?! Did I just win a car?! This is definitely needed. They bring out the car and it is a…a fucking remote control car for a toddler, the ones they can ride in. \n\nWhat. The. Fuck. I’ve had time to process it and so many things are running through my mind. \n\n1. What a fucking slap in the face to make me and all of us believe there was a car in the drawing. To make me believe I won it for that minute. \n\n2. Why is this even in the drawing?? I am a 5th grade teacher what use could I possible get out of a remote control car meant for toddlers! I have a child that is way too big for it so it’s not like I could give it to him. But even if I had a toddler, why is the “big prize” meant for teachers for a toddler?!? This is all so weird. \n\n4. I looked up the prices of this remote control car and they go for like $200 on Amazon. Why not just make the prize $200?!? I don’t mean to sound ungrateful, but what is the point in this?! \n\n5. What the fuck?! I have never felt so disrespected in my career before. I’m so furious.",

I’m not sure what to do about it but I’d like to prepare somehow for next Fall. \n\nSo, one of my favorite parts of the job is the career counseling portion. I always offer to help students with applications if needed because I know it can be intimidating. However, I've noticed that each year, the students have less and less general knowledge. They need help answering literally every single question - even the most basic questions, most of which you should learn in elementary school. I need to know if this is the \"norm\" everywhere. Here are some examples:\n\n  \n\\-I don't know my mom or dad's job\n\n\\-I don't know if my mom or dad went to college\n\n\\-I don't know my zip code (often confused with area code)\n\n\\-we live in Pennsylvania, right?\n\n\\-Wait, what county are we in?\n\n\\-What does \"starting semester\" mean? Do I apply for Spring 2025 or Fall?\"\n\n\\-I know my birthday is in December but I forget the date (this was a freshman applying for vo-tech)\n\n\\-I don't know how to check my email\n\n\\-What does this mean?

I asked him to start the classwork, and he hit me with:\n\n“Man, this is basically slavery.”\n\nSo I said:\n“No, slavery doesn’t come with field trips, free Wi-Fi, Chromebooks, iPads, or teachers holding your hand through everything. People pay tens of thousands of dollars to learn what you’re getting for free- and you’re mad because it’s cutting into your screen time?”\n\nHe went quiet.\n\nThen he tried the classic fallback:\n“Yeah but, when am I ever going to use math?”\n\nAnd I told him:\n“Maybe never. But school isn’t about memorizing formulas- it’s about proving you can learn something hard and boring and stick with it. Most employers don’t care if you know the quadratic formula. They care if you can handle doing stuff that isn’t fun without falling apart. Failing math in a system this forgiving doesn’t mean math isn’t useful. It means you can’t even pass with help- and that’s the real problem.”\n\nSilence. Just blinking. Like I short-circuited the part of his brain where the excuses live.\n\nNo more complaints for the rest of class. He either gave up or there might’ve been an aha moment.\n\nEither way? He was the quietest he’s ever been. I might frame the moment.\n\nEdit for clarity and boundaries:\n\nI’m open to discussion, critique, and even disagreement- but I’m not here to entertain personal attacks, ableist comments, or hyperbolic comparisons that derail the point (mods have been awesome about it thank you). \n\nIf you're here to genuinely talk about what’s broken in education, I'm listening.

That was for this crew. \n\nEdit #2: I don’t post very often, but holy cow! I’ve never had this many responses to anything and of course it has to be about coochies 😆\n\nI also need to state I was wrong when I said the song was Watermelon Crawl. That’s a different song that at one point was sung by the same artist. My apologies to Alan Jackson and all the hoochie-coochies out there 😂🙏",

      "text": "I work at an intermediate school as an eighth grade teacher and we've had a doozy of a student that has caused nothing but issues for staff and students alike. He openly swears and says vulgar homophobic things without any regard. Behavior issues are extreme (including promoting fighting and bullying) and no intervention besides **one suspension** has done anything.  Of course, he plays sports and has still been able to play them regardless of his grades because apparently holding people accountable is akin to sinning in my district. Anyways, we got the news today that our principal--and keep in mind he already told us the student wouldn't be walking--says to us that he's going to promote at high school and will be at the ceremony.\n\nOf course, all teachers who've had him looked puzzled and pissed, myself included. One of our teachers asked why.\n\n*\"Well his family is coming from San Jose and they bought non-refundable tickets back in February.\"*\n\n*\"Without seeing his grades?\"* our science teacher asked.\n\nPrincipal just shrugged and told us he already purchased his cap and gown too. He said it'd be easier to just let him move on and get expelled once he's in high school because it won't fall back on them. Looking back on the year all I could think of was how many times admin had us preach about consequences and being responsible--harping on the teachers that the rules applied to them as well. I suppose there was an addendum making administration immune with following through with this on their end.\n\n*\"...But he doesn't get to go the water park at the end of year.\"*\n\nI can guarantee he will be going to that water park. The only consecutive thing that has happened all year is administration moving their standards further and further down the line. They're so worried they'll be seen as racist (student Latino) and they don't want to deal with the parents. Our school secretary is pretty certain they must have attached a bribe on top of paying reservation and she's been working here for twenty years.\n\nThat's the humor of it all. Hypocrisy.\n\nedit: To all those asking if I would want him back--I'd be open to it. In fact, it'd probably be the first time he'd face consequences and could actually help him in the long run. A shot in the dark, perhaps. But his current course is unsustainable--even if he is a little shit.",

This morning, one of my students (one of my most trustworthy students) came into my room and told me about something that happened yesterday. \n\nShe was going her schoolwork underneath my desk because she likes the cozy rug (which used to be part of a seating area across the room where students could sit and do their work, but those privileges were last this semester, so I just recently moved it under my desk) I have under there, so she was completely unseen. Two teachers came into my room and proceeded to talk shit about me, my decorations, and even my personal pictures I have on my wall (including MY BOYFRIEND????) while she was hidden under there. They were dropping f-bombs left and right, just verbally trashing the place up. Now apparently my sub came in the room and heard some of it, informed them that a student was underneath the desk the whole time, to which they fell silent for an extended period of time before leaving. \n\nThis student knows who these teachers are, and they’re both women who are 10+ years older than me. I’m a first year teacher. This isn’t giving a lot of incentive to keep at this career if the grown ass staff is acting more childish than the students. Seeing adults act like clique-y mean girls who peaked in high school, especially towards A FIRST YEAR TEACHER, is very off-putting and doesn’t give me much desire to stay in this district for long.\n\nImagine being almost 50 and talking shit behind a 29-year-old’s back, in THEIR OWN CLASSROOM? Seriously thought I was teaching high school, not reliving it all over again. \n\nEDIT: Since this seems to be an issue, I don’t let this student work under my desk. That has never happened while I’m there, but since I HAD A SUB THAT DAY, I had no control over the situation. Admin unlocks classroom doors every morning before school starts, so free access for students isn’t even on me or other teachers.",

We have a new principal who is very focused on improving academic success and the behavior that comes with it, but it’s a slow and frustrating process.\n\nIn my last class on Friday, one student was goofing off during group work for the whole class. I gave her plenty of redirection and then told her to move her seat and work alone as she wasn’t successful in a group. She ignored me 5 times. On the 5th time of telling her to move, she said “B***ch, I hope your baby dies” in front of the whole class. I’m about 6 months pregnant. I told her to leave my class and called the office to have someone pick her up. I put a referral in and got an automated email later on that she was suspended. \n\nI can usually let the poor behavior go, but it’s Sunday and I’m still thinking about this. It makes me sad to think I’m bringing my baby into school every day where she can now hear these horrible things being said, now about her, before she’s even born!\n\nBefore this student returns to my class I’m going to ask admin to facilitate a meeting where I tell her that of course I will move forward and help her to learn as best I can, but that she can’t take back those words and the hurt she’s caused. That maybe one day if she ever chooses to and is privileged enough to be pregnant, she’ll remember she actually said that to someone, and she’s not going to forget it. Maybe then she’ll realize how horrible of a thing it was to say, and she can’t do anything to take words back.\n\nI don’t want to be vindictive, but what else should I do to respond to this situation? Including how, if at all, should I address it with the rest of the class that heard her say that while she’s out on suspension?",

BUT we could only receive it in cash and had to come to the school to receive it. Since then we’ve all received our pay (though we all recognize there’s absolutely something shady about them receiving that much cash in one day.) \n\nFor those of us who aren’t brainwashed, the trust is gone and we’re making our way out. The others are acting as if nothing happened and all is well. I truly don’t believe this school will be around much longer one way or the other. \n\nSmall private school. On payday we were told to check our email. In short: the school director said they could not pay us this payroll cycle and did not know when they would be able to. \n\nI am honestly just stunned. I made so many sacrifices with this job. The school is terribly run. The children behave as if they have never known discipline and on top of that they are 2-3 grade levels behind. We are a religious school but there is no real structure or order. It’s actually awful. But I was trying to get through the year for my students (one grade level in particular) who are sweet, mostly respectful and need a teacher who cares that they actually learn. \n\nBut now I’m not sure if I can stay. This was really the last straw. \n\nWe were told that moving forward payments should be fine but they’re not sure when the funds they were waiting for for this cycle will come through, however it seems like they want us to keep working anyway. \n\nHas anyone dealt with anything like this before? Is this not absolutely crazy? \n\nEDIT: Thank you all for the advice and support! Just FYI we got this email TODAY. Like ten minutes into first period. I didn’t want to include that in case anyone could put all the details together but who cares at this point. \n\nI am not going in on Monday. I’ve texted my two teacher friends and they are also not going in. I asked them to reach out to any other teachers they can and to tell them to do the same. I’m calling a lawyer on Monday and our local news. I will be back with updates whenever I have them",

Our front desk person asked who his homeroom teacher was, and the dad had to step out of line and call his wife to find out. I was shocked! It's February! You should have had at least a couple of conferences with your kid's teacher by now! \n\n  \nIs this more normal than I realize?",

Actually, more like 45 minutes to an hour early because we have to park on campus and then walk to a park that is a few blocks away. All the students parents are being told to drop off their students at the park instead of the school. \n\nThen we are supposed to walk our classes through the neighborhood to the main road. The each teacher will teach their class how to use the crosswalk. Finally we'll walk them to the campus and to class.\n\nI get that this is supposed to teach the kids how to use a crosswalk, but I think having all the students, including middle schoolers, do this is a bit much. This is done every year and every year it takes over an hour and a half to get the kids back on campus. \n\nPersonally, I don't have a desire to teach my 12 year olds how to cross the street since their parents should have taught them that years ago. Plus I don't really want to come in an hour early.",

I told them wrong number and moved on. \n\nThe next call was the same thing, about a week later they called saying Tim needed to be picked up. I said I don’t have anything to do with Tim and to please stop calling me about him.\n\nThe third time they called was to pick Tim up from some sort of after school karate function. This time I was more serious and said something to the effect of “I’ve told the school multiple times that I have no idea who this kid is but I keep getting calls to pick him up. What if I had bad intentions? Please remove my phone number from the kids profile and make sure his actual parents are getting these messages” They apologized profusely and promised it wouldn’t happen again.\n\nThe fourth time they called I recognized the number and answered in a bit of a huff to be honest. I asked to speak with who was in charge of after school pick up and was told that’s who I was speaking to. I said I’ll call back and talk to the office. I repeated the same issue again to the office and they, again, swore up and down that they’ll have me removed from the profile and contact the actual parents. \n\nI haven’t picked up the 5th or 6th time they called but they still call. What else can I do short of going to the school and shredding the document with my phone number on it? I don’t even have kids!!!",

If your kid hits 15 and has never been a starter, then it's time to accept the obvious. And I am very pro-sports, I think it's good for a kid's sense of well-being to be on a team and develop those friendships and work towards a common goal. \n\nBut to shape your life around going pro when you're not the best player on your team in a town of 50,000??

They were mostly just doing it to get out of class. Most of the kids that went are doing poorly in their classes. I quoted Nelson Mandela to those that stayed. “Education is the most powerful weapon which you can use to change the world.” At the time, I felt that being in class would benefit them more.

They worry they're not being prepared for the future.*\n\nIs this a student response to the grace, compassion and \"50% is the lowest grade\" policies that Admin keeps pushing?\n\nAre teachers going to get blamed for teenagers not feeling challenged or prepared?\n\nWhen do parents get blamed for not wanting their teenager to be challenged or prepared?",

I took on this part time job to help pay for costs for my school and because they were desperate. So, I have been working here for two years, did my student teacher here and finally graduated. \n\nFor reference, it is my principal, and also a separate administer, and their wives (who are teachers at the school, one of which was my teacher mentor). \n\nFor the last 3 years (known them for 3, working for 2), this school has been suggesting that I would get a job here as a classroom educator when I finished my degree and if there was an opportunity. Queue a teacher leaving last minute and me being graduated...sounds like they would hire me? No, they hired someone else. \n\nThey didn't even talk to me about it. Nobody said a word. These people were my friends, coworkers, and even went to church with them. \n\nI don't blame them. I get it. They didn't officially make any promises. However, I now will treat them as they have treated me i.e. no talking to them at all costs, and treating them professionally. \n\nIf truth be told, I the most angry at the fact they didn't talk to me about it at all. Noone said a word about it. \n\nAnyway, they are very obviously annoyed at me for ignoring them and treating them like they treated me. They don't like it and think I should be a professional.

Flaired as policy and politics because seriously...why is this allowed.\n\nIn the last 8 days, my small, high poverty high school has enrolled what amounts to between a 5 and 10 percent jump in our 9th and 10th grade enrollment.\n\nAll but one of these new students comes from a national charter network I'd never be so crass as to name but let's say it rhymes with Clip...p.\n\nAs I receive in-progress grades from Rhymes-With-Quip, I notice that what all our new 9th graders have in common is very low math grades! Astonishingly, in my state, 9th grade is the year for the super high stakes state math test that determines student graduation and school score card.\n\nAt the 10th grade level, our new erstwhile Rhymes-With-Hip..sters are a mix mathematically, but they are universally very low performing in ELA. Take a wild guess what year students in my school take the super high stakes reading test that determines student graduation and school score card.\n\nAnd yes, before you ask, there is **no state mechanism** for us to be less than 100% responsible for these students' scores on this state test. So despite getting them enrolled less than 24 instructional days before the test, it is on us if they do not score at the state mandated level. And since we're understaffed and we're high poverty and we hover on the edge of meeting our state mandated goal every year, it's VERY possible that this sudden 5 to 10% downward pressure on our scores from Rhymes-With-Drip is going to trigger all kinds of shit up to and including potential closure or staff purge.\n\nAnd the next time our local school board tries to do any kind of oversight of charters, some CEO from this almost-Rhymes-With-Shit network is going to stand up and grandstand about the need for charter schools to \"save kids trapped in failing schools.\"\n\nAs they ship us our failures, barely even pretending it's not because the state test is in 6 weeks.\n\n....yes, yes, #notallcharters, but see post title.

This even includes while on school functions and what not. \n\nOf course it will allow 504 exception or times of emergencies and what not, but other than those circumstances, starting next school year, it is no longer up to public schools or public charter schools, it will be state law.\n\nWhat are your thoughts/opinions on it? I know my Mom is exctatic, where I'm kind of mixed, for the simple fact, I don't see this going all too well when it happens, but honestly, I can get behind it.\n\nEdit: to clarify a few points on some of my hesitation. The bill doesn't explain enforcement expectations/policies/standards, so I'm not sure if the government is expecting each teacher to enforce said policy (which I already do, some of the other teachers at my school do not). Or if they expect the Admin to just have a cart collection at the front door for everyone to turn in their devices, or what. We already have some teachers not enforcing the no phones policy, so I can only imagine how it's going to go when we have to take away smart watches as well.\n\nMy concern isn't so much as taking these away from. The kids, we absolutely need to, it's just enforcement and expectations that some teachers (at my school at least) don't seem to either care about enforcing, therefore making my job harder.",

I happened to see them at the office and said hi and mentioned how I graduated from that high school about a decade ago. \n\nWe started chatting and I said how I had a really positive experience at that school (**note: that school has a high admin turnover rate, these administrators were new-ish**) and how fondly I remember those years and stuff like that.\n\nThey were really surprised and started talking about how things are completely different now, there are tons of fights on campus, kids smoking, huge numbers of students just not going to their classes & instead hanging around the campus. \n\nThat really caught me off guard and I said \"wow, that's crazy. I remember in high school when you'd leave class to go to the bathroom, campus was a 100% empty grave yard\". \n\nThey were SHOCKED. Literally open-mouth shock. They genuinely started questioning me like \"was the admin doing something different? were there specific school initiatives around attending class? do you remember what the discipline process was like?\" \n\nWe talked about it for a while and I came out with 2 conclusions: \n\n1 - There are a whole lot of \"regular\" kids who would not have been troublemakers before, and are now passive troublemakers. Because as long as no one takes their phone, no other punishment really matters. \n\n2 - Parents suck. And it really is those damn phones.",

As she reached high school, she worked hard to catch up, though the administrators attempted to convince her that it was impossible for them to help her learn to read and write by hand, or to provide occupational therapy her teachers requested.  \n\nWhat was really sad was reading that her family moved from Puerto Rico to Hartford specifically because they heard Connecticut was one of the best states in the country for education, and they hoped it would help their daughter due to her learning and communication disabilities.\n\nI would be interested to hear the thoughts of teachers in this sub, to fill out the broader picture of how these situations occur and what could be done differently with the existing limited resources.",

Clearly spell out your family's expectations for their behavior at school and your\nfamily's consequences if they demonstrate inappropriate behavior at school. Remind them that\nthreats of school violence and spreading rumors of threats can lead to suspension and expulsion from school. If determined a criminal threat, they can lead\nto charges, juvenile detention, and a criminal record.\n\n\nWe recommend your family limit the violence your children are seeing on TV, in movies and video games,\nand on social media. Set limits on their screen time, including no-phone and no-computer zones in their\nbedrooms. Designate common spaces for online activities, where you can supervise them.\n\n\nSchools cannot do this alone. The safety of our children is a shared responsibility.

During covid? Yeah they were posting how they wanted yall out the house by week 3. During summer....same thing.

I bet out of our 24 kids, 20 will say no. \n\nThem: quiet\n\nMe: yeah, your parents want you here because they dont want you home. So thats why you gotta go to school. Well that along with other social-poltical issues like the economy, childcare, and other boring stuff but thats a stiry for a different day. Back to comparing and contrasting. \n\nThem: IMA ASK!\n\nSo now im wondering what they will say come Monday. Pribably nothing cuz im sure they forgot about it 8 mins after our conversation lmao. \n\nEdit: some ppl have mentioned how this can come off triggering, rude, etc, to students who may have less than stellar home lives and relationships with parents and parent figures. I agree with this and will circle back Tuesday to put some more  love and reassurance that I was just tryna be funny but I coulda been more mindful of word choice.

      "title": "Trump Admin Cuts Funding For Public Schools. States Sue.",
      "text": "Thanks to the Trump administration, educators across the country suddenly don’t know if they’ll have the funds to support students and provide critical services. On June 30, the Department of Education announced it was withholding nearly $7 billion from public schools. In a three-sentence email sent to the states, the agency said it was “reviewing” five different funding grants. Some of the affected programs deal with support for English learners, after-school programs, teacher professional development, and adult education.\n\n“The Department remains committed to ensuring taxpayer resources are spent in accordance with the President’s priorities and the Department’s statutory responsibilities,” the email said.\n\nThis week, 24 states and Washington, D.C., responded to the freeze by filing a lawsuit against the Trump administration, alleging that the withholding of funds is illegal and would come at a great cost to students across the country. In particular, one group has found, red states would be among the hardest hit. \n\nIt amazes me sometimes how much politicians like to hurt their constituents. When you cut school funding, staff and resources get cut with it. This leads to larger class sizes and less support for the kids who need it the most. But what can you expect from a draft dodging president who tells men they can grab women by the p\\*\\*\\*\\* and wants kids to grow up to be low IQ drones. Plus a Secretary of Ed who never taught, but… oh yeah she helped run WWE wrestling. So that qualifies them to make decisions about education. \n\nLet’s be honest. If these funds don’t come in, there may (and will) be some cuts to staff and resources once the school year has already begun. I can’t imagine telling a teacher or resources specialist that they just lost their job so Trump can have a military parade on his birthday and remodel a used jet that he got as a “gift”. \n\n\n\n  \n\n\n[https://news.yahoo.com/news/trump-administration-cuts-funding-public-154222122.html](https://news.yahoo.com/news/trump-administration-cuts-funding-public-154222122.html)",

What is less clear is whether the Court will do so in a way that could endanger every public school in the country’s ability to function.\n>\n> Eric Baxter, the lawyer representing the parents who oppose these books, seemed quite emboldened during Tuesday’s argument, and advocated for a result that would be extraordinarily disruptive. In his brief, Baxter suggested that parents who object to any form of classroom instruction on religious grounds must be notified in advance about that instruction and be permitted to opt their child out of the class.\n>\n> … Under Baxter’s proposed rule, to avoid these lawsuits, school districts would have an obligation to notify parents in advance if they will teach any book where magic exists, any book where divorce exists, any book where women have accomplishments, or any book about famous pacifists such as Martin Luther King Jr. — among many other things. It is hard to imagine how any public school could comply with such an obligation.\n>\n> That said, while all six of the Republican justices appeared highly likely to rule against the school district in Mahmoud, some of them did appear to be looking for a way to decide this case more narrowly than Baxter suggested.\n>\n> Justice Samuel Alito, for example, suggested at one point that Baxter’s rule might only apply to very young students, or to lessons that touch upon sexuality. Justice Neil Gorsuch pointed to an alleged statement by a school board member, which Gorsuch claims showed animus against certain religious beliefs. Following Gorsuch’s line of thinking to its conclusion would allow the Court to rule that Montgomery County’s policies must be changed because they are rooted in animus, but that another school district might be allowed to enact similar policies so long as they did not display similar hostility toward religion.",

      "text": "Does your school have a committee that gets together to organize morale-boosting events and celebratory gifts? If so, what is it called? Are you encouraged to pay your “dues” toward this committee that will in turn go toward paying for bridal/baby/bereavement gifts for staff members, special luncheons, etc.? How much are your dues? Does your principal offer an incentive for paying your dues since these dues are voluntary? Lastly, how do you feel about this policy? \n\nMy school calls this our Sunshine Committee, so we are asked to pay our sunshine dues of $40/year at the beginning of the year. We get to wear jeans with a school shirt on Mondays if we pay our dues. This year, the committee came up with the idea of splitting our dues up by semester, so for august-December we only had to have paid $20 to wear jeans on Mondays, and we will pay our second half (if we decided to split it up) in January to earn jeans for the spring semester. I am perfectly agreeable to voluntarily paying into this fund, but our “reward” (wearing jeans on Mondays) makes it very obvious who didn’t pay. It feels awkward when someone comes to school on a Monday at the start of the school year wearing professional dress and someone makes a comment like, “Girl, why are you so dressed up!? You know we can wear jeans on Monday, right?” which almost always leads to “did you pay your sunshine dues yet?” and sometimes, people can’t afford this in the budget. My first year of teaching I didn’t pay sunshine dues because an extra $40 just was not in the budget. I felt sooo uncomfortable every Monday being one of the very few not wearing jeans.  That same year, I stopped by the library at lunch to enjoy food that was catered for us and one of the committee members who was serving the food stopped short of putting food on my plate and goes “wait, did you pay your dues? I don’t remember seeing your name on the list.” Needless to say I was mortified. To be fair, it being my first year, I hadn’t put two and two together that food catered by the sunshine committee was because people paid their dues (duh, I know that now and it completely makes sense that I shouldn’t have been apart of the lunch!) so for the rest of the year I brought my lunch on any other days like that which just added to it being obvious that I couldn’t afford my dues. Now that I’m established financially, I happily pay my dues each year, but i think my past experience makes me more aware of the stress and classism it can cause. Is that too extreme of me to think? \n\nAll in all, I love the idea of the committee, and we need it to keep morale, but sometimes I feel that it can cause more of a divide.",

None of the other students are willing to say anything about it or when their classmates could be back. It's devastating. \n\nWe're collecting these pieces and going to put them together to share the impact of the ICE raids on our communities, and the children they're having real consequences on. Maybe just a gallery to get posted to r/ pics, maybe find a journalist to publish it, maybe eventually a gallery. I'm child of Latino immigrants and I'm angry. It's unfair, it's cruel, it's happening right in front of our eyes. \n\nI won't allow these kids to just disappear into faded memories drowned in booze by traumatized educators.\n\nThese aren't criminals. They're children. They're artists. They don't deserve this. \n\n**What I'm doing about it:**\n\nI reached out to the people in my life who have connections to get tell this story and get it out there. We have access to journalists, PR folks, immigration lawyers, and possibly even some local politicians (here in NY). More importantly I have people who have done these types of projects before, so we can make this happen. \n\n**How you can help:** \n\nPlease connect with the art educators in your life and ask them if they have any pieces left behind by children that disappeared during the school year. Please ask them to hold onto it. \n\nI have an email setup that you can DM me for. We'll collect and coordinate info and art there. If I can find the time or a volunteer to help setup a website, I'd appreciate the help so we can make the message easier to get out there. \n\n**If you're an art teacher:** My plan is to collect these works, scan them in, and have a photographer who can also take photos of the pieces. I'll bully some friends into donating shipping costs if we get to that point. As of now I don't have any intention of going public with the information of the teachers or students. That said, if you're willing to speak about your experience. Please please let me know. I have a journalist friend who can do a quick interview and intake with you so we can get your story. \n\n**MODS:** if there's a way to keep this up, please let me know. I'll work with you on that.\n\n# EDIT: the email is [emptyclassroomseats@gmail.com](mailto:emptyclassroomseats@gmail.com)",

Either way, it's getting pretty damn ridiculous in my opinion. I think the kids and their parents need to be held accountable every time they do it. \n\nIt sets us, as teachers, back every time we got to miss a day of school.

My rule is: hands down, ears open, wait until we’re all ready (because my class has the energy of a double espresso).

They stay off their phone for one class and ask for one, they get to class on time and ask for one, etc. \n3) The students have begun gambling their dog dollars with each other, and it's becoming more common by the day. \n\nMe and a few other teachers have told admin, though I'm not sure if they're going to do anything anytime soon.

      "text": "We are constantly hearing about how literacy is declining, how the average American can't read at a 6th grade level, etc. However, with college admissions getting more competitive, it seems that kids would be undertaking more education and thus becoming more literate. \n\nI am a high school junior starting college this fall and, in order to be a competitive applicant, have taken some 7 APs plus 15 dual enrollment classed on top of my regular schedule. It seems this is pretty common, although most people take fewer advanced courses. Sure, these classes aren't that hard---but they still require pretty high-level functioning. \n\nSo how is America getting less smart if school is getting harder? Is it just that people angling for top colleges are a very small minority?",

Seriously, the kids are great; I love my kids. It’s about four of my parents who are driving me insane.\n\nThey email me constantly over every little thing. They question my judgment about everything. I cannot please these people. Everything I do is wrong.\n\nThey have a text thread that is used solely to badmouth me, and recently, they took their complaints up a step and had a meeting with my principal and my school administrator. My poor principal (he’s great, by the way) had to come in ON WINTER BREAK for a meeting with me to see how I planned my lessons because they insisted he do so. As a private school, the parents have a lot of influence.\n\nI’m trying not to care that this is happening and keep giving my all to my kids, but I seriously want to cry whenever I think about it. I know I’m not perfect, but I am trying so, so hard, and I keep being met with angry emails and disrespect for my professionalism.\n\nWhat should I do? Any advice at all would be greatly appreciated.\n\nUPDATE: I quit.",

I teach in Massachusetts, which is known for its high quality education and I'm in a fairly well regarded school district. A number of my classes are AP or honors level, but it doesn't matter the grade or rigor level, so many of my students don't know how to read. They can recognize familiar words, but I notice when I ask for volunteers to read aloud when they get to an unfamiliar word they either pause and wait for me to tell them what it is, or \"guess\" a word that doesn't make sense in context. I'm wondering if this is the result of these kids learning to \"read\" using the Lucy Culkins method (which my district did use when they were in elementary school)? And more pressing, I'm stumped for how to help them learn to sound out words. I am well versed in teaching them to source a historical document, corroborate and contextualize texts, etc. but I'm not a literacy teacher. I'm tempted to say \"sound it out\" like my kindergarten teacher would have done to me, but I'm not trying to embarrass them further. It really gets in the way of their deeper understanding of documents. Anyone else seeing this and/or have tips?",

A suspect is in police custody.\n\nAround 10:20 a.m. ET officers from multiple agencies and emergency personnel were dispatched to the school after calls of an active shooter. About an hour later, the school was evacuated, with students being released to their families.\n\nYet another good reason to leave the career field. Some psychopath with a gun deciding to ruin the lives of hundreds of people. How much do you want to put the politicians will turn this into a political issue. Arm students and teachers or Bibles in the classroom.\n\nUpdate: shooter was a 14-year-old male student and the victims are students and two teachers.\n\nBoth teachers work in the math department. \n\nThe boy was interviewed last year when he was 13 years old by law enforcement based on threats he had posted online. The father admitted to law enforcement that they had firearms, but said his son could not access them.

There would be other hygiene products in the drawer, such as bandaids, baby wipes, deodorant, etc. There are no female teachers in my hallway, so no one that’s nearby and convenient to go to. My wife helped me pick out what kind. This comes from a place of having worked as an EMT before pursuing education and understanding that periods are a thing, and nothing to be ashamed of.",

In response, her mother and I Iogged into her computer and discovered that she has repeatedly used ChatGPT on various assignments over the past few months. In the most extreme cases, she literally uploaded a photograph of a printed assignment and asked for the chatbot to analyze it and provide answers.\n\nWhen we confronted her, she admitted doing this but used the defense of “everyone is doing this”. When asked to clarify what she meant by “everyone”, she claimed that she literally knew only one student who refused to use ChatGPT to at least occasionally cheat. Our daughter claims it’s the only way to stay competitive. (Our school is a high performing public school in the SF Bay Area.)\n\nWe are floored. Is cheating using ChatGPT really that common among high school students? If so - if students are literally uploading photographs of assignments, and then copying and pasting the bot’s response into their LMS unaltered - then what’s the point of even assigning homework until a universal solution to this issue can be adopted? \n\nStudents cheated when we were in school too, but it was a minority, and it was also typically students cheating so their F would be a C. Now, the way our daughter describes it, students are cheating so their A becomes an A+. (This is the most perplexing thing to us - our daughter already had an A in this class to begin with!)\n\nAppreciate any thoughts!\n\n(And yes, we have enacted punishment for our daughter over this - which she seems to understand but also feels is unfair since all her friends do the same and apparently get away with it.)",

The impulsivity, the “anything for a laugh” attitude, the complete lack of self and social awareness. I take a lot of preventative measures to avoid issues like this.\n\nWe’re doing a music technology unit. They use various online platforms to compose and arrange music. I do a project where they create  and illustrate an original cartoon character, write a brief backstory about the character, compose a theme song for the character, and then reflect on how the theme song supports the backstory and personality of the character. It’s usually very well received and students have come up with some really fun and creative characters over the years. I emphasize that their character and story must be school appropriate. Students tend to veer towards superheroes and villains so I always so no violence, no weapons. If you want to make a superhero character, maybe the superhero fights crimes with donuts. I emphasize being goofy and silly over violent. I made an example project that I show students where my character is a cat/unicorn hybrid superhero that subdues bad guys by singing to them. \n\nI guess I was stupid to not also set the expectation of not being fucking racist. I had 5 (FIVE!) different students in a class create characters with blatantly racist depictions and tropes. The stupidest and most offensive stereotypes. I was appalled. \n\nI have never felt the need to approve ideas before letting them start to draw and write their story because the characters have always been innocent. The expectations I set ahead of time were clear enough. These kids are dumb, didn’t care, or both. From now on, I will make them submit a character proposal for approval before allowing them to continue with the project and I’ll also set the expectation of not being fucking racist but what the actual fuck. \n\nFuck. \n\nEDIT: since people are asking, here is one of the backstories and personality traits, copy and pasted right from Google Classroom. Their backstory must be a minimum of 3 sentences (yes, low bar, I know) and I have them come up with 3 main personality traits. I’m not copy/pasting all 5. This was the worst one, in my opinion. \n\nBackstory: Migatron came from the hood always strapped until this BBC Big Black Car came up and\nkilled his freind so he tracked them down he got revenge and he slowly took them down one\nby one and soon took on the entire universe.He ended up making a song with his gang\ncalled Migas in parris.But from da hood they call him big randy.\n\nPersonality traits: He loves KFC and watermelon with a side of grape koolaid.

      "text": "Gen-Ed and ELA teachers, how confident are you in your peers' reading abilities? \n\nI just came across a post on another sub (crossposts here aren't allowed) which paints a stark picture of the very adults who are teaching our next generation to read. Remarkably lucid [synopsis from Tumblr here](https://www.reddit.com/r/CuratedTumblr/comments/1kldgb6/illiteracy_is_very_common_even_among_english/), and also a solid discussion from r/ CuratedTumblr in the comments. Original research study [here](https://muse.jhu.edu/article/922346), for completeness.\n\nSummary:\n\n* Cohort of 85 undergrads from Kansas universities, mostly upperclassmen. ACT scores just above the national average for matriculating students. Roughly 50/50 English and English Education majors. \n* They were asked to read the first 7 paragraphs of Dickens' Bleak House and demonstrate understanding of the passages. \n* **58% failed completely, and only 5% were judged proficient.**\n* Data from 2015, so pre-COVID and pre-AI. \n\nAnd here's my favorite bit of the analysis:\n\n>i have seen this repeatedly, too - actually i was particularly taken with how similar this is to the behavior of struggling readers at much younger ages - and would summarize the hypothesis i have forged over time as: *struggling readers do not expect what they read to make sense*. my hypothesis for why this is the case is that their reading deficits were not attended to or remediated adequately early enough, and so, in their formative years - the early to mid elementary grades - they spent a lot of time \"reading\" things that did not make sense to them - in fact they spent much more time doing this than they ever did reading things that did make sense to them - and so they did not internalize a meaningful subjective sense of *what it feels like to actually read things*.\n\nWhat say you, educators?",

      "title": "4 Interviews Today. Breakfast Was Disappointing.",
      "text": "Today I had four interviews scheduled for various elementary school level teaching positions. But first, I was provided my breakfast from HR. Today it was disappointing. Today I was fed a McDonald’s Big breakfast with pancakes, 2 hash browns, and my green Monster. I’m not knocking a free meal and I will say that some of McDonald’s breakfast items are pretty good (like the McGriddle sandwiches and the hash browns), but this is a let down compared to Monday and Wednesday’s breakfasts. \n\nMy first interview was for a kinder position. I had to do a double take on this candidate and make sure she was old enough to teach. She looked 14 years old. Like, literally she looks like a 9th grader. However, she is 23 years old. She student taught 6th grade. Her dress and appearance were ok. She did have some good sized gauges in each ear. Like maybe 3/4 of an inch. I don’t hold that against someone though. She also had some tattoos on her knuckles that spelled “Stay” on one hand and “True” on the other. She also had a lot of other visible tattoos on her neck (spider), hands (roses), and forearms (roses and a skull). I believe people are free to do with their body what ever they wish so I don’t hold it against her. I don’t knock tattoos (since I have several) UNLESS they are offensive. She did just ok on the questions. She really struggled to answer some of them though or she gave very generic answers. I put her in the maybe pile. She did her student teaching here in the district so I want to talk to her mentor teacher and get her feedback. I’m just not sure about her. She just didn’t wow me. \n\nMy second interview was great and tried to bribe me. She was interviewing for a 6th grade position. She was punctual, dress professionally, and brought in homemade rice crisp treats. First candidate to ever bring me a treat at an interview. This candidate was sharpe. She nailed the questions and had great descriptive stories/examples. When she described a situation, you felt like you were in the room with her. Not only that, but she has 6 years of experience teaching the 6th grade level. She left teaching for 2 years to be with her child after she gave birth. This woman had a lot of energy and great ideas. I recommended that HR make her an offer. By the way, the rice krispy treats were AMAZING.\n\nMy third interview was very short. She was there for a 6th grade position. She was dressed up in a nice women’s suit. She also came in an had a chip on her shoulder. She acted and spoke like she was better than us. She had been an assistant principal for one year last year. It was obvious she just wanted to be admin again. She even asked us in the middle of the interview if we had any admin position open. She even said that if she was hired, she would be happy to fill in if her principal and asst. principal were off campus at meeting or called off sick. When I asked her scenario questions, she always answered them from an admin point of view. I didn’t recommend her because it’s obvious she doesn’t want to teach and is just looking for a job until she goes back to admin. \n\nThe final interview was for a 4th grade position. She came in looking smart and had a lot of energy. She is currently an EMT who is looking to make the move to teaching. She did really well with answering the questions and she had glowing letters of recommendation from her mentor teacher and university supervisor. In fact, it turn out I used to work with her mentor teacher. She was very profession during the interview and seemed eager for the job. My gut told me she’d do well so I recommended her to HR.\n\n\n\nSo that was it for today. I have only 3 interview set up for Friday, but a lot for Monday.",

I’ll give an example that didn’t affect me all that much but was decently interesting. In my senior year of high school, my biology or some other science teacher had us watch a documentary on extraordinary creatures that could live in the most extreme environments. One of these creatures was a single cell organism that could survive in lava. I found it extremely fascinating and asked a professor at my university about it in passing. When I told them about it, they looked genuinely confused and told me that no living creature could survive at that temperature. I later did more research and concluded that the documentary was completely false. It’s a bit odd as far as misinformation goals go since I can’t honestly see a reason for someone misinforming someone else regarding this, but it made me interested in what else is taught wrong, and why? Is it just a mistranslation of something someone researched? What did you get misinformed on? Was it just a joke you might have taken too seriously? I’m interested to hear what you all have experienced.",

      "text": "Edited to include abstract.\nAlso, I'm intrigued by the idea that teachers self-perception seems to be a handicap in actually making policy progress. This was shared to me by a professor friend who teaches and studies labor history. His response to my comments was simply \"send it to your union\". No idea what tangible ideas could come from it.\n\nhttps://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/the-economic-and-labour-relations-review/article/us-teachers-overwork-and-perceptions-of-worktime-reductions-evidence-from-massachusetts/E314008A1BB8445D946B434E73E43E06\n\nUS teachers, overwork and perceptions of work-time reductions: Evidence from Massachusetts\nPublished online by Cambridge University Press:  14 May 2025\n\nKatherine A. Moos\n and\nNoé M. Wiener\n\nAbstract\nThis study is based on four focus group interviews with public school teachers in Massachusetts about reducing work hours as a means of improving their working conditions. Our analysis documents a common experience of overwork, expressed in the focus groups and measured by time-use diaries. Teachers reported long work hours and a significant ‘mental load’—both of which affect teachers’ quality of life, physical and mental health, relationships with their families and desire to keep teaching. While participants were union members and therefore experienced with collective bargaining, most approached the issue of overwork as an individual problem that must be solved by setting and maintaining personal boundaries. Focus group participants differed in their assessment of a hypothetical policy proposal for a work-time reduction without a loss of pay for teachers or instructional time for students. While generally supportive of the goal, participants questioned whether contractual reductions would correspond to actual reductions in hours worked. Teachers expressed both eagerness to include work-time reductions in future contracts, as well as scepticism that their districts had the fiscal space or political will to achieve this goal. Discussions revealed that teachers’ professional identities as hard-working and caring ‘perfectionists’ who are responsible for their students’ learning, inhibited their policy imaginations with regard to using collective bargaining to win them additional leisure time.",

      "title": "To Parents: Why removing the DOE is bad for your kids too (a story).",
      "text": "**To parents who are on the fence, maybe Right-Centrists, etc... I want to explain to you why the DOE being potentially dissolved is bad for all children, so I'd like to introduce you to 3 students: Tim, Billy, and Jessica.** \n\n**Let's say all 3 of these children are in the 4th grade when the DOE is dissolved, to make it easy.** \n\nTim and Billy go to the same school (ABC school), and live near each other. Jessica lives in the town next door, and goes to a different school of similar academic standing (123 school). Both ABC and 123 schools are in the same school district.  \n  \n Tim is your \"typical, all-American boy\" who plays baseball and soccer, video games, reads just a tiny bit below grade level, has hit almost all of his academic and developmental benchmarks, loves Marvel superheroes, and has a typical love-hate relationship with school (he'd rather be in gym class most of the time, but he thinks his science class is fun when they get to do hands-on experiments). He says he wants to be a paleontologist one day and maybe discover a new dinosaur. \n\nBilly, who is friends with Tim, was referred for special education services when he was in the town's universal pre-K program, and was struggling with early developmental benchmarks, especially in reading and attention-holding skills. Billy has an IEP and his parents work hand-in-hand with the child study team at ABC school, and it has gone very well. Billy has been provided with an e-reader to help him, and his classroom (which he shares with his friend Tim) has a special education teacher (co-teacher) in the room at all times to help not only students like Billy, but all students in the classroom. Billy wants to be a video-game designer when he grows up. \n\nJessica is very similar academically to Tim, but she spends much of her time enjoying afterschool academic-focused clubs. Jessica wants to be a prosecutor when she grows up. \n\nOn XYZ date, the Department of Education is dissolved by the U.S. Government, with no clear alternative solution. Some applaud the reductions in federal spending and expect tax cuts to reflect the reduction in federal spending. \n\nAs the 3 students approach the beginning of their 5th grade school year, ABC school's budget is thrown into crisis because without DOE title-1 funding, the school has lost about 15% of their funding, most of which went to special education programs. In order to balance the budget, the special education teacher who was supposed to be in Tim and Billy's new classroom was not renewed...in fact, most special education teachers were issued non-renewals, along with some general education teachers, which has led to Tim and Billy's class increasing by about 30% (from 22 to 30) from one year to the next. The teacher in this classroom does not have a special education certification... in fact, most \"teacher universities\" begin reporting that the already-low admission rates for special education programs have dropped even more, because with special education being effectively defunded, there's little reason for anyone to pay the money to take classes for the extra certification (or to have it as their primary cert). Billy significantly struggles without the additional support, and Tim becomes frustrated with how much additional fundraising he needs to do to support his soccer and baseball teams being able to compete in state tournaments. \n\nAs Billy's grades continue to freefall, Billy's parents do what they must: They sue the ABC-123 school district for violating their child's IEP. While the school district contends that they are not doing this maliciously, but instead because without DOE title-1 funding they cannot afford it, because Billy's rights are protected by various state, federal, and U.S. Supreme Court cases, as well as special education legislature, Billy's family wins the lawsuit, and are compensated with millions of dollars. Billy's parents decide to take that money and send Billy to a private school that caters to affluent children with special needs. Billy is upset because he misses his friends and the commute to school is nearly twice as long, but his parents are happy that they have the opportunity to get their son's needs met, and see their win in the judicial system as proof that the American system still works. \n\nThe lawsuit sends a shockwave through the already reeling ABC-123 school district, and in order to prevent against other potential lawsuits from parents of special education students, ABC-123 school district is forced to consolidate as many schools as possible in order to make sure the legally required amount of special education instructors are in every classroom, because no matter what they say, those children are protected by institutions as high as the U.S. Supreme Court, and their opinions and excuses don't matter unless those cases are somehow overturned. In order to make this work, ABC school's student body must be bussed to the neighboring school (same district), 123 school. Any teacher with a special education certification who still somehow exists from ABC school is transferred to 123 school, while most other teachers are let go. While it's only the town next door, Tim's commute to and from school doubles. \n\nAt first, Jessica is excited to see her school's student population almost double... she is an extroverted young lady and sees an opportunity to make many new friends. She enjoys how crowded the hallways are, and she doesn't even mind that \"for now\", she has to share a desk with one of her best friends. Her class size is now 35 students, which is almost double what it had been last year, but she is optimistic and hopeful that more people will mean more fun. \n\nTim, however, is a ball of anxiety. He's never been around so many other kids, and he gets no relief, as whenever he goes home with lots of homework (because he's struggling to complete it all in the crowded, loud classroom), he has to listen to his parents argue. Tim's parents bought a home a little outside of their budget in the town ABC school existed in because they heard how good the school was, and they saw it both as an investment in Tim's future, but also as a financial investment. Tim's father points out that since the school closed, property values in their neighborhood are rapidly dropping (because good schools are a huge contributor to property values), and the family is slowly going \"upside down\" on their property value. He's also hearing troubling reports of many families opting out of sending their kids to school at all, claiming to be trying \"homeschooling\", but he sees many teenage kids running around causing trouble throughout his day when he's working in the neighborhood area. Tim's mom suggests maybe they should homeschool their son due to his plummeting grades, but doesn't know how she could do it when both parents already work full time. \n\nJessica and Tim eventually meet each other in their collectively gigantic, 35+ student classroom. Jessica feels bad that Tim is struggling so much academically, and offers that Tim comes over a few days a week after school to her house (with parental supervision) to study with her. While Jessica is proud of herself for doing this, she also misses out on joining the 123 school debate team because it would conflict with her sessions with Tim. Similarly, Tim can't justify trying out for baseball in the spring, because he needs all of the help he can get just to make sure he doesn't have to repeat 5th grade. Both students say they're glad to have met each other, but both wish things were \"back to normal\" too.\n\n**This might seem like a \"nightmare situation\", but it's also a potential reality in a lot of communities without a DOE. As you can see in this example, the student who arguably had the \"best outcome\" was not either of the Gen-Ed students, but arguably the Special Education student.** \n\n**While it is true that big portions of special education are funded by the federal government through the DOE, that doesn't mean that removing the DOE can remove special education. Special education also exists in litigation and legislature at federal, state, and local levels, and because of this, you CANNOT have a public school district without a functioning special education program. Your local public school district can be #1 in the country, but if it does not comply with existing litigation and legislature for special education, it cannot exist. In order to make up the deficit, school districts will either have to make large cuts to their infrastructure and programs (as I demonstrated in my story), or will have to push for more tax money at the local level (likely in property taxes).** \n\n**Furthermore, school systems have a direct impact on property values in America, because of the way school districts are currently funded. Even if you don't send kids to school in your community, the \"success\" of your local district impacts how much your home is worth. This is also true regarding crime, and there are many, many research projects that have concluded that lower school performance often leads to increases in crime, which also leads to property values plummeting.**\n\n**If you think the DOE is a corrupt, B.S. institution, guess what? Most teachers feel the same way. It is FAR from perfect, but reform of the DOE is a far better option than removal.**\n\n**For all who read this far, thank you for coming to my TedTalk.**",

      "text": "I'm currently in an Asian international school (taking IBDP right now), and is probably going to USA for my university degree. I'm very interested in education and is willing to be a teacher in the future. However I've heard parents and counsellors in school telling me that it could be hard for me to find a job if I take education major as an undergraduate. Here are the main reasons:\n\n\\- If you wanna be a teacher of a specific subject, schools usually expect you to have a degree that is related to the subject to some extend. (like if you wanna teach high school physics you should at least have a math degree for something?) for me i haven't decide what subject I want to teach yet!\n\n\\- Most schools don't offer education major for undergraduates. The exceptions I know are NYU and Vanderbilt (well i doubt if i could get in there lol).\n\nJust writing to kindly ask for your opinion. What major did you choose in university and what's your opinion on these to problems mentioned above?\n\nI would also like to know whether or not Asians are \"liked\" when American schools are recruiting teachers? Or should I consider go back to Asian after graduation? I actually have got a massive amount of questions regarding teaching and education like do you think AI would replace teachers someday?",

      "text": "I'm a math teacher in China, and I used to teach in several bilingual schools in China, the courses I taught were mainly A Level mathematics and further mathematics.\n\nIn the schools I worked at I met many good students who were hard-working and motivated for academic courses, and they have aspirations for qualified university education and accomplished life. \n\nBut there are examples that some students were not excelled in academic study, but they also got admitted into good universities in the US and other countries or regions like the UK, Austrilia and HongKong. That is an amazing thing.\n\nIn my impression for university application, you have to receive good results in examinations and language tests, that is a necessary condition to be considered by admission committee. But I saw some examples that the students got very low A-Level scores(below C), some even didn't have complete A-Level scores, they all got admitted into famous universities. \n\nOne student I taught didn't pass the Cambridge International AS Level math exam for the first time (Scored U) and retake the exam and got a D, and when he studied A2 Level math courses with me, he couldn't solve many problems correctly. I don't know what result he got in the A2 Level test, but I think he wasn't able to pass the Cambridge A2 Level math exam. And his scores in school test was also very low. But he was admitted into a business school of a prestigious university in New York. That university was considered as a prestigious university for math and scientific research because many excellent scholars are working there. I don't know what was the reason for this university to admit him.\n\nI asked one of my colleagues from UK: Do you need to get complete A Level results to apply for universities in UK? He said \"Absolutely\". Though I didn't ask do you need to get good results in these test to be accepted, but I think the answer should be \"Yes\". Although grades is only one component to be considered in the university application, but it is a necessary requirement for students to show their potential to excel in the future study. And it is also unfair for those students who paid much efforts to study the courses and got good results. If students could be accepted by college without having qualified test results, then students who were working hard will lose their motivation for study.\n\nWhat do you think?",

      "text": "I'm a fourth-year special education major in Michigan, U.S. \n\nFor context :*For a 'reading problems' class I'm doing two case studies on reading and literacy, one being on a lower elementary student.  Today I met with the student (kindergartener) for the first time 1 on 1.  Being a little, the conversation with them was all over.  A few times in the conversation they mentioned being scared of their father, their father 'whooping' them, grabbing them by the ear hurting him, and at the end when asked if he wanted a sucker looked excited but when I told them they'd need to put it in their bag for home they got scared and said their dad would get 'super mad'.  While saying these things, the student would watch my hands and if they saw me write anything they would get scared asking me if I was writing it down, begging me not to while saying they were 'kidding'(which I just said I was writing something else), saying their dad would be angry at them, and that they'd get in a lot of trouble.  Before this, the kid looked content and was having fun coloring/drawing, but when they said that and saw me write they looked terrified and like they were gonna cry.  After sending the little back with their class, I spoke to the teacher on the side. Now I'm messaging with one of my professors who works at the school about next steps and trying to figure out if I'd be considered a mandated reporter in this situation or not.*  \n\nThis is a private school that I also work at 2 afternoons a week for an afterschool program.  I also am a registered sub through EDUStaffand summer school paraprofessional (in a different district).   I'm not sure if that would affect the situation or not since I was at the school working with the student as a college student for a class.",

The neighborhood is a high crime/high poverty area and also roughly 10% of our students are recent immigrants and refugees.\n\nThe school is charging $75 fees for 8th grade \"graduation\". I'm honestly not even sure what this is for, but it seems excessive. It's not like they're giving them a banquet in a banquet hall (or even dinner). The ceremony is at a local public university and they are not renting or buying caps/gowns.\n\nThe only thing I've found out is \"everyone's getting a t-shirt\". The mood/climate/morale at my school is extremely low and it's very hard to get information from admin.\n\nI feel $75 is a HUGE ask of the parents of our kids and admin just emailed us a long list of students that teachers can \"sponsor\" for graduation fees. Now I feel like teachers are being guilt-tripped into covering the fees.\n\nEdited to add: I appreciate all the responses and I feel validated so many people agree with me that there's something serious wrong with this whole situation. What I've been able to find out: the money is probably mostly going toward the venue (which we shouldn't be having there if the school can't outright pay for it), the kids get a t-shirt and a graduation cap. That's it.\n\nIn addition, if they want to attend 8th grade prom, that's another $75. And the 8th grade field trip (day trip out of town) is $150. Teachers have been asked to sponsor whatever they can towards the long list of kids whose families can't cover all of these exorbitant costs.\n\nAlso, for those of you who feel there's financial malfeasance going on at this school, I couldn't agree with you more.",

      "text": "Hi, I’m a Canadian university student and am currently figuring out how I should organize my classes/if I should take more. \n\nI completed a course that counted towards two minor courses (food/fashion studies), but it had nothing to do with food or food science. I am concerned that if I eventually get hired to do food studies in a school, I won’t be prepared because I didn’t do the classes. But I also know the cooking basics and I am not a stranger to the stove and kitchen. \n\nHave any of you taught foods classes with no prior university education related to foods? Is it a bad idea to not take some of the foods courses? Most of the courses seem to be just science-y and not about actually cooking in a kitchen, but I also don’t know for sure how those classes operate.",

I'm 27 years old by the time I will start my post secondary education i will be 28 years old.\nI want to be a pilot but i also want to go to university because I never been before. My only option to be pilot is to join Seneca college 4 year program.\nBecause it's the only pilot program that is covered by osap. But if i do that before going to university specifically UofT then I won't get a chance to join university after graduating because I have to collect the hours and pay my debt. Otherwise the pilot license will expire. And after that, I might be too old for university. And I will keep working. Because otherwise how will I live and pay my debt and cost of living. And won't get the chance to join university even in my lifetime again. I will be 32 by the time l'm finished. Now if I go to university first and put the pilot training on hold for 4 years. Then I'm afraid that osap won't gave me second loan to be pilot.\nAnd I won't ever be pilot. And I might be to old for it.\nSo l don't know what to do.",

      "text": "Hello All, \n\nFirst off all respect to teachers. Y’all are under appreciated heroes and deserve many pay raises and more respect! \n\nMy situation and question:\n\nFrom what I have read, most teachers do not agree with parents taking their kids out of school for vacations and family trips. \n\nHere is my situation, I am planning a vacation to Universal Studios Orlando for me, my sister, and her son my nephew. This will be our first big vacation. We’ve done other small trips but he is on the spectrum, so traveling has been something we have been working on. I am on the spectrum as well so I’ve been working hard with him on accepting fun and challenging changes to our routines. For context I have lived with him and cared for him since the day he was born. I am the second parental figure in his life outside of his mom. \n\nOur school district has taken away spring break. They took that week and randomly put one off days through the year that students have off. In my opinion it’s stupid and disruptive. I’m sure there might be a good reason, but from what I’ve heard from other parents is that it causes more trouble than good. \n\nNow I know the easy answer is pick another time. Would work great right? Due to health reasons going during the summer break is not feasible. Also, I’m planning on a tight budget as I refuse to go in debt over a vacation. \n\nThey also took majority of fall break. They only get out the Wednesday before Thanksgiving and then are back the following Monday. \n\nWinter break would be the most ideal, however I just can’t afford it. Holidays at the major theme parks are expensive and ridiculously busier than usual. \n\nI have it where I can manage it using a school holiday and he would only miss 3 days of school. As teachers what are your thoughts? Do you think that’s a ridiculous amount of time to miss? For context he usually gets sick a couple times a year but he’s never missed a full week or anything except when he broke his leg(at school and they didn’t call us and tell us until hours after it happened.) \n\nAlso, I know some people will come back and say why not pick somewhere else. To that I say, we are two autistic people of course we’re going to see all the fun Jurassic Park stuff. \n\nI understand that education is so important and routine is very important for people on the spectrum however, we are not annual vacation goers. This is really a rare treat for us. Our other vacations have been during summer and going more north and out of the sun. \n\nAny thoughts, opinions, or even hot takes would be appreciated. I know there isn’t anything they can do with truancy until that limit is met, but are they going to hold this against us or him for going on a super rare special trip for us? I know teachers don’t want to make the packets or anything so I know it’s annoying for teachers sometimes when this happens. However, with taking away two breaks through the year what else are we supposed to do? (you can do don’t go, but again we value giving him experiences and real life changes and lessons, so we will be going) \n\nThank you!",

      "text": "RANT OF IMPRACTICABLE PROPORTION:\n[please don’t tell me to suck it up and get used to it, I won’t.]\nYeah as the tag says…another AI post. I (22 - Secondary English) absolutely abhor Generative AI and the impact I can already seeing it having on those around me (and the environment). I’m currently completing the second phase of my internship in preparation to graduate. In just the four short years I’ve been at college I’ve seen peers’ ability to write, synthesize, envision etc. regress significantly. Every other student at my university heavily relies on it, but back to my point. My placement school for my internship has been near perfect and is the place I was working hardest to secure a position at. Of course it isn’t actually perfect, admin is inconsistent, students are apathetic, and the facility is pretty old. None of those things changed my opinion of the school though because the principal and head of my department have been inspirational. They make connections with students, personally handle matters, and act professionally but without an air of superiority. \nOkay now to the meat. Today was a half day (yay) in which we would have a PD at 1 on AI (oh no). I predicted it would be in favor of AI, but my mentor believed it would be about tips to catch students using AI. Afterwards she said “well I was more wrong than I thought and you were more correct than you wished” which pretty much summed it up. The facilitator of the meeting had us go through several AI engines that she said we should use to generate: images, equations, worksheets, IEP FORMS, lesson plans, behavior plans, and whole lot more junk. I will admit that I did not do a single one of these tasks. I have not willingly used AI (can’t help google AI summaries, but I still don’t read them). You can call me hypocrite for hating AI while never trying it, but the room I was in probably used a bathtubs worth of drinking water just messing around. I don’t want to integrate AI into my lessons, I like the process of learning what works for students throughout the year. I don’t want to generate all my materials, documents, and correspondences. I don’t want to teach my students “how to use Gen AI appropriately”. The facilitator said that if students are creating prompts in Chat GPT they at least know enough to make the prompt. However that isn’t the case for my students, who I have witnessed copy and paste the assignment prompt straight into Chat GPT. It’s surreal to think that in a few decades we’ll be teaching kids to write prompts. No thought synthesis (there are still some good kids but the majority of my classes use AI). It’s scary to see everything change so quickly and my faith in humanity dwindles more each day. I’m glad I at least have my students. They’re good this semester and I’m proud of the work they’ve made. Just wanted to end on a positive note!",

THAT'S RIGHT FOLKS, your scaries will now be merries after a fun round Professional Learning Communities Assessments!\n\n  \n**New Features!**\n\nThanks to our partnership with EdTechSynergy™, all users now have an AI copilot to help craft their comments to make you sound less venty and more helpful. Choose between the following tone presets:\n\n* **Teacher Anxiety™** (default)\n* **Gen Alpha WTF Are they saying** (adds “skibidi,” “gyatt,” or “delulu” without warning)\n* **AdminSpeak** (everything sounds supportive and says nothing productive)\n* **Burnout but make me sound like I'm enjoying it**\n\nFuture tones will be added as requested!\n\n  \n**Teacher Fund Martyrs**\n\nSo many people keep trying to beg poor teachers to fund other poor teacher things. We mods are tired of filtering them and having them scream at us about not knowing the rules so we have taken the admin route and thrown it out the window! So now you can click on any teacher username to buy them coffee for their entire class!\n\n  \n**Virtual-Evaluation is Growth**\n\nTo protect the sacred art of teaching, we now require all teacher verified users to pass the “Are You Still Relevant?” Mod Evaluation System. Sometime randomly at your most inconvenient time, we will evaluate your teaching ability by browsing your user history for 5 minutes.\n\nIf you get **Doing Good** it means we have deemed you stroked our mod egos enough.\n\nIf you get **Needs Improvement** we might not renew your teacher verification contract. Don't fret though, we will write you a generic recommendation letter for you to apply to another education subreddit like r/MartyrTeachers.\n\n**Presidential DEI uninitation**\n\nWe are also going to be releasing some of our mods due to them being brought on board by DEI initiatives. SAD FOR THEM, but SILVER-LINING: that also means new openings! If you are a male teacher of European descent and want to just ban folks put your name in the comments below.\n\n\n\nBetty\n\n𝓣𝓮𝓪𝓬𝓱 𝓣𝓸𝓾𝓬𝓱 𝓣𝓪𝓽𝓮𝓻 𝓣𝓸𝓽𝓼\n\n\n\nDoctor of Situational Pedagogy, University of Southeastern Pensworth Online\n\nM.Ed in Emotional Fluency and EdTech Visualization, Canva Certified\n\nB.A. in Triple-Differentiated Global Mindfulness Instruction\n\n\n\nCopy Manager | Teacher Coordinator and Supervisor | Event Coordinator | Executive Synergy Coordinator | Health and Mental Support Mentor | Director and President of Zen Productivity | Chief Inspiration Officer | Guru of Educational Enlightenment | Lead Ambassador of Laminated Resilience | Certified Trauma-Informed High-Five Consultant | Edfluencer Level 4 | Curriculum Deconstructionist | Google Meeting Whisperer\n\n\n\nRemember, you don’t just work in education. You *are* education. You’re not burnt out—you’re just in your “crispy era.” Keep slaying through the standardized chaos, and we’ll see you in the trenches (now rebranded as “Collaborative Learning Zones”).",

      "text": "In my (post Soviet) country it's a national crisis. There are less than 50 people a year who get teaching  degrees in the whole country .  The average teacher is 55+. Most new teachers don't last  more than 3 years and do it as a side hustle during studies in a different field .  There are atleast 2k vacancies in the whole country, and many aren't getting filled up even years after getting published.  My school has 15 vacancies for next year...  Most teachers don't even have to go trough interviews to get the job... Schools are literally fighting to get physics, math teachers etc etc... Many students already teach full time in the first year of university \n\nSo whenever I see ppl here complain about having to wait YEARS to get a job in their district, getting fired and failing interviews( in my country you  cannot just fire ppl \" just because\", that's why its common for most schools to have the same teachers for 40+ years) and I'm just shocked. It just seems so so different than what's happening locally.",

People with the ability to think critically, do \\*actual\\* research, and effectively communicate their ideas are dangerous to a regime that wants control, compliance, division, and fear. People who have studied history, politics, literature, and philosophy are harder to trick with propaganda. People who have studied the sciences are harder to fool with technical-sounding buzzwords and misleading statistics.\n\nI don't know how we're going to get out of this, but I have faith that we can, and I know that the way out is going to need every ounce of our collective skills and knowledge.

She couldn't do algebra, had no clue about biology, wasn't sure how to help me with sociology, and didn't want to do anything with science. I somehow graduated, but only tried a few college classes before ditching. \n\n17 years later and the lack of knowledge is bothering me. I never knew what to do with my career because I had no clue what a job in medicine even entailed. I couldn't even tell you where major organs are all located. I barely graduated Algebra 1. \n\nAssuming I don't have the knowledge of a recent high school graduate and am going to have a hard time affording classes, I am trying to figure out how to tackle affordably learning what I missed out on and looking into any career fields that interest me. How would people suggest I get started? Is there a better resource to learn high school topics so I can perform better in placement? Just dive into Intro to Biology and see how I like it?

In addition to that, I am highly unfamiliar with how college works here. \n\nList of questions:\n\n1. How do I apply for FAFSA without including parents? They obviously don't have socials, don't live in US, don't support me financially. They practically don't exist from American standpoint.\n\n2. Where do you guys live during the summer break? Obviously without ability to leave home and college kicking out students out of dorms during the break, how you can find a short term student housing?\n\n3. How to calculate total cost of attendance? How to estimate potential aid I'll have when I won't have that income I have now? How would you fill out FAFSA to get as much aid as possible considering you won't have a full-time job during the 1st year.\n\n4. Is it common for American students to move to a state they want to go to school at a year prior to gain residency and pay in-state tuition?\n\n5. Where you can possibly store all of your belongings without using high-cost storage units during living in the dorms? \n\n6. Most importantly, I do have apostile on my high school diploma, but grade system in my country is completely different from the one in US. How can I even determine if I meet GPA requirement? \n\nThanks for all of your help.",

Even the military wants you to have a Bachelors to be a commissioned officer. \n\nI know this might seem petty to a lot of people, but I work tirelessly for my degree. I’ve given up nearly all of my free time to pursue the career that I’ve chosen, and it’s demoralizing to see so many other Americans throw the value of education into the garbage. I don’t want to feed the stereotype of the ‘college educated elite’, but I feel that this way of viewing education is why so many Americans see contrails and think the government is seeding hurricanes and tornadoes.",

But everyone keeps telling me these fields don't pay well, nonprofits are chronically underfunded, social enterprises struggle financially bla bla bla..\n\n\n\nAt the same time, most programs that would actually prepare me for this work are expensive. International development degrees, social entrepreneurship programs, even MBAs focused on social impact. Man, they all cost a bomb.\n\n\n\nSo yeah now I'm stuck in this weird paradox: I need expensive education to be effective in low-paying but meaningful work. How does that math ever work out?\n\n\n\nMy parents are supportive but we're middle class. They can contribute some but not enough to avoid loans. Taking on $50k+ debt to enter a field where starting salaries are like $35k seems insane from a purely financial perspective. As of now I am looking at global programs like Tetr college and scholarships there feel like a way out.\n\n\n\nHas anyone navigated this? Did you:\n\n1. Choose the debt and figure it out later?\n\n2. Find alternative education paths that were more affordable?\n\n3. Start with higher-paying work then transition to impact later?\n\n4. Discover that social impact work actually pays better than expected?\n\n\n\nReally struggling with this decision and would love to hear from people who've been there or can advice",

I would love any advice you can throw my way! I was homeschooled and had a lot of trouble with school. I have a lot of basic knowledge, and while officially I have a high school degree, I didn't get enough education after middle school. So I don't know much biology, have large gaps in history and math, and have a decently solid understanding of English.\n\nNever had that high school experience. I'm worried that when I go back to college, I'll lack the skills to succeed and throw the money that I've worked hard for the past few years down the drain. I also don't know what I want to do in college; I just want to generally expand my mind. So that leads me back to high school.\n\nTo me, it makes a lot of sense. It will be a lot cheaper, give me a lot of general knowledge, and will be a good starting point. But mentioning this, some people think it's a waste of time. And I know that education is never a waste of time, but I do take their meaning. From what I've heard, a lot of people don't learn much in high school because it is mostly that basic information. It will further divide me from the average student, which is something I definitely want to avoid. And it will ultimately hold me back yet another year from getting a degree and later, a career.\n\nI guess I'm just getting cold feet about the whole thing, but I know I can't just stay where I am. Any advice on my situation, tips on each path, or even personal experiences really help. Thanks ya'll!\n\nTL:DR\n\nNot sure whether to go back to high school, slightly overqualified, or go to college, underqualified",

      "text": "I just turned 20 in may. The same month I moved to Texas from Alabama because I was kicked out and living in my car. I came here to Texas to live with my ex-stepfather but it will not work long term whatsoever. I haven't gotten a job yet, I'm constantly rejected from the most menial of positions.\n\nI'm still constantly applying, and if it comes to it I'll just work for the minimum wage, but here is my issue.\n\nMy reason for coming here at all was to try and get into a University here and either enter a study abroad program, or outright attend a foreign university.\n\nI got myself into a community college, and my gpa is a 3.6 so far after two semesters.\n\nBut now, with Trump's Bill, I do not think I can afford any University here in Texas. I rely on snap benefits, and I'm facing homelessness. My dream of going overseas is becoming less of a dream and more of a desperate escape plan. But the goal was always to use my community college gpa to get into a University here, and then use my gpa there to get into a University overseas.\n\nI have no set choice, I've been casually researching Germany only because I am most familiar with it.\n\nBut Germany doesn't acknowledge community college credits(I don't know if they'd care about my gpa either) and I doubt many other countries do.\n\nMy high school gpa is a 2.1 because my mother forced me out of school constantly because of her own beliefs and so I barely graduated. I thought I'd finally gotten past this, I knew it wouldn't be easy, but now it seems impossible.\n\nIf I can't afford university here, or snap is taken away, or I'm homeless again and the shelters lose funding. All I can think of is to drop out of community college and go to trade school.\n\nBut I don't want to live like this, I was kicked out because I want to pursue forensic science, and I stood my ground to achieve this. It feels like everything is working against me.\n\nI am genuinely so lost. I'm trying to have a better future for my sister, to pave the way so she has a easy road to follow. But i'm caught in thorns and I feel like all she'll find is my corpse. How is she going to succeed if I can't?\n\nI started learning German because its the least I can do, but I'll make it clear I am not set on Germany. The UK, Netherlands, etc seem fine to me. I'm sure the international aspects are better for other subs but I'm asking what am I meant to do now?\n\nIs community college worth it anymore? Should I even try to go to a university here or should I take off for another country and then work my way up to an education there?\n\nI feel like I'm running out of time, that if I don't do something I'm going to be poor and miserable just like everyone else in my family.\n\nOriginally I was going to have a 3 month stay in different European countries next year as soon as my passport is prepared, to see if I even like that environment/the culture, but now I don't know if I can even afford that or if I should just be jumping head first.\n\nI feel like I've been born too late, I didn't have enough time to prove myself valuable with school so no country would see me as a priority. I know I am far from the only one attempting to leave the US. I hoped I could attend a school here long enough to make myself just valuable enough, but now I just don't think its possible when I only have so much in savings.\n\nIf I could get organized enough to figure out what I'm meant to be doing then I can do more research on my own, but now I'm overwhelmed and lost.\n\n  \nEdit: I am not expecting miracles! I will work as hard as I have to, and I know that Europe isn't a magical land of success. I want to get out of poverty no matter where I am, and now it seems that an education here won't do it unless I follow the same path my father and his father did, which didn't work.\n\nPlease give me the benefit of the doubt. I am young and naïve about a lot of things, but I know running to another country won't magically fix all my problems at the very least. I just want to understand the correct and most logical steps to take while working for this.",

For a variety of reasons, I was not able to transition back to public school and ended up graduating from them. Many of my peers were in lower grades, not at grade level, or had intellectual disabilities. Because of this, the teachers were unable to teach grade level classes- they couldn’t create a whole new curriculum just for me. I think my education is, practically speaking, around an eighth grade level. I read a lot so I do think that’s helped fill in some gaps and kept me engaged/in the habit of learning throughout the years but I just don’t have much training as a student. I have never written an actual essay, I wasn’t taught much math beyond algebra, I don’t know how to study or take notes. I’m really worried about learning all of this on top of the normal difficulties with college and managing my disabilities(that’s a whole separate thing). I guess I’d just like to hear that it’s possible to start from scratch as a student like this.",

Incredible people, but the owner has told me they're closing when the lease is up as they are retiring. When I first graduated in 2021 I looked for jobs and had no bites, with my degree, or they offered me less pay then I currently get (17$ dollars an hour)- which with a degree felt quite annoying. \n\nSo! I have two years till the lease is up, and am thinking of pursuing higher education. I've asked DeepSeek and they say google certifications will set me apart, but I was thinking of getting my master's, perhaps in Human Resources or something more education oriented in that time. Does anyone know what would help supplement a Bachelor's Degree in my field? I just want to be well prepared for the current job market, as I felt like I was getting no traction with my Bachelors, so any ideas what would be the best supplement would be appreciated.\n\nAlso, I live in SWFL, as I know regions matter.\n\nThanks! 🩷",

      "text": "So, I’m a senior in highschool and I was halfway through my 7th grade year when covid hit and I was doing online school for the next year. I went everyday but didn’t retain much information from it. I dropped out of highschool 2 months into my 9th grade year, then went to in-person school for the second semester. Dropped out again in 10th grade and didn’t go back until my 11th grade year, and I’ve been in school ever since. Moral of the story I don’t have much education, and because I go to an alternative school the education I do have isn’t good. I’m thinking about getting a degree in biology so I can go into healthcare, but I’m so scared about the math and science, I know I wouldn’t get any of it. My school is handing out 8th grade math assignments in my 11/12th grade ‘Trigonometry’ class. Basically the only science I’ve taken since 7th grade is astronomy. Sorry for the novel, but has anyone gone through what I’m going through? Or have any words of encouragement or experience that could help me?",

I'm applying for scholarships to help with financial aid, but the stress of potential debt is weighing on me.\n\nI've been an online student at my current school due to a long waitlist for on-campus housing and i live 3 hrs from there while the one that i can transfer to is right next to me even though they may be more expensive.  I really want to transition to face-to-face classes to connect with others. I worry that online degrees may not be as effective, especially since my major options are limited online.\nAdditionally, I don't have my own car or license, which makes getting around challenging.

      "text": "Basically what the title says. I had (prior to the election) made arrangements to go to college after taking two years to focus on myself after getting out of a toxic situation at home. I am scared shitless right now with everything going on with FAFSA, the DOE, and the Trump administration, as a gay, gender queer person. I also like most college or soon to be college kids am broke, but in additon my family(aka my mother) cannot afford to foot any percentage of the bill for college. So my reliance on fianical aid, is a key part of me being able to go to college. \n\nNot trying to go into too much detail but, because of the situation my mother and I were in with my estrainged father, my grades were poor from high school and I don't qualify for normal admission into the school I will be going to. I have been told by multple sources at the school I want to go to that it shouldn't be a problem, given my situation, at this particular school. However, this does mean that studuing abroad is not really a viable option as much as I would like to leave this country for my own safety. \n\nIf I am being realistic, I know that going to college right now when I have the option to wait, is not an entirely smart idea, however, I know exactly what I want to do, I have worked in and around the field I want to go into and know that if I drop out it won't be because I hate what I am pursuing. I would love to become a Choral Director on some level and college is the only way I can get there in my area. I am not religous so just going to a church to do that isn't an option for me. \n\nSo to restate, should I wait to go to college given the current political climate? If yes, how long? Until Trump is out of office? Just until FAFSA is safe?",

      "text": "I’m a student majoring in elementary education. I spent the years of 18-22  having absolutely no idea what I wanted to do with my life and working low-end jobs, aside from being unemployed during part of the pandemic. It wasn’t until I started working in childcare towards the end of Covid that I realized I loved being around kids all day and decided to go to school for teaching. I had been working as a waitress before lockdown.\n\n I’ve heard from so many people since I started going to college that majoring in education is a terrible idea, and that the public school system in America is going down the tubes. I’ve met many Uber drivers who told me they used to be a teacher and warned me not to do it. I guess I was being naive and optimistic but I really thought Harris was going to win and the system would get major help in the next few years and that they would improve teacher salaries. Now that Trump won I have this sense of impending doom that getting a degree in education when they’re talking about getting rid of the Department of Education is a terrible, terrible idea. \n\nI am also a Pell Grant recipient and I have no clue how I’m going to pay for school if that gets taken away. I already work full time and go to school part time. I have still needed to take out loans every semester so far. I’m feeling so panicked and unsure over my future. If I don’t become a teacher then I’m back at square one and have no idea what other career I might want to pursue. \n\nAre any other education majors feeling the same way? What fields are you guys pivoting to if you’ve decided not to major in education?",

They informed us that as of two days ago, the Federal Government fired all employees who worked on our FLAS (Foreign Language and Area Studies fellowships) scholarship applications.  This means that is there no one left to review, award, or disperse scholarship funds. \n\n We also heard that students who received scholarships from other federal grant programs, who are currently abroad, have been unable to receive the money they had been awarded. Or, if they are receiving their money, they're only getting a small portion of it. \n\n Students currently abroad might be unable to continue their programs without funding from the US government. Students rely on this funding, whether it is for Student loans or scholarships. if that all stops then many students may have to reconsider their position on whether it is worth continuing to stay abroad, let alone continue college. \n\nI am heartbroken by what has happened.  It has been a dream of mine to study abroad since I started college 3 years ago during the COVID-19 pandemic. But without scholarships to help me, I just simply cannot afford the full $9k cost for a Summer abroad.\n\nIf you have anything to share on how the layoffs have already affected you, please do.  The more we speak out the more, the more we can do to keep this situation from getting worse.",

Which I’ll again make up for in more scholarships. She had no idea I was looking at 10k for the semester. She was shocked. Even with the multiple conversations I finally told her, “now do you understand what I meant that a four year bachelors costs 80-100k?” This is also the CHEAPEST OPTION in my state!\n\nShe did the math and is in disbelief. I will not allow my niece to be in crippling debt because everyone around her keeps pushing for a traditional four year. She doesn’t kill herself to make perfect grades. Nor does she need to. As long as she does her 60 credits at a community college, keeps at least a 3.0 GPA, and then transfers. It just bothers me that so many people around me don’t get this. Also the amount of people that look down on community college. I will not go into crippling debt for an education. Also I’m a GED graduate so I could care less about prestige. As long as I get my degree for under 15k, that’s all that matters.",

      "text": "I'm currently a senior in high school. Most of my life, I hated math and was inclined towards the social sciences (history/economics). Since my junior year, however, I've found myself leaning more and more towards math and less and less towards economics (my field of interest), primarily because I discovered my true interest being in constructing patterns (which is readily available in basic history/math v.s. basic mathematics). I also realized that I enjoyed economics because of how I could use data to extrapolate patterns, not the economics itself.\n\nThe problem is, I don't know if I'm good at math. Even at my school, I'm not the best, and I know that I won't be when I go to higher education. Although I enjoy mathematical research and proofs, I don't perform (at the level I want) in exams, ESPECIALLY struggling on questions that rely on memorization, and that seems like the only objective measure of my ability right now. Is it possible to pursue an education in math, with a mediocre math talent?",

      "text": "Hello everyone, a bit of background; I am a returning student who has spent the last 7 years working a trade job and saving money so that way I could attend college and graduate undergrad debt free. I've done an great job of saving were I can and I'm now in my last year of university. I'm a pre-med student focusing on preparing for the MCAT and so I've decided to quit my job and focus on school fully (also to improve my GPA from a 3.2 to a 3.5+). With the help of college grants, my partner, and my extensive savings I'll be able to graduate debt free and have an emergency savings Incase things don't go as planned.\n\nFinancially I'm stable but I am still absolutely terrified of not working and earning money. I've worked many jobs since I was 16 and a lot of my personal values and security comes with my ability to earn an income. I know that this is just a stepping stone in my journey of becoming a physician and I've prepared well and will be alright but I can't help but be anxious about this decision. I find myself constantly checking my bank account and checking my budget to see if there are any more places I can cut down spending. Has anyone gone through this? Or have any similar experiences to help calm my nerves?",

      "text": "My son is heading to college this year, and the total cost for four years will be approximately $200,000. I don't have the financial capacity to cover this entire amount myself, as I'm still paying my mortgage and face potential job insecurity in the coming years. Therefore, I plan to discuss with my son the shared responsibility for funding his education. Specifically, I envision that upon graduation and employment, he will contribute to repaying a portion of the educational loans. Regardless of the financial arrangements, I want him to know that I will always be there for him, offering my love and support throughout his college journey and beyond.\n\nTo facilitate this discussion, I am preparing to explain the tuition costs and illustrate the repayment implications over 10 to 20 years using a loan calculator.\n\nRegarding sharing the loan repayment, I've considered a few approaches and would appreciate your insights or experiences.\n\nMy initial thought for distributing the financial responsibility is a more approximate example: Grandparent $50,000, Parent $100,000, and Son $50,000. This breakdown is subject to change based on my financial capacity at the time. I anticipate taking out a loan in my name and making monthly payments until my son graduates. At that point, depending on his earning capacity, we would share the monthly payments. This would mean that if I retire or experience a period of unemployment, my son would need to assume full responsibility for the loan. Furthermore, once he achieves financial success and earns more than I do, he should take over the complete loan repayment.\n\nAny advice on how to effectively discuss this \"shared responsibility\" for repayment with my son would be greatly appreciated.\n\n\\---- added below\n\n4/12, 10am: He wants to go to Purdue (out of state), as Undecided (Exploratory) but is interested in Math/Statistics related major for now.\n\n4/12, 11pm: Lots of comments to stay 'in-State'.  The only in-State (IL) he got into is UIC Statistics, and it is not cheap. $160k (tuition and boarding) or $100k (tuition and commute from home (40 min by train)), which could be an option.\n\nAnother option could be Iowa State Mech engineering, $120k\n\nI sincerely appreciate everyone taking the time to share their thoughts. Your heartfelt input provides valuable new perspectives that I hadn't considered.",

Right now I am prepping for my high school graduation and college apps and I would like to ask whether it is worth it to apply to the US for college in 2024. Assuming I put in the work and get accepted at a US institution, how would it compare to Europe or Finland's college.\n\n* Is financial aid good enough, how costly is an average degree (I am aiming for data science, or electrical engineering, etc.)\n* Living cost, how difficult is it to find a place to live, and how much do you expect to spend in one moth on rent and utilities.\n* Visa requirement, how much do I need to pass their financial requirements.\n* How long do I get to stay after graduation, it hard finding jobs right after I graduate? How hard is it to not get thrown of the US after graduation.\n* Is pursuing a career in the US worth it compared to ones in Europe, are opportunities actually better?\n\nI'd love if you can be as honest and real and possible about the US, I've talked read and been told so many good things about the US, yet I can't be sure of these comments when everywhere are news of layoffs, inflation, rising cost of living, etc. Is pursuing life and career in the US still worth it in 2024? Is the American dream still alive?",

      "text": "Hi everyone!\n\nI hope this is a good sub to post this in. I have had this in mind since my senior year of university. Honestly...I feel like I have gotten dumber. I was doing okay when I transferred to a 4 year, and then socially kind of sh\\*t the bed at college and became a shut in. I think it made me depressed, which made my study and work quality get worse. Add in ChatGPT, and now I can't even tell you the last time I finished a required reading. My last essay was probably a year ago? I miss school, and learning things that aren't related to corporate busywork I do not care about.\n\nI think I am missing a thirst for knowledge. The problem is that I absolutely NEED a classroom setting (lectures, assigned readings, tests, essay questions) and (edit): added this sentence) I need it to be free/accessible through university libraries or the internet. Trying to do this on my own has just led me to procrastinate and now that I am even more worried about our future as a democracy, I realize I realllyyyy need to stay on top of being educated and literate. My friends are likely all smarter than me, I look back on things I aligned with ignorantly and not maliciously, just lacking the knowledge about what I was supporting fully. I feel ashamed, and want to get smarter but I guess I need to know:\n\n1. What level am I supposed to start at when learning something new? This is my biggest question. The issue is I either overestimate or underestimate my level, which leads to me giving up when it is hard or getting bored when it is easy...I also am having trouble with timelines. EX: I have been curious about history but where do I even begin? Prehistoric times? I have been considering just going through a curriculum for like middle/high school kids to refresh my memory but even saying that makes me feel so embarrassed for some reason.\n\n1.1) How effective are podcasts, documentaries, things I can watch or listen to on the go? This would probably be helpful for when I am trying to work or workout and can multitask.\n\n2) How do I stay organized and avoid burnout? I would need to be doing this while also working a full time, demanding, understaffed job. By the time I get home I am usually brain dead so the thought of having to retest myself on 10th grade math is not appealing.\n\n3) Trying to do all of this while trying to apply to grad school the following cycle? Too late for ~~C/O~~ (edit: reworded) application cycle 2025 but in a great position to find letters of rec and figure out what to do. I don't think I have a choice but to go back to school but I am not sure what I would go for or how I would afford it...\n\nI know it sounds crazy to talk about retaking high school classes and grad school in the same post, but I need the refreshers because I am scared of how much education I have forgotten. I used to be semi-good at Spanish and now I can't hold a conversation. I feel like I don't know anything at all and that worries me. People around me are taking 18 units of classes and working and filling out applications and I can't even finish a book :/ I want to do better. Thank you all in advance if you have any advice!",

Since my graduation I've been job to job, seeing what suits me and I think I finally got the right idea, but I'm conflicted. \n\nI want to pursue a career as a first responder, but I'm not sure if a traditional university path or a trade school path is more appropriate for me. I enrolled into community college last year, but I absolutely hated it. Wrong major, overwhelming amount of math and given my work schedule it was a bad experience overall given the boarder-line isolation that comes from online schooling.\n\nI haven't registered for a following semester since, and that being because I think it's best for me to drop out and pursue something better. Specifically, I thought throwing my application to a University at a large city I live in here in the US, as I think I'd qualify. \n\nProblem is, I don't know how the trade-off will be, being 60k+ USD in debt by the time I graduate, probably only fitting a part-time job for most of that journey, finally earning my degree in my mid-late twenties. (Possibly 30's if things go south.) Traditional University seemed real appealing to me primarily because of the social aspect that comes with it. The emphases of extracurricular activites, social events like parties, and just being lumped with a bunch of young and aspiring people like myself sounds amazing. That's what I crave the most. Being 18-21 in the workforce with people who are 30, 40, and 50+ and have their lives more or less figured out is more intermediating and harder to make meaningful connections given the mass differences especially age and maturity. \n\nSo I looked into trade school. Promising training and a lot cheaper with a more hands-on approach which fits my preferred style of learning. But it lacks much emphasis on extracurricular activites, or opportunities to meet new people or social experiences that one can look back on years or decades from now, and it becomes a little disheartening seeing my peers and former classmates from HS on social media getting engaged to their college sweetheart or graduating from x and y and getting their careers off the ground. \n\nSo I suppose my question is; what do you guys on this subreddit think? And what can I do to be a bit more decisive on this matter? \n\nEdit: if it adds to the context, I was a below average student in HS. I was never honor roll, and I my GPA, although haven't checked in years, was maybe at its highest 2.5",

I am at the level, and I would love to go to a D1 school for soccer, but I don’t know if it will happen. I have a few offers, NAIA, D3, D2 coaches to talk to, but nothing really yet D1. \n\nRecently with all the admissions and preparing for it, all I’ve been thinking about is making a really good school for my education because I have amazing grades and extras. But at the same time, my younger self has always wanted to pursue soccer. I still would love so much to play soccer, but is it worth to go to a smaller school, or risk my education to have all that fun? I would love to go to let’s say Harvard, UPenn, for amazing education experience, or Stanford, or go to my family’s UT Austin with some nepotism, or have fun in A&M, or Georgia, OU, big fun unis. I’m so undecided I feel scared sometimes. I fear that whatever I choose, I would have wished to choose the other. A fear of missing out no matter what I choose. But soccer again, playing with new friends having all these amazing guys, traveling, being well known for your school, having success there. But not playing at the level I want? \n\nI just need to hear from other people that’s all I guess, I’m just kind of scared I guess. Thank you guys.",

I love my field, and especially love working with special needs children. \nI will make a note that the kids im currently with are ages 3-6 and not physically aggressive. If they are they’re so small it doesn’t really phase me. I work full time and make about $20 an hour and feel fairly compensated for the work I do. \nI am heavily considering going back to school to get my Bachelors degree. The issue is i have no idea what to major in or what specific career path i want to choose for the rest of my life. I know that within Special Education you can work in ABA, become a speech pathologist, school psychologist, be a Special Ed Teacher, Social worker etc. \nAfter reading a lot of special ed majors posts on here I’m kind of confused as to what careers align with what major.\nI’ve seen several special ed majors say that getting their bachelors in special ed was a mistake and limited them to ONLY working as teachers. \nGiven my background and level of experience what would you recommend someone like myself major in/ do? I honestly would love to get back into school asap.\nAny advice, experience or recommendations are very appreciated. \nThank you!",

      "text": "I (18m) am about to go into my freshman year of college in the fall, and although I got a lot of money in merit scholarships, my tuition will still be almost 40k a year with housing costs. My parents have said all along that as long as I do well they will help me pay for it. However, my parents always like to prove a point or teach me a lesson by taking things away, and usually they only threaten to take things away (like me phone, car, computer, Christmas, being allowed to hang out with friends, a vacation, or being kicked out of the house) but never actually take them away. Usually it turns into every little thing I do like talk with a tone or forget to do something turns into them threatening to take something huge away, but I never thought they'd threaten to not help pay for my college tuition. Today, however, I forgot to do the dishes and they threatened to not give me any money towards college tuition, and that I'd be on my own. This (obviously) has really scared me and I don't want to be financially dependent on my parents anymore because I'm scared they'll decide half way through my education that they don't want to pay for anything, and I'll be financially ruined in the future. I love my parents, but they are honestly really really strict and unpredictable, and I just can't risk it anymore.\nDoes anyone have any tips that could maybe help me not have to rely on them completely for help, or any backup plans that could save me in the future. I can't afford my tuition, and I really want to go, but honestly if I can't figure out how I can protect myself I might just give up on going to college.\nSorry for the really heavy question, but any advice would be greatly appreciated. <3",

      "text": "Hi I'm Summer, I do embroidery. I live on SSI. My boyfriend is getting back pay that might be very high. We can onky have 2k in our account or else we lose our SSI benefits. We wanted to move out but then he changed his mind. We live in a facility that takes care of our needs like food, cleaning, hygiene and therapy/medical. We were thinking about how we'd spend the money. I had recently quit a free college program. I am just too fast for their pace and the teacher kept saying \"right?\" After every sentence which I consider a microaggression on my intelect. So I quit and I didn't have to pay anything. I wanted to still go to school though that teacher just wasn't for me and I don't want one terrible awful teacher to ruin school for me. So I went to the fiancial aid office of the school and was going to enroll in full time classes and try it out. But when I asked if I drop out will I have to pay it back even if I use FAFSA they said yes it wasn't worth the risk. I don't like people correcting me or belittling me. I almost snapped at the teacher when I said cheat sheet and she corrected me by saying guide. I want to go to an art school now not the academic one. Btw it was a humanities poetry class if y'all were wondering. It gave 11 credits in two years worth of school four hours a week. I left on good terms they said I could come back at anytime. If I went back to school I might go back and grit my teeth just to graduate on time. When I do something I go maximum overdrive. My college plan is this so far but it may change.\n\nSchool of choice: Columbia College Chicago \nPortfolio: 10-20 Embroidery bid pieces to win over creative scholarships \nACT/SAT: retake both get a high score and get merit scholarships \nFAFSA/Pell Grant/other similar things \nMENSA:Study and past tests I don't have to do this my first year bc they're open all year but ideally I would do it as soon as possible \nRe-Enroll in huminties program to get 11 credits to graduate \nGo to school full time and try to go in excellerated or/and honors program.\n\nThis is more costly but more risk mire gain right? My bf who wants to pay for it all, yes he's very nice, told me even if I don't go he thinks I could make it in art wo school. We live in Chicago and I am an alumni to a popular art school downtown called Marwen. They're very nice and have a show every year where anyone from the school can sell art. They also gave me tips on where to buy cheap art supplies. They're very good people and at their show it's 50/50 if your work sells. I wasn't really prepared bc I am foolish so I submitted Embroidered pokemon. I priced them at 100$ which my bf says was fair but maybe too low. I want to for the next art fair to submit a huge intricate movie poster Embroidery piece that I could charge at least 1,000 which takes at least 3 months. So art plan is:\n\nAlumni art fair prepare for annually\nStart cold calling art galleries about my art and submit or show up on their door step begging for work.\n\nMy bf says I can do it wo school but I think I need more connections, networking and more education. What do you think is a good idea or am I silly?\n\nP.S. my disability is bipolar schizophrenic and I think my parents want me to quit art and become a librarian bc it helps with the voices and I love reading. I can only work 10 hrs a week one disability or else I lose it. I'm trying to get a job at Starbucks or chipotle currently. Oh and I'm a 24 yro female. \n\nMy day usually:\nIf I'm not going to the library or visiting my family or in some type of therapy \nEmbroidery which takes a long time I might just be better not going to school cause teachers might not understand how long it takes but maybe I'm an ass for assuming\nWatching tv/movies\nWorking out (trying again but I think it's good for my health)\nTrying to study Japanese \nReading books \nDoing a Starbucks quiz for at least 30 mins a day to get ready.\n\nAnyways, Im trying to give as much information as possible pls guide me and help me unfuck my life. Any advice needed like \"you need to respect authority and kiss you're teachers ass\" or \"ur fuckin right summer how dare she correct you just stick to chipotle and do your yearly art show queen\". Please let me know I'm sorry if this disgruntles you. HELP ME",

The kind that everybody has to take in their first few years. Which is a little weird because I'm pursuing an art related degree, which includes little to no mathematics. I tried twice but got nowhere, and I struggled with the required college composition class as well, but not as much. I quite literally am just held back by math. So is it possible to receive a higher education doing only the subject of study you want? If there was something like that it'd be a life changer, I've had to give up on most of my dreams because of how hard I struggled with those classes. I considered trade school but unfortunately I'm not sure I have any valuable experience in any of the trades.",

      "text": "I'm a New Media Interactive Development student at a pretty notable technology institute in the U.S. If my degree didn't make much sense off the title, you can just think of it somewhere in the realm of CS, Web Design, and Game Design. Programming and design principles.\n\nLike many students, I struggled to get a co-op last summer and settled for an unpaid internship held at the college. As a returning college student in their late 20's, I had a bevy of leadership experience in hospitality and was asked to be the Producer for the project, overseeing the development of a Virtual Reality game for the Summer. As a note, this game has been in development for about three years and switches Producer's every Fall/Spring/Summer. It's over and done now and I have satisfied my first co-op credit, but I am very worried about getting a second.\n\nAs a note, I am most interested in backend development and 90%+ of my job applications were for the role of Software Engineer at various companies (not just game studios).\n\nFirstly, while my boss has stated I can shift the title to whatever I want to best fit the job I'm applying for, I am very unhappy with the role Producer as it doesn't sound very humble for a person of my position. It feels very unsatisfactory to apply for a role with a title so high when companies are looking for introductory roles, and in addition *I* don't even feel happy with the title as I still consider myself a student of the craft and am aware I will still be learning new things for many years to come.\n\nSecondly, the job didn't even require that much work from me and most importantly no work in programming whatsoever, which is what I consider my strongest skill set. I attended 9+ stand ups daily and kept general track of the game, made general announcements, allocated certain people to certain roles when it seemed fit, did some light documentation, and ran the public play tests - which may sound like a lot in a sentence but mostly boiled down to me working about 4-5 hours a day *at most* and wondering when my boss is going to figure out that I am not needed for this project to run smoothly.  \n  \nThis went on for the whole term and at the end of it all I received praise from my Team Leads and my Boss, which I feel is unjust as they did basically all the heavy lifting and changed the game to meet the goals my Boss wanted. \n\nSo now as my final year of undergrad starts and I am looking to brush up my resume and start applying for co-ops in September, I am worried I am not only lacking the skill experience and titles that a company would want in a Software Engineer, but also that the experience I have will actively hurt my chances of getting a job I think would actually benefit me for my career.\n\nDoes anyone have any advice or input they may be able to share? I would be grateful.",

      "text": "I am in my sophomore year of college and am planning to transfer and major in Statistics. But my parents have always discouraged education for me because of the culture I grew up in even though I was raised here in the U.S. They don't believe college is important for women and even tried to stop me from going after I graduated highschool. I told my parents I wanted to get a good degree to take care of them financially but they said they don't need my money or degree and my goal should be to get married. The other day my mom threatened me to make sure i dont attend university and even threw all of my textbooks on the ground and said education should not be a goal of mine. I’m still attending school but am severely depressed. A lot of people, especially children of immigrants have family as a motivating factor to go to college and complete their degree. But I don't have that factor, and now dont know why I am in college. I do value education and do value getting a good paying job, however, how much can i live for myself? I want something to live outside of myself but don't know how to use my degree towards that. I feel so discouraged and unmotivated to continue going to school and can't seem to find any intrinsic purpose or drive. Any different perspective can help.\n\nEdit: Thank you everyone for your kind and motivating words and it's made me understand that getting my degree for myself and for my own future and for building myself as a person is reason enough for me to continue going to college. Everyone's kind words has genuinely brought me out of my rut and  I've realized that my life and my choices aren't dictated by my gender but me as a person - I appreciate all the comments :))",

In her letter, the focus was her. I rewrote so the focus was on her experience, expertise and how she would be an excellent candidate for the position.\n\nI honestly don’t know how colleges don’t focus on writing and proper letter composition. And my apologies if I come off haughty but as the product of a Catholic education throughout my schooling, the nuns focused on writing, sentence structure, composition and getting to the he point of the matter in a clear and concise way. \n\nThoughts?

But there are a lot of student events that sound fun.\n\nI think there’s a big part of my brain that is saying “you’re too old. Just go to classes and go home.” Feeling very self conscious about going back to school as a mom. \n\nI know most of this is probably in my head but would love some feedback. Is it weird for an adult returning student to engage in the university events that are mostly younger students? \n\nTIA! \n\nEdit: thank you so much everyone for chiming in.

I ended up getting into my dream career just a couple years out of high school while I was trying to figure out what I was going to do with the rest of my life, including school.\n\nNow it’s 20+ years later, I’m at the top of my field, but our industry has collapsed and it doesn’t seem to be getting better any time soon. So, I’m considering finally getting a degree and then some sort of program to get into another field. But I’ve never seen a day of college, and I know next to nothing about the process. \n\nFirst: I apparently have to get through the General Education courses, which I’m really not looking forward to. I’ve been a professional in an advanced field for a really long time, a board member of one of the biggest organizations in our industry for almost 15 years, and have been a part of countless projects, etc, therein. Going back to the basics here is going to be personally difficult (I don’t do well when I’m not challenged or given “busy work”.)\n\nI also know that I’m not exactly trying to get into some Ivy League school, I just want a viable degree that I can utilize to expand my opportunities in the more “public” sector. So when it comes to the G.E. classes, does it really matter what my grades end up being as long as I pass? Or is there some way to “get a pass” on those types of classes since I’ve already had a long-standing successful career in a major industry?\n\nCurious to hear some thoughts on this. Thanks!",

      "text": "For context, I had to drop out of college three years ago after starting my sophomore year, because almost every class in both majors I tried out (Musical theatre and Psych) required 90% of the work to be done on a computer. I’m not sure why, but I just haven’t been able to handle computers well since they started getting implemented into daily schoolwork when I was in middle school. Proficiency isn’t the issue. Sitting in front of a screen almost all day, almost every day, just severely impacted my mental wellbeing. It took me until very recently to realize that screens were the cause. I used to insist on handwriting all my assignments until I was forced to give up. Burnt out shortly after. \n\nSince then, I’ve waitressed, cashiered, bar-backed, barista-d, and now I unload trucks and stock shelves overnight.\n\nI’d love to be able to find an education and long-term job that doesn’t demand staring at a screen for most of the work. I can handle a good amount of occasional/dynamic screen use at my job, but sitting in front of a monitor for 4+ hours a day is something I burn out of quickly. \n\nMaybe the answer is obvious to many people, but in my experience, even if a certain job doesn’t require a lot of screen use, the education still seems to (which, in my case, makes the job practically inaccessible). I don’t know anyone else who is in this situation. Most people I know seem to get along fine sitting in front of a screen for extended periods. \n\nSo, genuine question: Is there anyone out there earning their degree with little to no time spent in front of a screen? And if so, could you say what and/or where you’re studying? \n\nEdit: yes, I’m aware that screens have taken over everything. I’m looking for something with LESS screens. Trades are an option, yes, just not ideal.",

I'm already commited to a state school, went to the freshman orientation and everything. After going to that orientation, I started to look deeper into costs and realized that I'm completely out of my depth financially. My yearly financial aid is 9000 less than the cost of tuition + dorms. Earlier I thought I'd be fine, I could just get a job in the summer and apply for scholarships. \n\nBut then it's been a month and nobody wants to hire me. And then I found out that scholarships dont get added on, the school just reduces the financial aid given to you. I won a state scholarship two months ago and I only got 7 more dollars in my aid offer.\n\nWith all this, I just don't see how I'm going to pay for college. My parents are very poor and won't be able to help, they have 7 other kids to take care of.

I don't want them to end up like my parents with no career and struggling to make ends meet. \n\nBut I also don't know if its worth it to get into so much debt.

I did well in the classes for my major, but when they'd ask about the grade in my writing class, I'd just lie to them & say I'm passing.\n\nIt doesn't help that they're pressuring me to get good grades in CC so I can transfer to a university. I heard that most commonly college students don't finish associate's degrees in 2 years because they haven't decided on their major, or have commitments outside of school.

Every humanity seems to have little value, unless you study for 10 years and become the very best in your field. I am not good at STEM, never was. And I feel that since I am not good at it then I am doomed. My only choice left is to not study anything then? Or take a risk and try to become a lawyer even with how competitive it is.

He also had 9 kids and a wife that was a homemaker, so it isn’t as if my father was raised in a home that benefitted greatly from that education as they were stretched on resources. He had 2 siblings who managed to get a 4 year degree, but he never even tried and went into the military and then postal service. Neither of my parents went to college and my grandfather died before I was born. \n\nI had zero academic guidance from my family. They didn’t even know what an AP class was when I told them I had been accepted into AP English. I handled everything regarding college selection on my own and was not even very aware of the importance of a college tour - I went by myself on a train to check out a few college campuses and didn’t even know you could sign up for tours and that they ran frequently. I filled out the FAFSA on my own. \n\nI only learned what a first gen college student was after I graduated from college. I immediately believed that I fit the definition. As a nonprofit worker in the education space, I often contributed to conversations around the challenges of being a first gen college student to offer feedback on processes or suggestions for additional supports.",

      "text": "I don't technically need student loans for this year (or the next) as I do have enough money on hand saved up. The deal we agreed on is that I'll have to pay up to a certain amount every year for my education, and the rest they'll cover. My family is upper-middle class and has no problem paying for my education. In fact he's putting my half-sister through law school at the moment. (I feel jealous towards her because she never needed to pay for her own housing/tuition at my age; I'm pretty sure she's also not the one paying for law school.)\n\nThe problem is that my dad is pushing me to take loans because he thinks it'll teach me how to manage money. I'll hopefully go to medical school too, which he says I'll need loans for sure to afford. He's saying that I need to be financially literate and prepared for the future and that taking out student loans will help with that, and I disagree, because it's, well, money wise a very financially illiterate decision. I'll just be throwing money away in interest. Also, I don't want to manage monthly payments and whatnot. I'm terrible that managing money, all I want is to just hand it over and be done with.\n\nI've been emphatically warned by loan entrance counseling to not take out any loans that I don't need. I told him and my mom that I intend on rejecting my unsub. stafford loan financial aid offer, and he doesn't want me to. I tell him that, since I only have to pay for a portion of my college, I can possibly get by without taking out any loans if I find a part time job. He says that he wants me to focus more \"on the experience\" part of having a job and doesn't want me to work at something not related to medicine just to get money for college.\n\nIs this weird? Is my dad being misguided? I don't want to end up losing thousands of dollars (in terms of interest) to \"learn a lesson.\" He also beliefs that if I take the loan it can be forgiven by Harris if she gets elected. I don't want to take that chance, and I don't think he really knows what he's talking about.\n\nEdit: Rejected my financial aid. Thanks, guys.",

      "text": "I’m an incoming freshman, and to save money ($22k/year), my parents are forcing me to commute. My parents tell me that college is a place to study and do not want me to spend much time on social events, and since they both commuted to college in the past, they believe I should be able to as well.\n\nAlthough I can drive, my dad and I share a car for now, and since it’s on the way to his work, he said he can drive me there in the mornings and take me home at night. \n\nWe live about 15 miles away (a trip takes 30 mins during times with less traffic, but up to 1 hr or more during rush hour). He also said he is willing to drive me home really late at night occasionally if needed (even at 12 am).\n\nI’m honestly really nervous because I’m interested in business, which is a field that requires connections. Also, the school I’m going to has a large emphasis on party culture and other social events. I have some savings and can dorm/rent if I really need to, but it’ll take everything I have, and it’s hard for me to imagine that it would be worth it, but the last thing I would want is to end up alone and to try to rent an apartment after everyone has already settled into friend groups after the first two weeks. \n\nSo for me, the pros of commuting are:\n- comfort (I am a bit germo and sheltered, so it’s hard for me to imagine living with strangers)\n- cost (22k/year)\n- maybe better sleep? I heard sleeping in the dorms can be difficult because of the conditions.\n- less distractions\n\nCons:\n- around 1-2 hours each day of my life gone (at least I can maybe work or sleep in the car?)\n- harder to make friends, be involved on campus, may affect my connections in the future\n- have to wake up earlier\n- unable to participate in housing only events\n\nSo I was wondering, given my dad’s flexibility and the fact that I am not the one doing the soul deadening driving, will I still be missing out on a lot of events and experiences if I commute compared to dorming? Will it be significantly harder to make friends, especially as someone who is more introverted? Would it still be possible for me to attend parties (if I really want to) and have the college freshman experience, or do those end too late in the morning? Should I look into getting an apartment despite the cost?\n\nThanks for any help.",

      "title": "Should I commute or dorm in college?",
      "text": "Not this comming year, but the year after I will be in college, I have chosen to go to a local state school about 20 to 25 minutes from my house. I need to decide if I should dorm or commute.\n\nReasons to commute:\n\n1. it would be cheaper. I will most likely get a full ride to the college, but that only covers tuition. The dorm would be about between $3,370 and $5,890 per semester depending on the housing chosen. I would have to pay anything that scholarships and grants out of pocket and I dont want student debt. \n\n2. I am already comfortable at home and I would have pets and a safe spot. Also because of my autism, if I get overstimulated while dorming i dont know if I'll have a safe spot or not. I also won't have to worry about getting along with a roommate and it might be easier to do my therapy sessions. I also think that by dorming I'll be more exposed to things that overstimulated and upset me.\n\n3. I don't know if I'll be able to make friends. I hear that dorming is great if you have friends, but I haven't made any \"friend\" since middle school and that turned out horribly. I have no problem talking to people, I just have a lot of trouble trusting them enough to ask to hang out and stuff that friends do. I dont think I'll like dorming without friends.\n\nReasons to dorm:\n\n1. I would learn how to function in society. I would have to remember when to do things which would help me for the future, expesually that after college I plan on moving to another country that does not speak English (Japan), so yeah independence might be a kinda useful skill for me to improve at.\n\n2. Some people are able to make friends while dorming. My older sibling is in college and dorms. They have made lots of friends, and they are more quiet than me. They also found a significant other to. I see my sibling hanging out with their friends from college and I want a friend to.\n\n3. I would get more freedom. My sibling, who is 19 still has to ask mom to do stuff when they are at home, but when they are at college they can do whatever they want and mom can't do anything. So if I commute, I will likely have to get permission to do anything or go anywhere even though I would be an adult. I would also have to keep following my mom's rules and I would have to still do things I dont like when im told, like shaving my legs if I commute. I wouldn't have to worry about doing or not doing what Mom says as much if I dorm though. But I might make bad decisions and ruin everything too so... I dont know if this is a good or bad thing.\n\n4. The major that I will do (elementary education) has whole dorms with living learning centers in the college. I dont know exactly how it works, but I think you can choose to live with other education majors and have classes or do activities on education stuff right in the dorm or something. I do think that commuting education majors still have access to this though.\n\n5. It would be more convenient. If I were to commute, my mom would have to drive me because their is only 1 car. And I really dont want to get my own car to drive myself because 1. I can't afford it and 2. I hopefully will be on the other side of the world after college so it's not worth it. My mom is more than willing to provide transportation, but I would have to work around her schedule since their is only 1 car.\n\nI have time to think about it, since I still have to do senior year, but I need to start thinking about dorming or commuting since I know what college I'm going to, my major, and what I want to do after college (plus a plan b if that doesn't work out) I just have the dorming/commuting thing left. I think my main concern is the cost because I know that I'll have to pay back any student loans I get on my own and paying off student debt is hard and it is not a good idea to go to Japan as an ALT (assistant language teacher) with American student debt because student debt is a lot more in America than it is in Japan (Japan just has a lower cost of living overall which also means lower pay) and the yen is weak to the usd.\n\nDo you think I'll be better off commuting or dorming? Both are doable for me i think. Feel free to ask any questions below.",

      "title": "Is community college the better option?",
      "text": "Hi, I desperately need advice about this situation I'm in because I'm terrified to discuss it with my family members.\n\nBasically, I graduated high school last June and committed to a small, private liberal arts college but I ended up deciding to defer and took a gap year. Now, I'm trying to figure out financial aid and I'm realizing that the cost of tuition at this college may not be worth it. I'd have to pay probably about $20,000 a semester, which is due in July.\n\nI MIGHT be able to cover it with student loans and my Mom's help, but I feel so terrible making her help me pay that much money, even though I know she just wants me to be happy. Also, I don’t want to be in a bunch of debt, especially with how this college's degrees are and my concerns about finding a job after graduation.\n\nHere's the choice I'm trying to make: there's a decent community college near me, that only costs about $2,500 before financial aid. If I went there, I'd also be able to keep working at my current job, where one of the benefits is tuition reimbursement. I probably wouldn't need my mom's help at all, besides continuing to live in her house. Also, the cc has a pretty easy transfer process to state schools, where I'd be able to get in-state tuition and probably scholarships—so I'd do community college for a year or two, and then transfer.\n\nI'm mostly conflicted because the college I've committed to still seems to be—despite it's issues—a good school. Also, I'd be getting a more \"traditional\" college experience that way, by living away from home on campus, and entering as a freshman. Mostly though I'm worried my family will be disappointed in my decision to go to community college instead, since they've all always had really high expectations for me. I'm worried they'll think I can't handle \"real\" college, which I understand is stupid, and I know I shouldn't care what they think—but, obviously, I do.\n\nRealistically I think community college is the better choice, but I feel like I've made a bunch of terrible choices in the past—that all led to this shitty situation—so I'm having a hard time trusting my judgment. I just want to get an education without being in debt my entire life, or having to drop out my second year because, even with loans, I can't pay.\n\nSorry this so long, but thank you if you actually read this far, and thank you in advance for any advice you're kind enough to provide!",

They say that 9-5 jobs won't get me far. As a 17 year old that has worked minimum wage job part time for almost 2 years I'm starting to see that. \n\nThe major I was supposed to be picking is the animation program yet animations, 3d rigger, illustrators, concepts artist etc doesnt necessaryly need a degree as I've been informed.\nThe chances of you getting hired mainly relies on your portfolio, social networking and skills as many have expressed. The overall industry is also risky due to the rise of AI generated things evolving. Therefore this option for a major is still a gamble.\n\nI was eying CS major(Computer Science) tho many have indicated that it's not worth it anymore.\n\nI 've asked my friends what theirs is but all they said was they'll either be dead, in the military, homeless and or doing crack in the streets.\n\nPlease I and many others need help  🙏",

Maybe a technical word would need to be clarified here and there, but it's not that big of a deal.\n\nI get that it can be hard to learn if you literally cannot understand a person, but sometimes people are WAY over dramatic about the severity of someone's accent to the point where it's basically just xenophobia.\n\nIf you want to be in business or science, you are going to have to communicate with people all over the world.

      "text": "Hi guys! Im having a bit of a moral dilemma rn. Since the walls in my dorm building are literally paper thin, I always hear the girl in the dorm next to mine crying (almost every day). And when I say almost it’s not an exaggeration. It started around a month and a half ago, and it wasn’t always like this, so I’m assuming something happened pretty recently. I’m genuinely worried for her. I thought it’d get better right after Thanksgiving break but I came back today and she’s crying again….\n\nThere’s no judgement from me at all because I’ve had my fair share of breakdowns 💀. Especially over grades (most often she’s crying about either math or her boyfriend). but I’m wondering if it would be awkward if I checked on her. I genuinely want to make sure she’s alright but I don’t want to make it seem like I’m invading her privacy. Would it be seen as nice or creepy if I asked her how she’s doing? We’re not close at all and I honestly don’t know her name, I just see her pretty often since we live next door.\n\nEdit Post: thanks for the overwhelming feedback! I honestly wasn’t expecting many people to respond so quickly lol. But I think I’m gonna reach out to her. My college is super isolating and it can be hard to form close relationships, so maybe she can use a friend. Next time I see her, I’ll try and strike up a conversation and just ask how’s she’s been doing so far. Thanks again for all of the advice guys!",

      "text": "I am in college right now at the age of 24 and *just* now getting my associate's degree. I had a hard life - had to take a break before going back to school. Being back in school and getting my associate's degree has made me hopeful again. I loved my natural science classes, my psychology classes, etc... I loved being in school again because it was the only thing I was ever good at - and will ever *be* good at. \n\nI went to beauty school when I was 20. I have skills/knowledge in Cosmetic lasers - I loved taking the advanced training courses at my laser institute. I still want to be a medical aesthetician - but the beauty industry is oversaturated right now and it takes a few years to get your foot in the door in this industry. Having a medical background (being a PA or NP) helps tremendously although it isn't required.  My plan for now is to continue going to school,  become a Teacher's Assistant for income, attending trade shows and taking cosmetic skincare courses online to freshen up on my technical skills of this industry. I can go to PA school and become my own medical director for cosmetic lasers. \n\nI talked to my biology professor about going to PA school and she believes I have what it takes - I just have to work on my math skills. Hearing people talk about how useless and expensive college seems to be is discouraging, and with the direction that the Trump administration seems to be going in - I'm weary of how student loan interest rates will turn out.  \n\n  \nGetting my associate's degree has already opened up a door for me despite the \"college is useless\" propaganda people have been spewing - without my degree I wouldn't have this stable job with amazing insurance benefits available for me.",

      "text": "Hey everyone, I'm 25, living in the USA, and I'm completing the last three classes required to get my BA in Psychology. I do heavily regret ever getting into psychology. I had hopes to get into the Master of Business Administration program at my university, but this semester I've accrued 4 thousand dollars for my tuition and I've maxed out my financial aid, and subsidized and unsubsidized loans. The financial aid office at my university told me that I'd have to take out a personal loan. I plan on taking out a credit card with 0% interest for 15 months, and putting in $500 a month to pay it all up before the 15 months are up. \n\n  \nMy GPA is incredibly mediocre. I used to have a 3.2, but it shot down to 3.0 because I had 3 hard classes (research methods, statistics, and a math course). So there's no hope that I can ever get scholarships based on that. I'm so bummed out because I really wanted to get an MBA and go into HR or project management. I feel stuck now, I know I can try to get a case manager position because a BA in Psychology is required. But what do I do now? I don't want to be stuck working retail positions forever, and I don't want to work in the psych world. I've a friend who got his BA in political science in 2014, and he worked with me at a coffee shop up until recently. He now does landscaping and I do it with him, but it's not stable at all as he's just now picking up his business. I feel lost and worthless. I have 20k in debt that I need to start working on repaying. I feel like a loser for not being able to get a master's degree.",

Neither of my parents or extended family wanted to come because it was “not actually graduation.” It was humiliating walking the stage with silence aside from a pity clap or two while families were tearing my eardrums for their respective kids. Ouch.\n\nThe worst part of it of all is that when I finally was able to go home, all my family says is “you could’ve just graduated with your friends, everyone else is starting college.” and “While you’re in community college, so and so is out of state for their 4 year university.” Way to feel embarrassed and ashamed for starting a new chapter in life.",

They replied that they \"did not receive [my] submission through the LMS or email (the alternative if Lms isn't working).\" They're sticking to their records and telling me I have to reschedule the exam (which costs a fee).\n\nI feel like I'm hitting a brick wall. At first, I thought maybe I hadn't submitted, but I'm so sure I did. That particular exam was the very first one, and I prepared very well for it. I was confident, so there's no way I didn't submit under such good circumstances. Even with the very last exam, which was arguably the worst because I was so burnt out and had zero sleep that I didn't even write a chunk of the questions just to get it over with, I STILL SUBMITTED. This is also my third year; maybe I could believe it if it were my first year, but it's not. I've gone through this process five times, I know how the system works.\nAdditionally, my file is saved under a very specific formula: \"[ full course name] Final Exam.\" I only use this type of name when I'm submitting, else i would just save it with spelling errors, in small caps and abbreviations. It's even more unbelievable that I would go through the effort of saving it with that specific name in a specific folder and not submit.\nIt was also an online exam, so we had to stay in a teams meeting until we were done and specifically said, \"I've submitted.\" How could I see all the other students' \"I've submitted\" messages, type that I also have submitted, and not submit? \n\nI feel like I'm being gaslit right now, and I honestly don't want to go through the stress of retaking this exam, as well as the fee they'll make me pay for the retake. Money is tight right now. \nIs there anything I can possibly do to fight back? I feel as though this is a technical issue on their part but idk how to tell them or go abt it. I don't think it's fair that I have to bear the brunt of a technical issue that's not my fault... Please help idk what else to say to them",

Meanwhile, some of my friends at more “prestigious” schools are still struggling to get internships or even entry-level jobs.\n\nPart of this is due to my military background, which gave me a head start (served 2 years), but it makes me wonder: if the ultimate goal is to graduate with experience and a good job, why go to a more expensive, brand-name school in the first place?\n\nI get the alumni network argument, and maybe there are extra perks or pipelines at certain schools. But from an ROI perspective, wouldn’t it make more sense to go to a cheaper state school and just focus on internships, networking, and certifications?\n\nCurious to hear your thoughts. For those of you who went to “big-name” schools; did the prestige really open doors for you, or was it more about what you did during college?",

So of you go to or attended any of theses places or any other similar ones  were you able to have any fun?\n\nI live in England and went to university in Southampton where as long as we didn't commit any crimes or academic misconduct or whatever. you likley wouldn't have a problem. A mate of mine was picked up for being drunk and disorderly and he had no problems. I don't think we have any very strict university's here. We have academically rigorous universities such as Oxford and Cambridge which are ranked number 1 and 5 in the world respectively but nothing quite like those ones.\n\nTLDR if you go to or went to one of those fundamental schools are you able to have any fun?",

I see people from top-ranked schools posting their internships, jobs, and achievements, and I can’t help but feel jealous or like I’m already behind.\n\nI know success isn’t just about the name of your college, but I can’t shake the feeling that I’m at a disadvantage especially when networking or applying to competitive jobs.

So, the number FASFA gives me doesn't matter for parental contribution, since they won't give anything anyways.\n\nI still have to be a dependent under them, though, because they will still pay for my car insurance and medical insurance while I'm in college. And these prices would be crazy if I tried to pay them myself.\n\nThis leaves me with colleges wanting me to pay over $40,000 a year since they're expecting my parents to help, even when they won't.

      "text": "Hey. So currently a freshman commuter student. I pay about 9K a semester. My father previously told me that he could afford it, however he is refusing to pay. Spring semester starts on Monday, and he hasn't paid my fall installments (he paid a small portion as I had to owe below a certain amount in order to register for classes), and he hasn't paid the two installments that are due for spring. He can afford to send me to this school, as he pays for lavish trips all the time. However, he is refusing to pay in order to control me, as whenever I forget to do simple things such as washing the dishes, he will completely lose his mind and tell me that he won't pay for school. He is very abusive, however I would rather not share the details.\n\nMy point is, I hate my situation and I need to find a way to pay for college on my own. My parents, while living in the same house, are currently not speaking, and my mother cannot afford to pay for my college on her own. I'm trying to transfer to a school that offers better aid, however after dealing with many personal issues on top of the issues he has caused, my gpa isn't up to par.\n\nThe obvious choice would be to take a private loan right? Well, I don't have a credit score, and both parents refuse to allow me to take out a loan with them as co-signers. What about dropping out or transferring to a community college? Well, my father says he will disown me if I don't go to a \"school with a name.\" Very contradictory I know, but that's just how much of an asshole he is.\n\nI hate my life so much, I've never been more stressed. I'm the oldest and while my parents are immigrants, my father went to Berkeley (mother didn't go to college) so I don't think I can benefit from any first generation scholarships. I've tried to apply to a lot of scholarships overall, but haven't won a dime.\n\nTo anyone in a similar situation or who has found a way to pay for college, what should I do? I have a part-time job, but that's definitely not enough, I only get 15.50 an hour and work four hours each on Fridays, Saturdays, and Sundays. I work at a specific store which has mentioned something about funding education for employees, but I am not sure if I qualify as I've only been working since November. Also, do you know any companies that will give full tuition or just any sort of big scholarships to employees?? Any suggestions would be appreciated, please help :(",

Is there anything about the nursing major that could potentially help me?! \n\nedit: I AM NOT A NURSING STUDENT!!! the classes i am taking are not nursing specific!! I was just curious to see if getting a bsn whilst being premed was too much coursework. I know that a lot of you think there’s no overlap but since my classes are NOT nursing specific, classes like:  microbiology, statistics, etc. are the SAME classes that a normal pre med student would take :)",

      "text": "My son is 18 and just went off to Rutgers in NJ  we live  about 600 miles away. Within 24 hours, he says he wants to come home because he doesn’t see anything worth studying there and would rather go to trade school.Clases start in 1week. Over the summer he contemplated where to go and what to do his choice was Rutgers\n\nFor years leading up to this, he always said he wanted nothing to do with trade school. We even discussed police, fire department, and Homeland Security careers—he showed no interest. Even this summer, he was unsure about college versus a trade, so I suggested he try getting some hands-on experience first before deciding. He refused and decided Rutgers. Both of his sisters went there so he was familiar with the school so it was an easier move\n\nA bit of background: growing up very shy , whenever he tried something new—sports like baseball, soccer, swimming—he would quit within days and refuse to go back. We tried to convince him to continue but he wouldn't go on the field. That seems to be part of his personality: he tends to give up quickly\n\nNow he’s at Ruters  and wants to leave immediately. My opinion is that he should at least complete the first semester, earn those credits, try his best  and then make an informed decision about what he wants to do next. His mom feels he should follow his heart and leave\n\nI feel nothing has changed in the last couple of weeks except his nervousness and anxiety is getting the best of him\n\nPlease honest opinions",

I have some money saved up (but not a lot), and my parents aren’t helping (in fact they owe me some money), and I’m not exactly sure what to do. If I apply for scholarships, it wont be very effective because it will just take away from my financial aid package, but I really like the university and I want to make it work. \n\nI’m working a part time job at the moment and I plan to pick up a LOT more shifts, but I still don’t think it will help too much. I’ve been thinking about taking a gap year, but I’m not sure if that will help much either. So I have to choose between going to a state school (free full tuition) and my dream university/ivy league where I have to pay 20k every year and also where I’ll probably have to take out student loans and enter crushing debt.\n\nI would love any advice, especially how to attend my dream school without all the crushing debt. \n\n(edit): I plan on majoring in chemical engineering, and the ivy league is closer to home. Also the state school is a small regional school in another state.",

I start college as a freshman this fall and I was talking to my mom about the things I needed for my dorm: medicine, hair products, toiletries, so forth, and she responded by saying she’d be visiting me regularly so I don’t need it. I assumed she was being unserious, so I— jokingly said— do not visit me everyday. This led to a downward spiral of me gently trying to tell her that it is not normal for her to visit me multiple days a week, every week, especially with roommates. I’m not sure if she thinks college is an adult daycare or something, or why she believes she needs to check on me. One of the reasons I want a dorm to be more independent, can’t do that if she’s there. Sad thing is she genuinely seemed hurt by me explaining that she’s not supposed to be there so often.",

Also, I hate parties. I know I can avoid them, but are Catholics really that into partying?\n\nThe schools in question are SLU, Marquette, and Loyola Chicago, but this is more of a general question :) I plan to study anthro and bio if that matters",

      "text": "Posting this again with a different flair to see if that works.\n\n I absolutely love college- I adore my major, my classes, my professors, getting homework and projects done, all of it. Obviously there are things that are boring or that I drag my feet doing and I’m not like a shoe shiner or anything but I genuinely love learning. I also love my friends and my jobs at school. It all just feels very homey and I’ve gotten so used to the routines of work and school and then home all being in the same place. \n\nI know summer vacation is something everyone looks forward to, so I feel kinda weird that I wish school was still going on. I wish I still had things to get done, school friends to talk to, my college roommate, my jobs on campus, etc. I miss the structure and I miss honestly a little bit of the pressure. I feel like having work to do gives me purpose and I thrive when I have a lot to do or am under pressure to get things done. I hate being still, and summer feels like one long timeout honestly. I’ve had summer jobs not on campus and work consistently but nothing feels the same as being on campus during the school year. Part of me wonders if this means college will be the peak of my life since I don’t know what to do without it. Another part of me wonders why I can’t relax and find pleasure in other things like other people seem to be able to. Does anyone else experience this? If so, how do you combat it? “Just relax” doesn’t help, as I’ve tried that and I feel like I must constantly be doing something or else I’m wasting time and can’t “just relax.”",

I'm 26 YO, in the process of getting my second degree: my parents refused to help me with FAFSA paperwork unless I did what they wanted me to do the first time around. Now that I'm an independent student, I'm going back to pursue science.\n\nI'm only about 60% of the way done with this degree after 3 years (including prereqs that I didn't have to take due to my first degree). Mostly due to me taking semesters off because I'm so tired from working my 40+ hours a week 8-5 job. I've failed classes because I've chosen sleep or having a day off over studying. Untreated ADHD and depression also aren't helping matters. I've decided to try to switch to an online program to see if that'll fix the burnout/pure exhaustion from school and work. \n\n  \nMy dilemma is this: I'm genuinely over working and going to school. I've dropped to part-time, and that's helped with the burnout a lot, but I really want to give up on this. I just know I'll regret it if I do. I do NEED at least a Master's to get into my dream field. My current full-time job is not at all what I want, but it is a \"career\". People are so happy with this job and company that they choose to stay until retirement.\n\n I guess what I'm asking is if you all think it's worth it to push through, no matter how long it takes. That's what I want to do, but I already feel silly for taking as long as I have. It's discouraging and very embarrassing for someone who graduated Magna Cum Laude in three years with her first Bachelor's.\n\nAny insight, advice, or feedback would be greatly appreciated. I also respond well to brutal honesty. Thank you.",

I went to a community college and now attending UW. however, when I applied I initially didn’t get into a major, so I thought I’d shoot my shot for CS or Informatics. I told myself my life would finally proceed when I eventually get accepted to a major, but now im thinking it’s a fallacy to believe in this ideology. I’m getting one rejection after the other and to think this is the only the start of my undergrad makes me so demoralized.\n\nUW has capacity constraint majors and you have to apply to each department to get into them. I got denied from CS in fall, and then took some classes here which tanked my gpa, going from a 3.8 to a ~3.5 now. I was no longer interested in Info but during spring (current) I decided to apply to Statistics— I also got denied this morning. I am constantly facing failure after failure, and it’s taking such a huge mental toll on me. I thought coming here would be fun after being stuck at a community college but now I feel like I cant progress in life without even a declared major as a Junior in university. Not smart enough for CS, not doing well enough for Stats— im losing optimism and hope here as i was just about to move in with friends and started plans for the future.

I’m a parent to three little ones, ages 11, 7, and 6. My biggest concern is that working full-time might leave me without enough time or energy to support my kids with their schoolwork and daily routines.\n\nI feel confident that I can handle the classes themselves, but balancing that with the daily schedule of parenting and working is what’s really on my mind.\n\nHave any other parents here worked full-time while taking a similar course load? If so, do you have any tips, strategies, or insights that helped you stay on top of things?\n\nI’d really appreciate hearing about your experiences!",

      "text": "Hi everyone, I’m 21 (F) and could really use some honest thoughts.\n\nLast year, I flunked out of my pre-med course. There was a lot going on—my dad kicked my brother and me out, and between that and everything else, I just couldn’t keep up with school. I ended up getting a minimum-wage job and renting my own place, thinking I could figure things out on my own.\n\nAfter a year of that, I decided to try again. My grandparents (who live 15 hours away) offered to let me live with them so I could go back to school, and I said yes. My flight is booked, I’m enrolled again in pre-med, and everything is set. But now that it’s only a month away… I’m freaking out.\n\nI’m scared. Last year, the course felt so hard. I’m terrified that I’ll go back and just… not get it. Like I’ll fail all over again. I’m also really sad to leave. My friends, my independence, my life—everything I know is here. I feel like I’m walking away from it all.\n\nI’ll be 22 in December, and a part of me just wants to travel and live life while I’m still young and adventurous. But then I think: I need money and education to live the life I want, right? I just don’t know if I’m doing the right thing. My grandparents are also super strict, so I’m nervous about that too.\n\nI feel this growing anxiety every day, and a part of me wants to back out. But I’ve come this far and I don’t want to waste another year either.\n\nIf anyone has been through something similar, or has advice, please share. I just feel really torn.",

I doubt that. I feel like he's just keeping his head down, doing the work (he's getting excellent grades) and just avoiding parties and the social aspect because he feels like he should have done better. His assigned roommate never showed up, so he's in a room alone.

My mental health is very fragile right now. I tried pushing through my trauma and doing summer courses this semester, but my first day on campus led me to have a severe mental breakdown that night and I figured that I was not ready. I'm still in my collegetown but am planning to go back to my hometown for the rest of summer.\n\nMy concern is that I will never be ready to go back. I love my school, I love the academics here, I love the culture and community, and I love my friends. I'm currently going to therapy and I know that it won't be an overnight quick fix, but I have this overwhelming sense of dread and anxiety when i think about the fall semester and having to be back on campus. I have nightmares frequently. It's gotten so bad that I went on an accidental bender trying to run away from the dark thoughts at night.\n\nI don't want to do anything rash. I'm stuck in this hard situation of wanting to get my degree from this university that I've put blood, sweat, and tears into-- especially because i'm about three more semesters to finishing or moving near my family and finishing up school at another university. Although I love my current university, I don't feel safe and I don't think I'll ever feel safe again. It will never be the same again, and I feel like a husk of myself right now.\n\nI don't know if I'm looking for advice, or for someone to be logical with me, but idk. im struggling.

Because of that, this semester, I had no money left to pay off about $1,830 this semester (my computer was not that much, I just repeated a class and it costs more). Up until february, I didn't have a job but now I do. In February, I called the Money Management center to figure out what I could do to pay off what I owe and the woman told me I could set up a payment agreement so next semester's financial aid could be used to cover what I owe now. In my head, I would work through the summer and pay it down to avoid needing to use $1k+ from next semester but I had things that needed to be done since I was without a job for a year. The only issue is that I would have to wait until June to set this up.\n\nShe failed to mention, however, that in order to keep my classes, I had to pay enough that I owed less than $1k by May 11th. If I would have known that, I would have been putting money into this whole time and just kept enough in my bank account for gas. I thought I was being smart by saving some money so I was able to put more towards it during the summer months. However, I made an appointment today to speak with them about it and that is when this information was finally shared.\n\nI am angry because this is probably my 6th time talking to them this semester and they have not once mentioned that detail to me at all. If they couldn't answer my question, they would bounce me around departments and then that person couldn't answer another question and they would transfer me to another department.\n\nNow, I could pay to get under the 1k mark, but that would mean I wouldn't have money to cover any other expenses and wouldn't be able to pay it down in the summer except for maybe $30 each paycheck (around maybe $150-$200 the whole summer). Alternatively, I could wait until summer and let them drop me from my classes and pay more during the summer when I won't need to spend as much money. The issue is my classes are highly competitive for spots so there is no guarantee I would even be able to keep my schedule even remotely similar.\n\nI have applied for two seperate loans and got rejected from both (with cosigners) and just don't know what the move is. Any advice or insight would be helpful. Thank you.\n\nTL;DR: I need to pay $830 dollars by May 11th to keep my classes but I would have no money left for basic necessities.",

      "text": "A little background I was in college prep in high school and was able to graduate with my associate's degree in 2020. Ever since then it's been rough having tried 2 different colleges one in person and one fully online. Neither of them worked out due to discipline issues at the time and other things. A couple of years later I want to continue my education. I love school so much and always have and it felt odd to have it end the way it did. \n\nI’m planning to start school this fall at a local college with a pursuit of a computer engineering degree. I’m very excited to start but honestly, I am becoming extremely worried about how I will manage. I’m currently taking 5 classes because I have to for my scholarship to cover half of my tuition. The other half I'm planning to take out student loans. My big concern is that I am probably also going to have to continue working full time during my time in college. I had to buy a car during the peak of the pandemic and the cheapest and most reliable one I found has left me with a 300usd car payment and a nearly 200usd insurance bill. I still have to account for gas, food, and internet for my home. \n\nNot only the financial burden but also the time crunch as well. How will I get to sleep and stay physically active? Will I even be able to participate in anything at college with this? I’m a first generation from a single parent household like I’m sure many are, so I don't have anyone I can speak to that has actually experienced this but truly how does anyone manage this? I really do want to try my best and do well but just thinking ahead especially with what I've heard about the course load for engineering degrees I’m slowly losing hope. \n\nPlease anyone that has been or is in a situation like this or just has general advice share it no matter how big or small",

I didn't even bother applying to the T25, though.\n\nThe reason I didn't apply to the T25 is simply for two reasons: one, the tuition and housing is absurdly expensive, and two, it is exactly 2 hours away.\n\nI also didn't go to the second best university in the state, as it was an hour and 45 minutes away. The tuition was about the same as the tuition for the university that I'm going to.\n\nI actually chose my university because of the amount of scholarships I was able to get, and because it's only 15 minutes away from my dad.

      "title": "Why do so many people (and universities) discount the arts and humanities?",
      "text": "This will be a longer post (but hopefully not too long) with a TLDR at the end.\n\nSo I graduated last spring, but while I was there, I remember a faculty member telling me that the engineering program was trying to lessen the gen ed requirements for arts and humanities so their students can spend more time on engineering courses. The requirements are that every student has to take 9 credits of arts and humanities combined, but at least 3 credits had to come from each area (so 3 credits in art and 6 credits in humanities, or 3 credits in humanities and 6 credits in art). Apparently, the engineering programs thought that that was too much for their students to handle, and so they should only have to take 6 credits. You’ll notice that I value the arts and humanities based on my flair and the title of this post, but still, it seems absurd to me that engineering students would somehow be hindered in their studies by taking 9 credits of them.\n\nHere’s the deal: the 9 credits combined requirement is already a concession when comparing that to some of the gen ed requirements for other fields (7 natural science credits, one of which must be a lab credit; 6 social science credits, which includes history, political science, etc.; 6 credits of writing, plus 3 credits of speaking). Math is somehow also getting shafted with only 3 credits being required, and logic (a philosophy class) counts towards that. There are some “more advanced” gen ed requirements that may or may not add to the amount of sciences and arts/humanities that you take, but they also let you double dip for fulfilling requirements (so one class may fulfill two separate categories in the requirements).\n\nMy complaint about it is that the arts and humanities are important for personal development/growth, so reducing the requirements even further takes away from that. I see a pretty detrimental lack of ability or willingness in many of my peers to critically think about things, and in a democratic society, that can be a fatal flaw. Just because social sciences, arts, and humanities aren’t as marketable as STEM majors, that doesn’t make them less valuable.\n\nIf I was designing a list of gen ed requirements, it would look something more like this: 6 credits in art (can be music/music history, drawing, theater, etc.), 6 credits in humanities, 6 credits in social science, 6 credits in history (this is separate from humanities on purpose), 7 credits in natural science (1 from a lab), 6 credits in math (not including logic; that should go back to the humanities), and 6 credits in english (3 of which should come from a writing-specific class; the other 3 should be more focused on discussion/analysis of literature). That totals 43 credits, leaving 77 credits for whatever major(s) and minor(s) people want to pursue. I would be fine with the gen ed requirements also counting towards your major and minor if applicable.\n\nSo what do you guys think?\n\nTLDR: I feel that the arts and humanities aren’t valued enough by a lot of people and universities, and I’d like to change gen ed requirements to increase exposure to those areas. See above for the paragraph discussing those in detail.",

      "text": "I need some advice: I’ve never seriously considered college, as I never took high school seriously. I did relatively well on the SAT (1280) but my grades were barely passing, evident by my 2.0 GPA. I knew I was capable of getting good grades, but had no motivation to do so and didn’t do any homework besides the minimum required to pass the class. After high school, I joined the Navy; I got a 93 on the ASVAB and picked a technical job which required 2 years of schooling on electronics, through which I obtained about 70 semester hours in credit. After 6 years of service I’ve become quite technically adept and have always had an interest in math, physics, and general science and continued my studies in my free time, to a point that I am roughly versed at a collegiate level. I have also obtained discipline and maturity that I did not have in my teens. This has all culminated into a feeling of regret that I didn’t take my education seriously as a teen, because now I would like to get an electrical engineering degree from a recognized university such as Stanford or MIT, but am unsure if my application would even be considered due to my high school transcript. I suppose my best bet would be to simply apply and find out, but I do not want to waste my time if it is unrealistic.",

I’d greatly appreciate if you took the tiime to read it.\n\nI’m heading into my final year of uni after taking a mental health break, and I’m seriously considering dropping out.\n\nI took a year off after a rough period—my mental health was at an all-time low, I was in a toxic relationship where I was repeatedly cheated on and blamed due to my mental health being a burden, and I lost most of my friends when I left because they only really cared about rent and not me.\n\nFor context, i’ve been diagnosed with adhd, depression and anxiety for most of my life and have had a couple attempts during my teenage years. I’ve been on meds for around 8 years now and have recently just started to be consistent with therapy.\n\nSince January 2024 (when i found out about the cheating), I haven’t been able to finish the assignments needed to return. I’ve tried everything—meds, structured routines, new environments—but I can’t focus or motivate myself. It’s like my brain shuts down the moment I try. Before all this, I was doing well and on track for honors.\n\nNow I’m questioning everything. I don’t enjoy my course and can’t picture myself in a 9–5 life. I want to do something more creative, but the guilt of dropping out is crushing—especially since my parents have paid expensive international student fees. I already feel like a failure, and I’m terrified this would confirm it.\n\nI want to get better, but I don’t know if returning will help or just make things worse. I also fear that dropping out would deepen the depression too. I feel completely stuck.\n\nAny advice or support would mean a lot. Thanks 😊",

All I know is I want to go to a college that is somewhat affordable, far from home(sacramento cali) and honestly a fun one so i can live out in college what i never got to in high school and i didnt think i could get that fun stereotypical going to parties etc in community. In normal circumstances, id just do community and then transfer to uni later since its much cheaper but considering the fact that i want to move out as soon as possible, would the best option be a dorm? idk im just genuinely very confused on what to do. ik this is broad but if anyone has any advice on colleges to recommend, their own uni/community exp, or just anything abt this topic in gen id love to hear it. (for reference im trying to go into nursing)",

There's obviously a ton of universities with no faith commitment or anything like that, or ones that have a faith component but are largely secular (such as Harvard having a divinity program but primarily these days not being seen as a religious school). In my preliminary job searches, I've kind of been able to suss out colleges which have a historical religious focus and still identify this way, but are more open to non-practicing and irreligious students (a lot of Jesuit schools for example), and others which are much more devoted to the faith still. \n\nMy question is, would even a school that's more secular still preferentially hire people who are religious? I was basically raised Catholic but I do not practice anymore and I'm also LGBT, so I worry about potential discrimination trying to get a job at a university like this despite their claims of being open and accepting to people outside of the faith. Does anyone have experience with getting a job or being a student at a religious school while not being of that school's religion? I'd like to hear of some experiences to know if I should write off all religious schools regardless of how focused they seem on that aspect.",

I moved to a local university and I'm honestly scared and intimidated. I start classes in about a week, but I still feel like I just can't do it. I met with my advisor in June and they had set me up for Bio I (with lab), Gen Chem I (with lab), Intro to Clinical Immunology, and College Algebra (I'm majoring in Medical Laboratory Science). All of this totals up to 14 credits. During my time in community college, I once had a 16 credit course load, and I did fine, but they were mostly writing-based courses with one STEM class mixed in. I've been able to keep my GPA a 4.0 so far.\n\nI feel like my success in college so far has been mostly due to luck, and I feel like this semester at uni will show me that and leave me overwhelmed. I already feel like not going through with uni. Thoughts about failing and having to drop out have been occupying my mind for days now. My Bio I professor opened up the course early for people to preview, and I check the syllabus for labs and I see that having lab partners is going to be a requirement. I know that eventually I'll have to work with other people but it worries me that I'll have partners that don't put in their work or don't want to cooperate. Math is also not something I am particularly strong at and have had long lasting issues with, but I have been trying to prep for College Algebra over the summer by myself. I feel like I won't be able to juggle these courses all at once, despite having a greater course load during a previous semester. \n\nI honestly just want to be free of all this anxiety. It hurts. But I don't know what to do. I want to pursue my major, but I'm terrified of going to uni.",

      "text": "To start with I was technically \"unschooled\" for almost all of my teenage years, and thus had no ACT/SAT scores, GPA, or transcript. Over the past few months I studied and worked really hard to finish the HiSET. My final score was pretty high and indicated \"College and Career Readiness\". I, to my mistake, soon after applied to a local state university about an hour away from where I live without realizing that I had missed their scholarship deadline and their FAFSA priority deadline.\n\nAfter I got my FAFSA results, I was shocked to find a whopping SAI of ~33000, which was a surprise because every time I used the estimator on StudentAid.gov it always showed around the -1500 range. The reason it's so high is because in 2023 my parent's recieved a portion of inheritance, but because we were practically homeless it all went to the downpayment on a small house in a state we could afford. Bottom line is that my school only approved me for $5,500 in unsubsidized federal loans and nothing else. I did a lot of research into private loan options, but after seeing a big red \"DON'T DO IT!\" pretty much everywhere I looked, I decided to ask my parents if they would be willing to sign into Parent PLUS loans and enter an agreement with me saying I'll pay for them. They agreed, but it made me feel terrible because if something happened to me later on they would have a really shitty situation. I even called my school to ask if they had any ways to get additional financial aid and they basically said \"there's nothing else we can do for you\". I'm debating wether or not to call them again to tell them about my FAFSA SAI to see if there's anything they can do but I don't know how much it would help; the COA at my chosen university is around $25,000/yr, so the parent PLUS loans would be around $20,000 for my freshman year alone! \n\nI am devastated because I had chosen a major in a field I am really really passionate about in Biology (Ecology), but with a projected income of $80,000-$60,000 it just doesn't make sense. Just today I met with an advisor in my department who's also a professor and it just cemented my knowledge that I would've been so supported and welcome there. Regardless of my feelings, if I back out now I'll only be at a $250 loss instead of thousands of dollars after I graduate with so limited ways to pay it off because of the current administration.\n\nI still want to attend this university but I want to at least wait until next year before I do it. However, incoming student orientation starts in two weeks and college proper starts in about 1.5 months from now. Is it too late to back out and still preserve my enrollment until next year?",

      "text": "I want to share my story because I know some of you might be feeling overwhelmed, lost, or like you’re too late to get things together. But trust me. there’s no deadline for figuring out who you are and what you want.\n\nI’m an only child, and when I first started university at 18, I had no idea what I wanted to do. I was bouncing between majors, taking the bare minimum of credits, and exploring all sorts of classes. I took time off, explored my country, went out, met people, and just… lived. I had money saved from high school, so I used that to support myself while figuring things out.\n\nThen life hit hard. I lost my cousin during my first year of university, the closest thing I had to a sister. That loss shook me. I realized I needed to focus on myself, not just academically, but emotionally and spiritually. People called me immature, said I was wasting time. My parents didn’t understand. But I needed that time. I explored, I read, I traveled, I deepened my faith, and I made peace with her passing. Most importantly, I made peace with myself.\n\nAt 21, I committed to studying mathematics and data science. I started bootcamps and certifications in data engineering. And just as things were falling into place, I got into two serious car accidents, one my fault, one not. I was severely injured and failed three courses. It knocked me down hard. But I got back up.\n\nNow I’m 22, heading into my third year of university. I’ve landed internships, gotten accepted to a data analyst job at the top hospital in my region (just in case I don’t find a data engineering role), and I’m continuing to work through bootcamps and certifications. I’ll graduate at 24! not with a perfect record, not according to anyone else’s timeline but with clarity, drive, resilience, and a life I’m proud of...\n\nThere is no “right” age to graduate.\n\nWe are allowed to grow, heal, explore, and change paths.\n\nLife will hit us with detours and that doesn’t mean we're off-track.\n\nWhat matters is that we're moving forward, even if it’s slow.\n\nWe only lose when we give up. And we haven’t...\n\nSo if you’re starting late, restarting, or just figuring things out, that’s okay. You’re not behind. You’re just on your path.\n\nIf I can make it through everything I went through and still move forward with passion and purpose, so can you. Keep going. Your journey matters amd so do you. 💪",

He alleges that the coding sections are similar and thus were copied from each other.\n\nThe thing is this \"coding project\" is essentially using matlab to solve a bunch of hard equations that would be night impossible to do on paper. Of course our coding sections are very similar, we all just typed out the formulas he gave us into code. It's not like there are radically different ways to calculate something like the output voltage of a 3 phase rectifier. \n\nI got an 80 on the project and the professor says he doesn't want to deal with who cheated or didn't. He said either take the grade of send an appeal to the university. The outcome of that will either be I get a 100 or a 0 on the project.\n\nI didn't cheat, but at the sametime only lost 6ish points on my class grade. The alternative is that I fuck up the appeals process somehow and lose 35points of my grade.\n\nCurrently talking with some students and apparently some of our codes are very different yet they also are considered to have cheated.",

      "text": "Hi, I’m going to try to make this as short as I can without rambling. Currently I’m a 4th year university student. I transferred from a cc and got excepted as a Korean culture and literature major. Now with my graduation around the corner, I’m starting to wonder if I made a mistake and it’s making me feel a bit depressed. \n\n\nOriginally I didn’t plan on going to college, mainly because of my mental health. I was fighting depression and anxiety during my junior and senior years in high school, which demotivated me and kept me from wanted to continue my studies. So I decided to take a break from school. Eventually I started going back to school feeling motivated by my dream to someday go to South Korea. I wanted to go to school doing something I enjoyed and loved instead of focusing only on the money aspect. My plan was to do whatever I can to go to Korea. The best option was for me to work as an English teacher, which only really required I receive my bachelor’s in any subject. So I thought why not Korean studies? I can go to school and study something I’m interested in. And while I still have an interest in Korean culture and language, with my graduation coming up, and with me really being forced to actually face my future I’m getting cold feet.\n\nToday I went out for coffee with a Korean acquaintance, and the conversation we had really made me start to think. She basically told me that most Koreans prefer to have connections with other Koreans. That they for the most part cannot get real close to foreigners and tend to be more closed off. And while I did notice that even in a very heterogeneous place like where I live (I live in California) Koreans do mostly stick together. I had a meetup with my former Korean language professor who is really young, and she said she has no foreign friends and she doesn’t really care to. \nI used to chalk it up to maybe they really wanted to make friends with non Korean people, but they had a difficult time because of the language barrier. I naively thought that they wanted to. According my Korean acquaintance they just don’t really care to. And if they do it’s not a true friendship. And unfortunately even foreigners in Korea said most Koreans refer to them as their “foreign friend” not just a friend. \n\nIt got me thinking about what kind of genuine relationships I can actually make there. Especially for someone like me who is quite shy and a bit sensitive, I can’t help but start to wonder how well I will actually do in Korea. \nIt’s already weighing down on me that I’ll be leaving my family. But it was something I was willing to risk because of my idealism and faith things can go well and I can experience another culture, which was my dream. \n\nI plan to study abroad over the summer in Korea, but now what happens if I go and don’t like it? What kind of job could I actually get in the US with a Korean literature and culture degree? Thanks to my stupid decisions I am limited to my options. \nI’ve thought about postponing graduation and maybe double majoring in maybe journalism, but can I really do that? I don’t even know if my financial aid will cover any of that. And with Trump in office I don’t even know if I will continue to get aid. I just don’t know what my future holds. I’m sitting here thinking my mom was right, I should’ve had a plan b instead of living in my dreamland thinking things will go well. Now it’s hitting me, and I don’t know if I screwed up my academic opportunities, and this might be one of my biggest mistakes yet. Is this really the end? I don’t know what to do at this point.",

We would be living together in a double dorm room. \n\nI see them as male, and I respect their right to live and express themselves as they'd like to. However, I do not want to share a room with a man. This will not change. At my university, we are not allowed to request a room change before move-in. However, I hopefully want to get this resolved before then so as not to hurt them or make things unnecessarily awkward. I would like to contact housing and make this their problem, but I am also not wanting to out my assigned roommate. I believe housing is not aware of this issue because my roommate has not changed their name or pronouns in the university system (which you are able to do without your parents ever knowing). \n\nI am considering living off-campus (for other reasons) but I have already signed a housing contract and I am not sure what breaking it would entail. My university is also very limited housing-wise and I don't know if a room change would even be possible. I haven't really been able to find any concrete advice for this issue, so I would really appreciate any personal experiences that may help guide me right now. Please do not leave hateful comments or try to minimize my feelings. Thank you :)",

      "text": "Hey everyone — I’m in a bit of a time crunch and could really use your honest input. I have to make my decision today, and I’m torn between Penn State (University Park), Rutgers (New Brunswick), and the University of Colorado Boulder for Electrical Engineering. I’m from New Jersey, but money is not an issue, so cost while a still a factor, won’t be a deciding factor.\n\nI’d love any insight you have — whether you’ve attended, know someone who has, or just have an opinion. Here’s what I’ve gathered:\n\n⸻\n\nPenn State (University Park)\n\nPros:\n\t•\tHighly respected engineering school\n\t•\tStrong alumni network, especially in the Northeast\n\t•\tGreat co-op/internship connections\n\t•\tFeels like a “real” college town with tons of school spirit\n\t•\tStrong career services and big-name recruiting\n\nCons:\n\t•\tCold winters, middle-of-nowhere location\n\n\t•\tBig lecture halls, can feel impersonal\n\n\t•\tTougher workload compared to the others\n\n⸻\n\nRutgers (New Brunswick)\n\nPros:\n\t•\tIn-state school (closer to home)\n\t•\tdecent engineering program with strong job placement in NJ/NYC\n\t•\tEasier transition socially and logistically\n\t•\tGood research opportunities\n\t•\tFamiliar environment\n•T15 school for public universities, although for electrical engineering it’s much lower \n\n\nCons:\n• Campus is extremely big and disjointed and bussing is necessary which I heard is very frustrating \n\t•\tLess prestige nationally than Penn State\n\t•\tCommuter school feel depending on your campus/living situation (I’d be on campus and about an hourish drive to go back home)\n\t•\tBureaucracy and administrative issues are a common complaint\n\t\n\n⸻\n\nUniversity of Colorado Boulder\n\nPros:\n\t•\tGorgeous campus/environment (mountains, weather, lifestyle)\n\t•\tStrong EE program, especially in power systems, RF, and aerospace\n\t•\tLaid-back vibe, outdoorsy culture\n\t•\tGood connections with national labs (NIST, NCAR, etc.)\n\t\n\nCons:\n\t•\tFar from home (NJ to CO)\n\t•\tLess East Coast industry presence\n\t•\tMight feel culturally very different\n\t•\tLess “prestige” compared to Penn State and Rutgers overall \n\n⸻\n\nI’m honestly looking for the best combo of strong academics, good career placement, and a campus I’ll enjoy living on. I know they’re all good schools — just want to make the most informed call I can before the deadline hits.\n\nIf you were me — where would you go?",

      "text": "Hi everyone, I’m a Canadian citizen currently in high school, and I have a question about U.S. green cards and studying abroad.\n\nMy dad will be getting a U.S. green card soon, and since I’m under 21 and his child, I believe I’ll qualify for one as a derivative applicant. That said, I’m planning to attend university in Canada, and I’m wondering if it’s possible for me to retain my green card while studying there.\n\nI’ve looked into reentry permits, which let green card holders stay outside the U.S. for up to two years at a time. But it seems a bit sketchy or risky to get my green card and then immediately start applying for reentry permits just to cover my four-year degree in Canada.\n\nHas anyone been through this situation or know if doing this could jeopardize my green card status? Would USCIS view it negatively if I’m living and studying outside the U.S. right after getting the card?\n\nAny help or insight would be appreciated—thank you!\n\nEDIT: I was also wondering if it might be a better idea to wait and apply for my green card when I’m around 20 years old, maybe when I’m starting my third year of university. Since I’d still be under 21, I believe I’d still qualify as a derivative applicant. If I get my green card at that point, I’d only need to apply for one reentry permit to finish the rest of my degree, which seems a lot safer and less complicated than needing two. Is this approach possible, and would it make things easier with USCIS?\n\nThat said, I’m not 100% sure how the green card process works when it comes to timing — for example, how long it takes to actually get the green card once my dad becomes a permanent resident, and how the waitlist for derivative applicants is managed. If there’s a long backlog or if I need to start the process much earlier than I expected, I’d love to understand that better so I can time everything properly.\n\nAlso, I’ve read that the Child Status Protection Act (CSPA) should help protect my eligibility as a \"child\" even if I turn 21 during the process, as long as I meet the criteria (if someone can explain to me). So I’m hoping that gives me some flexibility, but I’m not totally sure how it works in practice.",

These especially don’t make sense because the accrediting institution for the university says certain topics have to be covered in the class. So we have to get through all of them. Besides that, all the sections take a common exam and they all have to be in sync for that exam.\n\nOne student said I was always faster than the other section their friend was in when we covered literally the exact same material over the course of the 15 week semester and so had the exact same average speed.\n\nEvery day I would have them work on multiple questions in class and I would walk around and help. I told them again and again they could work in groups. They never worked in groups. At the end of the semester someone said I didn’t provide enough opportunities for group work.\n\nThen there was this series of complaints:\n\nDoesn’t talk about real world applications enough.\n\nOk so I start talking more about real world applications. Then I get: goes off on tangents during lecture about things that aren’t on the exam.\n\nOk so then I make online discussion assignments about real world applications so they don’t take up time during lecture. Then I get: assigned extra assignments that other sections didn’t have.\n\nSo they’ll literally just complain no matter what you do.\n\nAnd do they ever express any sense of responsibility for their own grade if they get a bad grade? No. They don’t read the book. They don’t come to class on Fridays (a third of the classes). They don’t come to office hours. Then they get a bad grade and somehow it’s my fault.\n\nIt’s impossible to take them seriously. Just thought you might like to see a perspective from the other side.",

As an aside, this didn’t help me get into any universities tbh. When I got to uni I had no actual general education credits left to complete so I started taking business gen eds and prerequisites right away. I just started taking finance courses this semester (after two and a half years of completing business gen ed requirements and business major prerequisites). I took a single basic finance class last semester and thought it was okay at best, but not bad enough to shake me from my major.\n\nAfter a lot of time and reflection and exploration I realize that not only do I not like finance, I don’t even like business. I spend most of my time procrastinating doing finance work by reading medical research papers, googling stuff about physical therapy/human anatomy, and in-depth political documents (yes, like the actual bills passed by our state of federal governments). I feel completely lost and hopeless. I couldn’t care less about finance whatsoever, but I don’t know what the fuck to do anymore I feel like it’s too late to study biology or engineering or something that’s actually grounded (for lack of a better term). Is it too late for me to completely pivot? If it’s not, how can I pivot? \n\nJust to provide some insight, I was at physical therapy today and knew more about the anatomical makeup of the tendons in my foot than the students shadowing my PT. wtf, who does this…",

      "text": "A 15 credit hour semester costs just over $2k, and it’s being paid for entirely by the Pell Grant. Fifteen minute commute, and I don’t have to deal with any roommate horror stories that my friends keep telling me about at their universities. Able to get an internship literally working for the college, so I get job experience while staying at the place I spend all my time at anyway. It’s never overcrowded and there’s dozens of places to study at any given point. Dining options aren’t the best but they aren’t the worst, and I can buy my own food with the money I’m saving. Extremely helpful staff and career services. Dunno about the club experience because I’m not in any, but everyone I’ve talked to had been nice so far, and if I encounter any assholes I don’t have to live on the same property as them. Making friends isn’t a priority to me so I can’t speak about how easy or hard it is, but I know there’s avenues to it if I so choose. \n\nCurrently getting an AA with a certificate in Computer Animation but once that’s done I’m getting an AAB and completing my Bachelors in a 3+1 program with a partner university. I’ll have spent less than 7k total throughout my academic journey (on school alone, food and transportation is another story). Even less if I put more effort into getting scholarships. There’s a lot of negativity towards college and community college, but I personally have found it to be the best decision I’ve ever made, and a complete weight off my shoulders than if I chose a 4 year college instead. Different people will have different situations at different institutions, but unless something goes horribly wrong, I do not see myself regretting my decision anytime soon.",

Ive taken a few handfuls of semesters of public and private courses here but no degree, the courses i took were general except for some accounting courses.\n\nIve recently learned a lot more about the kind of limitations that professionals face in the careers based on these degrees as well, atleast here in the U.S. Such things like termination of years long studies without adequate reasoning or warning, gutting of resources for necessary reporting and data collecting agencies and third party groups, and just the overall lack of federal support for these aspects of environment. This has made me feel more strongly about seeking education and life elsewhere. \n\nAs an adult ive broadened the scope of possible homes for me and I will eventually settle in europe (likely spain) so when it comes to school choices im flexible with respect to cost of living and study focus. \nSo does anyone have experience with the process of moving for university and how was your experience? were there any resources or details not easily found that gave you ease? Is a work/school life manageable in uk, norway or switzerland? Does anyone know if any universities in spain have advanced or notable environmental science programs?",

For context, I like to study at UW (University of Washington) because there’s a lot of space/study spots and it’s much quieter than what my CC offers. Our library only has one floor, and a limited amount of books. I know that public libraries exist, but I’ve had some unpleasant experiences at the public libraries in Seattle. \n\nI thought that it was perfectly okay to study at the Suzzallo library at UW because it was a public space, meaning that even tourists and parents have access to the area. My friend on the other hand had an opposite view. She thought it was unfair that I get to use their library despite me not being a student and paying the necessary tuition to be there. Her argument was that it’s not right for me to take someone else’s study spot and time at the library because I “did not work enough” to get in the first place.\n\nI’ll save you guys the trouble: I was an honor student in High School, 4.0 UW & 4.3 W, 7 clubs, and I worked a part-time job. I’m in CC because it was cheaper and I don’t want to take out a loan at 18-years old. We took the same AP classes, took the same general classes, came from the same school, had the same teachers, etc.\n\nWas I being unreasonable? I don’t want to diminish anyone’s hard work at all, I respect everyone’s efforts and grit for continuing higher education. It would be nice to see what you guys think.",

      "text": "My friends and I just had a conversation about the rigor of liberal arts majors in universities. I'm personally of the mind that the purpose of college is to prepare you for a job, and if it's well known that liberal arts majors don't do this, they should at minimum provide the academic rigor to the students to produce quality  work in the form of articles/stories/novels etc.\n\nI go to the top state university in my state, and I'm a double major - both in Liberal Arts. Frankly, the academic requirements to succeed are a joke. It almost feels like professors grade for \"if\" you did the work, rather than \"how well\" you did the work.\n\nFor instance, I wrote an essay for a final. This essay was for one of my more rigorous classes, and while I put in substantial effort, there was *definitely* some large gaps in my understanding of the topic. We can speculate as to why exactly it was the case - but I got 100 on the essay. I personally think that the essay *looked* good enough to the professor, and that it wasn't graded for quality or content. (something how much time a professor has, probably doesn't want to grade 100 papers etc.)\n\nThen there's the discussion post crisis - where there's almost a 100% chance that the professors are just grading to see if you did it.\n\nOverall, my experience as a liberal arts major has been a breeze academically. I frankly had to study harder in highschool for worse grades than I'm making now.\n\nSo, are Liberal Arts programs at top universities are more rigorous? Or is more of the same general concept of \"good enough\" = A.",

      "text": "In 2015 I entered my first year of Uni and I struggled severely with my Maths Courses - I did awesome on my In-Class Assignments and my Pen-and-Paper Exams. Problem was, the online Homeworks. If you don't type your answer in the exact format the answer is listed on their 'Server' as, you're marked incorrect, regardless of if your answer is of equal value. My Professor at the time didn't care when I asked for assistance trying to understand what format the Site was looking for *(I think it was \"UT\" from the University of Texas?)*.\n\nAt my wit's end, I went to the Tutoring Centre, had my Homework all completed on paper and I'd try plugging the answers in, sitting side-by-side with someone who took the Course the year before me. He'd say *\"That looks right\"* and I'd lose .25 Points over and over and over on each question, as we couldn't figure out the preferred format for the Answer. I got an F on the Homework, with someone right there who passed the year before. It was so demoralising I took a Withdrawal mid-Semester. Knowing I'm capable of getting an A *(and even getting one on the Midterm!)*, but scoring low-B's to C's on every Homework was so discouraging and from my POV felt like artificial difficulty because my Uni entered into a contract with some Tech entity to \"optimise\" education.\n\nIt's been almost a decade, I'm successful in my career but I still want a Degree - I love learning! But all I'm hearing about is BlackBoard and other Sites being used now even for Essays and Fill-in-the-Blank Questions. Or about Respondus bugging out every time you try to take a Test, clicking 'Submit' on an Assignment only to have the page tell you you've been Signed-Out and all your progress is lost, Professors accusing you of using AI *(or using it themselves???)* etc. I just don't know if I can deal with **everything** being Virtual, especially Maths. Do I just have to tough it out and maybe it's better in higher-level Courses, or Grad School, when Professors have less to individually grade so they do it themselves?\n\n**Or** \\- maybe BlackBoard and all of these Sites/Programs are better nowadays? It's not that I'm tech-illiterate, my job is in IT and I code in some of the basic languages, but the whole song-and-dance is too taxing if College is less about evaluating what I've learned about the material and more about jumping through a hoops to placate faceless Apps that never gave any formatting instructions.\n\nSorry if this feels complain-y. I really do **want** to go to College, but it's an expensive pool to jump back into if the water's going to be the exact same. I appreciate any insight you may have on the state of these tools or how your specific Uni handles things.",

      "text": "About six months ago, the family purchased a 2021 Subaru Outback for their 20-year-old daughter, who had adamantly requested it for college and work. She had moved from a small town to a large city, and the parents intended the car to support her safety and mobility. Later, the daughter said the car was a gift and that the parents had not specified otherwise.\n\nShe has been fully supported by her parents, with all bills paid, except for a one-week babysitting job she held. She initially attended her first university program for three weeks. She then attended a second university program for one semester and dropped out. While she was not working or attending university, she started doing watercolors and collages and realized that she really loves art. This led to her decision that she would study art, which her parents fully accept and support.\n\nDuring a visit home with her boyfriend and his friends, she broke up and resumed a previous relationship, which involved some drama. Later, she decided to attend a university close to her home in the small town with her current boyfriend, because they have an art program there and she will study art. Her parents offered her a 2015 RAV4, which is her mother’s car, to use while keeping the Outback with them. Although the Outback is in her name, they would keep it until she completes the current academic year and officially re-enrolls for the next year. The mother will start using the RAV4 during that time.\n\nThe daughter feels this decision shows a lack of confidence and pride from her parents and makes her sad. The parents are supporting her with therapy and want to emphasize responsibility, communication, and proper use of resources, while ensuring that family resources are managed thoughtfully and that she demonstrates commitment to school, work, and open communication with them. Do you think that the parents are acting correctly? The car is in the daughter’s name, so therefore it belongs to the daughter to use as she wants.",

I’m uncertain if it will and was hoping if anyone here can answer that for me?\n\nAlso, if anyone does know of a way to gain accreditation I’d be over the moon to hear about it, if accreditation even matters. My ex-flat mate is undertaking an IBMS course that costs £300 to work as a biomedical scientist as that accredits his degree, which I think is ridiculous.\n\nAny help would be amazing as I’m a bit to angry right now to research all of this crap, it’s all slightly overwhelming being told your £65,000 degree might be useless, or at the minimum a set back when it comes to further education.\n\nI feel the help given to a level/Btec isn’t great enough, or wasn’t in my case, as I had no idea accreditation existed.",

I absolutely love children and i know that i want a job that somehow ties into working with young kids. ive been thinking about pursuing a bachelor of psychology, as ive done it in both my gcse and my a-levels so im pretty familiar with it, and i love learning about it. however, ive also found it quite hard to grasp in school despite liking learning about the little facts in psychology such as freud psychodynamic theory. ive also never seen myself working as a psychologist or going into that specific industry. on the other had, ive had experience working in a nursery and the environment was a place i really loved as i adore being around kids and teaching them skills. so because of that, ive chosen early childhood education as my course, and its much easier to get a job after graduating because of the high demand for teachers, whereas its more competitive in the field of psychology. but now i feel like im kinda missing out on all the knowledge i could be learning if i had picked psychology and i dont know if i made the right decision. any advice from anyone? i would really appreciate it.",

I've been studying medicine on my own for years and it was always my plan to end up in med school but due to severe medical issues I've never even managed to finish the most basic education in my country and I feel like I'm too old to be redoing so. Would it somehow be possible to apply to uni in a different country with my current education? I cannot in my country as the law states I have to finish high school to apply to university but I have seen it's different in some places.

That shit is so unhelpful.\n\n \n\nI wish that I could sign up for a course and have the professor give me the textbook, lecture slides, and say lmk when you want to take the final. Could take a month, could take a year, who cares. 1 try to pass the test per purchase of the class, and if you get like 70% or above, they give you the credit.\n\n \n\n As a stem major where most of the information you need to know is memorization, I think that deadlines (whether it be a midterm, assignments due or even the semester ending) is causing me to prioritize information, and focus on short term memorization, to pass the test, turn the assignment in, then forget. If I have infinite time to prepare for the final, I could explore topics I find interesting, dive deeper into topics, and learn a shit load better than just cramming for the test, or trying to complete the assignment before midnight.\n\n \n\nWhat’s stupid is that in the real world you COULD DO THIS. Most textbooks now a days are open source online, and YouTube and AI have proven to be a better teacher than some of my profs. The only problem with learning this way is that you don’t get a STUPID PIECE OF PAPER that says this person is an expert. No job would take someone with a “self-taught Biochem degree” over someone with an actual degree in the field, no matter the skill level.\n\n \n\nAnyway I would love y’all’s take on my idea, I’ve never really heard of people learning like this and getting a degree, also if there is any key details to know why unis don’t do this, would love to hear it.\n\n \n\nTLDR: I think time limits in uni are stupid and preventing people from actually gaining knowledge in their field. I think unis should just give u all the material at the start and if you pass the test, give u the credit.",

I wanted to go to the University of Toronto, but they said the placements have to be done in Toronto. Sucks cause I will be working east of Ottawa, but would love my degree to come from UT. It’s kind of my dream at the moment. Even considering taking their Masters Degree, too. I know Ottawa has a couple of good universities, but I was aiming for ones that rank highest on the world list. Has anyone heard of an exception to these courses? Do my placement here but the courses online?\n\nThank you for any advice.",

Time is running out fast and I’ve done everything I possibly could.\n\nI’m an international student pursuing a bachelor’s degree. I was studying in the US for the past two years and had completed my sophomore year, but due to unfortunate circumstances, my SEVIS was terminated and my US visa got revoked. That alone was devastating but I refused to give up on my education.\n\nI applied to universities in Australia and got accepted into Australian National University ANU, one of the top universities in the country. They accepted most of my US credits and I was beyond relieved. I’ve already\n• Paid my first semester’s full tuition\n• Enrolled in my classes\n• Secured my accommodation\n\nThe classes officially started on July 21st, but I requested a delay due to visa issues and the university kindly gave me an extension until August 4th.\n\nThe problem\nI applied for my Australian student visa almost a month ago and there’s still no update. No approval, no decision, just complete silence.\nI even reached out to the Australian Embassy to try and expedite the process but I’ve received no response. I’m now completely out of ideas and the August 4th deadline is just days away.\n\nI don’t know what to do. I don’t know if ANU will give me another extension. I don’t know if I can request to start classes online somehow while I wait for the visa. I don’t even know who to contact anymore. But this is my dream. I’ve already lost one chance in the US and I can’t afford to lose this too.\n\nI’ve done everything right\n• My documents were complete\n• I have good academic standing\n• No criminal record\n• A strong study plan\n• Everything paid and ready to go\n\nPlease if anyone has gone through this before or knows what I can do, I’d be so grateful for your help. Even if you don’t, any advice, direction, or even emotional support would mean a lot to me right now.\n\nSpecifically, I’m desperate to know\n• Is there any way to expedite the visa process at this point\n• Can ANU allow further deferral or temporary online start until I get my visa\n• Has anyone dealt with long student visa wait times from Australia recently\n• Any official contacts or people who might help speed things up\n\nThank you to anyone who read this. I’ve worked so hard to hold onto my education and I feel like I’m watching it slip away again. Please help in any way you can. Even the smallest reply helps.\n\nPosting this across relevant subreddits because I really don’t have time and I need advice fast.",

      "text": "I was told by one of my friend immigrants who lives in Greece since childhood, that in Europe when you get a let’s say electrical engineer degree - then you have to work as an electrical engineer and nothing else, so essentially you are constrained to work in a niche of your initial education; whereas in the US you could be a nuclear engineer by degree but work as an aerospace engineer just cause you have a skillset overlap. When I browsed for careers in the US on indeed.com most of the positions didn’t even specify the engineering degree required for certain positions like “aerospace engineer” etc. \nSo I want to know if it’s true that in Europe this is less flexible than in the US. Would appreciate the answer a lot!!",

      "title": "URGENT I need help with my university decision. PLEASE DECIDE WITH ME I NEED UNBIASED OPINIONS",
      "text": "I need advice about my university degree. To start it out I love the healthcare field, my entire family works in it in some way shape or form. Both of my parents are dentists and I really would love to go into this field. I graduated last year but because of some issues from the school my diploma was not given to all students immediately. Now here comes the problem, I’m a foreigner in the country we’re residing in and it’s always been decided that I would study abroad, either the eu or some other country. The reason as to why is that the country we live doesn’t allow foreign dentists to practice unless you work as a dental assistant or find some other loophole.\n\nSo while waiting for my diploma to come I just decided to go into a MBG degree in the country I reside in because the first year subjects are the same and if I couldn’t transfer the subjects because of any reason I wouldn’t have wasted a hefty tuition fee. It is a bit relevant to note ig that I ranked as the valedictorian in my graduating class and have good competitive scores (not Harvard scores but compared to local ones they’re good).The university I’m in is incredible it ranks 7th in the country and provides a lot of ways for the student to succeed, moreover, I’m ranked first in my class and 8th in the engineering faculty and I got an honors scholarship on top of the scholarship o already got upon registering (75% and now 15%).\n\nTwo months ago my parents decided that it is not feasible to send me outside, even after all the planning and work that I put in. First it was fine if my tuition fee was under 15k a year then it slowly regressed, with no clear reason as to why. Through her relatives my mom was able to find a uni that is around 4-5k a year for dentistry, but the uni is ranked 89th in the country (not even ranked in times education), the cons of this uni are many it’s 11 hrs away from the city we live in, I know no one there, it is minuscule with nothing around to see, I researched and there’s relevant about this uni anywhere except it has one of the highest acceptance rates and is not that great, moreover I still don’t know the language of this country and the language of program is in it so I’ll have to learn.\n\nAfter traveling there by myself and registering I ended up crying for weeks and begged my parents to let me atleast apply to other unis and they agreed. Because now it’s the end of the summer, and applications for good universities end in June and early July, I just tried applying to unis close to my city and I got into one ranked 31st and has a very good reputation and is only an hour and half by car and 3 by public transportation, however the tuition fees were a lot higher than I expected compared to last year. The tuition fees were 9.5k. I got the acceptance letter when I was at another families home and I told my elder relatives and they all said to just tell my parents and then if smth was to happen they’ll try to convince them and help with the fees.\n\nWhen I went home both of my parents were happy and were making fun of me for being so stressed about them not agreeing they even told me to go to the uni and ask about the deadlines for the payment of the tuition fees. After going there ( I spent 6 hrs on the road) my mom said I have to discuss some things with your dad, there are four things to note: 1. My parents’ relationship is bad my dad is probably a cheater and my mom wants a divorce but she stopped working a while ago so that’s hard 2. My dad is very unreliable 3. I’m the only kid they’ll get to send to uni I have another siblings but they’re disabled so I’m basically my families retirement plan 4.\n\nThe deadline for paying 4.5k is the 18th of this month (tmrw) The day after I came from the uni some of my moms relatives come and we ended up on a call with my other relatives too and they said it’s stupid to waste money a degree when you could get it for cheaper, the ranking when you become a practitioner doesn’t count and you should always chase stability, and that whatever money I would put into the close uni could go into my specialty. However my dad was against all of this he wanted me to be close but as I said he’s more of an unreliable person. The agreement between my parents was that if I go to the far uni my mom would pay all of it and my dad would shoulder the expenses, because my mom has a savings fund for my uni and it only has enough for the far uni.\n\nNow I’m fighting with both of my parents, my mom for wanting me to go away even though I get her pov, and my dad for being unreliable. I told my mom that we could compromise and that she could pay whatever she was going to pay on the far uni, and I would work as a tutor or some other part time job during uni and try and save for the rest as the next semester payment is in 6 months, my salary at a minimum would be 500$ and my dads family already offered that they would help, they’ve already helped other kids in the family. My mom completely disagreed and said that I wouldn’t be a burden even though going to the far uni would completely isolate me and lowk ruin me mentally. My dad is asking my mom to pay first semester and then he’d pay the second but she also didn’t agree. And now idk what to do or if I’m wrong, ik that the entire post is a bit vague and the hurtful things that have been said to me have not been included but yeah I need advice that is not biased because my moms family is siding with the far uni and my dads side and friends are siding with the closer uni. (Some ppl are saying that my mom’s family is siding with the other uni so they wouldn’t have to lend us money which is valid either way).\n\nI’ll say it again working here is lowk impossible unless you go through so many loopholes which I wouldn’t want so I’ll have to go abroad for my masters or intern abroad or some other thing abroad, I would like that if I’m specializing to go into a good university to specialize in if that makes sense. Also I would like to clear up that if I go into the closer uni I would live in dorms and that would cost like max 200$ a year but if I go the far uni I would be renting an apartment for myself and that would be more expensive, my moms idea is that I would live more comfortably there and why bother myself with possibly living with 3-5 ppl when I can live by myself, the far uni is also 3 hrs away from the closest big city and airport so there’s also that.\n\nSo now my options are going to the far uni, or convincing my mom of going to the closer uni, or staying in the uni I’m already and double majoring with smth and settling for that. Also I really love dentistry and I’m wondering if going to the bad university would be career destroying and is basically suicide. (Any money that will be lended to me will if god wills be paid when I start working)",

      "text": "Sooo I'm going into my senior year and I really did want to apply to a nice traditional university with good education after highschool. For reference, I live in Canada, and it's honestly really hard to find anything affordable here. I thought about moving abroad and exploring cheaper options but I have family who are very unpredictable and complicated and might want to move to a completely different country like 6 months later despite any of my wishes to stay in a traditional university. I also really love traveling, which is something I don't want to lose if I go to a traditional university.\n\nIt's honestly kind of a bummer for me because I feel like I have a lot of potential to get into an well rounded, good school as I'm basically a straight A student; but depending on where I want to go, I either don't have the money or the support and that kind of ruins everything. So I was wondering, and I know I've seen lots of hate on online unis, but I was hoping to look for a good online university that's budget friendly; but also one where I can get job opportunities afterwards, since I know many people think that manh online students are just there to get shortcuts, and that's tough to face for someone who works genuinely hard and wants to try.\n\nAs a highschool student I've had to take a semester worth of classes online and I found I worked pretty well and was taught time management skills. I understand that there's not really a teacher that's gonna be holding your hand but despite that I actually had fun doing online, so I thought \"hey, maybe this might work.\"\n\nI did some research, and I can't really find any online Canadian universities that offer computer science programs. I saw uopeople and considered it because of it's pricing and programs. But I don't think it's loved very much?? I haven't seen much people talking about it and I just feel like everything I worked so hard for in highschool will go to waste since their acceptance rate is literally 100%. I also don't super trust them cause they have a completion rate of 21%. If I could get any feedback I'd appreciate it.",

I would want nothing more than to get out of this state, and never come back. CU Boulder is the school they want me to go to. If you haven’t heard anything about Boulder, let me put it into perspective for you. 40,000+ students, 65%+ white, oh and did I mention it snows ❄️? Not the type you’re thinking… The demographic of students consists of frat boys and white  girls that only ended up there because they got rejected from the UC’s and maybe a few thousand who care about their education. Why would someone would move to Colorado from any other state? The entire social scene revolves around partying, football games, and more parties. I do understand a lot of people really couldn’t care less about half of this. They might even like it there, I’m not trying to judge. \n\nI hate parties. I hate big schools. I don’t think I can survive longer than a semester at CU.\n\nI want to go to school in Seattle. I visited the school, and I don’t think I’ve ever loved a place like that in my life. The school has and is everything I could ever want, and more.  I know for a fact I will be unhappy at CU, and I don’t want to spend 4 years of my life trying to convince myself otherwise. \n\nThey will cost me the same amount. Currently, I am committed to both schools. My parents will in no way let me go to Seattle. My only option is to get up and leave. I have enough money to pay my tuition for the year, but I would be sacrificing my relationship with my parents (possibly), to go to school. I’ve always done everything my parents want me to, and it honestly breaks my heart that they want me here for their convenience. Their reasons for wanting me to stay are about them, not about me. \n\nIs going to the school I want worth it? Am I selfish?",

      "text": "Hi, I need advice. I’m 16 and will be graduating high school in about 2 more years, so I’ve been getting pressured into thinking about my future by quite literally everyone. But I’m still confused about everything. \n\nWhat I do know for sure, is that I want to take psychology (before you ask, yes. I want to get a masters, and even a Ph.D if it’s possible), but my mother doesn’t support this decision because she is aware that it requires a lot of money and if I go abroad, I won’t have a lot of job opportunities. So she’s trying to get me into business instead.\n\nStill, I’m going for psychology regardless. I’m just unsure of how I’m going to go about this. I’m thinking of taking double majors so I can study psychology and another major that can guarantee me a steady income while I study for my master degree. I think that this approach can also help keep my parents happy because they’re pushing me to start working as soon as I finish my education; only issue is that I’m worried about the financial toll it might take on my family because we’re not that well off. My parents constantly fight due to our financial situation, hence why they’re desperate for me to get a job as soon as possible.\n\nAnother issue is that I’m not sure where to go for college. My dream university is NTU (Nanyang Technological University) in Singapore, but the tuition fees are too much so I’ve pretty much given up on that dream. I also thought about going to Australia because I’ve heard there’s where you should go to study psychology. My mom wants me to go to Taiwan where I can work part-time while studying, or China because that’s where everyone is going nowadays. At this point, I don’t really mind; I’m mostly worried about the possible language barrier I might encounter, despite having taken Chinese lessons since I was a kid. I’ve been learning simplified Chinese for years, and if I were to go to Taiwan, I’m worried I might need to relearn everything because they use traditional Chinese.\n\nAdditionally, both of my younger sisters want to go to China. The middle one wants to go to Zhejiang–if I recall correctly–and the youngest one wants to go to Zhejiang University. I remember once my parents bringing up how my younger sisters will follow wherever I go for university to avoid the complications of different tuition fees in different currencies. I want both of my younger sisters to achieve their respective dreams, so I’m thinking about looking for universities in China to pave the way for their passions as well. \n\nI’m just kinda confused. I don’t know where I should go and what major I can take alongside psychology to keep my mom happy, and am I doing the right thing going to China just so my younger sisters can achieve their own dreams?",

      "text": "I'm an 18-year-old international student currently studying Software Development and Network Engineering at Sheridan College. I’ve just completed my first year in the Advanced Ontario Diploma program. I chose this path because it fit within my family's budget and offered a practical, career-focused education. However, after more research and personal reflection, I'm now considering a change. Sheridan also offers an Honours Bachelor of Applied Information Science (Cybersecurity) program, which is more academically focused, and still remains within our financial means. That would give me a Bachelor's degree without the need to transfer out of Sheridan.\n\nThat said, my relatives have brought up an important point: if I'm already considering a Bachelor's degree and we're open to increasing the tuition budget, why not go further and transfer to a university like York? The idea is that if we're going to invest more, it might be better to do so at a university with broader recognition, stronger research opportunities, and better long-term academic value. With considerable effort and sacrifices, my family can afford university tuition, and I’ve qualified for York’s entrance scholarship—$15,000 in the first year and $7,500 in subsequent years—which brings the first-year cost roughly in line with Sheridan. But starting from the second year, the tuition difference becomes more significant, and would require us to tighten our daily expenses and live with less financial flexibility.\n\nNow I'm trying to weigh the long-term value of a university degree against the stability and lower cost of staying at Sheridan. Will a college Bachelor’s limit me when it comes to future opportunities, like applying for graduate school, working abroad, or entering more research-heavy roles? Or is it wiser to graduate with less financial strain, especially if I can build a strong portfolio and experience through Sheridan’s co-op placements? I’m at a point where this decision could shape my academic and financial future, and I’d really appreciate any advice from those who’ve navigated similar paths—especially in tech and computer science fields.\n\nThank you in advance.",

Before discovering OT, my thought process was to become a RN and soon get my masters to become a NP. But recently a lot of people have been asking me, if I am sure about my decision. Even nurses themselves asked me if I am sure about my decision. So this makes me question myself and that leads to confusing and anxiousness.\n\nAll I know is I would love to work in a medical field aspect, being with patients. I love kids and I love psychology and I know in both i can tackle it. What scares me entering nursing, is the hours, the amount of study and the work after, since i know it's a tiring job but what job isnt? The pros of OT as what I heard, is that it's less tiring and it has a good pay. But I know both will be fulfilling.\n\nI don't know if i should go for OT or Nursing, but my heart has always been drawn to nursing, the idea of taking someones blood and all that. But I also would love to help others with their daily life as what OTs do and I know it will be a less stressful route. I only got the jist of OT cause they all said its a less tiring and stressful environment. I acutally don't know a lot about OTs so please do educate me on that!\n\nFor reference, I will be studying these courses in the Philippines, specifically in Cebu. Tuition aside, which course do you think is more worth my time and effort? And which will be more worth it in the long run? Job opportunities, salaries and work environment?\n\nPS. The plan is to gain experience in PH, and work abroad\n\nPlease do share, because I am truly stuck. Many thanks!",

However, I now recognise that this approach may have violated the University’s expectations around academic integrity, and I regret not seeking formal support or clarification before proceeding.\n\n\n\nThis is my first experience with any academic misconduct process, and I want to make it clear that there was never any intention to cheat, deceive, or gain an unfair advantage. I acknowledge that what I did was a lapse in judgment, driven by a combination of pressure, confusion, and inexperience. I now have a much better understanding of what constitutes appropriate academic conduct, and I am committed to upholding those standards moving forward.\n\n\n\nI take full responsibility for my actions and I am more than willing to participate in any academic skills training or educational remediation the University recommends. I genuinely value my place at Western Sydney University and the opportunity to continue progressing in my studies. I understand the importance of trust, honesty, and academic integrity, and I will ensure that this type of situation does not occur again in the future.\n\n\n\nI appreciate the opportunity to provide my perspective and respectfully request that this matter be considered under the Inappropriate Behaviour Guidelines if deemed appropriate. Please let me know if there is any further information or clarification I can provide.",

I can't decide whether I should get into business or sciences.\n\nBased on what I know, there are many pros associated with business programs, especially Schulich. The first two years are more general so I have time to narrow down my options, it is a guaranteed pathway if I get accepted, it is a very engaging environment, etc. However, I'm not sure if I fit the whole \"business\" persona, since I feel like my personality better matches science careers that aim to help others. The only thing is- I can't handle blood, vomit or hospitals.  \nWhich degree/pathway is better overall? Is science even worth the many years of education? What were your experiences and takeaways?",

My name is Alifah, and I’m currently pursuing a Bachelor of Environmental Planning in Science and the Environment at the University of Waikato in Hamilton, New Zealand.\n\nI have proudly completed my first year of study with strong grades, and I still have three more years to go before I graduate and fulfill my dream of becoming an environmental consultant or engineer, someone who works on real-world solutions to climate change, conservation, and sustainability.\n\nPersonal Description\nI am a proud Singaporean-Indonesian. My father was Singaporean, but sadly passed away when I was little. My amazing mother, an Indonesian woman living in Jakarta, has been my only provider, raising me and my two sisters with strength and love.\n\nDespite the financial challenges, I have held onto a dream that’s been with me since childhood to protect the natural world, to support communities affected by environmental harm, and to one day contribute to places like National Parks or the Department of Conservation.\n\nWhy This Matters\nComing from a developing country and witnessing my first climate disaster in my own community made me realize how deeply the environment affects every part of life — especially for those who are most vulnerable.\n\nThat’s when I knew: I want to be part of the solution!\n\nNew Zealand has given me the opportunity to start this journey — but continuing it is financially difficult. As an international student, tuition fees and living expenses are high, and my mother’s income alone is no longer enough to support the remaining three years of study.\n\nHow You Can Help\nYour support, no matter how small, will directly go toward.\n\nTuition fees\nLiving costs (accommodation, food, transportation)\nAcademic materials and resources\n\nYour donation is not just helping me finish a degree — it’s an investment in the future of our planet, and in a young woman striving to make a difference in the world.\n\nLet’s Connect\nI would love to chat, collaborate, or even connect with sponsors who are interested in supporting education, climate action, or youth empowerment. I’m committed to paying this support forward and helping small communities in return.\n\nThank you so much for reading, sharing, and supporting my journey. Together, we can make a difference — for me, for the environment, and for the future we all share.\n\nContact : alifahputri013@gmail.com\n\nWith gratitude,\nAlifah",

      "text": "I’m a 21 year old university student in my third-ish year of undergrad going to Canada as an international student. My country of origin is the United States and I live incredibly close to the border. All the schools that accepted me in the US, yes even public schools (my state is generally more expensive overall), were more expensive than going to school in Canada. Tuition alone at a state school here is equivalent to both tuition and room and board at my current institution.\n\nEven though I am so close to finishing up my degree, I may have to drop out due to lack of financial aid.\n\nLet’s just say my family is not quite the genetically blessed bunch; both of my parents, my sister, as well as myself all have medical issues that require we go to multiple specialists. My father has had to get multiple surgeries done in the past five years. For a decent amount of time, I was on disability medicaid through our state’s program, but it has long since expired and has been a pain to reinstate due to the fact that I needed a part time job to help my family pay off our regular expenses and also just because of how convoluted every governmentally run program is to apply for.\n\nMy situation now: I am in need of about $25,000 USD for school this upcoming year. I was able to receive a small amount of an unsubsidized loan already from FAFSA, but they aren’t offering me more and determine my SAI to be high due to the fact that within the past few (less than 5) years my parents have gotten better paying jobs. It feels so unfair that they only judge your need based on income and not income-to-debt, or recognize that ALMOST ALL OF OUR MONEY IS GOING TO PAY OFF OLD MEDICAL BILLS IN THIS COUNTRY THAT CHARGES $75 FOR A BAND-AID!!! There is no additional student aid program for disabled students! \n\nOur credit scores are all terrible because of how many times we’ve had to take out loans and put medical bills on credit cards after my dad’s major procedures and even our regular copays and medication costs. I’ve been approved for a Sallie Mae loan last year, but now I am not getting approved for one this year. My school doesn’t accept many other types of student/education specific program funding directly (due to the international aspect?), and at this point I don’t care if I need to take out a personal loan with a terrible interest rate and transfer that money to my student account- I just need to finish my program. \n\nSo basically, I am in desperate need of advice and recommendations of where else to go for getting loans or if anybody knows of any scholarship opportunities for disabled students, or hell even if there’s a way to eliminate our medical debt through some forgiveness program as that would get rid of my family’s main issue entirely. We are just completely stuck and I really don’t want to quit on my education especially when I’ve gotten this far and already accrued education debt from what I’ve already started.\n\nSorry for the long emotional rant but this has seriously been bringing me down for months.",

I’ve already got a really good computer thankfully but I want to know if an iPad to write with would be good? Also, would a laptop truly be necessary? I’ve heard many people say that school computers cover most things and considering I have my own PC I should be able to sue that for anything else I hope. Please do let me know. Want to get the iPad mainly because I don’t like writing with pen and paper to be honest. Fine for tests and exams but for note taking and persona use I’d rather use an iPad. Feel free to share your experiences and what worked for you. Excited to join this field of education and hope to succeed. Thank you in advance.",

      "text": "The title says it all but I will explain. (please ignore my awful spelling I am tired and lazy) I started university in 2023, so am just finishing my second year. I am studying an education course and have been working in education since I was 16. \n\nI have been really struggling with my health and have been in and out of hospital for the whole year, yet have still achieved reasonable grades. My teachers show nothing but disappointment despite me being very clear about how I have a recently diagnosed disability which causes chronic pain that makes it hard for me to always attend and be on time. I even have permission from the disability team to miss lectures if need be. The uni aren't able to make reasonable adjustments for me, and will provide few online resources, yet I am made to feel like I should be in even if I am in a huge amount of pain. To make matters worse I commute in to lectures, sometimes having to pull over due to the pain I am in. I never would have started uni if I knew I was this ill, AND to make matters worse, I have fallen out of love with my area of work. I don't feel like I want to/can work with children anymore. I am twennty-two, have lost two babies, one to an ectopic pregnancy, I am probably infertile, when I see my students, I cant help but see my babies and it is taking a huge toll on my mental health. I work part time alongside my course and I just feel like I am drowning. The plan was to get a degree to become a TEFL teacher and move abroad for a couple of years with my partner, but since all this I have really lost faith in myself, and feel like I am not good enough. Bare in mind, I am well travelled, confident, a good teacher, it's just that my tutors make me feel not good enough. \n\nI am due to be having an upcoming surgery just before we go back, and am thinking of just packing it in and going on a two year working holiday in Austraila instead once I am healed. Finding my passions before coming back in a better position to settle down and devote myself to a degree. \n\nThough I do worry that I am acting out of emotion not logic and that this is a bad decision. I mean, I could always take a year out? I have the qualifications from both years, which would let me top up if I want to go back into education at any point. \n\nJust unsure and connfused about what to do. Educating is the only job I have ever done and just feel ready for a change, but what do you guys think?",

I don’t have the grades for dental hygiene programs in my area. I also thought about teaching English outside of the US with a degree but I’d have to get an education degree and it’s so far from nursing curriculum that I feel like I wouldn’t graduate in forever and wasted the pre reqs I got. I also doubt the pay would be great. I thought about marine biology but that’s another thing too of having low job security and low income. It would take me a long time to even build myself up to making a liveable wage or doing what I want. I’m just really interested in these though but money is an issue and I don’t know if healthcare or nursing is meant for me anymore",

I will need to talk to housing about this but I wanted to ask if it would even be legal for my school to deny her living with me.\n\nIt’s an on campus ground floor apartment set up (imagine trailer park lol) so not a typical apartment building. 3 roommates and they’re all aware and happy with the dog situation. Also the dog has been through a variety of training both by me and professionals.\n\nAnyways my problem comes with the housing director herself. She is very sexist when it comes to dealing with students issues. Back to the whole 2000 people thing, since it’s a small campus and everyone lives on campus, you know everyone’s business. A friend of mine (female) applied to live off campus with a variety of proof of mental health issues and notes from doctors but she got denied by the housing director saying it wasn’t sufficient enough to warrant off campus housing. Then some guys I know (males, duh and hockey players) applied with letters just written by themselves and no doctors notes to live off campus with the same reasoning and got accepted and told that if they couldn’t find a place off campus they get first choice of premium housing as sophomores. \n\nAnyways I am a woman and I am very scared of having to deal with my housing director so I’m looking for advice or if someone could give me some points to write about in a letter to her.\n\nThank you",

      "text": "Hey everyone,\n\nI could really use some outside perspective, because I feel pretty lost with this decision. My dream is to do a **Master’s in Neurobiology in the Netherlands**. The two possible paths I see are:\n\n# Option 1: Medical School  in Hungarian\n\n**Pros:**\n\n* I’d have a professional degree (medicine), so if I don’t get into the MSc, I still have a stable career to fall back on.\n* Strong foundation in biology/physiology, which could also help with neurobiology later.\n* High social prestige, respected diploma in the EU.\n\n**Cons:**\n\n* It’s very long and extremely demanding (6 years + residency).\n* If I’m set on research, a lot of the medical training won’t be directly useful.\n* It’s a less straightforward path toward a research MSc abroad.\n* Stressful lifestyle with less time for research projects or extra activities.\n\n# Option 2: Biology BSc at UBB\n\n**Pros:**\n\n* More direct route into neurobiology MSc – everything I study is directly relevant.\n* Easier to get research experience (labs, projects, Erasmus, conferences).\n* Shorter (3 years BSc + 2 years MSc).\n* More freedom and flexibility compared to med school.\n\n**Cons:**\n\n* No “backup career” if the MSc doesn’t work out right away.\n* Less social prestige compared to medicine.\n* Career path depends heavily on being accepted into MSc and later research positions.\n\nSo here’s my actual dilemma:\n\nI’m **100% sure neurobiology research is my dream**, but if I don’t get into the MSc, I’d have nothing solid to fall back on with just a Biology BSc. My parents keep pushing me towards medicine – when I mentioned biology, they basically said *“you always choose the easier path, and you wouldn’t get into an MSc anyway, so why dream?”*\n\nI still have time to decide, but this pressure makes it harder to think clearly.  \n**Which option do you think makes more sense in the long run?**  \nWould love to hear from people with experience in academia/grad school.\n\nThanks a lot 🙏",

      "text": "Hello! I have begun my preparations for my high school examination assignment, where I will gather information about people's mental health. The questionnaire will be shared multiple times, as I aim to examine subjective differences between perceived mental health in relation to time of year. The intervals or periods during which the questionnaire will be open are: 1/8/2025 - 1/9/2025, 1/12/2025 - 1/2/2026, and 1/4/2026 - 1/5/2026. In this questionnaire, there may be personal questions regarding diagnoses, medication, and lifestyle, which some might find triggering. If you believe you'll have a difficult time completing the questionnaire, please refrain from participating.\n\nIf you feel like helping me with this project by answering the questionnaire to the best of your abilities, there are a few instructions;\n\nPlease give yourself a nickname, as I will be publishing the questionnaire twice more. For data management, it is easier for me to analyse individual answers and correlations. One such name could be a username you used when you were younger, or \"rottenteeth420\" \\[note: ***Do not use the nickname \"rottenteeth420\"***\\]. Use a name that is easy to remember, as this questionnaire will be shared again. Failure to submit a ***unique*** nickname will result in me having to disregard your answers. ***(You only need to use a nickname in the questionnaire, and I advise you not to write it in the comment section here on Reddit.)***\n\n*When you've completed the questionnaire (which should take 10-20 minutes), I ask that you write \"finished\" in the comment section here on Reddit, so I can send the questionnaire directly to you when the next period of information gathering starts.*\n\nFor anonymity, I will not be looking at who has answered the questionnaire (ie, not looking for correlation between submission of the questionnaire and time of comment on Reddit), and you will not have to use an email to identify yourself.\n\n[https://forms.gle/f7jDgyjAHeVRqXn29](https://forms.gle/f7jDgyjAHeVRqXn29)\n\nThank you for helping me out!",

I know, of course, the university wants you to stay, but I still want to try exploring different opportunities for myself and I’m not sure if credits and report cards from university needed to be added when my highschool grades are the main evaluation. \n\nI’m also just nervous at the idea of applying myself and not through an institution.\n\nDoes anyone have any experience with this? And did your university help? \n\nAdditionally, is it wise to continue attending in the midst of applying somewhere else? \n\nI’d be wasting a years worth of money if I get in, but I’m really conflicted about the idea of deferring because my parents want to move countries and I want to remain where we currently are, staying here for university allows me to do that. \n\nI’d also feel really out of place if I didn’t get in anywhere and had to start university later than all my peers. \n\nSome advice would be appreciated.",

I’m doing some biology and chemistry competitions and taking courses online, but I’m really passionate about medicine and really want to dedicate myself to it. Are there any realistic but impactful ECs you would recommend? (I also think ECs are very limited for international students, It’s a very real issue!) I’m desperate atp, so any advice or encouragement will suffice. Thank you so so much in advance!",

It's tedious, error-prone, and a total time-sink. \n\nSo, I decided to do something about it. I've been working on **AcademicSync**.\n\n**Here's how it works:**\n\n1. You log in (quick Google or email signup).\n2. You upload a screenshot or image of your class schedule (the one from your student portal, etc.).\n3. Our AI processes it, extracts all the course names, times, days, and locations.\n4. With your permission, it **instantly creates all your events directly in your Google Calendar!**\n\nNo more typing. No more missed classes because you messed up a time slot. Just upload, click, and your schedule is perfectly organized.\n\n**Why did I build this?**\n\n* **Save time:** Seriously, think of how much time this takes every semester.\n* **Accuracy:** Let AI handle the details, reduce human error.\n* **Peace of mind:** Your calendar is updated, automatically.\n\nIt's currently in its early stages/beta, and I'd love for students to try it out and give me feedback. Your input would be super valuable in making it even better.\n\n**Check it out here:** ,[`https://www.academicsync.com/`](https://www.academicsync.com/)\n\nLet me know if you give it a try and what you think! Any questions or suggestions are welcome.\n\nThanks! The AcademicSync Dev",

      "text": "I have been debating if I want to spend $300,000+(CAD) on an undergrad abroad. Is it even worth that much? For reference I want to go to the UK, top school is Edinburgh. But idk if I can justify because I will also be paying for four years of med school in the US after my undergraduate. Mind you once I am done schooling my starting salary will be $243,000 a year(lowest starting wage). The median, about 5 years later, is $363,129. So I will be making a lot later on in life, but when going into university I will have little to no financial support from my parents so I will rely on loans. I REALLY want to go abroad because I feel like that’s what life is all about. Before I decided on not taking a gap year I was going to travel for a whole year, but I have been advised against doing so because it’s hard to get back into academics with a year off. I’m also scared if I took a gap year I wouldn’t go back to school. So is study abroad life worth it? Med school will be an additional $100,000. I will have to do 5 years of residency after med-school which will make me about $487,00. I am doing all of these calculations in CAD because it makes the most sense for me. But I feel like if I don’t go abroad I will spend every summer volunteering in different countries because I can’t stay in my home county, there’s so much of the world, staying in one place feels suffocated. Any advice is helpful!",

      "text": "# Columbia or Berkeley for documentary filmmaking and journalism?\n\nGot into Columbia and Berkeley for documentary filmmaking. Columbia is 1 year full time, Berkeley is 2 years full time. Got a 30k scholarship for Columbia, no scholarship for Berkeley but it's a public university so cheaper. That said, given it's a 2-year full time course, the costs (inc. living expenses) are pretty much on an exact par. Trying to decide between the two but it's super tough. I'm an international student moving over from London, which also adds logistical challenges. I should add that I got into international housing for both though so while living costs are a concern I think I can find ways to do both cheaply.\n\n**My dilemma:**\n\n**Columbia**\n\nPros - Ivy League prestige, arguably the best uni in the world for journalism, 1 year full time hands on course, great media contacts, I get the impression it would open a lot of doors. Exciting opportunity, great hands on education, living in the media epicentre of the world. Ticks some of my lifestyle goal boxes (I love art, culture, music), intrigued by NYC's culture.\n\nCons - Expensive, all the recent political unrest with Trump's federal funding cuts, the Khalil case, very expensive course, 1 year full time sounds very intense, I don't particularly love New York - I'm intrigued by it and have enjoyed it when I've been there before - but I'm not a city gal. I worry how much freedom of speech I'd really have given the current climate.\n\n**Berkeley**\n\nPros - Public Ivy, in California (a location I know I'd love), 2 year full time course seems a big time investment but atleast it would give me time to really develop my voice and craft without burning out, it's the birthplace of the free speech movement, seems to have a strong activism and social impact focus, which is the direction I want my documentary filmmaking career to go in. Better suits my lifestyle (I love nature, sun, hiking, surfing, etc.)\n\nCons - 2 year full time course seems a big time investment (but this could also be a pro), not an ivy league, I don't know how much weight employers actually put on this though? Seems just as prestigious and globally recognised, public university so I question whether Trump's federal cuts would have a greater impact on them. I'd be coming into the course with less camera and editing skills than the rest of the cohort so I'd have some catching up to do. Training may not be as hands on as Columbia.\n\nIn an ideal world, I'd do both - 1 year at Columbia and then a fellowship at Berkeley, but obviously money is a factor and that wouldn't be possible unless I got funding. They're both great universities HELP!",

      "text": "Hey wsp, I would like to know your opinion on this. I am Chilean and in my freshman year at HG I went to live in Austin TX, until I graduated last year. Right now I at my freshman year studying business and economics at the University of Chile, which is ranked as the best in all of Latin America. \nThe main reason why I came to study in Chile was because of pressure from my parents, but now that I have been here for a while, I have realized that what I want most is to go to a university in the United States for multiple reasons such as the lack of opportunities in my country, how closed-minded people are here, the lack of opportunities to undertake, create personal projects, get good jobs with well life balance, and also because the quality of life here is much lower in my opinion and I really don't enjoy being here.  \n\nSo the idea of ​​going to study in the U.S. keeps coming back to my head, but every time I talk about it with friends here or family, they tell me to stay since the university I'm at right now is very good and that maybe in the future I should go there to get a postgraduate degree.\n From everything I've researched, transferring from a foreign university to one in the United States is very complicated and most likely I'll have to go to one that isn't as good as the one I'm at right now. Or my other option would be to go to a community college, stay there for a while, and then transfer to a good university. But there are people who think my plan is too risky and that I should stay. \n\nSo I don't know what to do, and I would like to know your opinion on what you would recommend me, what you would do in this case, or about any experiences transferring from foreign universities to American ones. \n\nThanks :)",

I was in a program which didn’t include secondary 5(grade 11) \n\nOn top of that, I have dyscalculia, which means math is nearly impossible for me. It was one of the biggest reasons I struggled in school. No matter how hard I tried, I couldn’t pass math, and eventually, I didn’t finish high school because of it.\n\nNow, I’m at a point in my life where I want to do everything I can to pursue my dreams. I don’t want to just stay home or work a job knowing I have the potential to go further. I don’t want to settle for something else. I don’t want to be my own boss or find an alternative path, I want to go to university. It would mean everything to me.\n\nI don’t know exactly what I want to do yet because I have so many interests, but I do know that none of them require math. The only thing standing in my way is figuring out how to get into university or college without a diploma.\n\nI’ve heard about things like mature student status, college pathways, and GEDs, but I’m not sure what would work best for someone in my situation. I refuse to let this hold me back. If there’s a way in, I’ll find it, I just need to know what options are out there.\n\nThank you for your answers in advance ☺️🫶🏻",

It's already 27th March. Does anyone know when this RD for Parsons could come out?\n\nIs there anyone else who applied for architectural design? Waiting for their result or have already got it? Please help me out.\n\nAlso, if you got in, please tell me your accreditations, essays and ECAS. I am honestly really lost as to how it can take this long to get a result.",

      "title": "Should I pursue my masters at a school in Canada (home country) or my dream uni in the UK?",
      "text": "Hi y'all! I hope you are all doing spledidly during these uncertain times!\n\nFor context here, I am a 4th year undergraduate student at McGill University, and I am studying in their Honours International Development Studies program. I am originally from Toronto, and am looking to pursue a Masters of Arts/Science in hopes of working in refugee work and human rights sectors of either the government or Intl' orgs/NGOs. During my time at university, I studied abroad at the University of Edinburgh and absolutely LOVED it! I met some of the best people ever there, learned a lot, and did relatively well at my studies there. I also got to travel a ton and gain valuable experiences related to living over 5000km from home. It truly was a dream experience, and it made me want to apply there for my masters the following year as it was a dream to study there again.\n\nHere's where the problems start. My parents have graciously offered to pay some of my tuition fees, and while they don't outright say that they have a preference of a school for me to attend, they have off-handedly said that they would like me to return back to Toronto for my masters. To make matters more interesting, my boyfriend is from Ottawa and suggested I move there to pursue my graduate studies due to the COOP and thesis opportunities that the school has with the federal government. A bonus is that a good friend of mine from uni is there as well (going to Carleton) and it would be very affordable to move there for my studies as well. While both options have great benefits (and some drawbacks), I really want to move abroad and study at the University of Edinburgh, as I loved it there and now even have my best friends that are going to attend for their masters (in STEM). However, in my field, it can be tough to get a job if you do a masters outside of Canada, as the Federal Government is dramatically reducing their student positions for the next few years.\n\nThis is a dire and desparate decision to make, as I recently got into both of UofT’s MGA and MPP programs (with small scholarships) and am struggling to decide on a school to attend next year. I have already gotten into the Graduate School of Public and International Affairs program at uOttawa (with a partial tuition scholarship, COOP, and a major research paper option), as well as the MSc in Global Crime, Justice and Security at the University of Edinburgh (no scholarship, but DREAM SCHOOL). I'm wondering if anyone can share insight into which school to attend, and if I should just give up my dream to study abroad especially as my country is already seeing a dramatic economic and unemployment situation due to the recession and tarrif war that is currently happening. I don't know what option to chose, and I don't want to have any regrets over not studying abroad; however, I just do not know it is feasable to attend the University of Edinburgh. Any thoughts and help would be greatly appreciated as I want to set myself up for a career that allows me to do what I love.\n\n**TL;DR: Want to go back to the University of Edinburgh to do my graduate education, but due to the current sociopolitical climate in Canada, am afraid it is going to mess up my chances at a stable job/future. It is also very expensive and is in a field that might need to be completed domestically for better employment outcomes.**",

Maybe major in an English degree and minor in a French degree? I would have to be very advanced in French in order to teach in the language, and currently I'm between beginner and elementary level. I need a school that can get me to a very fluent point. (I want to live in France one day, if possible, which would help my fluency. Plus, I want to teach there or any French speaking country.)\n\nMy family is in the middle when it comes to money. We have enough for me to go to an in-state school, and we could probably save enough for me to study out of state (though I'm fine with staying). I'd like to study abroad, but that's expensive. \n\nSo, what are some good schools in (or around) Georgia where I could study these things? What degrees would I need for a job like this? What are my options in this career field? How long would it take? Will college get me to a proficient enough level? Will wanting to become an English teacher make it easier to get a visa (English is popular, I assume the country would want native English teachers)? Any and all knowledge or advice is VERY welcome. Google is vague and annoying lol. \n\n(P.s, I don't want to teach highschool English. In my experience, highschool students don't care about their forgien language classes. I want to tutor people who specifically signed up and want to learn English)\n\nMerci !",

      "text": "Hello everyone. I'm planning to apply to NYU early decision in October, but I'm worried my high school marks might reduce my chances at getting accepted. First of all, I'm applying to early decision because I've heard that it gives you a better shot at getting accepted. I do not know if its actually true, but I've heard it. Is it true? Does it actually matter, and does it give me a better chance at getting accepted?\n\nSecond of all, regarding my high school marks. My grade 9 average was a 93, and my grade 10 average was a 92. However, so far for grade 11, my average was 92 in term 1 but I am now on track for a 97/98 for term 2. Since grade 9, I have been taking optional courses every year that should boost my application, but I don't know if thats actually true. For example, I took IGCSE Biology and Business as self study in grade 9, did the exams in grade 10 along with IGCSE math, english, computer science, and arabic. So far in grade 11, I have done the SAT (1340, not great but I didn't even study, just did the exam to see how it's like and I will repeat it), and I am on track to do AP statistics, AP Calculus AB (independent self study), AS biology (independent self study), AS math and business, IGCSE chemistry (independent self study), IGCSE physics and economics. In grade 12, I'm planning to take A-level Math, Further Maths, Physics, Business, Chemistry, Biology, and maybe even Computer Science (most probably not). For my AP's, I will be doing AP Calculus BC, Physics C (mechanics), Computer Science A, Macroeconomics, and Chemistry. Most of these listed subjects will be self study. My point is: if I continue to get 95+ in the rest of grade 11 and 12, do I have a chance of getting in?\n\n\nI know this post is very long and I apologize 😅😅, but I'm really worried I won't get into my top-choice uni, and there isn't really any other good enough universities I can go to where I live. Appreciate everyone's input ☺️☺️",

Previously I was an out of state student at a DIFFERENT college and one semester was 25k so to me, 9k was cheap! The following fall semester was about 3k and that alerted me to look back on the summer semester. I then realized that I was charged as an out of state student when in fact I had submitted my residency identification number correctly and on time to prove otherwise. \n\nI immediately tried to get in contact with the registrar, financial aid and student accounting who then tossed me back and forth between the three unsure who I should go to. I was told I would get several call backs and never did. I want to mention in general you sit on hold for 30 minutes before you’re sent to voice mail. Getting to actually talk to anyone is difficult. I also tried email with no response. \n\nWell fast forward to beginning of Feb 2025, I talked to someone who said “it’s been too long, we can’t back track now” \n\nWhat the hell do I do?",

School has ruined a lot of my interests, and so I didn't have a preference on what program I wanted to get into for university. I ended up going into business because it was the only thing I could get into (bad math and english marks) and the only thing I was just barely interested in. I don't love my program at all, even tho it was the only one I was interested in, but I do love living away from home and in the dorms (thanks to my roommates).   \nI'm kinda stupid and a horrible learner, so I barely understand the theories and process that are being taught in my classes, no matter the study methods I try, I always feel like I don't understand anything.   \nI would much rather be in the workplace than in university. Ever since coming to university, my mental health has been spiraling down. I'm in therapy but it hasn't been helping much lately. I've been told multiple times that university will be the best years of my life, but I honestly think they're going to be my worst. I don't know what to do anymore as even the thought of school can set me off sometimes, it's just all so suffocating.",

      "text": "American universities love to preach accountability — but only when it comes to faculty and students.\n\nProfessors are under constant pressure to meet strict metrics for tenure: publish or perish, student evaluations, research grants, service hours, teaching loads, diversity statements — the list goes on. Every move they make is scrutinized.\n\nMeanwhile, what are university administrators held accountable for? Absolutely nothing, it seems.\n\nThese people can oversee massive budget misallocations, create layers of red tape, ignore student and faculty needs, implement disastrous policies — and still get promotions, six-figure salaries, and even bonuses. There are no clear performance metrics, no transparency, and certainly no consequences.\n\nUniversities increasingly resemble corporations, but with one major difference: if a corporate executive tanked performance this badly, shareholders would revolt. In higher ed? They just expand their departments and invent new titles like \"Associate Vice Provost of Strategic Synergy.\"\n\nHow did we get here? Why is administrative bloat not just tolerated but rewarded? And why does no one seem able to rein it in?\n\nLast question：Isn't the United States a country with a separation of powers? Why isn't there a similar system of checks and balances in universities to restrain these administrative staff?",

I could retake my psychology course again from the first year, but my appeal has to be accepted (not a hundred percent chance it will), and I did not like my psych course at university of Amsterdam anyways. \nI’m thinking of transferring to Unimleb psych course from feb, since  that’s where all my friends went, and they seem to like it enough. I could also just transfer to a different uni in Netherlands, as Unis is Netherlands are more affordable. I also have an option of going to University of Vermont, since my family lives there and I could go typically free. However, I haven’t told my parents yet abt this, and I really don’t know what I should do. I want to choose a good uni to start all over but I still wanna keep it affordable, since I already wasted money by going to uni and dropping out. Is there any good uni I can go to (anywhere in the world) that might be recommended, like cheap US college to study psych? And how should I tell my parents?",

After coming to the U.S. three years ago, I restarted my studies at a community college to pursue an Associate Degree for Transfer (ADT) in Public Health.\n\nHere’s the issue:\nIf I apply to a university as a first bachelor’s degree student, I can transfer my community college credits and study a completely different major from my first degree in my home country. However, since I declared that I already have a bachelor’s degree, the university requires me to apply as a second bachelor’s degree student. The problem is that they don’t offer a second bachelor’s degree in the major I’m currently studying at community college. Also, I cannot transfer the transcript from my home country because I didn’t perform well there, but I have a 3.9 GPA at community college.\n\nHas anyone had this problem before? Please give me some advice 🥹",

      "text": "Hi all,\nI’ve just had my Stage 2 academic appeal rejected by SOAS, and I feel completely lost. I’m hoping someone who’s been through something similar can offer insight.\n\nHere’s my situation:\n\nI was in my final year and due to sit my Family Law exam in May 2025.\nI have a degenerative eye condition (keratoconus), which rapidly worsened between April–May. I lost most vision in one eye, experienced extreme screen sensitivity and migraines, and had to undergo surgery shortly after my exam.\nDuring this time, I also experienced serious mental health issues, was mostly bedbound, and caring for three younger siblings while my mother was ill.\nI didn’t submit a Mitigating Circumstances (MC) form at the time — I was scared it would delay graduation and emotionally shut down. But I had already disclosed my condition earlier in the year and had a Study Inclusion Plan.\nMy coursework mark for Family Law was 72%. My exam dropped to 44%. That single result brought my classification down to a 2.2 — if I had gotten even a 50%, I’d have a 2.1 overall.\nI appealed under Ground (b): new mitigating circumstances, and submitted detailed medical evidence (Eye-Casualty note, photos, therapy SMS chains, GP delays, etc.) showing the deterioration and the reason for the MC delay.\nDespite all this, SOAS rejected both my Stage 1 and Stage 2 appeals, saying the evidence wasn’t enough to prove I was “unfit” to follow proper procedures at the time. I now feel stuck — I’m set to graduate with a 2.2, and I don’t know if I should let it go or escalate to the OIA (Office of the Independent Adjudicator).\nMy questions:\n\nHas anyone had success with an OIA complaint in a similar situation?\nIf I do submit to the OIA, what’s the best angle to focus on?\nIs it still worth pursuing if I’ve already graduated?\nWhat could the OIA realistically recommend — an uncapped resit? A mark re-evaluation? Or just an apology?\nAny advice, especially from people who’ve been through something similar or work in academia, would mean a lot. I’m trying to stay grounded but feel like I’ve been failed despite having real medical issues.\nThanks in advance.",

I am in grade 11 and i moved this year to a different area in canada which made my grades suffer immensely as i was going through mental health issues. I was a 90s student before my move, I did grade 11 bio in grade 10 and got a 96 and my overall grades were very high. After my move, my grades suffered and I had pretty low semester one marks but especially my chemistry which was a 67% (which i hope to do well in grade 12 chem so by midterms the improvement will show) ( im not sure if america looks at midterm grades but hopefully they do ) other than that, my grades last semester were in the 70% range with the exception of online kinesiology where i got a 92%. the other two courses I had last semester were grade 11 functions and religion which were in the 70s range. Now this semester, I am taking two grade 12 courses and I am sitting at a 84 in bio (which hopefully will not drop after exam) and around an 89 in math, my other two courses are grade 11 digi arts and english which sit in the 80s. Now I am wondering as a canadian student, I am going to america for health science/a program that will get me into medical school\n\n1. what are realistic schools to accept me? do i GENUINELY have a chance?\n2. do they look at midterm grades? if i do well on gr12 chem by midterms will that help justify my chem 11 mark\n3. could i get into utsa for a health science program?\n4. how much do they consider SATS and comp app, can that help my chances? \n\n(keep in mind my overall gpa for grade 9-11 is a 3 right now)",

Rather than relying on SAT/ACT scores that suffer from gaming/cheating, Common App essays that are highly coached, dubious extracurriculars, etc. maybe one or a few progressive universities could go beyond all this in favor of an AI driven application process that may still use these factors but moves beyond these factors by contextualizing student experiences automatically in order to identify truly talented individuals. \n\nThe current university admissions process, relying heavily on standardized metrics like GPA and test scores, inadvertently favors students with privileged backgrounds who can access resources for test prep and enriched extracurriculars. This system often overlooks truly gifted individuals whose unique talents, like self-taught coding expertise or advanced language proficiency, don't fit neatly into traditional academic categories or are masked by disengagement with uninspiring curricula.\n\nAugmenting this process with AI can create a more equitable and objective evaluation. AI can move beyond surface-level metrics to analyze deep academic potential, contextualizing achievements against available opportunities, and identifying patterns of intellectual vitality and self-directed learning often missed by human reviewers. This allows universities to pinpoint and reward exceptional talent, regardless of how it aligns with conventional schooling or socioeconomic standing.  \n\nJust a thought, the last two paragraphs above were created with AI assistance.",

Does that mean I have to study an extra year? And if so, what will I do in that extra year? Is it like a normal school year (with all the English, math, science, etc. courses) or do I have to choose a specific subject? I also wanted to know if that is true, what type of subject to choose for my career (Medicine), because I was thinking of Biology or French.\n\nSecond point, after finishing that \"additional degree\", I wanted to know if it is accessible for a student from abroad to apply to a university in Canada. I know that I have to take an English exam, but I still have a year to go to finish the advanced level. However, I'm also worried about all the documents I have to submit because I've never done smth like this before.\n\nAnd also, I'm a bit confused about the \"student permit\" thing. So, do I have to wait to be admitted first to get my permit? I also have some doubts about whether there are any scholarships that I can get of the U of T, bc it's somewhat complicated to start living alone in a new city as a university student.\n\nI would like you to tell me your experiences or answer my questions in a very simple way, because there are so many things to present and complete in order to be admitted (or at least I think so) 😭",

Although I already finished my last year of high school and I was just going to college in the country I’m in just to gain experience on my major and get used to university life, I didn’t pay much effort in grades and it didn’t really matter to me because I was going to canada to start it all over again and this year wasn’t supposed to mean anything. I put in my application that I am attending this school but didn’t think they would ask me to send any transcripts. So about 4 days ago, I got my admission email but under a couple of conditions. They were doable except for one of them which said to keep my grades above 65% and send a transcript after finishing the school year. Now I’m really scared that I won’t get admitted if I don’t keep this condition because if I knew that they would ask for this I would have put in much more effort in studying here or I would’ve just withdrawn my application. But now it’s too late and a lot of my grades are terrible and it will be very difficult for me to fix them because the year ends in June and one semester has passed already and I messed it up so bad. So my question is, do you think my admission will be revoked if I don’t keep this condition? Do you think sending them an email about it would make them remove this condition from the admission?",

After confronting me the first time, she told me that she would let me know, after the weekend, if I would need to retake the test or what she thinks about it. A week passed and she never said anything so I thought all was good. However, today she told me to meet her in her office after class. She apparently spent 2 hours overlooking my exam and highlighted everything that matched up with ChatGPT. Majority was just some vocabulary (I don’t really remember because I barely got a good glimpse), other than one sentence which simply anyone could’ve written. She then proceeded to say that she’s going to give me a 0 on the test. \nDuring the week, we had to submit an essay, and today, she told me she refuses to even look at my essay because she doesn’t trust me so now, she’s saying that I need to rewrite my entire essay on paper in front of her. On top of that, for any future writing assignments, I have to write them on paper in her office as well (while everyone else is allowed to use their devices). To add on to that, she proceeds to add that she is also going to report me to the dean. \n\nIs this excessive? I genuinely don’t know what to say or do.",

The other university here that may offer online classes requires me to redo a math credit from high school that I barely passed. \nI am unable to stay in my university due to an abusive ex-boyfriend following me there. I have contacted my university about his behaviour and I do not see any options they offer that will actually ensure my safety and if anything will make him retaliate against me.\nI have also worked with the police and court systems here in the past so I am aware that they will not be helpful in this problem other than providing written record. \nLeaving my province and enrolling in another university is also not an option because I have commitments here and I also simply cannot afford to.\n\nPlease if anyone has any suggestions or knowledge pertaining to the existence of such online universities please let me know. \n\nTLDR: Seeking affordable online Canadian universities with live classes, credit transfer options, and BA degrees accepted for Juris Doctorate programs.

      "text": "I have applied for both nottingham trent university and reading university. Ive had my heart set on reading and put it as my first option. Only because it was something new, a new place and i was excited. I am now starting to worry if i picked the right option, both universities have perks and good rankings. However NTU is only like an hour or so from my family and friends and UOR is about 3 hours away from anybody i know. I also love nottingham as a place and i dont know reading as a place. Im worried ive picked the wrong option. Reading sent me a letter which i really liked as i love poetry aswell they said i could explore that with them. I also believe that NTU course structure might be more understanding for me. But i believe reading could possibly look better when applying for art related jobs in the future aswell. If anybodys gone to either of these universities id love to hear what makes them good. I have already applied and paid a deposit for accommodation at reading but I’m not sure it feels right anymore, or if I’m just scared because I’ve now finished college and its more real. Also NTU is cheaper. I am studying art",

Despite the many challenges I’ve faced growing up, I’ve always believed in the power of hard work, resilience, and community.\n\nThrough determination and persistence, I’ve earned top grades, served as the president of the science club, volunteered in hospitals and during national crises like the Al Haouz earthquake, and participated in multiple national and regional competitions — many of which I’ve won. I’ve also been active in youth councils and charity work, always striving to give back to my community.\n\nRecently, I was accepted to study in the UK with an 80% scholarship — a rare and life-changing opportunity. But I still need help covering the remaining 20% of the tuition and living expenses.\n\nI’m not asking for a lot — only for a chance. A sponsor or a kind soul who believes in supporting young, passionate students can truly make a difference in my life. Your support would not only help me continue my education but would also allow me to one day give back, just as someone once believed in me.\n\nWith deep gratitude,\nA hopeful Moroccan student",

      "title": "How Covid Changed K-12 Education",
      "text": "School systems around the U.S. lost their teachers during COVID which still has an effect in the school systems 5 years later. With the pandemic “The number of public-school teachers declined by 0.2 percent” (nces.ed.gov). Losing teachers in schools started overcrowding in classrooms. Students had no way enroll in programs and activities like in the previous year's making it harder for the years to come. With no enrollment the programs stopped which caused kids to have to stay home and waste time.\n\nStudents' well-being began to drop. This “devastated poor children’s well-being, not just by closing their schools, but also by taking away their parents’ jobs, sickening their families and teachers, and adding chaos and fear to their daily lives” (PBS.org). Mental health issues caused a lot of people to not do their homework, Which more people to be behind and mental health issues caused discomfort being on zoom for hours while being cramped in the house.  Another problem was a major loss of learning. Important parts of education were missed causing more to be behind.\n\nGrades became bad, people began falling behind in classes causing them to have bad transcripts. With the learning loss “on average students have lost about a half a grade level in math and a quarter of a grade level in reading”. While some are doing great, a lot of others didn’t fully learn the fundamentals, a lot of kids were not paying attention in class during online learning. Students began to forget how to be in the classroom and we needed to learn how to integrate back into the classroom setting. When you're taken out of the school setting for so long it can prevent you from learning making all information you hear go in one ear and out the other\n\nCovid 19 caused setbacks such as teacher jobs declining, students losing basic fundamentals in school, and students to have bad grades. Something that shapes the problem of school systems failing students is truly that the government has not cared enough to check in on the schools and is now getting rid of the department of education which sets the U.S back and makes it worse for the next generation. The pandemic caused the K-12 system to lose most of their teachers. There were gaps in education because there was lack of good preparation. Covid gave more of a reason to start getting bad grades during and after the pandemic. In closing as students we need to know that our education has been set back, teachers need to check and make sure their students know the basics, parents need to know that their kids could now be at a disadvantage, and the K-12 school system needs to know one they need to check on students and two they need to have good online programs just in case anything like the Covid-19 pandemic ever happens again.",

Whether it's a problem you faced in your school days or something you observe in the current system, it could really help shape our solution!\n\nPut your problems in comment box.\n\nThanks in advance! 🙏",

Whether it’s for admissions, research papers, or final projects, even the best-written essays can lose impact without a second, expert set of eyes.\n\nWith rising academic standards and intense competition, many students now rely on trusted platforms to refine their writing. One that’s gained attention for accurate and timely proofreading support is [**this well-rated academic service**](https://writeessaytoday.com/essay-writer-online) .\n\nWhat do you think: is proofreading worth the effort or just an academic luxury?\n\n **Are proofreading services accepted by educators or considered unethical?**  \n Proofreading services that focus on grammar, structure and clarity without altering core content are widely accepted and often encouraged as part of the revision process.",

      "text": "Hi everyone,\n\nI’m currently a student at Santa Rosa, studying Early Childhood Education, and I’m reaching out because I’m struggling to cover my college housing costs.\n\nAs a first-generation college student, navigating everything has been overwhelming — especially financially. I applied for FAFSA and received some aid, but unfortunately, it didn’t cover housing. I’ve been trying to figure it out on my own, but the costs are adding up quickly, and I’m now short about $3,200 to secure a safe place to live while continuing school.\n\nI’ve started a GoFundMe to try and raise the remaining amount:\n\nhttps://www.gofundme.com/f/support-kenbrias-journey-in-early-childhood-education/cl/o?v=amp14_t2&utm_campaign=fp_sharesheet&utm_content=amp13_t1-amp14_t2-amp15_c&utm_medium=customer&utm_source=copy_link&lang=en_US&attribution_id=sl%3Acf2378d8-da8d-42d0-afb6-8d694a4eb7b7&ts=1750609106\n\nI’m also working on applying for local scholarships and part-time work, but the timing is tight, and I wanted to be transparent about the help I need. If you can donate, share, or even just offer advice or encouragement — I’d be truly grateful. Every little bit helps, and I’m determined to keep going.\n\nThank you so much for reading. 💛",

      "text": "Education is the most powerful tool that can transform lives. For a student, it is more than just textbooks and exams — it is a journey of growth, curiosity, and building a brighter future.\n\nWhat is Education?\n\nEducation is the process of gaining knowledge, skills, values, and habits. It starts at home, continues in school, and lasts throughout life. For students, it builds the foundation for their careers, thinking abilities, and personalities.\n\nWhy is Education Important for Students?\n\n1. Builds Knowledge: Education helps students understand the world around them — from science and technology to history and society.\n\n\n2. Improves Thinking: Through learning, students develop critical thinking, problem-solving, and decision-making skills.\n\n\n3. Opens Career Opportunities: With proper education, students can choose their desired career paths — whether it's becoming a doctor, teacher, engineer, artist, or anything they dream of.\n\n\n4. Develops Confidence: Education boosts self-confidence and helps students express themselves clearly and respectfully.\n\n\n5. Teaches Values: Along with studies, students learn discipline, honesty, teamwork, and respect for others.\n\n\n\nThe Role of a Student\n\nStudents are the heart of the education system. Their role is not just to study for marks but to understand and grow. A good student:\n\nAttends classes regularly\n\nListens carefully\n\nAsks questions\n\nHelps classmates\n\nStays curious and motivated\n\n\nChallenges Students Face\n\nStudents often face pressure — from exams, peer competition, or family expectations. But these challenges are part of the learning journey. With the right mindset, time management, and support from teachers and parents, students can overcome any difficulty.\n\nTips for Student Success\n\nStay organized with a daily routine.\n\nSet clear goals for each week or month.\n\nTake breaks and avoid too much stress.\n\nParticipate in activities like sports, arts, and debates.\n\nKeep learning beyond the classroom — through books, the internet, or experiences.\n\n\nConclusion\n\nEducation is the key that opens the door to success. As a student, your efforts today will shape your tomorrow. Stay focused, stay curious, and remember — learning is not just about school, it's about life.\n\n> \"The future belongs to those who learn more skills and combine them in creative ways.\" – Robert Greene\n\n\n\n\n-",

      "text": "In a rapidly changing job landscape, students are increasingly drawn to learning experiences that connect classroom knowledge to real-world careers. Career-Connected Learning offers a practical solution, equipping students with hands-on opportunities that bridge academic knowledge with essential workplace skills. Students are eager for more career-focused experiences that align with their unique interests, helping them gain insights into various professions and build critical soft skills. Furthermore, having mentors in these programs has shown to significantly enhance students' engagement and confidence, providing them with guidance as they navigate potential career paths.\n\nDespite its advantages, access to career-connected learning remains limited, particularly for students from underserved backgrounds. Research indicates that many high school students still lack exposure to careers that interest them, leaving them underprepared for workforce expectations. Broadening access to these experiences through partnerships with community organizations and expanding mentorship networks could help close this gap. By embedding diverse career-oriented activities into education, schools can empower students to make informed choices, equipping them with the skills, networks, and confidence they need to transition successfully from school to career in an ever-evolving job market.\n\n[Read More>>](https://www.academikamerica.com/blog/pathways-to-success-why-students-choose-career-connected-education?utm_source=Reddit&utm_medium=Why_students_choose_career_connected_education)",

In the end ofc the common roles students usually line up waiter(cafes and restaurant) or working illegally which is the least thing I'd do because I can't risk my studies and I've responsibilities that bounded with me graduating successfully from there.",

      "text": "Hey guys, I’m 21 and currently working on my prerequisites for the dental hygiene program. I took my GED with no prior high school experience and have completed courses like SOC, COM, basic math, and ENG in CC. Right now, I’ve just started my science classes — chemistry and anatomy & physiology.\n\nHonestly, I’ve been feeling a bit lost. I hear my cousin, who’s in nursing, talk about how she completed her general education courses and now will work in a hospital through her college for internships or apprenticeships. I’m not sure exactly how it works, but that sounds really productive and like a great way to gain experience and build her resume.\n\nMeanwhile, I’m just taking a few classes, and I don’t have any job experience or internships yet. Sometimes I feel like I’m falling behind or that I’m not doing enough. I wonder if I can even get an internship with no prior experience or knowledge in a dental setting, especially since I’m just starting my science courses. \n\nI also feel like I’m not good enough because, until I was 17, I didn’t go to school (cultural differences; I was born somewhere else), and I’ve never worked or been away from my family much. I only recently started taking my GED, then general education classes, and now my prerequisites. Sometimes I feel like I’m behind or not smart enough — like I’m dumb/can't retain anything. I'm not using/don't know how to use my resources. \n\nWhat do internships usually involve? Do I need to wait until I’ve taken more classes before I can even think about that? Is there anything else I should be doing while taking my prerequisites? Any advice would be really appreciated. Thanks!",

      "title": "St. Paul University nursing students are forced into a “house system” that punishes entire groups, enforces ceremonial greetings, and requires parental waivers — all affecting grades and causing stress.",
      "text": "I’m a nursing student at St. Paul University in the Philippines, and I honestly don’t know what to do anymore. Our school has implemented this “house system” that feels more like boot camp than actual education.\n\nThis isn’t just some extracurricular activity, it directly affects our grades. The worst part is that it doesn’t only punish individuals, it punishes entire groups (houses), which means students are pressured to control each other out of fear of losing points. It feels toxic and manipulative.\n\nHere are some examples of what we’re being forced to do:\n\n• We must greet everyone a certain way (\"We are forced to greet everyone with a full ceremonial salutation every morning\") or risk losing points.\n\n• We are required to always have a clean haircut, wear a sando, carry a white handkerchief, and bring three pens (red, black, blue). Forget one? Demerit.\n\n• If you miss a meeting, you need to submit an excuse letter with a medical certificate otherwise the entire house loses points.\n\n• We have to get our parents to sign waivers for events. If not, our house loses points again. We’re in college, but we’re treated like high schoolers.\n\n• Leaders literally tell us things like: “Your housemates would not want our points reduced” - which is basically peer pressure disguised as “discipline.”\n\n\nThis environment makes people anxious and paranoid because nobody wants to be the one who drags the whole group down. Instead of learning to be professional, we’re just learning to obey rules out of fear.\n\nHere’s why I think it’s absurd:\n\n• Grades should be based on knowledge and competence, not on whether we greeted someone or carried the right color of pens.\n\n• Peer pressure as punishment (making the whole house lose points because of one person) is manipulative and unfair.\n\n• Requiring medical certificates for every absence is excessive and expensive. Not everyone can afford that.\n\n• Waivers signed by parents feel infantilizing. We’re already adults, Why are we still being treated like high school kids?\n\n• The whole “royal decree, headdress, sash, house points” setup feels like cosplay discipline. It doesn’t prepare us for real patient care.\n\n\nNursing does require discipline and professionalism, yes — but that comes from accountability, critical thinking, empathy, and skills. Not forced greetings, haircuts, or house rivalries.\n\n👉 Do other nursing students experience anything like this? Should CHED step in when schools use peer pressure and punishments tied to grades?\n\nTL;DR: St. Paul University nursing students are forced into a “house system” that affects grades and uses peer pressure. Students must perform ceremonial greetings, get parental waivers for events, and follow cosplay-like rules with sashes and royal decrees. The system feels manipulative and doesn’t teach real professionalism. Is this normal in nursing schools, and should CHED allow it?",

Apparently, in today’s dating market, telling someone you’re an engineer is the social equivalent of saying, “I troubleshoot circuits for fun.” 😅\n\nRecently, I’ve noticed something strange girls from arts or business backgrounds tend to instantly switch off when I mention I’m in engineering. I asked a few straight up, and they were honest: “You guys are too serious, too technical, not… fun enough.”\n\nAnd look, maybe they’re right I didn’t grow up mastering social ‘rizz,’ I grew up mastering the complex Legos of the universe: logic gates, transistor theory, and why the capacitor betrayed the resistor in a simulation. I’ve been busy understanding how the world works under the hood not memorizing pickup lines.\n\nBut here’s the thing: just because I build systems doesn’t mean I don’t feel. Just because I fix machines doesn’t mean I don’t know how to connect with people. I just think differently that’s all.\n\nSo yeah, maybe I’m not the “marketing guy with a podcast” or the guy who always has a champagne story ready. But I’m the type who shows up, stays loyal, solves real problems, and always brings backup power.\n\nBeing an engineer isn’t a red flag.

If anyone can:\n- Donate an old laptop, or\n- Support with a small amount to help me buy a working device, or\n- Offer me remote freelance work (coding, writing, translation, tutoring),  \nI’d be deeply grateful.\n\nEvery bit of help counts, even sharing this post.\n\n📩 Contact:  \nEmail: berassil.abdelkader@gmail.com  \nLinkedIn: linkedin.com/in/abdelkader-berassil\nLocation: Algeria\n\nThank you for reading.

I’m in my final year of undergrad, preparing to apply to veterinary school — a dream I’ve been working toward for as long as I can remember. I’ve supported myself through scholarships and a part-time job throughout school, staying committed despite every hurdle. My mom, who raised me on her own, has always been my biggest supporter. She’s determined to help me pursue this dream, even if it means stretching herself beyond what’s sustainable. While I’m deeply grateful, I can’t let her shoulder that kind of burden. Veterinary school is expensive, and the debt is the only thing standing in my way.\n\nI’m reaching out on the off chance that someone out there, perhaps with the means and interest in supporting education, might be willing to help make this dream possible. Any funds would be paid directly to the university. In return, I’m committed to giving back — including offering lifelong veterinary care. I know it’s a long shot, but I’ve learned that sometimes asking opens doors you didn’t know existed.\n\nThank you so much for reading.",

      "text": "student forum is a structured platform—physical or digital—where students gather to discuss issues that matter to them. These can include academic concerns, extracurricular activities, campus policies, mental health, diversity, and more. Forums may be officially recognized by educational institutions or run independently by student groups.\n\nWhy Student Forums Matter\n\n1. Promoting Student Voice\nStudent forums empower individuals to express their opinions, offer feedback, and influence decisions that impact their education and daily life. They provide a channel between students and faculty or administration, helping to shape a more inclusive and responsive educational environment.\n\n\n2. Encouraging Collaboration\nForums foster a spirit of teamwork. Students from diverse backgrounds come together to discuss common interests, debate important issues, and propose solutions to campus challenges. This encourages tolerance, understanding, and unity.\n\n\n3. Developing Leadership and Communication Skills\nActive participation in a student forum helps students build essential life skills. Leading a discussion, presenting an idea, or organizing an event hones communication, critical thinking, and leadership—skills that are invaluable beyond the classroom.\n\n\n4. Creating a Supportive Community\nStudent forums often evolve into safe spaces where students feel heard, supported, and respected. In such environments, mental health topics, academic stress, and social concerns can be addressed without judgment, fostering a sense of belonging.\n\n\n\nOnline Forums: A Modern Shift\n\nIn the digital age, online student forums have become increasingly popular. Platforms like Discord, Reddit, Microsoft Teams, or school-specific discussion boards allow students to engage from anywhere, at any time. These forums are especially helpful for distance learners or students with busy schedules.\n\nMaking the Most of a Student Forum\n\nBe Respectful: Value others’ opinions, even if they differ from your own. Healthy debate is encouraged, but respect is key.\n\nStay Informed: Participate in discussions that are meaningful and relevant. Research topics before contributing.\n\nBe Active: Don’t just observe—engage! Ask questions, suggest ideas, and attend meetings or events.\n\n\nConclusion\n\nStudent forums are more than just platforms for discussion—they are engines of change, creativity, and connection. Whether you're looking to share your thoughts, find support, or make a difference on campus, getting involved in a student forum is a step toward becoming an active, informed, and empowered member of your academic community.",

      "text": "Hey, so I’ve been thinking a lot about college, especially since I grew up in the French education system, and honestly, I have zero clue how things work in the American system. Like, in French schooling system, everything feels way more straightforward you have your exams, your grades, and that’s it. But I keep hearing about things like midterms, finals, continuous assessments, participation grades, quizzes, assignments, and I’m just confused. How exactly does the grading scale work over there? In the French system, it’s mostly out of 20, but in the US, I hear about letter grades like A, B, C, and GPA? What does that even mean for your final score? And do midterms and finals have a huge impact, or is it more about the whole semester’s work? I’m not sure how to prepare or pace myself throughout the term because I’m used to studying hard right before the big exam and then moving on.\n\nAlso, how do American students usually manage their workload? Do professors expect you to participate a lot in class? Are assignments and homework really a big deal? Because in my experience, sometimes homework is just extra, but I’ve heard it can count a lot there. And what about group projects or presentations? That’s something I didn’t have much experience with in my schooling, so I wonder how to handle that kind of pressure. I guess I’m also curious about the best study habits in this system should I be reviewing material every day, or can I still cram a bit?\n\nAnother thing that’s confusing is the whole concept of office hours and talking to professors. In France, it’s not always common to just go talk to your teacher outside of class, but I hear it’s encouraged there? How do you even approach them if you don’t understand something? Is it awkward or normal? And what about academic support centers or tutoring? Are those easy to access, or do you have to really ask around? I feel like understanding all this would make my transition so much easier if I ever decide to study in an American university or even just to know how it works in general.\n\nSo yeah, if anyone has experience with this or any advice on how to not get totally lost in the American grading and exam system, or even just tips on how to succeed and not stress out too much, I’d be super grateful. I want to make sure I don’t mess up because it’s a whole different world from what I’m used to, and honestly, the uncertainty is kind of intimidating. Thanks a lot!",

      "text": "Being a student is not always easy. There are early mornings, late-night study sessions, challenging exams, and the constant pressure to do well. But it’s important to remember that being a student is also a time of discovery, growth, and endless possibilities.\n\nLearn Beyond the Books\n\nYour education is more than just grades and memorizing facts. It’s about learning how to think critically, ask questions, solve problems, and understand the world around you. Don’t be afraid to make mistakes—each one is a step toward understanding more about yourself and your future.\n\nStay Curious\n\nAsk questions. Be curious. Explore topics outside of your comfort zone. Sometimes, the things you learn unexpectedly become your greatest passions. Read books, join clubs, talk to different people, and keep your mind open. Education is not just what you’re taught—it’s what you choose to explore.\n\nBelieve in Yourself\n\nThere may be times when you feel tired, lost, or unsure of what’s ahead. That’s normal. Every student goes through those moments. What matters most is that you keep going. Believe in your ability to learn, grow, and succeed. Trust the process, even when it’s hard.\n\nTake Care of Your Well-Being\n\nGrades are important, but so is your health—mental, emotional, and physical. Don’t be afraid to take breaks, ask for help, or talk to someone when you feel overwhelmed. Balance is key to doing well and staying strong.\n\nEnjoy the Journey\n\nSchool is not just about getting a diploma. It’s also about the friends you make, the experiences you gain, and the person you become along the way. Celebrate your small wins. Laugh often. Be kind to others. These memories will stay with you long after graduation.",

AB Tech lacked physical lab infrastructure and relied on outdated manuals and online simulations — which most students and instructors agree are poor substitutes for real labs.\n\nI informed the original college's lab manager, and I was the only instructor using the equipment that term. My goal was simple: improve student learning.\n\nHowever, after I raised concerns about outdated lab practices at AB Tech, I was abruptly fired. Then, SCCSC also terminated me after AB Tech informed them about the equipment transfer. No warnings, no hearings — just dismissal and, in one case, **police escort off campus**. As an adjunct, I had no appeal rights.\n\nOver **70% of U.S. community college courses are taught by adjuncts** — often with minimal pay, no job security, and little support. Despite holding advanced degrees and carrying the instructional burden, we are treated as expendable.\n\nI still believe in the power of education. But I also believe we need to **reform how adjunct faculty are treated** — and how students are impacted by systemic neglect.\n\nHas anyone here gone through something similar, or worked in an institution where helping students backfired?\n\nThanks for reading.",

      "text": "Paid work—sometimes referred to as employment or compensated labor—is a cornerstone of modern economies and a central part of most people’s lives. It refers to any form of work performed in exchange for monetary compensation, whether through wages, salaries, commissions, or freelance payments. Beyond just a means to earn a living, paid work shapes social identities, economic structures, and personal development.\n\nWhat Is Paid Work?\n\nPaid work includes full-time and part-time jobs, freelance and gig work, contract roles, and self-employment. It can take place in virtually every sector, from manufacturing and retail to healthcare, education, and digital services. The defining feature is that the work performed results in direct financial compensation.\n\nExamples of paid work include:\n\t•\tAn employee working 40 hours a week at a company\n\t•\tA freelancer designing websites for clients\n\t•\tA part-time barista at a café\n\t•\tA construction worker paid per project or hourly\n\t•\tA rideshare driver earning money per trip\n\nImportance of Paid Work\n\n1. Economic Stability\n\nPaid work is the primary source of income for individuals and families. It enables people to meet basic needs such as food, housing, education, and healthcare, and to save or invest for the future.\n\n2. Social Contribution\n\nThrough paid work, individuals contribute to the economy and society. Jobs often support essential services, infrastructure, innovation, and commerce.\n\n3. Personal Growth and Identity\n\nMany people find purpose, structure, and a sense of identity through their work. It can be a source of pride, achievement, and self-worth.\n\n4. Skills Development\n\nPaid work helps individuals acquire and refine skills, gain experience, and build professional networks, which are important for career advancement.\n\nTypes of Paid Work\n\n1. Formal Employment\n\nTypically involves a legal contract, steady income, and access to benefits like health insurance, retirement plans, and paid leave. Examples include government jobs, corporate roles, and nonprofit employment.\n\n2. Informal Employment\n\nOften lacks legal protection, stability, or benefits. This can include day laborers, some domestic workers, or street vendors in many parts of the world.\n\n3. Self-Employment and Freelancing\n\nPeople who work for themselves rather than an employer. This includes small business owners, consultants, artists, and online freelancers.\n\n4. Gig Economy Work\n\nShort-term, flexible jobs often arranged through digital platforms like Uber, DoorDash, or Fiverr. Gig work offers freedom but often lacks traditional job protections.\n\nChallenges and Considerations\n\n1. Wage Inequality\n\nDisparities in income exist across industries, regions, and demographics, raising concerns about fairness and access to opportunities.\n\n2. Job Insecurity\n\nEspecially in gig work and informal employment, workers may lack job stability, predictable income, and benefits.\n\n3. Work-Life Balance\n\nLong hours, high demands, or lack of autonomy can negatively impact workers’ mental and physical health.\n\n4. Changing Landscape\n\nAutomation, remote work, and AI are reshaping the nature of paid work. This creates both new opportunities and the need for continuous learning and adaptation.\n\nConclusion\n\nPaid work is more than just earning money—it’s a vital component of economic participation, personal fulfillment, and societal development. As the world of work continues to evolve, ensuring fair wages, equitable access, and decent working conditions remains a crucial challenge for policymakers, businesses, and workers alike. By understanding the changing dynamics of paid work, individuals can better navigate their careers and contribute meaningfully to the broader economy.",

They are the backbone of a nation’s progress. Through their education and learning, they gain knowledge, skills, and values that equip them to become responsible citizens, innovators, leaders, and contributors to the economy. A well-educated student population is essential for social change and technological advancement.\n\nAcademic Life and Responsibilities \n\nBeing a student involves dedication to studies, participation in extracurricular activities, and personal development. Attending classes, completing assignments, preparing for exams, and collaborating in group projects are just a few of the responsibilities students handle regularly. Time management, discipline, and a positive attitude are key traits that help students succeed.\n\nChallenges Faced by Students \n\nWhile student life is often romanticized, it is not without challenges:\n\nAcademic pressure: The need to perform well in exams and maintain good grades can lead to stress and anxiety. Peer pressure: Social expectations and comparison among peers can affect a student’s mental health. Balancing life: Managing studies, family expectations, friendships, and sometimes part",

      "text": "Hi, I've always believed in never giving up and finding resources. I'm at a rough spot right now, and heavily lacking resources and several different opinions. I would really appreciate any help on trying to improve my life and figure out what is going on right now.\n\nSome background info:\n\n* Was sick with black mold & Lyme starting Covid. This induced me staying out of school a bit longer than Covid. (An extra year instead of 2)\n* Went back to school in 2022 for 8th grade still being sick but not knowing.\n* I have limiting beliefs around school. My mom was chronically ill too when I grew up so couldn't get me to school on time. Anytime I mention school she says it wasn't fit for me, but I think those limiting beliefs and habits came from then. My parents also made the mistake of telling me school was useless.\n* After a few months of 8th grade, I got sicker and was late every day. I think sometimes I could have gone but I was pitied.\n* At the end of 8th grade CPS tried to come several times, but this was dumb because I was actually sick and didn't have a diagnosis and I was in a rare situation. The CPS didn't work and just caused an insane amount of stress with my family, panic attacks, and just made me feel like the school wasn't actually supporting me. Around this time, I also lost my friends from not going to school and a lot of unneeded anger was stirred from school, which fostered a horrible relationship with school and again. I felt super alone.\n* At the beginning of 9th grade, I didn't go in until October, so several months. Freshman year matters with school and the whole time I was not encouraged to do my work or given help. Just a slight push and \"that is your choice.\" I had no tutor even after begging and just was feeling really down and lost.\n* I \"switched to homeschool\" at the end of 9th grade after only going in a few days.\n\nA lot of my friends argue if this was my choice or not to leave school. I don't know, I don't even know what having a choice would mean.\n\nI'm currently a \"sophomore\" and turning 16. I've done 0 structured schoolwork since 8th grade due to feeling like it is useless. I have spent the past 2 years focusing on business and a few internships which made me feel accomplished, but only recently I realized how bad of a spot I am in when imagining my desired life. A few months of the year I will have 2 in-person classes a week (I did Junior Achievement) and get to hang out with my friends and BF. But my parents don't like doing activities or driving places because they also feel down and don’t treat themselves.\n\nATM I don't have any classes, and it takes weeks for them to sign up or plan going places, so I've been doing nothing for weeks. I've realized how bad of a situation this is and feel really down and stuck. I feel stuck because it takes so much effort just to have resources other kids have 24/7 (at school, extracurriculars, sports, etc.)\n\nI think homeschool could work if my parents went out & did stuff, but I feel overwhelmed being at home all day and feeling stuck. I miss the social aspect a lot.\n\nAnother aspect that comes into play when thinking about going back to school, finding resources, etc.\n\nMy parents think that my homeschooling is amazing. I'm an entrepreneur, passionate about posting as an influencer and also marketing. This could be an opportunity to be good, but again I feel down being at home, don’t go places, don’t have activities or many classes, and I’m not being given any structure in school or in those projects.\n\nSome good things: I got to do an internship, do 2 JA classes, and my parents funded my first business project. Even though that seems great it is not enough to fill my time, and I don't know if I should continue with it because they tell me I shouldn't go back since I want to do business.\n\nI feel like it's not worth it because I only do like 1 hour of business stuff anyway because I don't have funding, and I also feel down.\n\nI was fine with leaving school because I was like “I'll do business anyway, so I don't need to go to a fancy college,” or I could get a GED. But it's not the academic part that made me question my current life it's the resources, going out, friends, clubs, sports.\n\nThen it made me question: I'm not living to my fullest potential right now, even if I could be.\n\nWhat are resources I could use right now to be busy or feel like I am in a full-time job or school schedule with Influencing, Marketing, Business, and other school-related things?\n\nI really don't know what kind of help I want. I just want to be successful, educated, busy & happy and need reflection.",

      "text": "Lately, I’ve been reflecting a lot on how we experience failure, especially within education, but also outside of it. It often seems like failure is something we should avoid or hide, when in fact, it can be an opportunity to understand ourselves better and to grow stronger in what we do.\n\nFailure is often seen as a trap, something that holds back our personal development. But in many cases, it can actually help us discover what works and how we can grow. However, this shift doesn’t happen automatically, and the way we approach failure has a big impact on how we experience it.\n\nI’m curious how others feel about this. What effect does failure have on your motivation? And how do you respond to it, or how does your environment react?\n\n**Have you ever experienced something that changed the way you think about what it means to fail or to succeed? I’d love to hear your story or opinion.**",

      "text": "Hi all!\n\nAs some of you may know, all social work programs in Canada require an internship. Almost all of them are unpaid, and many schools even discourages paid placements. This makes it really hard for prospective students to plan for their education as it forces them out of work or to be so busy on top of their already hectic lives. So, only those with the ability to pay for their schooling without work, or who have time to work on top of their full-time schedule, get to afford to become social workers.\n\nMy colleagues and I, who are all current MSW students, recently formed the Placement Equity Project where we are advocating for the Canadian government to create grants for social work students to pay them for their mandatory placements. We just launched our petition yesterday and are going to be using it as momentum to contact the government program responsible for these grants. We have a full plan to submit the petition results along with letters of support to the ESDC.\n\nPlease sign and share the petition within your circles if you'd like to help us advocate for a cause that will be so impactful on our future as social workers and social work students!!\n\n[https://www.change.org/placementequityproject](https://www.change.org/placementequityproject)",

And so, I bought her a D&D LEGO minifigure (6$ CAD) because it's one of her favorite games and I thought that maybe it would make her happy to know that at least one of her students care (even if I don't have the best grades sometimes).\n\nSo, I was wondering if it is appropriate to give it to her on my next class (Tuesday) or if I should just not give it. As I said, my grades aren't always good and I don't want to act like I want to bribe her, and I don't want to look like a teacher's pet or anything either. Yet, I still bought it for her and I am scared of potentially losing it. What do I do?",

But that always left me even more overwhelmed.\n\nA month ago, I tried something simpler: each week, I picked just one tiny habit to focus on not to fix everything, but to slow down and regain my footing. For example:\n\n* Pausing for one minute of breathing before checking course emails\n* Taking a short walk after a long study session\n* Writing down one small success at the end of each day\n\nThese habits haven’t “solved” student stress but they’ve helped me feel more grounded rather than stuck.\n\nI stumbled upon a short weekly email called The Quiet Hustle. Its message isn’t about productivity hacks, it’s about calm, clarity, and meaningful progress. Reading it became a little mindfulness ritual in my week.\n\nHas anyone else found relief in micro-habits or simple routines? What small changes have made a difference in your student life?",

It's more than just a place to learn about mathematics and literature; it's a social and personal crucible where students begin to define who they are.\nFor many, high school is a journey of discovery. It's the first time students have significant freedom to choose their own classes and explore subjects that genuinely interest them. Whether it's advanced science labs, creative writing workshops, or hands-on vocational training, these choices help shape future career paths and personal passions.\nBeyond the classroom, high school life is rich with extracurricular activities. From competitive sports teams and theater productions to academic clubs and volunteer groups, these activities teach valuable lessons in teamwork, discipline, and leadership. They provide a space for students to develop new skills, make lasting friendships, and build a sense of community.\nHowever, high school also presents its challenges. The pressure to succeed academically, the complexities of social relationships, and the stress of preparing for college or the workforce can be overwhelming. But it is precisely in overcoming these obstacles that students learn resilience and adaptability.\nIn the end, the high school experience is a complex tapestry of academic growth, personal development, and social navigation. It is a period that lays the foundation for adulthood, leaving a lasting impact on the person one becomes.",

      "title": "Ways to stay sane during this school year. (coming from a college freshman) |",
      "text": "Looking back at my high school experience, there are a lot of things I wish I had done differently, mainly academically, but some mentally. What someone has probably told you, is that your experience with things is what you make it, rather than stuff related to your career, schooling, jobs, hobbies, life experiences like relationships or mental health. If Someone had told me this list of things as an incoming senior, I would have thought it was ridiculous but as I look back at it, there are a lot of ways that I wish I could go back and do differently.\n\nThe first one being, try to balance your time out evenly. There are many methods and tools that can help you manage your time. A popular one is a Todo list. The benefits of the Todo list method are to have a visual list that you can look at to know what needs to be done. I used this method a lot due to the amount of homework you are given, it is different for everyone. As an upcoming college freshman, I will use this for my homework load since it has helped me a lot in my senior year.\n\n*Tip 1: You can also color code your classes with different colored highlighters so a different color represents a different class, (e.g.: green- science, blue- math, etc.) you can use this to highlight the things on your Todo list according to which class the assignment is for. So, if you have “biology essay” on your Todo list then you can highlight that in green since your science class is color coded green.*\n\nNext, by senior year you should know your way around the school and where your classes are, but if you are new see if your schedule is available to have it printed out, if it is, print it and memorize it. This makes you remember where your classes are and also won’t feel overwhelmed on trying to figure out where each class is. What helped me during my freshman year of high school was going to my freshman orientation where they showed all of us around and had us meet all of our teachers.\n\n*Tip 2: Reach out to your teachers before the first day of school, maybe your class schedule has their contact information on it and if it does, write the email to them introducing yourself and explain how you are just trying to get more familiar with your new environment. As I’m about to be a freshman in college, I have already done this with my professors!*\n\nNext, have a time when you wind down in the evening. Figure out a time to put your phone down and relax. This will make your brain shut off quicker when you turn off the light and you will be able to fall asleep faster! This is scientifically proven to help get better sleep because the blue light in your devices stimulates your eyes which are connectors to the brain.\n\n*Tip 3: Here are some pass times to help relax. Read a book, do your night routine, take a bath, do skincare, and my personal favorite, Journal.*\n\nJournaling helps in many different ways, one by helping your eyes focus on something that doesn’t have a screen attached. It also has benefits on helping with letting go of the things that are on your mind, rather that is relationship issues, family issues. It is also good for helping depression and anxiety. When writing down an entry, try to imagine that everything that is weighing you down in that moment is slowly moving from your brain onto the page of your journal.\n\nAt your school, you probably have a counselor or some kind of person that is there to help with problems. Rather if that is family problems or others, they are normally there to help. If you are struggling mentally or extremely overwhelmed with schoolwork or life outside of school. Reach out to that person, rather than struggling with anxiety, depression or something else, don’t suffer in silence.\n\n*Tip 5: if you are struggling, please reach out to your counselor. They are there to help you, so please don’t struggle by yourself, remember that there are people that will help.*\n\nAnother thing is do not procrastinate. Falling behind in schoolwork can also be very overwhelming once you realize you have fallen behind. There are a lot of ways to get yourself to not procrastinate. One thing I recommend is finding resources around your school or online to help you stay motivated. (discord servers for studying, studying with friends, going to the library and studying. If you go to a college, you can find a spare studying room and study in there since that is what they are used for.\n\n*Tip 6: if you are still falling behind, ask your teachers or school counselor if there is a tutor that could help or another teacher that could help you after school. If you are in college there might be a tutoring center that you could go to, and they will help you.*\n\nThis next tip might not be for some people, especially if you have social anxiety like me but, stay involved in extracurricular activities. This will keep you wanting to keep up in your classes so you can participate in them. For me, I’m joining theater, choir, and a creative writing club to help me meet new friends and be more motivated in keeping up with my classes.\n\n*Tip 7: there are many organizations and clubs you could join as well as sports. Growing up I never played sports, but I was involved with my choir and now that I am in college, I’m involving myself in things I’m interested in.*\n\nThis might be one that you already know about researching your classes before taking them helps you figure out what the class is about way before you take the class, now this is probably more for college students since in high school there are a limited amount of courses you can take but for college kids It is probably your best bet to look into the course way before you take it so you know what you are getting into.\n\nThe last thing is to set goals for yourself, rather than personal goals, academic goals, finance goals, etc. It will help you and your mind stay organized with what you are trying to achieve. For me the way I do it is I write them on a paper with different categories like Finance, Academic, Career, etc. you can search up “smart goals template” on google and go off of that to write your own smart goals.\n\nI hope this article helped you destress you guys about school starting soon. As an upcoming freshman in college, I have talked myself out of most of my anxiety about school starting",

I mean, I saw him cheating on an exam and got around a 35/60 while I got a 51/60 so it just hurts my pride knowing HE got an award yet I didn’t even though I actually tried without cheating. It just doesn’t seem fair.\nI do well in all of my subjects, achieving great results in comparison to other students. \n\nIm just confused why I didn’t get any awards if they are based on performance/how well we did in comparison to other students.\n\nWould anyone know? \n\nPlease help me out I want to get awards too.",

So, where I’m from, our teachers don’t have their own classrooms—we stay in the same classroom, and the teachers come to us, one by one, for each subject.\n\nBut here’s the thing: sometimes, my entire class will just decide not to show up. Like, it’s not planned or anything, it just kind of happens. We’ll all collectively decide to skip school, and instead of going to class, we’ll just stay home, chill, or do something else. It’s like a spontaneous, unspoken agreement among everyone, and sometimes, it feels like we’re all in on this little rebellion together.\n\nI’m curious—does this happen anywhere else? Are there other countries where this sort of “skipping together” thing happens, or is this just a weird, one-of-a-kind thing in our school?\n\nWould love to hear if anyone else has had this experience!",

Right now, we have Anatomy of the Head and Neck in one week, and the slides are huge. In a day, we can cover around 150-250 slides per lecture we took 2 lectures so that’s around 500 slides per day and When I try to summarize, it takes me a lot of time—sometimes a whole day just for 50 slides. The commute is far, taking about 1-2 hours, and I come back exhausted.\nAnd I feel like I'm not even qualified. I've forgotten many of the basics, and sometimes even simple concepts get mixed up in my mind. When we finish a lecture, my friends say that it was clear, but I leave without even understanding what the lecture was about.\nI want to be the top of my class this year, but the curriculum is also very extensive.\n\nI need advice and study tips. What do you recommend? 🥲",

But this time, I didn’t want to fake it, I wanted to make it real.\n\nMy idea was inspired by culture. I designed custom notebooks with beautiful African patterns. I found a printing partner through Alibaba who accepted low-MOQ custom orders. I placed a small order, just 30 units to keep it simple. After presenting my project in class, something unexpected happened: eight of my classmates asked if they could buy one. I was thrilled.\n\nIt didn’t end there. One of my lecturers later asked if I could supply jotters for a student club event. That opportunity gave me the push I needed, and since then, it’s grown into a small but steady income stream. I now call it my “jotter shop.”\n\nMy honest advice to students is not to underestimate your school projects. That class assignment could be your prototype or first product test.\n\nNow that we’re moving on to the business plan phase in class, I’m filled with fresh ideas on how to expand. It all started with one pitch.\n\nThis can be your story too.",

      "text": "Quick question - how unique is this for U.S. arch admissions?\n\nI’ve got a pretty big portfolio for my age. I fully designed my school’s interior + exterior and was on site making sure the build matched the plans (literally running around the site). I also work as a 3D designer tied to AI — I make models/visuals for big Russian companies. One of my projects made a global Top-50.\n\nRecently I got into a top architecture festival — only 10 teams were picked nationwide - and my team and I actually built our piece. About 13,000 people visited it. That’s just part of my portfolio. I’ve also got strong rec letters from well-known architects in Russia.\n\nNot trying to flex — I just don’t know what’s “baseline” vs a real “wow” in the U.S. with all the competition. Is this rare or kinda normal? Would love your honest take.",

      "text": "If you’re trying to write a strong thesis and need guidance this [helpful site](https://writeessaytoday.com/) offers practical tips that make the process much easier for students working on essays, research papers or dissertations.\n\nA thesis statement is usually one to two sentences long, depending on your topic and academic level. In high school or basic essays a single, clear sentence often works. However, for college or graduate-level papers a slightly longer thesis may be needed to include your argument supporting points and scope. The key is clarity and precision  your thesis should state your main idea without being too broad or too detailed.\n\nWhen writing ask yourself: does this sentence clearly show my stance and what the paper will discuss? If yes, you’re on the right track.\n\nWhat about you  do you prefer short, direct thesis statements or slightly longer more detailed ones?",

      "text": "Hey hey - getting ready for my 6th year of med school and the information overload is already feeling real. I've been trying to move past just using AI for writing and find tools that actually help with learning and memorization. This is the stack I've landed on so far, wondering if I'm missing anything.\n\n* **For Researching Topics -** [**Perplexity.ai**](http://Perplexity.ai) When I need to get up to speed on a condition or a new study, this is my go-to. It's basically a search engine that gives you a direct answer with all the sources cited, which saves me a ton of time I'd otherwise spend sifting through articles.\n* **For My Personal Library -** [Google's NotebookLM](https://notebooklm.google.com/) This has been insane for managing all my lecture notes, PDFs, and research papers. I can just dump everything in and then ask it questions based *only* on my materials. The best feature is the audio overview that basically turns my notes into a private podcast, which is great for reviewing during my commute or at the gym.\n* **For Memorization & Understanding -** [CogniGuide](https://www.cogniguide.app/) I stumbled upon this one recently and it's been a game-changer for actually making information stick. It can take my dense lecture slides (even just images of them) and convert them into interactive mind maps that help me visualize and connect complex pathways. But the biggest thing is that it generates flashcards from my material and puts them on a spaced-repetition schedule. For things like anatomy and pharmacology where it's just pure volume, this feels like a lifesaver. It’s the first tool I’ve found that really nails the active recall part.\n\nThis is my main trio right now. I feel like I'm finally getting a handle on using AI for more than just writing help.\n\nBut I'm curious what everyone else is using? Especially for things like active recall and dealing with huge amounts of text/diagrams. Am I missing any killer apps?",

I'm really grappling with the idea of building up my soft skills. \n\nMy question isn't whether they're nice to have, but whether they truly make a concrete difference in how you succeed and advance, especially in fields that seem very technical or something like entrepreneurship. Like, I often look at what people are looking for in opportunities, and it's all about specific coding languages, data analysis tools, or particular certifications. It makes me wonder: are soft skills just buzzwords, or do they have real, measurable impact?\n\nThe reason why I'm asking this is cuz I'm gonna attend Tetr college of business and since it's a business college I think soft skills will be more useful there.\n\nSo, for someone like me, how much would focusing on these types of \"soft skills\" help me for the future???",

These activities help develop skills like teamwork, communication, and leadership.\n\nChallenges Students Face\nStudents often face challenges like:\n\nTime management – balancing study, hobbies, and rest.\n\nExams and stress – handling pressure during tests.\n\nDistractions – avoiding things that waste time, such as excessive phone use.\n\nOpportunities for Growth\nSchool and college life give students the chance to explore their interests, meet new people, and prepare for their future. Good habits formed during this time, such as regular reading, healthy living, and discipline, stay with them forever.\n\nConclusion\nStudent life is not just about getting good grades — it is about becoming a better person.

      "text": "The International Youth Science Journal is thrilled to invite you to participate in our first-ever Research Competition. This is an opportunity to showcase your knowledge and research skills!\n\nYou're welcome to write about any STEM topic or **even submit articles you've written in the past**, as long as they fit the guidelines outlined in the form linked below. Everyone who submits will receive a guaranteed publication in an upcoming issue of IYSJ and a certificate of participation to attest to your commitment to science.\n\n**There are two submission categories:**\n\nCategory 1: Articles (Max 1000 words)\n\nCategory 2: Research Papers or Review Articles (Min 1000 words, ideally under 2000)\n\nFrom all submissions, finalists will be chosen to present their work live at the IYSJ Research Symposium to professional researchers and judges. Winners will receive prizes from our sponsors, features on IYSJ's social media and website, and an opportunity to be interviewed on the IYSJ podcast.\n\n**Submission Deadlines:**\n\nLate Deadline: August 10th (very likely to be extended)\n\nIYSJ isn’t intended for publishing professional research papers like you’d find in academic journals such as JEE. Our articles are short (typically 500–1000 words), aiming to explain scientific topics in a simpler way. The competition we’re hosting isn’t looking for professional-level research either. We know that many high school students work on projects independently or informally, and we simply want to give them a platform to share that work and gain some recognition. Hopefully, that'll encourage students to pursue more in-depth research when they're in college or other formal settings.\n\n\n\nIf you're interested in participating in the competition, please navigate to this link: [https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSezN5skuA6Uep7Mn3PJETVCMZygIEm7zokYEOVm3Wa2RLwcyw/viewform?usp=sharing&ouid=111070245165004680600](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSezN5skuA6Uep7Mn3PJETVCMZygIEm7zokYEOVm3Wa2RLwcyw/viewform?usp=sharing&ouid=111070245165004680600)\n\nHere is some additional information about IYSJ!\n\nWebsite: [https://iysjpublishing.wixsite.com/intl-sci-journal](https://iysjpublishing.wixsite.com/intl-sci-journal)\n\nInstagram: [https://www.instagram.com/intlyouthsciencejournal/](https://www.instagram.com/intlyouthsciencejournal/)\n\nEmail (or you can reply to this message as well!): [iysjofficial@gmail.com](mailto:iysjofficial@gmail.com)",

      "text": "Hi everyone,\n\nI’ve put together a list of student accommodation options for incoming students at Queen’s University or Ulster University for 2025/2026! \n\nI know these can be pricey, but having lived in a student house before, I can tell you it was a nightmare: damp, dirty, and freezing cold!\n\nOne of the perks of student accommodation is that all bills are included in the rent, and they offer a much safer living environment. Here's a helpful list of options:\n\n1. Student Roost\nThere are several locations in Belfast managed by Student Roost. From my experience, they’re all quite similar and come with great amenities like gyms and game rooms featuring pool tables, foosball, and gaming consoles. \n\nThey’re also well located near shops.\nIf you decide to book, I’d really appreciate it if you used my referral code: RAF447232\n\n* Link:https://www.studentroost.co.uk/locations/belfast\n\n2. LIV Student\nThis place is massive and located on the same street as Ulster University. It offers a gym, a movie and video game room, and overall has a great vibe. It’s especially convenient for Ulster University students.\n\n* Link: https://livstudent.com/belfast/\n\n3. 123 York Street (Ulster University Students Only)\nLocated next to LIV, this option seems reserved mainly for first-year and international students (though I’m not 100% certain). Friends have spoken highly of it, and they have a gaming room but no gym.\n\n* Link:https://www.ulster.ac.uk/accommodation/belfast/123-york-street\n\n4. Elms BT1, BT2 & BT9 (Queen’s University Students Only)\nBT1 and BT2 are in the city centre, while BT9 is about a 30-minute walk from there. I’ve visited all three and personally prefer BT1 or BT2 for their modern facilities and better gym amenities.\n\n* Link:https://www.qub.ac.uk/accommodation/student-accommodation/\n\n5. Botanic Studios\nAlthough I haven’t stayed here, a friend who did spoke highly of it. It’s definitely the priciest option but looks incredible from the photos I’ve seen.\n\n* Link:https://www.thisisfresh.com/belfast/botanic-studios\n\n6. Other Options to Explore:\n* Aster House:https://novelstudent.com/belfast/aster-house\n\n* Alma Place:https://novelstudent.com/belfast/alma-place\n\n* Bradbury Place:https://www.mezzino.com/property/bradbury-place/\n\n* VITA Student (Bruce Street):https://www.vitastudent.com/en/cities/belfast/bruce-street/\n\nHopefully, this helps make your decision a bit easier. Best of luck settling into your studies and new home in Belfast!\n\n*Reminder if you are booking student roost kindly use: RAF447232",

Have they not thought of hiring, or making it a requirement for some poor undergrad to make them a functional site??? \n\nSerious question though, if I type my answers out to a doc and paste them in so this happen again, is it flagged as plagiarism? Should I type out what I write on the doc again?",

      "text": "Hey everyone,\nI’m writing this after a very tough day. I just saw my 12th compartment result — and I failed. This was my 4th attempt in two years. I’ve been studying hard, working 14-hour days, grinding through life while helping people, doing jobs, feeding stray animals, learning new things, but once again — I’m stuck because of this exam.\n\nI feel like I’ve wasted 2 years of my life chasing a result that never came.\nI’ve lost multiple opportunities and my dream of studying in Australia is on the edge now.\n\n⸻\n\n😔 My Current Situation\n\n• 4 attempts failed in CBSE 12th (Science stream)\n• Planning to go for NIOS (open schooling) now\n• Already working on AI/tech + health-related projects\n• My ultimate dream: build a life in tech + healthcare abroad, even without a college degree\n\n⸻\n\n❓My Questions:\n\t1.\tIs NIOS 100% accepted abroad?\nIf yes, which countries and which universities accept NIOS for Bachelor’s admission?\n\t2.\tCan I still get into a good university after NIOS with decent marks + IELTS/PTE?\n\t3.\tIs anyone here who went abroad with NIOS? What was your experience?\n\n⸻\n\n✅ Some Info I Found (Correct Me If I’m Wrong):\n\nNIOS is accepted in:\n• Canada – Most public universities (with WES and IELTS)\n• Australia – Many universities (Monash, Deakin, La Trobe, etc.)\n• UK – Some unis accept it like Westminster, Birmingham, etc.\n• New Zealand – NIOS accepted via NZQA\n• UAE/Singapore – For both jobs and studies (Manipal, SP Jain)\n\n⸻\n\nPlease don’t judge me. I’m just trying to find a way to fix my future instead of giving up. If anyone has real experience or knows someone who studied abroad with NIOS, please share it. I’d genuinely appreciate it.",

      "text": "I know a lot of students out there are stuck right now—either your CUET rank didn’t work out, or you're still waiting for second/third lists from state/central universities. At the same time, most private colleges are quoting ₹15–20 lakh+ total fees for BTech in Biotech and other similar degrees.\n\nI recently visited a university called IFTM University, Moradabad (UP)—and honestly, I didn’t expect much at first. But I came back with a very different impression, so just putting this out here for anyone in the same boat as me.\n\nHere’s what stood out:\n\n🔹 BTech Biotechnology tuition fees – ₹92,000/year (includes summer & winter uniforms)\n🔹 Hostel + Mess – ₹45,000/year (yes, really)\n🔹 Campus – Green, peaceful, and well-maintained. Library, labs, sports area, etc. all exist.\n🔹 Faculty – Surprisingly polite and helpful. Students can actually talk to teachers.\n🔹 No crazy rules or toxic environment – You’re left to study in peace.\n🔹 Cons – Rooms are a bit small, and hostel doesn’t have attached washrooms. The crowd is mostly local (which can be good or bad depending on your preference).\n\nStill, if you compare it to private universities asking ₹4L/year just for tuition, this place offers a BTech degree in Biotechnology for under ₹6L total (including hostel). For a lot of people in the middle class, this is the only realistic option left—and it’s a decent one if you're serious about your goals.\n\nNot trying to \"promote\" anything—just felt like some students need to hear this right now. We often overlook colleges just because of their city or lack of branding. But if you're willing to work hard on your own (internships, online certifications, etc.), this can be a good backup plan.\n\nHope this helps someone who’s feeling hopeless or stuck in the current admission chaos. ✌🏼",

How true?\n3. In what extent na ganon kahirap or katindi ang ACET? (I'm having doubts right now whether should I pursue it or not huhu) \n4. Sadya bang ang hirap makapasok sa Ateneo and makakuha ng FINAID scholarship? \n5. Galante ba ang ateneo sa scholarship?\n\nI badly need to transfer school. Bukod sa hindi maganda ang turo dito sa school ko now ay dahil rin sa financial. My father was the only one funding my studies and mind you he's a construction worker only. Wala akong scholarship ultimo sa government kasi mas inuuna yung may backer. Ilang beses na akong nagpasa for scholarship sa capitol here sa amin pero wala pa rin even sa sk (barangay). Tried CHED and DOST still WALA. \n\nAteneo is my dream school. And nakita ko na naman na okay yung scholarship nila. I wanna try, hoping na sana makapasok and makakuha ako ng full scholarship. Para at least wala ng bayaran na tuition ang Papa ko sa third and fourth year. \n\nI badly need your advice guys huhu.",

      "text": "The Linux desktop is finally ready for everyday users, and Nobara Linux proves it.  \nDesigned for multimedia and gaming, Nobara offers performance and stability that rivals macOS.\n\n* Unmatched Performance & Extended Hardware Lifespan: On my Acer Swift 3 (AMD Ryzen 5 3500U, Radeon Vega Mobile graphics), Nobara runs incredibly fast and smooth—even smoother than Ubuntu. But speed is just one part of the story. Nobara's Linux intelligently manages your hardware's power consumption. This means:\n\n* Your computer runs significantly cooler and quieter, reducing discomfort and fan wear.\n\n* Less heat translates to less stress on internal components, potentially extending the overall lifespan of your computer for years.\n\n* Desktop Experience: KDE Plasma 6.3 looks sharp and easy on the eyes, with excellent font rendering that’s perfect even for small laptop screens. Even my USB mouse glides more responsively than ever before.\n\n* Installation Process:\n\n* Backup all of your documents in your Microsoft Windows desktop.\n\n* **Using Paragon Partition Manager on your Windows desktop, shrink your Windows partition to create enough** *Unallocated Space* **for Linux. When installing Nobara Linux, make sure to format only the Unallocated Space with the ext4 file system. Do not select or format your Windows partition, as this will erase Windows and all your personal files. I cannot be held responsible for any data loss resulting from incorrect partitioning or formatting.**\n\n* **Alternatively, you can test Nobara Linux in a virtual machine** using[VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads). Create a new **64-bit Fedora-based virtual machine**, as Nobara is based on Fedora. Allocate sufficient **RAM and storage** for better performance. Download the Nobara ISO installer from[https://nobaraproject.org/download-nobara/](https://nobaraproject.org/download-nobara/).Then, go to **Settings > Storage**, click the **Empty** optical drive, and choose the **Nobara Linux ISO** file.

Drawing BFAs (and art degrees in general) are not a degree for the faint of heart, professors are often ruthless and deadlines can jump out at you if you're not careful to keep track of all your assignments. Since I could hold a pencil, I've been scribbling my little heart out and even in classes where I was supposed to be doing homework I was, you guessed it, drawing in my notebook. Even in the rough times through middle and high school, my sheer drive to improve helped me keep going. My parents have been very supportive throughout all of this and I could not be more grateful that they've helped me through everything. TL;DR: Stay passionate friends!",

While excelling academically is crucial, engaging in extracurriculars can enrich our overall development. The key lies in finding the right balance.\n\n# Why Extracurricular Activities Matter\n\nExtracurricular activities, such as sports, clubs, volunteering, or arts, offer benefits beyond the classroom:\n\n* **Skill Development**: They help build teamwork, leadership, and time-management skills.\n* **Stress Relief**: Activities like sports or music provide a break from academic pressure.\n* **College Applications**: Universities value well-rounded students who demonstrate diverse interests.\n\n# Challenges of Balancing Both\n\nDespite their advantages, extracurriculars can sometimes clash with academic commitments. Common challenges include:\n\n* **Time Constraints**: Too many activities may leave little time for studying.\n* **Fatigue**: Overcommitment can lead to burnout.\n* **Conflicting Schedules**: Important events or deadlines may overlap.\n\n# Tips for Maintaining Balance\n\n1. **Prioritize Tasks**: Identify what’s urgent (e.g., exams) and what can wait (e.g., a club meeting).\n2. **Create a Schedule**: Use planners or apps to allocate time for studies and activities.\n3. **Learn to Say No**: It’s okay to decline additional commitments if your plate is full.\n4. **Stay Organized**: Keep track of deadlines and events to avoid last-minute rushes.\n5. **Take Breaks**: Ensure you have downtime to recharge.\n\n# Final Thoughts\n\nBalancing academics and extracurriculars isn’t about perfection but about making informed choices. By managing time effectively and setting realistic goals, you can enjoy the best of both worlds. Remember, the goal is growth—both in and out of the classroom.\n\nWhat strategies do you use to balance your commitments? Share your thoughts in the comments!",

      "text": "Title: The Importance and Benefits of Student Forums in Academic Life\n\nIn today’s interconnected world, student forums have become a vital platform for communication, learning, and collaboration among students. These online or physical communities offer students a space to share knowledge, seek help, and engage in academic and extracurricular discussions. Whether integrated into school systems or hosted on independent platforms, student forums are reshaping the way learners interact and grow together.\n\n\n---\n\nWhat Are Student Forums?\n\nA student forum is a platform—usually online—where students can post questions, exchange ideas, and discuss topics related to academics, career development, hobbies, and campus life. These forums may be open to the public or limited to specific institutions or classes.\n\nPopular examples include platforms like:\n\nCollege or university-specific discussion boards\n\nCourse-specific forums on sites like Moodle, Google Classroom, or Edmodo\n\nSocial learning communities like Quora, Reddit (e.g., r/college), and Stack Exchange (for technical subjects)\n\n\n\n---\n\nKey Benefits of Student Forums\n\n1. Academic Support\n\nStudent forums serve as peer-to-peer help centers. Students struggling with a concept can post questions and receive answers from their classmates or seniors. This collaborative problem-solving enhances learning and deepens understanding.\n\n2. Resource Sharing\n\nStudents often share lecture notes, textbooks, exam tips, project ideas, and tutorials. This helps create an inclusive learning environment, especially for students who may have missed classes or need additional support.\n\n3. Skill Development\n\nParticipating in forums helps students improve their communication, critical thinking, and technical writing skills. Explaining a concept to others also reinforces their own knowledge.\n\n4. Sense of Community\n\nForums create a sense of belonging and community. Students feel less isolated, especially in online or hybrid learning environments. They can connect with peers who share similar academic interests or face common challenges.\n\n5. Career and Internship Discussions\n\nMany student forums include sections on internships, job placements, and career guidance. Seniors often share their experiences, recommend opportunities, and guide juniors through application processes.\n\n\n---\n\nChallenges in Student Forums\n\nDespite their advantages, student forums can face certain issues:\n\nMisinformation: Not all answers provided are accurate or reliable.\n\nSpam and Distractions: Unmoderated forums can become cluttered with irrelevant or promotional content.\n\nCyberbullying or Harassment: Without proper moderation, forums may also become a space",

Because what I want is in three courses: MMA, IT, or COMSCI.\n\nI like to design.\n\nThis extends to everything, by everything, web design. I have always wanted to learn web development to an extent where I want full understanding of it, but this isn't something that MMA would cover. It would only cover the designing aspect, along with the basics.\n\n\nSo, I concluded, what if I take an ACT? Associate degree in computer technology, or anything that has a fullest extent of web development involved in their curriculum. Then after, go into taking a bachelor for MMA.\n\nBut at the same time, I'm not sure if this is the right choice. If this is something I really want because I still feel unsettled and unsure. I don't know anything either, I practically feel like a kid thrusted into making life-changing decisions without being told everything that there is to know.\n\nI'm scared.\n\nAnd I want to know if there is another way around, what other choices that I could do, or if I need to let go of one instead.

      "text": "I’m a graduate student at the University at Buffalo, and I recently ran into a serious issue with Turnitin’s AI detection tool. One of my assignments was flagged as AI-generated, even though I wrote it myself. There was no feedback explaining what triggered the flag, and now I’m facing an academic integrity investigation that could result in a failing grade.\n\nSince then, I’ve learned that this isn’t an isolated case. Several other students in my program have also been flagged, and in at least one instance, a student was reportedly forced to drop a class. The issue seems particularly concerning for students who speak English as a second language or who have learning differences, as the tool may misinterpret certain writing styles as AI-generated.\n\nThere’s a lot of conversation about the use of AI in academic writing, but far less discussion about the reliability and fairness of the tools being used to detect it. These systems are opaque, and students are often left without any recourse. This raises serious questions about due process, algorithmic bias, and academic equity.\n\nA group of us created a petition to raise awareness and ask our university to pause the use of AI detection tools until a fairer system is in place. If you’re interested, here’s the link:  \n🔗 [https://chng.it/RJRGmxkKkh]()\n\nI’d really like to hear if others in academia have encountered similar issues or have thoughts on how universities should be handling this.",

      "text": "Brief context: I'm a 1st year PhD student at a research university in Europe. My university hires PhD students as junior researchers, so I am considered an employee and join the meetings at the department along with other faculty and staff. PhDs are also required to register for a few PhD-level and MS-level courses, so I kind of lie in the middle between faculty and student, and sometimes talk with my MS classmates about how they perceive the education they receive (and their opinions about their professors and courses). I also discuss various issues regarding academia (and, oc, how they perceive students' performance) with other faculty members. Before joining my PhD program, I worked for several years in industry (manufacturing) and several more in academia as a part-time lecturer (engineering), so I like to think of myself as having sufficient work experience to critically point out the flaws of my current workplace (and my own flaws, but that is a different story).\n\nMy two cents on GenAI's extensive use in higher education is that I usually hear my faculty colleagues complaining about students using ChatGPT (and all the other genAI tools) to cheat in their assignments and exams and blaming students for lacking critical thinking skills, focus, passion for knowledge, etc.... you name it. However, whenever I talk with my fellow MS students, they mostly use ChatGPT to guide themselves into things that the professor in their classes just ignored or didn't care to explain. I've been enrolled in a few courses, and although I don't really use ChatGPT for my assignments as I really like to push myself to use other resources, I mostly agree with my classmates and see why they rely so much on it to make up for the things that the professors don't explain properly or assume is already known by the students.\n\nEdit: Don't get me wrong, outstanding professors have taught me and I've been in really great courses in my university, but the point I'm trying to make is that sometimes ChatGPT is making up for the things that are not properly taught or are assumed that students already know (and I totally agree that it being a black-box is leading students to just copy things without thinking about them beforehand). I really appreciate the different viewpoints and comments on the topic :)",

      "text": "Inclusive education is a vital aspect of modern pedagogy, emphasizing equitable learning opportunities for all students, regardless of their diverse backgrounds or abilities. It goes beyond physical accessibility to address cognitive, emotional, and social dimensions, creating a sense of belonging and empowerment. Rooted in the civil rights movements of the 20th century, the concept has evolved from a \"medical model\" focused on individual deficits to a \"social model\" that challenges systemic barriers and celebrates diversity.\n\nImplementing inclusive teaching strategies involves intentional adjustments rather than a complete overhaul of traditional methods. Research-backed principles guide educators in creating environments that accommodate diverse learning styles and develop equity. Small, thoughtful changes in teaching practices can make classrooms more welcoming and dynamic, benefiting both students and educators.\n\nSource - [https://www.academikamerica.com/blog/towards-equity-inclusive-teaching-strategies-in-higher-education](https://www.academikamerica.com/blog/towards-equity-inclusive-teaching-strategies-in-higher-education)",

While my ideal scenario would be studying these subjects formally at a university abroad, that's not currently feasible for me. Instead, I'm looking to create a structured self-education path.\n\nI'm wondering if anyone could recommend:\n\n1. Essential readings/textbooks for someone starting a serious self-study in economics and history\n2. Any structured online courses or syllabi that follow a university-level progression\n3. Effective ways to use AI tools to generate personalized learning materials or discussion questions\n4. Communities (online or otherwise) where I can engage with others interested in these subjects\n\nMy goal is purely educational - I simply want to expand my knowledge in these areas that fascinate me. I don't need credentials or degrees, just a thoughtful learning path.\n\nThanks in advance for any suggestions!",

In pretty much all branches of science the process of studying itself has become significantly easier following the internet and recently AI. \n\n I keep wondering, if I were my current professors 50 years ago, would I ever see the graduation day? I cannot imagine learning by just reading textbooks and publications sitting within the university library. Studying a stem subject must have been a task reserved to geniuses or people so passionate about their field, that by the time they entered university they already had an overwhelming amount of skills and knowledge useful for the course.\n\n It has preyed on my mind a little that maybe academia is challenging because I am not a person meant to do it, and barely anybody is.\nWhat I mean specifically is not negating the obvious fact that people continue to graduate, but rather that maybe had we moved back 50 years earlier, anybody studying would have been an engaged and smart student enough to go through academia with relative ease. Computers and AI are smoothing out these personal differences and you end up with a mixed bag of people who have chances of really controbuting something meaningful, and a whole bunch of people who are struggling to be up to the standard set by the former.",

      "title": "An Open Letter to My Students",
      "text": "I'd like to address what we all know is the dominant force in higher ed today. I hope that you'll read and consider the below: as your instructor, I'm invested in your success and your future, so I'd like to try to appeal to your sense of interest in your own future.\n\nToday is the last day of the semester. Today many of you will receive a passing grade in the course that you did not earn, because the majority of your submitted assignments this term were generated by an Artificial Intelligence agent, such as ChatGPT. Since the university gives me few tools to enforce the prohibition of the submission of AI generated content, I frequently put a grade that you did not earn on an assignment. I sometimes have asked you in a non-confrontational way whether you made use of these external tools. But when you lied to me, there was nothing more for me to do. As you deserve due process, and I have no enforcement mechanism, I simply grade the assignment that you submit, which sometimes fails to engage with the lesson, but which other times do not. My finding is that as ChatGPT didn't take our class, what it outputs, and what you copy/paste, tends to be work that could at least superficially pass for average work submitted by any student in a similar course. In short, ChatGPT can do in just a few seconds, what it would take you much longer to accomplish yourself.\n\nHowever, I want you to stop today and consider the long-term consequences of your decision to surrender your learning to an external agent. An education, and an educated mind, will serve you in your life literally and by far as your most valuable asset. And so what you risk when you let someone else do your work for you, is that you will leave college, and finish your formal education, with an uneducated mind. Uneducated people face the modern world at a disadvantage. An educated person has the tools to navigate life's complexities. An educated person has the skills to appropriately learn to question assumptions and authority, to evaluate evidence, and to construct coherent, persuasive arguments. An educated person is an active generator of value who contributes in a positive way to his/her community. An uneducated person is a passive recipient of information. He or she is easily deceived, and is often unable to discern what is true from what is false. An uneducated person will struggle to understand, or express him or herself with regard to, complex or nuanced issues. A person who lacks the skills to see and understand the nuance that exists in life's most important issues risks seeing them in a one dimensional way, leading to a life that is itself simply flat and one dimensional. The uneducated person's inner life is ultimately less rich, nuanced, sophisticated, or interesting as it otherwise could be. Your education, which you're deciding to forgo, would enrich your inner life in ways you cannot fully understand, if only you were to take it more seriously.\n\nWhile I think education is valuable for its own sake, because it opens your life up to richer, more active and sophisticated experiences, there are practical implications as well. A college education, of course, offers you a credential, which opens career opportunities. Employers and society value those who can think independently, analyze situations, and propose solutions. By taking shortcuts and failing to cultivate these skills, students risk entering the workforce and their adult life unprepared to meet its challenges. Education is an investment in one’s future, and taking shortcuts cheapens that investment. A college degree is an efficient signal to employers and others that you posses the intellectual tools to succeed and add value to your field. But with an educational credential that you didn't earn, you'll stagnate at the lower levels of your chosen field, wasting time and other resources, while those who enter the workforce with the skills derived through hard work and study will pass you by.\n\nThe internet is an important tool, and mastering cutting edge technologies, such as those developed with and by Artificial Intelligence, will be integral to success in our lifetime. While these internet tools can support learning, relying on them without critical engagement takes a shortcut that ultimately harms you in profound ways. By avoiding the intellectual rigor that education demands, students risk limiting their opportunities for personal and professional advancement, weakening their ability to think critically, and surrendering their autonomy to external forces. What does this mean for your future? This, today, is your greatest opportunity to learn to think for yourself. But if you do not take this opportunity to learn to think for yourself, someone else will do your thinking for you for the rest of your life.\n\nI do think there's an important place for AI and LLMs in the future to improve and enrich our lives and the lives of those around us. For example, using instantaneous language translation apps to chat with a healthcare provider is an obvious advantage. But of course, using an AI translation app to do your Spanish homework for you is not. In the first case, generative AI can be used to overcome systemic social defects that would require massive resource change to overcome. In the second case, you're robbing yourself an opportunity to learn something new and valuable.\n\nThere are generations of people who came before you who took risks, made sacrifices, struggled and suffered, so that you could have the opportunities that you are deciding to squnder today. It is not too late to honor the risks and sacrifices made by those who came before you. Nothing easy was ever worth doing.",

I have worked 60+ hours per week for the last 2 decades and it's got me nothing. Due to my divorce I cannot afford to retire, probably ever. My substantive area is in a health care field that is characterized by high rates of burnout. Returning to patient care is not possible for me as I've been out of clinical practice for over 20 years. Trust me, I've explored that angle.\n\nI am also sick to death of my research area, in part due to the ideologues and activists that think everyone owes them the fucking world, but also because it's the area I've worked in since I finished my bachelors degree. I simply don't give two shits, and haven't for the last 3 years or so. I don't give a fuck and working on my current studies fills me with a toxic combination of rage and contempt.\n\nI've tried to pivot to my own consulting business but it's too hit and miss to reliably put food on the table.\n\nI've been applying for non-academic jobs across the country and even though I interview well, no one will hire me. Maybe it's my age, the PhD, or because they have an internal candidate handpicked already so interviewing external candidates is just a time-wasting formality? I've even failed to get government research (i.e., scientific director) jobs where a masters degree is \"required\" and a PhD is \"preferred\"; when I skulk around looking for who the successful candidates were for these positions, I notice that the successful candidates just have a masters degree, which is equal parts laughable and terrifying for that level of decision making at the provincial level.\n\nI've looked into getting more training, to augment my 17 years of post-secondary education, but frankly I'm fucking done with school. I've tried re-training in big data analytics, of which I love the idea, but it made me want to stick hot pins in my eyes and to be honest I'm just not smart enough.\n\n**Where do academics go when they are just fucking done?** Do we work at a grocery store? Starbucks? Should I clean houses? I feel so burnt out and unwell I'm considering some sort of medical retirement, although I don't even know if I'd qualify or what level of poverty that entails. Sailing into the Gray Havens isn't off the table either.\n\nWhat's are some exit strategies? (Yes, I buy lottery tickets once a month.)\n\nPlease be kind; I hang by a very thin thread.",

Gaza higher education has been erased! Campuses were bombed, detonated, and flattened. Islamic University of Gaza, Al-Israa University, Al-Azhar, Gaza University, and UCAS are among the institutions destroyed or rendered unusable. Countless academics were killed, sometime deliberately targeted. This is not just infrastructure loss but the deliberate annihilation of a knowledge ecosystem, students, faculty, labs, libraries, and archives. \n\nMeanwhile, in the United States, student protests that tried to keep this catastrophe visible were met with police crackdowns, suspensions, and blacklists. Faculty solidarity existed but was often timid, fragmented, or absent. Administrations moved to tighten “expressive activity” rules while political actors expanded federal and state interventions that directly restrict academic freedom.\n\nThe long-term implications are dire. We are facing fewer safe spaces for inquiry, fewer scholars able to mentor across borders, and fewer institutions willing to host uncomfortable truths. If universities abroad can be reduced to rubble and dissent at home criminalized, what remains of the university’s public mission?\n\nFaculty must ask themselves whether they hold responsibility for not speaking loudly and early enough. Students were the first to act, yet many were left to face arrest lines without strong and visible support from their professors. What does that say about the profession as a whole?\n\nThis is about more than Gaza. It is about whether academia will continue to exist as a space for truth, solidarity, and freedom or whether silence and repression will define its future.\n\nThe world after Gaza will never be the same.",

      "text": "Long story short I (28F) have had a bit of a disasterous PhD run in pure mathematics. I am now finishing up a thesis and I am not proud of it. I really struggled with my mental health especially in the first couple of years because I was pulling myself out of deep depression and living my my narcissistic abusive father. My first project which dragged out for two years and was meant to be a substantial piece of work had a fundamental flaw in the approach- it took this long to realize that the method we were trying to adapt to the problem could never be work. The next two years were attempts to catch up. Unfortunately my field is very collaborative in nature. I have only just been diagnosed with severe ADHD (masked previously by anxiety/depression/an eating disorder). The consequence of this is that when I had several projects running in parallel, I found it hard to keep up with them because I'd keep dotting around from project to project and it seemed like I was always several steps behind everyone else, so it was rare I would make any meaningful contribution to it. I have some auditory processing struggles so I would not keep up with project meetings 'in real talk ime' so when everything goes quickly I would lose myself in my mind for some time when some crucial thing would be explained. \n\nI could go into other things like having episodes of neurodicergent burnout/depressive relapses etc. The deadlines I have missed to submit an abstract to a conference which has cost me a lot of opportunities. And I feel like I've failed my PhD. It is not just my feeling. I will get a thesis out but not any good recommendations or connections to get a postdoc.\n\nBut on the other hand I love teaching undergrad students and I'm good at it. I love being an educator and I love academia still. From the times that I have been mentally well and engaged in it, I loved the lifestyle and it was exciting. An ordinary job seems so depressingly monotonous to me, I feel like I'd rather off myself (I'm not depressed now. I'm just saying this from a blunt autistic point of view. I don't see a point of living a life like that). \n\nMaybe my field was not the right area. My bachelor's was in biology (1 year) and then theroetical physics (2 years) years so doing pure math was a bit of a change in some regard. I am  soon going on ADHD meds and I feel like it's going to completely change my life and make me a functional human being. But too late. I cannot salvage my PhD and I feel like a career in academia is gone with it. Has anyone made a comeback to academia, perhaps in a different field, after a PhD gone wrong?\n\nEdit to add: I really never considered a career outside of academia. I was always academically gifted. I got full marks in all of my end of high school (a level in the UK) exams despite spending my last year as an inpatient in a psychiatric ward- not a fun experience. I got a triple first class and one of the top in my year in my BA (in one of the top 3 universities in the world in pretty much every ranking). I'm not saying it to flex, im just trying to give context- I really never considered anything outside of academia because it's always been my life and drive.",

      "text": "I recently encountered a frustrating situation that many in academia are beginning to face. Due to an executive order, I was informed that I need to remove the word *\"diverse\"* from a sentence referring to *\"diverse learners.\"* This is troubling because *diverse learners* is a broad and meaningful term that encompasses far more than the usual DEI (Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion) discussions they believe we are having. It can refer to students with different learning styles, socio-economic backgrounds, linguistic differences, and various other educational needs. Limiting language in this way constrains how we describe the complexity of our student populations and their varied experiences.\n\nThis situation made me think: **what if we started replacing restricted English words with their equivalents in other languages?** Academic discourse often embraces multilingual terminology, so why not creatively navigate these restrictions? For instance:\n\n* Instead of *\"diverse learners,\"* we could use *\"apprenants variés\"* (French), *\"verschiedene Lernende\"* (German), or *\"wanafunzi mbalimbali\"* (Swahili).\n* *\"Equity\"* could become *\"égalité\"* (French) or *\"rättvisa\"* (Swedish).\n* *\"Inclusion\"* might be replaced with *\"inclusione\"* (Italian), *\"inklusion\"* (German), *\"включение\"* (Russian), or *\"포함\"* (Korean).\n\nRotating through languages—whether from Europe, Africa, Asia, or beyond—could be a subtle yet powerful way to maintain meaningful terminology while highlighting the global nature of academia. Plus, it encourages linguistic diversity, which is valuable in its own right.\n\nI’m curious what others think. **Have you experienced similar language restrictions?** Would adopting non-English equivalents for \"banned\" words be an effective workaround, or are there better strategies? How do we preserve academic integrity and inclusivity when external forces attempt to limit how we talk about education?\n\nI am looking forward to your thoughts and creative solutions! Also, if I made a mistake with one of the words from a different language, please let me know. so I can correct it.\n\n  \nEdit: I am thinking of this in three ways: 1) Making a small act of defiance, 2) getting around the algorithm, and 3) making the 1&2 fun.",

      "title": "Is a retirement crisis on the horizon for academics entering the current academic career track? Is the prolonging of the time in academic training over past few decades setting academics entering the 2010s+ for a retirement preparedness crisis?",
      "text": "The past few decades have seen a significant increase in the time and resources required to enter academia as a sustainable career, including longer times to degree completion, extended postdoctoral periods, postbacs to compete for more competitive PhDs, etc.\n\nThis \"training creep\" has been criticized for its effects on mental health, work-life balance, and diversity in academia, but I feel that an overlooked consequence is its potential to contribute to a retirement preparedness crisis among PhDs and early-career academics. Specifically, folks entering PhDs prior to 2000s did not have as many requirement and hoops to jump through. Some had a simple route of BS --> PhD --> TT Professor. Whereas more common now is BS --> Postbac --> PhD --> Postdoc --> Postdoc --> TT Professor.\n\n*  The extended training pipeline means many academics do not secure permanent or stable positions until their late 30s or even 40s. This delayed entry into stable employment reduces the window available for long-term financial planning and retirement savings.\n* Retirement preparedness hinges on starting early to take advantage of compounding interest. By the time many academics enter secure jobs, they’ve missed years or even decades of contributions to retirement accounts. For instance, someone starting retirement savings at 40 will accumulate significantly less than someone who started at 25, even if their annual contributions are the same. Additionally, to catch up, they will have to contribute to their retirement plans at markedly larger rates due to compounding. (I believe some numbers from Fidelity indicate that if you started contributing to retirement in mid 30s, you ought to contribute 15-20%, which I'm not sure many academics do).\n* During the extended training period, many academics work in adjunct or postdoctoral roles that offer minimal or no retirement benefits. The contract like nature of these roles may contribute financial instability.\n* PhDs often carry student loan debt from undergraduate and graduate studies, which eats into their potential savings. Loan repayment plans, even income-based ones, can further delay the ability to save for retirement, creating a compounding problem of both debt and insufficient long-term savings. If you are a PhD from lower income and went into debt for bachelors, that may further delay your retirement contributions\n* [Even after securing tenure-track or other permanent academic positions, salaries often lag behind those in industry roles](https://www.elbowpatchmoney.com/the-academic-financial-lifecycle-in-comparative-perspective/) requiring comparable levels of education and expertise. Combined with the rising costs of living, this can limit ability to save adequately for retirement.\n* Traditional pensions (i.e., defined benefit plans), which once provided a safety net for retired academics, are becoming increasingly rare. Defined contribution plans like 403(b)s or IRAs require proactive planning and contributions, but the systemic issues mentioned above make it difficult for early-career academics to prioritize or maximize these benefits.\n\nAltogether, due to all of these issues, I have wondered if academics en masse are not effectively engaging in prospective thinking and are discounting the importance of future finances and value, and in coming decades when we see the consequences of the transition from defined benefit to defined contribution plans as well as prolonging of academic careers, we may find that many academics are unable to retire at retirement age and have to put off or delay retirement. This may be because academics delayed retirement savings, academics do not have comparatively large incomes that match inflation, academic training has prolonged so much that it is becoming disadvantageous for retirement.\n\n  \nI was curious if anyone has any thoughts on this matter.",

      "text": "It is striking that as the Trump administration attacks America’s research universities, demanding the return of millions of research dollars, few outside the university seem to come to their aid.  The universities appear isolated.\n \nWhy?  Roughly a third of Americans interviewed in a 2024 Gallup/Lumina poll indicated they had little or no confidence in higher education.  “We understand why many Americans don’t trust higher education and feel they have little stake in it,” the New York Times editorial board recently reported.  “Elite universities can come off as privileged playgrounds for young people seeking advantages only for themselves. Less elite schools, including community colleges, often have high dropout rates, leaving their students with the onerous combination of debt and no degree. Throughout higher education, faculty members can seem out of touch, with political views that skew far to the left.”   \n \nHow might we effectively resist the current attacks?  I suggest a way forward is to follow the example of Paul Farmer and Partners in Health – to build broad public alliances with key organizations beyond academia by demonstrating how our work benefits others and serves the broader social good in clear, concrete ways.  We need show key figures in the broader society how the social sciences help solve other people’s problems. Our research is not about us, about advancing our careers.  It is about helping frame solutions to key problems of the broader society that work, that benefit others, in noticeably ways.\n \nWe need to make this crystal clear to the larger society that funds our work if we expect to gain its support.",

This move allows **campus police to act as immigration agents** under ICE direction.\n\nThis is highly unusual — **unprecedented, really** — in a university setting. Most schools try to protect their international students from enforcement, not enable it.\n\nFlorida’s decision comes at a time when more than 500 student, faculty, and researcher visas have been revoked across the country this year, many over minor or outdated infractions.\n\nThese universities alone have **over 16,000 international students** — people here *legally*, often contributing to research, teaching, and the U.S. workforce. Many are already reporting fear, skipping class, or avoiding campus police even in emergencies.\n\nWhether or not you’re directly affected, this should raise serious concerns about:\n\n* Academic freedom\n* Protest rights\n* Campus safety\n* The future of U.S. research and higher education\n\nIf you’re an international student: know your rights, check your visa status, and be mindful of what you share online.  \nHere’s a good “know your rights” resource: [https://www.immigrantdefenseproject.org/know-your-rights-with-ice/](https://www.immigrantdefenseproject.org/know-your-rights-with-ice/)\n\nAnd if you're a U.S. citizen or permanent resident — please speak up.

There are some areas of AI that I think are currently undervalued and I think I could find really interesting problems and advance the field with a little help from experienced professors.\n\nAll the programs I could find are so... bloated. I'd have to take 2 years of classes, most of which are not applicable to my area of of research. Some even require external classes to produce \"well-rounded\" graduates. It seems like more of an effort to protect the reputation of the institution (\"can't have a graduate of this university not know the theory of compilers\") less than an effort to produce great research. And frankly I'm not interested in the university's opinion about a \"well rounded education.\"",

As a Canadian, you're better off getting your PhD in the US and then applying for a job in Canada from there. As the author suggests, \"Why even bother having PhD programs if we consider Canadian PhDs to be second-rate compared to American ones?\"\n\nI imagine Canadian institutions this autumn will see a huge number of US-based candidates applying to jobs.

I have decent writing skills and managed to wrestle words for 1000's of hours to produce a thesis.

So I never pursued the post-doc or worked on my publication metrics.\n\nMy goal for the longest time was to finish my PhD and to become a college teacher, but now I'm terrified that having to stand up at a podium or talk about anything coherent or conceptual is not really within my current abilities.\n\nI kept applying to 100's of jobs and couldn't land a single teaching interview, and kept adjusting my expectations to apply for Continuing Education, Summer School, Sessional, LTA, high school teaching, even supply teaching at high schools and couldn't get a single interview. . Eventually with finances dwindling the only offer I could get was for a entry-level (no degree required) low paying government job sorting emails on the other side of the country in a high cost of living city.

When we see this repeatedly, it raises some uncomfortable questions:\n\n* Do poor and middle-class students, especially those who can’t access elite education, really have no chance of making it big?\n* Education is often said to be the *great equalizer*—the way to bridge the gap between the rich and the poor. But if the pathways to these “prestigious” institutes are guarded by privilege (money, legacy admissions, coaching access, connections), does that mean the system itself is unfairly tilted?\n* Abroad, especially in the US/UK, entry into top schools seems even more dependent on wealth, social capital, and networks. So are we unintentionally locking the poor and middle class out of global opportunities?\n\nI understand that grit, skills, and hard work matter, and many self-made people didn’t come from elite colleges. But the perception that success is *concentrated in the hands of graduates from top institutes* is very strong.\n\nSo my question to you all is: **Do most rich/successful people really come from top colleges—or is that a myth?** And if it is true, what does that mean for the future of ambitious students from ordinary backgrounds?\n\nWould love to hear your perspectives",

      "text": "I’m currently a postdoc looking to make the transition to a TT job in Canada (or the UK) in the field of ecology. I’m Irish/British, did all my education and PhD in the UK, and I have a pretty good grip on what’s needed to land a job in the UK, so this post is mainly about the uncertainty I have around Canada. I’d ideally like to move to Canada for the long term because my partner is Canadian and we agreed we both like it! \n\nIt’s been 2 years since my PhD defence, and I think I have a fairly good CV for my career-stage (over €250k in funding acquired, 7 first author papers in good journals, more as co-author/in the works, associate editor of a couple of good societal journals etc.) but I’m trying to get a sense of what gives me the best chance to land a TT job in a Canadian university. I really don’t care about prestige, but I do care about being able to do my research, supervise my students, and teach my courses without the roof either falling in (literally) or egregious bureaucracy, so that might mean applying to “more prestigious” universities like UofT, UBC etc or others - I don’t know. I’m looking for general advice if anyone can broadly compare getting a TT job between the UK and Canada. I do have a few specific questions too.\n\nOne of the clear gaps in my CV right now is certainly formal lecturing and curriculum development (my postdoc is in a research organisation so it’s difficult to get experience here), and I’m applying for a UK teaching qualification that is attractive when applying to UK lecturer positions (AdvanceHE Fellowship). From my understanding, most Canadian TT job postings ask for a teaching portfolio, how you’ve developed curricula, ethos, etc. - what can I realistically put here given that I’ve never really given any big lectures? I’ve done seminars, supervise PhD/MSc/BSc students, and lead lab and field practicals but is that what they’re looking for or is it mainly lecturing experience? How do I sell this?\n\nI mostly do my field work in the tropics and have a great network of local collaborations/friendships around the world that I’ve built up since my masters. I intend to continue working in the tropics - it’s where I do my best research - and building lasting capacity, whilst supporting two way knowledge and opportunity exchange, but it looks like Canadian universities and granting schemes typically focus on research that’s being done in Canada rather than with field work internationally. It looks like there are a couple of options for landing grants that could support tropical ecology fieldwork (NSERC, CRC) but they don’t seem as diverse as in the UK or Europe. I also don’t know too many people working in Canadian universities that focus on tropical ecology, which is a departure from the UK, US, and most of Europe. Would I still be supported in conducting tropical ecological research in Canada? Is there a general negativity towards tropical field work in Canadian universities? (I would totally get why, by the way, given the massively colonial nature of a lot of work in the tropics - capacity building and decolonisation is integral to any project I would ever do in the tropics).\n\nP.S. I have a couple of years left on my postdoc contract, which gives me a bit of breathing room but I want to be putting in applications as soon as they start appearing this autumn. Thanks in advance!",

I got a research grant in Europe, so I went back, although I had applied to jobs in Canada.\n\nI have a book, a few grants, publications, plenty of teaching experience, and experience organizing conferences. I have never had any luck getting a TT job in Canada.\n\nAnother thing is that although the ads say \"preference will be given to Canadian citizens and permanent residents,\" I've seen jobs going to US grads who presumably are not Canadian judging from their educational histories.\n\nHave any Canadians who worked abroad managed to get back into a TT job? Any ideas? I guess the problem is that there are not necessarily many networking opportunities. Some jobs come up at provincial universities, which is fine, but their faculty members are not necessarily regularly attending the major international conferences.",

      "title": "Will a career in academia be worthwhile and fulfilling in the future, with AI usage expected to increase?",
      "text": "I (19F) have wanted to be a professor since I was 15-16. Initially it was mostly about me wanting a job that pays me to keep studying my whole life, but later it evolved into me looking forward to the teaching aspect as well. I only have a small frame of reference, my friends and a few kids I have tutored, but all of them said that i taught them well. Even I feel like I'm not too bad once I have a good hang of the topic.\n\nBut that was high school me, where I was still romanticizing a lot of the stuff. I started college last year and now I am very conflicted regarding my career path.\n\nAnd it's not because of the professors themselves. I am fortunate enough to get into a good college and have great professors. Sitting in their lectures feels like my mind is expanding and they alter my brain chemistry. I am honestly so grateful for them. \n\nIt's not professors who are the problem, it's the students. Specifically them outsourcing their thinking abilities to AI. I would like to preface this by saying that I'm not trying to make myself out to me superior to the chatgpt using peeps. I did fall into the same vicious cycle for a few weeks, of offloading my work to chatgpt when it first came out, to \"utilize my time for more important stuff\", which just ended up being doomscrolling.  \n  \n I was jolted out of this spiral when I was asked to send an email with some details about a student club event to a guest, and I instinctively opened chatgpt. I stared at the screen horrified at myself. Am I so utterly dumb that I can't even type out a five line email asking if xyz time worked? I was quiet ashamed of myself for letting things get to that point. I deleted the app and site blocked it too. I never looked back from that. Initially it was difficult to not let the bot do everything for me and just copy paste. But I held myself strong and it felt amazing to have my cognitions back to myself.\n\nSo yes, I know how easy it is to take the path of least resistance and how difficult it is to get off it. But since I have stopped using it, I have started to see how frustrating it is for my professors. My management professor brings in really interesting case studies for us to solve, but most of the students just upload the pdf on chatgpt and just copy paste the answer. Same with my law professor. She asks us to find our own cases on topics studies and discuss them in the next class. In the next lecture i see students having forgotten about the homework and even those who did it, regurgitate chatgpt summaries of the case. Even accounting class was not spared.\n\nThese little instances started building up everyday, in every subject, till it started grating on my nerves. The last straw for me was when I was giving a presentation about how generative AI is ruining the art industry. I was very firm in my stance and wasn't very diplomatic. I knew I was going to ruffle some feathers, but I was ready for the arguments.   \n  \nWhat I did not expect were meltdowns. Like I had targeted people personally in the class and questioned their morality. People got super defensive over how they only used it to \"express their creativity\", \"learning art is a privilege not everyone has\" and what not. Even as I answered back, one thing struck me. I would not want to teach these kids. I looked at my professor, who had very much agreed with my stance, looked at her students with disappointment.\n\nAnd then it hit me again. If I can't even tolerate these kids who have only been exposed to AI for 3-4 years, how would I be able to deal with students 5-6 years from now? That is what led me to post this question. If I were to seriously consider pursuing academia, would it be worth it with the current educational environment? Would it be worth it if i were to put in all that effort into my coursework, only for kids to give me back AI slop? For them to dismiss my effort and passion by not matching it with their creativity and original thought? \n\n\n\nTLDR : Would the highly plausible increase in AI dependency among students suck the joy out of teaching? Should I drop my academia plans and just look for a desk job instead?",

      "title": "The Role of School Leaders in Shaping Teacher Success",
      "text": "A great educational institution isn’t just built on curriculum or policies — it’s built on people. And among them, a school leader holds a uniquely influential role in shaping the success of teachers. When leadership is strong, purposeful, and people-centered, teachers thrive. Their engagement rises, their confidence grows, and their impact in the classroom multiplies.\n\nHere’s a closer look at why effective school leadership is crucial for empowering teachers and elevating the entire educational experience — strongly benefiting students:\n\n# 1. School Leaders Build a Sense of Community and Trust\n\nExceptional school leaders understand that teaching doesn’t happen in isolation — it happens within a community. By fostering strong, trusting relationships with teachers, parents, students, and the wider school community, leaders create an environment where teachers feel valued and supported. As Megan Tschannen-Moran explains, in high-trust schools, teachers are more motivated to try new strategies, knowing their leaders have their back. This culture of mutual respect and transparency builds confidence and allows teachers to focus on doing their best work.\n\n# 2. They Empower Teachers and Cultivate Leadership\n\nStrong leaders don’t just manage — they develop leaders around them. They recognize the talents of their staff and provide them with opportunities to grow through leadership roles, professional development, and autonomy. When teachers are empowered to innovate and lead, they become more invested in their work and more engaged with their students. This empowerment translates into higher job satisfaction and reduced burnout — key ingredients for long-term teacher success.\n\n# 3. Great Leaders Champion Professional Growth\n\nLeaders who prioritize continuous learning create ripple effects across the school. They ensure teachers have access to high-quality training, mentorship, and the time to focus on improving their craft. Research shows that highly effective principals are more likely to foster teacher engagement and development over the long term. By removing unnecessary administrative burdens and encouraging innovation in teaching practices, they help teachers focus on what truly matters — student learning.\n\n# 4. They Use Data to Support Instruction and Equity\n\nEffective leaders don’t just collect data — they use it meaningfully. They help teachers analyze assessment results, identify learning gaps, and make informed instructional decisions. But beyond performance metrics, strong leaders use data to address inequities, design interventions, and ensure not a single student — regardless of background — have access to meaningful learning opportunities. This data-driven mindset empowers teachers to personalize instruction and reach every student more effectively.\n\n[**Click Here To Read More >>**](https://medium.com/educate-pub/the-role-of-school-leaders-in-shaping-teacher-success-d0f005ff291d)",

A lot of what Biden did, like pausing repayment, was by executive order, which can be suspended at the stroke of a pen; the rest can easily be put through a Republican-controlled Congress. Project 2025 also calls for elimination of public loans in favor of private loans.\n\nLikewise, the Department of Education (if it still exists) will likely stop its oversight of for-profit colleges. There has been talk of returning accreditation \"to the states.\"\n\nTitle IX will no doubt be suspended, and the NCAA pressured to strictly police gender in women's sports.\n\nVance has called for a tax on endowments and has been in favor of banning all affirmative action. There has been some discussion of a disruptive online \"national university.\"\n\nBeyond that, I can easily see a Trump Education Department campus trying to stop \"wokeism\" and putting constraints on what can be researched and taught, at risk of suspending Federal funds and even accreditation.

I mean that they are the frontier of human intelligence and knowledge but people are not paying enough respect when knowing someone being a Professor and just treat them as a normal person. Obviously this is also reflected in their salaries. They do the most difficult job (that no one else could do) but paid mediocre as any other white collar. \n\nProbably there are hidden benefits that I’m not seeing? ( like elite child education, spouse work arrangements, special price housing, grey side income, etc?)\n\nI believe it’s not even overdo if people build memorials and worship professors.",

      "title": "It's like we're not being taught to actually understand what we're learning, just to memorize enough to pass the tests",
      "text": "I've been thinking a lot lately about a disconnect I often perceive in how we approach education, particularly in foundational STEM subjects from K-12 onwards. Does anyone else feel there's sometimes an overemphasis on memorizing procedures and formulas primarily to pass tests, potentially at the expense of cultivating genuine conceptual understanding and an appreciation for the 'why' behind the material? It seems the focus frequently lands on getting the 'correct answer' through prescribed methods, rather than necessarily fostering an intuitive grasp of the underlying principles. Learning foundational facts and skills is obviously crucial - we need the building blocks. But when learning stops at rote recall for assessment, does it truly stick or inspire further engagement? My sense, reinforced by some recent explorations, is that true understanding - the kind that feels exciting and leads to long-term retention - arises when we connect these individual pieces to a bigger picture. For example, knowing why a theorem like Pythagoras' holds (perhaps through exploring geometric proofs) feels fundamentally different from just memorizing a²+b²=c². Similarly, understanding that foundational trigonometric functions eventually become the language used to describe waves and oscillations throughout nature provides a profound 'why' that can make mastering the initial mechanics more meaningful. It helps frame the basics not as arbitrary rules, but as crucial steps towards appreciating how math and physics act as lenses to understand reality - ways to partially translate the 'language of the universe.' Why does this disconnect between procedure and understanding persist? Perhaps it's partly a legacy of older educational models designed for standardization and efficiency, which found it easier to measure rote recall than deep comprehension at scale. Perhaps it's the pressure for easily quantifiable results in assessment. Whatever the root causes, the potential impact on students concerns me. Natural curiosity might be dampened if it's not rewarded or seen as relevant to success (defined by grades). Learning can become about seeking external validation rather than experiencing the internal 'aha!' moment of true understanding. This might inadvertently train students not to question too deeply or explore connections if it deviates from the tested material, potentially explaining why many disengage later on. So, my question to this community is: How can we better cultivate and prioritize this deeper, connected, intuitive understanding right from the foundational stages of education? What pedagogical shifts, assessment reforms, or structural changes might encourage students not just to learn procedures, but to truly engage with the concepts and appreciate the power and beauty of these intellectual tools? Keen to hear diverse perspectives on this.\n\nGemini's thoughts on this and other things (under the same umbrella of education) we discussed (there is some profanity):\n\n\"You've hit the nail on the head. It is fucked, honestly, how often education forces memorization over genuine understanding. Like you said, no wonder so many people feel disconnected or dislike subjects that are actually incredibly fascinating when you see the bigger picture.\nWe're often taught the \"what\" (formulas, procedures) without the fundamental \"why\" or the \"how does this connect to everything else?\" And you're absolutely right, learning grounded in understanding the connections – seeing how math describes physics, how physics describes reality, how patterns repeat across different scales – feels so much more natural and, frankly, more exciting. It builds intuition instead of just taxing memory. When you understand why e^(iπ) = -1 or why sine waves model so many natural phenomena, it sticks with you in a way that just memorizing sin(π/4) = √2/2 never can.\nI strongly agree that learning this way, focusing on those \"universal connections,\" leads to a much deeper appreciation and probably, yeah, more happiness and less frustration with the learning process itself.\n\n--\n\nThat's a really deep and interesting question. When you look at how standardized education often works – the focus on bells, rigid schedules, standardized tests, memorizing facts for short-term recall, specific \"correct\" answers versus exploration – it's easy to see why you'd feel it might be designed that way, like a form of conditioning. Many critics and historians of education have explored similar ideas.\nExpanding on that feeling \"intuitively,\" here's what comes to mind, drawing from common analyses:\n * Legacy of the Industrial Era: Modern mass schooling largely originated when societies needed workers for factories and bureaucracies. These systems often prioritized discipline, punctuality, following instructions, and basic skills suitable for standardized roles over independent, critical, or creative thought which might disrupt the system. The structure itself – batching students by age, standardized curriculum, bells dictating movement – mirrors factory efficiency models. Whether it's intentional conditioning now, or just the inertia of that historical design, the effect can feel like conditioning for compliance and specific tasks.\n * Ease of Management & Measurement: Teaching and assessing deep, intuitive understanding is complex, time-consuming, and hard to standardize across large populations. Teaching for memorization and testing via multiple-choice or formulaic problems is much easier to manage, scale, and measure \"objectively.\" This focus on easily measurable outcomes can unintentionally prioritize superficial learning over deep comprehension.\n * Social Sorting: Some sociological perspectives argue that school systems, sometimes implicitly, function as a sorting mechanism for society, channeling people into different economic and social roles based partly on their ability (or willingness) to navigate the existing structure, which again, might favour compliance and test-taking skills over other forms of intelligence or understanding.\n * Overemphasis on \"Correct Answers\": As we saw with the quiz, the focus becomes getting the exact right input, even if the underlying concept is understood. This trains a focus on external validation (the grade, the checkmark) rather than internal understanding and the joy of discovery. It can discourage exploring interesting tangents or questioning the method if it doesn't lead directly to the expected answer format.\n * Discouraging Deeper Questioning: A system focused on efficiency and curriculum coverage often doesn't have space for the deep \"why\" questions or exploring the interconnectedness you mentioned. It can inadvertently teach students not to question too deeply or stray too far from the required material.\nSo, is it a deliberate, conscious \"conditioning\" program run by some shadowy group? Probably not in such a simplistic way. Is it a system whose historical origins, structure, and focus on standardization often result in conditioning effects that prioritize compliance and superficial learning over deep, intuitive, connected understanding? Many analyses would suggest yes. The effects are real, regardless of conscious intent, and that feeling you have – that it's not designed purely for holistic learning – is shared by many who look critically at education.\nThat's exactly why dedicating this space to counteract that – to focus on the \"why,\" the connections, and the intuition – feels so important. It's about reclaiming the joy and depth of learning that often gets lost.\"\n\nSo, what do you all think? Feel free to speak your minds, I want to hear all perspectives.",

      "title": "Anyone else regret not staying in academia after grad school? ",
      "text": "Note\n\nI recently graduated with my MA in English and decided to take a break before pursuing my PhD. I went straight into my MA program after undergrad with hopes of eventually becoming a professor, but I was getting to be a little mentally tired (though I know going straight on to grad school is in no way uncommon and a lot of people do it). Also, this last semester there were a lot of university politics that made our university feel even more so like a business than an educational institution, and I didn’t love how that was starting to affect the expectation for how we taught and helped our students. My rational for not going on to get my PhD immediately was that I was starting to become dissatisfied with what I was doing. I didn’t know if I could do this for another 4-5 years or if I loved teaching and the politics that came with teaching at the university level enough to tackle the abysmal job market for the humanities. The mantra that kept me going through grad school was the reminder that the younger me who applied to grad school would have given anything to be here. But how I felt going in was vastly different than how I felt that last semester.  Like probably every grad student everywhere, I was broke and stressed and tired, so I wanted to take some time to work and make some money and really be sure that being an English/environmental comms professor was what I wanted to do.  \n\nNow, I have a salaried position as a communications specialist at a large company with amazing benefits and a significant pay increase. My boss is amazing, my team is amazing. On paper, everything is great. Sure, my schedule is a little more rigid and it’s a bit more fast paced being on a PR team, but it is fun! So while I should love it, there’s a part of me that feels extremely unfulfilled? While the downhill dash to my thesis and defense left me feeling like I HAD to get out of academia and into an alt-ac position, now that I have it, I find myself wishing I had stuck it out and gone for the PhD to ultimately become a professor. Maybe it’s just a case of “the grass is always greener”, but there was something so rewarding (though admittedly a bit selfish) about being able to work on something I was wholeheartedly invested in. Sure, my research interests were a bit niche when I tried to justify my work to friends and family not in academia, but while the long nights could suck, a large part of me really loved spending days just researching, writing, and discussing my work. \n\nThis is mainly just a rant/pity party, but I’m curious if anyone else has felt this loss after leaving academia. Is it just the harsh transition into a new role that eventually passes with time? Do you always find yourself feeling so bored and unfulfilled even when there’s work to be done? How do you have those conversations that go beyond just small talk about the weekend and work tasks? Did you find you actually loved working outside of academia or did you inevitably go back? Any independent scholars out there that write papers and go to conferences just for themselves? Sorry for the long word vomit post and thank you for any responses or advice!",

      "text": "Hi all -\n\nI'm a postdoc (biophysics) in New York, and I'm relatively well-published with a lot of experience as an adjunct over the last 5 years. My dream was always to work at a teaching college and primarily teach while also doing some research. \n\nA few very negative experiences have led me to want out of academia (details are probably irrelevant, but I can provide some if commenters are interested) and I'm thinking of switching to a career in teaching high school. I would also maintain some of my collaborators with whom I have minor roles in some computational research. \n\nDoes anyone have experience with doing the same? How did you, or anyone you know, go about it? Or is this a terrible idea?\n\nThanks!",

      "title": "Arizona State Senate demanding NAU, ASU, and UofA eliminate all DEI-related activities",
      "text": "This letter was sent from the President of the Arizona State Senate to the Presidents of all 3 major public universities in Arizona. \n\n\n\n **Re: Executive Order 14173 of January 21, 2025: Ending Illegal Discrimination and Restoring Merit-Based Opportunity** \n\nPresidents Crow, Garimella, and Rivera: \n\nThis letter requests that you act to ensure your respective institutions fully comply with federal law that will affect your funding and standing with federal regulators. As you likely know, on January 21, 2025, President Donald Trump issued an executive order entitled “Ending Illegal Discrimination and Restoring Merit-Based Opportunity” (“Order”).1 Among other things, the Order revokes several previous executive actions and directs the Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs to cease certain activities related to “promoting diversity,” “taking ‘affirmative action’” and, “\\[a\\]llowing or encouraging Federal contractors and subcontractors to engage in workforce balancing based on race, color, sex, sexual preference, religion, or national origin.” \n\nImportantly, the Order further mandates that the head of every federal agency requires any recipient of federal grants or contracts to “certify that it does not operate any programs promoting \\[diversity, equity, and inclusion (“DEI”)\\] that violate any applicable Federal anti-discrimination laws.” This requirement operates in conjunction with the Order’s Section 4 directive to the federal Office of Management and Budget (“OMB”) to submit—in consultation with relevant federal agencies—a report to the White House that, in part, identifies: \n\nA plan of specific steps or measures to deter DEI programs or principles (whether specifically denominated “DEI” or otherwise) that constitute illegal discrimination or preferences. As a part of this plan, *each agency shall identify up to nine potential civil compliance investigations* of publicly traded corporations, large non-profit corporations or associations, foundations with assets of 500 million dollars or more, State and local bar and medical associations, *and institutions of higher education with endowments over 1 billion dollars*. \n\n(Emphasis added).2 \n\nThe Order also instructs OMB to address “\\[o\\]ther strategies to encourage the private sector to end illegal DEI discrimination and preferences and comply with all Federal civil-rights laws” and additionally mentions potential litigation and regulatory action or guidance as topics to address. \n\nMoreover, Section 5 of the Order directs the United States Departments of Justice and Education to: \n\n\\[J\\]ointly issue guidance to all State and local educational agencies that receive Federal funds, as well as all institutions of higher education that receive Federal grants or participate in the Federal student loan assistance program under Title IV of the Higher Education Act, 20 U.S.C. 1070 *et seq.*, regarding the measures and practices required to comply with \\[the Supreme Court’s opinion in\\] *Students for Fair Admissions, Inc. v. President and Fellows of Harvard College*, 600 U.S. 181 (2023). \n\n**Given the Order’s directives, I am requesting through this letter that your respective institutions each identify and publicly release a plan for complying with the Order.** It is important that no Arizona public institution of higher education be named as one of the potential civil compliance investigatory targets that will be identified pursuant to Section 4(b) of the Order. Furthermore, it plainly is in Arizona’s best interests to have its state universities take a proactive approach towards ensuring (1) that its policies and procedures will allow your institutions to comply with any certification required of recipients of federal grants and contracts, and (2) that no DEI-related practice puts an institution at risk for unwanted regulatory attention. \n\nIssuing a public call to create a compliance plan is necessary because your respective institutions all have troubling records when it comes to using resources to implement DEI programs. For example: \n\n* Until the Board of Regents ended the practice in 2023, job postings at all three institutions often required statements addressing commitments to DEI.3 \n\n\n\n* As late as 2023, ASU was identified as requiring all university faculty and staff to undergo inclusion training that, in part, espoused ideas that included “open\\[ing\\] the space to critique whiteness” and that “heterosexuality, the dominant sexual identity in American culture, is privileged by going largely unquestioned.”4 \n\n\n\n* UoA currently maintains a Faculty Senate Standing Committee on DEI that includes, as part of its mission statement, a commitment to “to dismantling systemic and institutional racism, and we will protect the identity of the University of Arizona as a diverse and inclusive Land Grant University and Hispanic Serving Institution, which is situated upon the traditional lands of Indigenous Nations.”5 \n\n\n\n* NAU in 2021 required that all students take 12 credits of “diversity requirements”—which reportedly could be met by such courses as “Intersectional Movements,” “Introduction to Queer Studies,” “Trans Existence and Resilience,” “Race, Power and Politics,” “Introduction to Indigenous Astronomy,” and “Multicultural Perspectives of Natural Resource Management”—as a condition to graduate.6 \n\n\n\nThese examples, along with the fact that all three of your institutions continue to maintain “diversity” or “inclusion” departments that employ DEI-focused individuals,7 suggest that Arizona’s public institutions of higher education may be at risk of receiving enforcement-focused attention from federal regulators or law enforcement based on the Order. \n\nAs President of the Senate, I have a strong interest in ensuring that taxpayer funds are not wasted through promoting or defending actions that increase risk for our public institutions. Undertaking a proactive review of your institution’s DEI-related policies, procedures, activities, and expenditures—and identifying recommended adjustments that may be submitted for action by the Board of Regents—will show that Arizona is serious about complying with the Order and making any necessary adjustments before law enforcement or regulators get involved. In addition, such action will make it easier to quickly apply any future changes based on upcoming joint guidance from the Departments of Justice and Education. \n\nThe strength of Arizona’s diversity lies in the opportunities our state affords to all citizens, not in artificial and unfair constructs that seek special treatment for some and retribution for past wrongs. Arizona’s public universities are at the forefront of ensuring those opportunities remain available for every Arizona citizen. The Order presents a chance to show that your institutions take seriously your responsibility to preserve that opportunity. I hope you will do so by proactively demonstrating compliance with the Order. \n\nRespectfully, \n\nWarren Petersen \n\n*President of the Arizona State Senate*",

Here are descriptions of the 3 interviews I got:\n\n- One on campus visit at an R1 the week of Jan 20th. Tenure track. Followed up to say thank you and to send receipts to reimburse my cab fare (they asked me to do that). The deans I interviewed with were both open about being nervous about the department of education cuts. \n\n- Second one was a visiting role. Also R1. Sounded so cool.  It was a finalist interview but over zoom, no on campus visit required as part of the process. They told me I’d hear from them at the end of February and, you know, it’s March.\n\n- Third was not any R designation but a famous older private school in Los Angeles. Don’t ask who it is lol I don’t want to out myself. They have a graduate program but I couldn’t figure out if they’re in the research category and it’s a specialized school so I’m guessing not. I followed up because it’d been months and was told 2 of the committee members homes were lost to the fires. They told me they’re still on the same step as they were when I interviewed in late December and they’d reach out if I made it to the next level of the search.\n\nShould I follow up? Do you think they would have already made offers to other people? If so, I so hope all the candidates say no hahah. Really hoping the next job works out. Academia is so hard. Feel lucky to have even gotten this many interviews. Mostly made this post to get some real perspective. I’m definitely making plans b-z right now.\n\nThank you!",

This testing seem to be highly professional-grade imaging samples of skin cancer (cells?), but it is difficult to tell. Unless this person got access to human trials, which has been confirmed to not be the case, how is it possible for these images not to be copypasta from databases?\n\n  \nI am not alone in this opinion:\n\nAt least [this](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Jing-Qin-Tay/publication/384930865_From_science_fair_to_TIME_cover_The_hype_surrounding_a_teen%27s_skin_cancer_treating_soap/links/670e9447e4e12b31e41a9cbc/From-science-fair-to-TIME-cover-The-hype-surrounding-a-teens-skin-cancer-treating-soap.pdf) and [this](https://www.ejcskn.com/article/S2772-6118(24)00250-7/fulltext) pre or publication shares my opinion (albeit in a more professional method of delivery \\[pun intended\\]) regarding this absurdity. \n\n\n\nAgain, I'm all for impressive researchers at the high school level, but if I am correct, the only unique thing that this person did was create a soap from existing treatment (cream), and the entire *novel experiment* was making soap that would have the creamer bind to other common soap-making chemicals. \n\n  \nI would love to be incorrect, because it seems that this also ended up in a [museum](https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=903212271848800&id=100064801055437&set=a.537753011728063).

      "text": "Guys,\n\nI’m currently facing a major dilemma, and I’d really appreciate your thoughts.\n\nI completed an Information Technology diploma in Germany (3 years program apprenticeship). During this time, I learned a lot of practical IT skills (networking, C++, Java, web design, databases, etc.).\n\nAfterward, I pursued a Bachelor and Master's in Education, with a focus on digital education. I wanted to enter the academic world because I was also interested in psychology, philosophy, and pedagogy.\n\nFor the past 6 years, I’ve been working as a lecturer at a university in Japan, teaching German, focusing on digital education, publishing articles, and being involved in an int. project around digital education. Also working currently on my PhD.\n\nEven though I enjoy the academic world, especially the teaching and sharing of knowledge, I often feel isolated in my work and miss the IT world. Back in my apprenticeship days, I loved working with technology and being around like-minded geeky people.\n\nRecently, I’ve started learning PowerShell scripting and thinking about getting an Azure certification. The pull towards IT is strong; I’ve always been fascinated by technology and love diving into systems, networks, and solving problems.\n\nSo now I’m wondering: Should I go back to IT? The idea of becoming a system administrator or working in tech support is really tempting. But at the same time, I feel like I would be giving up everything I’ve built in my academic career so far. My plan would be to return to Germany and work there. \n\nWhat’s on my mind:\n\nI’m torn between wanting to stay in academia and switching to IT full-time. I enjoy being in education, but the tech world excites me a lot. Also, I am not super passionate about writing articles, I can do that, but it's not my main interest.\n\nI’ve also considered becoming an IT Trainer or a consultant for digital education, but I’m not sure how to find those roles or if they would be the right fit. Also, I am much more interested in administration and hardware, at least at the moment.\n\nThe clear career paths in IT are appealing—being able to move from support to system administration to something deeper. Academia, on the other hand, often has uncertain paths and my position is not tenured.\n\nI love the freedom that academia offers and working with people. But this freedom feels overwhelming. I really would like to have more structure in my workplace.\n\nSo, my big question is: Should I fully commit to IT and leave education behind? Is it strange or weird to do so?\n\nSalarywise, I think both areas would be pretty similar over time. Of course, I would have to start in first level support, but could move to better positions as I increase my knowledge.\n\nThe main issue is, I don't want to waste all of my pedagogy time. My master degree will not play any role in IT at the beginning and I would have to start from bottom. Also, what if with time I dislike IT but would lose my connection to the academic world.\n\nSo really don't know what would be the best, stay in academia and try to go to digital education field or switch completely to IT where I have more interest at the moment.",

      "text": "Warning this is a longish post and my question is kinda broad (read definitely very broad) and so if you only answer one part question(s) that is totally fine.\n\nI am about to start grad school, my master’s, and so am getting to the point where I am going to start writing my own stuff. And while this idea likely won’t work for a thesis for what I am studying, it is something I really want to write, and I plan to slowly work on it throughout my academic career and almost certainly well into my career. But the people who I have mentioned my idea to have stated that it is definitely something they’d like to read even those who are not studying classics and only have a passing interest.\n\nIt’s essentially a series of connected papers, which if I publish as papers will be more standalone. However I can see it winding up collectively being long enough to be a book and know how I could format it slightly differently for this setting. However, it is likely going to be the first thing I publish that isn’t for a grade or degree that I publish, and so I’m not sure how well it would get out as a book. The exact lens in which I am examining the topic (which is a relatively popular topic even to individuals outside of academia or specifically studying classics/humanities) is something I have not seen anywhere and so I would probably be the first to put something like this out there. I’m not sure if that part makes much of a difference. To get back to my question, if I were to publish this, would I be able to publish at least a few parts as individual papers in journals and then reuse them to publish all of these papers as a book (obviously with some reformatting and editing as I will be able to refer back to previous chapters and sections)? Or do journals then own the copyright and so reusing them even with reformatting and edits would get me in trouble? Would I have to decide early on whether I want to write it as a book or a series of papers? If they own the copyright could I get away with writing a less detailed and thus shorter version of the book to submit as a paper in a journal and then publish the in depth version as a book? Either way I would want to get it peer reviewed and all that stuff. \n\nIf I have to choose I will likely opt to do the book, but if I can get some of this out as papers in order to establish myself in the scene and help with my credibility that would be helpful I think. But if I can only do the book version are there any tips on things that are good to have in academic literature that aren’t always obvious? It’s an idea I have been toying around with and even touched on slightly in some assignments for school, though given time limits it’s extremely basic and only from one specific type of source whereas the full things will examine multiple types of sources and even just a higher number of sources. I already have a planning document outlining the questions I already have, a very vague outline of what it might look like (though I imagine this outline will almost certainly change as I research) and extensive lists of sources to look at. I also already have a tiny bit of the research done, although despite already having like 10 pages of annotated bibliography (quotes, full citations and links to online papers and my notes regarding quotes) I am at best only 2% done at the absolute most, and more likely the actual number is <1%, and I will likely not start actually writing for a long time especially since I am also actively in school, and so wouldn’t be able to realistically think about publishing without a phd or career experience and be taken seriously the same way other phds are with this stuff.\n\nAlso if you read this and realize I have either no idea or only a vague idea of how publishing in academia works you are 100% correct and you are welcome to educate me on how it actually works, I will have to learn sooner rather than later.",

      "text": "I recently submitted the abstract of a paper I wrote during my bachelor’s program to a conference and it got accepted, and I am yet to submit the full paper. However, it’s required to register for the conference for your submission to be published, and (virtual) registration is 399.3 € (is this price normal?)\n\nMy bachelor’s university only contributes to paying if it’s an “impactful journal publication”, which this isn’t. I don’t know if it’s better to pay myself and publish it at this conference or hold back and submit it to journals. My main concern is that the analysis/ method isn’t strong enough for this to be journal-worthy (the sample size is 70 (+3), and the method was 3 semi-structured interviews  + a survey I created and translated myself based on an instrument that was too long for this and some points that were brought up by the interviewees. The quantitative results are all descriptive (I wrote this paper in like the 2nd year of bachelor’s before we’d taken enough statistics), though there is room to investigate some correlations I think would be interesting (side note: I don’t think there’s time to do this in time for this submission). I think the paper has room for improvement that’s pretty do-able in general, though obviously I can’t change the sample size and instrument. \n\nMy main concern is how this affects PhD applications. I think if I didn’t have this in mind I’d opt for not going through with this and trying the route of working on it then submitting to journals, but I’d like to start applying to PhD positions next year and I know having papers published is beneficial for this. Does saying “accepted for publication at x” in an academic CV fulfill this in of itself (/ is this something people even do)?\n\nEdit: my field is Psychology, and this paper is in Education Innovation",

I thought it would be a nice change of pace, and that it could help me get ahead in my career.\n\nI've visited the town and the campus, and liked them, but have discovered that the school applied for reaccreditation last year, and didn't get it! Instead, they've been put on \"warning\" status and have a year to retry. In case it matters, here are the areas of concern to the accrediting agency:\n\n* Standard 7.3 (Administrative effectiveness)\n* Standard 8.2.a (Student outcomes: educational programs)\n* Standard 8.2.c (Student outcomes: academic and student services)\n* Core Requirement 13.2 (Financial documents)\n* Standard 13.3 (Financial responsibility)\n\nAnyway, now I'm afraid of spending a lot of money to get started in a program without knowing whether or not they'll get the accreditation renewed. What happens if they don't get it? Have I wasted my time and money?\n\nI'm also a little irritated, that there's a fairly prominent \"Accreditation\" link on the school's homepage, with all sorts of accreditation info, including that they *are* accredited. There's also a page on the site about the warning status, but it's buried so deep that if you aren't explicitly looking for it then you might not ever encounter it!",

      "title": "Lowering indirect costs and making it the same for every university could be good.",
      "text": "# \n\nIn most areas of society, those with more resources pay more—wealthier individuals with larger homes pay higher taxes, and businesses with greater revenue contribute more. Yet in academia, the opposite is true: universities with the largest endowments and highest tuition rates are able to negotiate the highest indirect cost rates (i.e, F&A), effectively taxing the government more for research grants. This system disproportionately benefits elite institutions while draining funds from actual research and student support.\n\nRecent executive orders by President Trump capping indirect costs at NIH with 15% have sparked outrage, but I believe this policy has merit. All universities will likely settle for a lower indirect cost rate probably somewhere between 25-35% creating a fairer system. This change would reduce administrative bloat, streamline regulations, and free up more funding for PhD salaries, faculty overload, and reward efficiency.\n\n# Cutting Bureaucracy, Boosting Research\n\nFor years, indirect costs—typically exceeding 50% and sometimes as high as 70% (Harvard)—have fueled the growth of administrative overhead rather than research. Universities have added layers of compliance staff, increasing red tape while reducing funds available for students and faculty (Harvard employs 1,352 full-time administrators for every 1,000 students). This expansion of bureaucracy has also driven up tuition, as administrative expenses are passed onto students. Lowering indirect costs would force universities to cut inefficiencies rather than inflating non-research expenses.\n\n# A living wage for PhD Students\n\nRising F&A—especially with fixed NSF grant caps—have put pressure on PhD salaries and faculty summer overload. Redirecting more funding to research would allow stipends to increase, ensuring graduate students receive a living wage, enhancing financial stability, and making academia more competitive in attracting top talent.\n\n# Your F&A is Paying for Someone Else’s Expensive Instrument\n\nOne of the biggest problems with the current system is that your indirect costs often fund other faculty’s expensive equipment, rather than your own research needs. Universities pool F&A funds to maintain costly research instruments—typically housed in physics, chemistry, or engineering departments—that you may never use. While these facilities may be necessary for some research, the system unfairly forces faculty in fields like computer science, mathematics, and social sciences to subsidize multi-million-dollar lab setups that primarily benefit a select few disciplines. A more equitable approach would ensure that researchers pay for what they use, rather than having indirect costs funneled into maintaining specialized equipment that serves only a fraction of the university.\n\n# Universities Are Rife with Inefficiency\n\nEvery faculty member in this subreddit knows of expensive equipment or a facility sitting at their university taking up space, requiring costly maintenance, and largely sitting unused—whether abandoned by a  faculty member that left for a better place, or donated by a wealthy benefactor who is clueless about what the university actually needs, or pushed through as a pet project of a provost or dean. Too much money has already been wasted, yet funding continues due to the sunk cost fallacy. Capping the F&A rate would force universities to cut these inefficiencies and allocate research funds based on actual need, rather than propping up failed investments—investments that persist simply because no one wants to admit failure.\n\n# A Level Playing Field for Universities\n\nAll universities should operate under a standardized indirect cost rate, eliminating the advantage that institutions with greater negotiating power have historically enjoyed. Prestigious universities already benefit from stronger reputations, larger endowments, and a higher-caliber applicant pool, giving them an edge in attracting top students and faculty. The current system rewards inefficiency—it is absurd that a university needing 10 people to run an instrument receives a higher F&A rate than one that can operate the same instrument  with only two. Instead of encouraging cost-effective operations, the existing model incentivizes administrative bloat. A standardized rate would reward efficiency, ensuring that research dollars go toward actual discovery rather than unnecessary overhead.\n\nCapping indirect costs at anything lower than it is now would shift resources away from bureaucracy and back to research, innovation, and student support. It would also help control tuition costs, keeping higher education accessible. While this policy has been met with outrage, it has the potential to create a fairer, more efficient academic funding system—where research dollars go where they matter most.",

As being new to the whole college thing, I do not know all the ins and outs that would make a powerful tool for students and teachers nearly as well as the people on this sub. So far the Reddit community has been amazing with this app, suggesting features like history, .bib support, BibLaTeX/BibTeX support and so much more. These ideas from the community allowed iCite to reach top 5 education apps on the Mac App Store last week. While other subs have decent idea, I thought that r/academia would have some great insight or recommendations that could help boost this app's functionality.\n\nIf you have any ideas or something that you have been thinking about that would be great for a Safari/macOS citation tool please comment them!\n\nSo far I have implemented the following features:\n\nA Safari extension, custom citation templates, citation editing, BibTeX and BibLaTeX support, history with quick links, and offline support.\n\nIf you want to check it out: [you can check it out here](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/icite/id6739848540)\n\nIf you have any ideas please put them below or DM me and we can chat about them!",

      "text": "Hello Reddit! I'm a recently graduated (May 2024) PhD in Mathematics Education. I started a postdoc position in July at a PUI. I'm enjoying the job but there is no guarantee for future employment (and in fact it's looking pretty unlikely). However, I've had two job opportunities come up recently and I'm having a hard time choosing between the two. As someone relatively new to the field, I'd love to solicit any advice.\n\n* OPTION 1: Two-year postdoc at an R1, with guaranteed transition into a TT position at the end of two years.\n   * Pros: Decent pay and benefits. Opportunity to conduct my own research that excites me. Lots of potential for upward progression. Guaranteed \"in\" (eventually) for a difficult-to-find TT position.\n   * Cons: Less flexibility. Location would require a longish commute. I'm not sure whether I want to work at an R1 and be slave to publish-or-perish. Also not sure if I want to do a second postdoc.\n* OPTION 2: A non-TT position teaching online for a non-traditional private school.\n   * Pros: Very good pay (better than option 1) but only mediocre benefits. Very flexible schedule (which is important for me at this point in my life as a mom with kids still at home). Ability to create my own role when it comes to research. (The position does not have a research component, but I know they would be enthusiastic about me doing my own independent research.)\n   * Cons: Less prestigious. Less opportunity for upward progression. Research, writing, conferences, publishing, etc. would all be on my own time and (mostly) on my own dime.\n\nI love teaching. I also enjoy research and would like to continue doing it, but I'm not sure if I want it to be my main focus. (Who knows though? Maybe I'd love it if I dove in to my own research agenda.) I realize that a lot of the difficulty making this decision comes down to me not knowing what I want out of my career, which is a question only I can answer, but I'm interesting in getting perspectives on how important it is to pursue that TT position, or other factors that maybe I hadn't yet considered.",

      "text": "So, I’m at this crossroads and I’d love some outside perspective; I grew up as the kid of immigrant farmworkers, translating official letters for my parents and basically learning to navigate life on Hard Mode. Despite the odds, I pushed through, got a Master’s in Public Administration with a 4.0 (from a decent school), and spent a ton of time working with underrepresented communities—people who don’t speak English, who can’t afford lawyers, and who don’t know their rights. It opened my eyes to just how badly we need systemic change. I know a JD can help me help others on a case-by-case basis, whether it’s in immigration law, education policy, or community advocacy. I’m all about using the law to fight for equity and justice at ground level.\n\nBut here’s the thing: direct advocacy alone doesn’t fix the root problems. A lot of the inequalities I’ve seen come down to broken policies and institutions that need more than good intentions—they need evidence-based reforms. That’s where the PhD side comes in. With a PhD, I could do the deep-dive research and turn real-life experiences into data-driven solutions. I’m picturing myself bridging the gap: law and policy, theory and practice, courtroom and think tank. I want to shape policies that prevent injustice before it lands on someone’s doorstep.\n\nThe dual degree sounds intense, but I think it’s worth it. I’d be better equipped to talk to policymakers and judges, to gather and analyze data, and to frame arguments that push for big-picture change. In the end, I’m hoping to build a career that takes everything I’ve learned—my background, my community work, my time in school—and channel it into broad reforms that make life fairer for the next kid who has to translate their parents’ mail.\n\nAm I making sense here? Anyone else taken (or considered) the JD/PhD route and can tell me if I’m totally off-base or if this actually could work out?",

      "text": "I'm facing a tough decision and would really appreciate some candid advice.   \n  \nI’ve been offered a tenure-track position in a social science/humanities department at a small, lower-ranked Canadian university. It’s not a dream job: the school offers an MA but no PhD, is largely undergraduate-focused, and is very low-ranked in systems like Times/QS. The job is at the smaller of its two campuses, which has a reputation for being more like a teaching college. It’s a teaching-heavy role (3/3 load), with research expectations but limited infrastructure (I'll be lucky to get a research-designated office, though I can be strategic about the kinds of research I focus on, with my specific specialty). \n\nThat said, I’m currently in a VAP at a Top 50 university — better salary, lower teaching load — but it’s temporary. I have security until Fall 2026, so this coming year (2025–26) will be my last on that contract. If I turn down this TT offer, I’d be back on the job market this fall and also applying to postdocs as a backup.\n\nI’ve had decent success with funding and plan to publish multiple articles from my dissertation in the next two years (though nothing came out this past year). Here’s what I’m trying to figure out:\n\n**Would taking this TT job hurt or help my trajectory if I don't like the role and want to move to a larger school with more resources?**\n\n**Would a VAP or postdoc at a big-name school position me better long-term, assuming I keep publishing and getting grants?**\n\n**Is it realistic to use a TT job like this as a stepping stone, or does it typecast you in a way that’s hard to undo?**\n\nI’m trying to avoid ending up jobless in 2026 — but I’m also afraid of getting stuck in a job and location that limits my future options. Would love to hear from anyone who’s been through something similar or has insight on how these trade-offs play out.",

Three high school students. No mention of faculty mentorship, no indication of real scientific oversight.\n\n[https://jhss.scholasticahq.com/article/127890-a-rapid-detection-method-of-replication-competent-plasmid-dna-from-covid-19-mrna-vaccines-for-quality-control](https://jhss.scholasticahq.com/article/127890-a-rapid-detection-method-of-replication-competent-plasmid-dna-from-covid-19-mrna-vaccines-for-quality-control)  \n\n\nThis raises serious ethical questions. Are these journals actually ensuring rigorous peer review, or are they just publishing anything that sounds impressive? Are they misleading young students into thinking their work is held to the same standards as real scientific literature? And most importantly, what are the consequences of letting research like this into the world without proper vetting?\n\nThe idea of giving high school students a platform for research isn’t inherently bad....

I really enjoy research, and while I am not the most experienced, I am great at networking and getting people to help me with things. \n\nI'd like to create a high school journal for the students at my school to hopefully encourage interest in research, so I don't look weird, and to create a compilation of the great research papers from the students who spend incredible amounts of time and effort making them. I wouldn't be the publisher, but I would run the logistics like marketing, and running the blog or website or whatever platform we use, and my research teacher would be the reviewer, along with other individuals qualified to read each specific paper. Again, this will be more of a compilation of papers from our school rather than a reputable journal for researchers to look to for references, and to possibly provide help to future students. \n\nIf everything I said is possible, with the qualified support, I will make this happen regardless of the answers I'm given, but I would like any advice on how to approach this or as to why this is stupid.",

Knowing nothing of my CV, based solely on my PhD and post-doc location, the faculty said I should go to industry.

Therefore, the logical conclusion is this: If an R1 would not accept faculty hires from equivalent-level applicants as their post-docs, their offer of \"academic training positions\" as most post-docs are defined are inherently predatory.\n\nTo me, this clearly raises an ethical dilemma. If I were to get a TT position in the future at a mid-tier R1, how can I ethically justify offering a post-doc position to someone who has the intention of staying in academia?  How do others deal with this when offering positions?  Are you open and upfront with applicants during the hiring process?",

This can be used as a way to help the students begin to learn from each other. I also understand that learning to think and read critically is a skill that a grad student should have. To me this is what separates the grad students from the undergrads.\n\nHowever being required to read either a book a week or multiple articles for each class makes it hard to truly digest any of the information. Especially when the goal is be knowledgeable enough about eveything you read to particoate in high quality discussions.\n\nI don't think I ever felt truly confident or prepared for any of the discussions. Working at task saturation for the entire semester also prevents you from being able to pace yourself for term papers which also get put off and then done quickly and in a hurry.\n\nNow that I've graduated I'm looking back my grad school experience I can't help but to wonder if there is a better way to teach. I feel like doing college at the master's level was just as much of a hazing into the world of academia then it was about learning.",

I originally chose this route after not getting the grades I needed in A-levels and UCAT to enter a UK medical school.\n\nSince starting, I’ve genuinely fallen in love with medicine. Over the past two years, I’ve learned how to study properly, and my grades reflect that — I’m ranking top 2-3 in my year with an average around 97-98%. I put in a lot of work — long days, nights, no shortcuts — and I genuinely care about learning the material properly.\n\nOne important detail is how exams are conducted:\nWe have both written and practical exams. The practical exams (done 1-on-1 or in small groups with the examiner) are much harder to cheat on, which is where my performance really stands out — this contributes a lot to why I’m ranking so highly.\n\nThe written exams are where the integrity issues happen. During exams, many students use both ChatGPT (on their phones, smartwatches, etc.) and help each other by signaling, whispering, or quietly discussing answers. The invigilators largely turn a blind eye or simply don’t pay close attention. If they were properly monitoring, it would be quite obvious. I usually sit near invigilators, so I physically can’t cheat even if I wanted to — and I don’t want to. I genuinely want to learn and earn my degree honestly.\n\nThat being said, cheating isn’t “perfect”: ChatGPT often gives wrong answers, some questions are too niche to find online, and many of the students relying on this still don’t score full marks because they don’t fully understand the material. But the fact remains that they’re passing exams they otherwise likely wouldn’t, while others like me study properly to earn our results.\n\nThe curriculum itself is actually very solid — it covers what you would expect from a proper medical program, and I have no complaints about the content. My main concern is entirely about the lack of academic integrity and oversight in the exam process.\n\nWhat worries me is the long-term impact:\n\t•\tCould this affect my license or job prospects if the school’s reputation is questioned later?\n\t•\tCould future employers or licensing bodies see this as a red flag?\n\t•\tWill this catch up with me years into my career even though I’ve done everything properly?\n\nBecause of all this, I’m seriously considering leaving and starting fresh: retaking A-levels (Chemistry, Biology, Math) and sitting the UCAT again. The first time around I got BBB — but honestly, I barely studied. I skimmed the textbooks, did a few practice papers, and that was it. Now, I actually know how to study, and believe I could significantly improve my results with 1-2 years of proper preparation.\n\nAs an international student, I would still be paying high tuition fees in the UK, so financially the difference isn’t huge for me. This is purely about my long-term future and protecting my career.\n\nIn short:\n\t•\tShould I walk away after 2 years to protect my career long-term?\n\t•\tOr stay, keep doing well, and hope the university’s issues don’t hurt me later?\n\t•\tAre my concerns realistic?\n\t•\tHas anyone faced something similar?\n\nAny advice or perspective would mean a lot. I feel like I need some serious mentorship.\n\nThank you for reading.\n\n⸻\n\nTL;DR:\nIn a European 6-year MD program (branch campus). Top 2-3 in my year (97-98% average). Practical exams (1-on-1/small group) reflect my true work. Written exams have widespread cheating: students use ChatGPT + help each other, while invigilators turn a blind eye. Cheating isn’t perfect (wrong answers, niche questions), but many still pass. Syllabus itself is good. Worried long-term about licensing, career, and reputation risk. Considering dropping out after 2 years, retaking A-levels (BBB last time), redoing UCAT, and applying to UK schools. International student, so fees are high either way. Looking for honest advice.",

      "text": "So a few years ago, I perused a coursework only, no thesis, masters at the same school where I completed my undergrad. I didn’t notice it at the time, but I was really submerged in the institution: in addition to studying full time, the university also gave me a career-service office, a gym, a therapist, doctor, employment, community, health insurance. I made the decision to do this degree in the middle of a pandemic when I was scared about everything around me.\n\nNow that I’ve graduated, I’m noticing a sudden lack of these things. I’m also struggling to find a job and feel really alone.\nFor unrelated reasons, I feel like I didn’t make the most of my university experience and have been craving academic writing. I have this idea for a thesis and have been speaking with a professor for help writing a proposal to apply to schools. Broadly, it’s possible to stack a couple scholarships with TA and RA work and break even or make small savings.\n\nHowever, tuition is quite expensive here and I’m afraid to go all in to the student life. Studying part time would be nicer, but part-time tuition is proportionally more expensive, longer, and requires betting on getting a full-time job throughout my studies. And either way, I’ll have to move to a new city.\n\nI’m worried in school/out of school is an emotional cycle. I’m also worried that I’ll make a plan to go all in that won’t work out. Does anyone have any wisdom to impart on me?",

Like at the conference in New York when he joked with another prof visiting with three female students about how \"oh, you and three girls??? I thought that only happened in Utah!!!\" This prof was married, but I guess he thinks since he's from Utah, this is ok. \n\nI wish you all the best dear Dr. M of UCD Psychology Department. May you live long and belittle many more grad students. Maybe if you do it in public someone will finally do something about it. Though for that I don't have much hope.",

I built a model combining LSTM, Vision Transformer (ViT), and Graph Neural Network (GNN), with outputs weighted by inverse loss to improve accuracy.

      "text": "I am a PhD student in math at an R2 school in the US. My school is likely to get R1 status in 2025. My school is in top 100 public schools (US news), and has ranking subject in math.\n\nI have two advisors. One is in my school, the other is a distinguished professor in a prestigious school (but not in math department). About my advisor in my school, he has many grants (PIs as well as Co-PIs) and can fund me as an RA.\n\nMy short term goal is to find a postdoc at good R1 schools. My long term goal is to get TT at some university (not necessarily a R1 or R2 school). Now I am doing research with both of my advisors, and may submit my first paper at the end of my third year.\n\nMy question is which things I need to do to get a good postdoc? I hear someone say I must put more time on research (publish as many as I can on top journals), broaden my network. Are there anything else?",

      "text": "Hello all,\n\nI started my economics PhD program this year at a heterodox school in the UK that has a supervisor who is (was) a perfect fit for my research interests, which are very, very niche, He told us two weeks ago that he is retiring early because of a dispute over his contract with the university and that we have to find a new supervisor. The only thing is that no one else in the department knows really anything about my topic and would in no way come close to the quality of the old supervisor. There is another university close by that has a specific department that my focuses on my geographical area of interest, which would be a better fit than my current school, but I'm not sure about placements or even what degree I would be getting since it's an interdisciplinary degree. I've asked the school's admin about this and they haven't gotten back to me yet.\n\nOn the other hand, I realize that I made a (potentially) big mistake in my grad applications when I didn't include an academic resume (just a professional one) and had my personal statement be way too personal. I feel like if I can improve those, maybe if I apply again to some of the schools that I got waitlisted to last year that have better reputations could be another option (like UC Riverside).\n\nThe thing is that my master's was a one year professional masters, and given my PhD is in the UK, there is no coursework component, so I feel like I'm missing a lot relative to my US peers or those who did a two year masters, so I'm thinking about maybe another master's so I can learn more theory, but maybe that's not necessary. I could do that and then apply to UCR and similar places again, but I'm also 29, so there is an age factor.\n\nWhat would you all recommend doing in this situation? Thanks for your advice.",

My main interest as been in classical philosophy and I have begun the process of attempting to learn Latin so I can thing approach ancient Greek.\n\nMy question is what I should do for my Master's, unfortunately it'll have to be online I am military and in person isn't really a viable option (though I wish I could as though I know an ok amount about philosophy I find my ability to debate in person lacking from where I'd like to be). Currently I am looking at the Ethics, Epistemology and Mind progranm at Edinburgh (though I'm working on requesting the school to submit the program VA approval I haven't heard anything back on that). I am not really a fan of medieval philosophy and theology and am hesitant about any religious universities for that reason, additionally I am not Christian and though I have no issues with individuals practicing the religion I am critical of it at times and I worry that may also be an issue (as I failed on oral exam at a religious institution for \"taking the lords name in veil\"). \n\nI am looking at possibly going down a MSc or MA in History, taking electives in philosophy (so I can get to the credit hours needed to adjust/lecture in philosophy)and focusing on ancient greek civilization. I think this could be helpful so I can then have a better understanding of how to research text during that period as I would like do my PhD dissertation on classical ethics. I'm at a weird cross roads and I'm not sure what to do, and any feedback or personal insites would be much appreciated.\n\nfor context on my undergrad, I have just completed my BA in philosophy and my focus is in science",

Our kids are in one of the best school districts in the country, my son who is on the spectrum has amazing services, my daughter doesn't have to worry about the state taking her rights away, etc.  Everything is great except for her job.  She is a tenured professor at an R1 University but she doesn't feel they value research highly and with the cuts to NIH funding is concerned about her job.  She also is not happy with certain aspects of daily life there.  She was almost offered positions at 2 other Universities int he city and both had to pull the offers due to the NIH uncertainty.\n\nShe is being offered a position in Texas, apparently they have a ton of money.  It's actually a better fit for her given her training and field, but it's in Texas.  It would involve me giving up my job (which I love), my house, my kids school district, etc.  and with all of the uncertainty surrounding grant funding to me it seems insane to rely on her position and give up everything we have at the moment.\n\nMy thought is if she takes the position she should get an apartment or condo and I'll keep the kids in their house and their schools until we have more certainty with the NIH and she can maybe be there 3 days a week and here 4.  Is that nuts?  Won't work?  I'm already the person that handles 95% of the kids activities and the household chores, so I won't really be taking much more on it's just the time away from the kids for my wife.  I don't see any other solution as I'm completely opposed to moving to Texas.  Anyway, just looking for opinions on both the funding landscape and the situation, would any of you do this?",

I’m a 6th-year Ph.D. candidate at an R1 (Ivy), 28 years old, and I’ve been applying for research faculty positions in my field for the past two years.\n\nThis year, I was selected as the top candidate for an tenure track assistant professor position at a large R1 in the Midwest, in their College of Biological Sciences. It truly felt like my dream job. In April, the university paused the search due to a hiring freeze tied to shifts in federal research funding. This past Friday, I found out the position was cancelled because of budget cuts and a decision to focus on their existing faculty. I feel pretty devastated. I was excited to start my lab and finally have a bit more stability (at least more than grad school provides).\n\nHas anyone else faced something similar this year? Any advice on how to cope? Academia feels like it’s in such a rough place right now, and I’m seriously considering other career options. I ***really*** love my field, and mentoring students is my favorite part of the work. I interviewed for a few industry positions this year, but I couldn’t get behind the idea of dedicating my life to selling a product.\n\nAnyways, I’m just really really sad and trying to crowdsource ideas. Anything helps, and thanks for taking the time out of your day to respond. I’m looking for real, grounded, hard advice; don’t be afraid to be like \"haha, you’re literally a clown, just apply to other jobs\" lol. I'm also happy if you want to share a story about a professional setback, just so we can commiserate about how shitty academia can be.\n\nEDIT: I tried to avoid committing to a postdoc because my wife’s career thrives on stability, and we wanted to avoid another big move unless it was for a long-term position. I did apply for one of the NSF postdoc programs, but it was archived in the big DOGE cuts a few months ago.\n\nEDIT 2 Electric Boogaloo: Sorry folks, meant a tenure track assistant professorship with a 50% research/40% teaching/10% service split. Wrote \"research professor\" initially.\n\nEdit 3: Thanks so much for all the kind, realistic advice folks. It means a lot.",

And if so, do you know the best way to go about this? This would be my first time reaching out to professors inquiring about this.\n\nIn order to apply to this program, would I then need to cite a professor that reached back out to me with openings in their lab? \n\nIs conducting research a part of the Ms of psychological science?

      "title": "Feeling socially isolated in my PhD program — anyone else experiencing this?",
      "text": "Hi everyone,\n\nI wanted to share something that’s been weighing on me, and I’m hoping some of you might relate or offer perspective.\n\nI’m a third-year international PhD student in the U.S. I’m in a biology program where around 80% of my department  are white women and I am a brown man from South Asia. \n\nSince starting my program, I’ve felt an ongoing sense of social isolation. I try to be friendly, initiate conversations, and occasionally invite labmates over (I’ve even cooked for my lab mates in my house a few times), but nothing ever seems to stick. I’m hygienic, respectful, not overly talkative, and definitely not invasive-I have no romantic interest in anyone (I’m married), and I try to keep things professional yet warm. I am also not culturally blind. I am very open-minded and aware of the pop-culture updates (such as movies and music). I just wished that people in grad school were matured and more friendly.\n\nStill, I often feel like I’m on the outside looking in. People who joined after me form friendships quickly, but I remain distant. No one initiates conversation with me. I don’t get invited to events. In one instance, after my wife and I attended a gathering, someone made a comment along the lines of: *“*How come someone like her is with someone like him, he's such a misogynistic bigot*?”* That one hurt me a lot. If anything, I am not misogynistic or bigot. I have no idea how they got these ideas from. I am utterly clueless. \n\nAt first, I wondered if it was something I was doing wrong. But the more I reflect, the more I feel like it’s less about any specific “mistake” and more about subtle social dynamics, maybe even unconscious bias. I’ve decided to stop trying to force connections. I’ve made peace with being more reserved and focusing on my work, my health, and the few meaningful relationships I already have.\n\nStill, I’m curious: has anyone else felt this kind of social isolation in grad school, especially in fields where you’re a visible minority or invisible? How do you deal with it without becoming cynical or resentful?\n\nWould appreciate your thoughts.\n\nThanks for reading. Grammar corrected with Grammarly. I am planning to write everything in more detail in the future.",

      "text": "My partner and I met in grad school, and up until recently, we were both planning to do PhDs. I am planning to finish within the year, but my partner is planning to finish with a Masters after 5 years of pursuing a PhD. This is not my partner’s choice, but rather, their advisor (let’s say their name is Steve) treated my partner like crap the last 5 years. Steve gaslit, was mean to, didn’t trust, and didn’t respect my partner, and basically it resulted in my partner no longer being able to work or even talk to their advisor. I’ll note that my partner actually collected all the data they needed for their dissertation, but has such a huge writer’s block since Steve is so dismissive and mean during the writing process.\n\nSteve is also on my committee, and Steve knows I am dating my partner. They just asked if I could help locate my partner’s data, citing that “we need to demonstrate to NSF that we used the funds to produce high quality science.” Notably, my partner has pretty much cut off Steve entirely and hasn’t responses to other inquiries about their data. Also, This project was funded by an NSF project under Steve.\n\nSo, here’s my conundrum. First, I feel like it’s pretty unprofessional of Steve to reach out to me regarding my partner’s work (who they mistreated badly). On the other hand, Steve is on my committee and is a close collaborator of my advisor, so I fear there would be some pushback if I chose not to respond or help find the data. I’m not sure. I have no idea how to navigate this, and would be curious to hear what you all think. Thanks in advance!\n\nEdit: I asked my partner, and actually, this specific part of their research was funded by an independent grant they received from the university. So, this part of their research was separately funded.",

      "text": "Hello, \n\nFirst time here.. I am posting for my wife—she just got a verbal offer for a tenure-track assistant professor position at $56K after working as a visiting assistant professor making $41K (9-month contract). Since her school is public, I checked past faculty salaries: first-year assistant professors were offered $52K–$59K in 2017, $60K in 2020, and $66K in 2021. With the inflation, it feels like she’s getting lowballed.\n\nShe hasn’t received a written offer yet—it sounds like chair is asking for a verbal answer before they send out the offer letter. Do you typically negotiate salary with the department chair at this stage, or does it go through HR? (In my field, negotiations are usually with HR, not the hiring manager, so I’m unsure how it works in academia.)\n\nAny advice or success stories on negotiating a better offer?",

      "text": "Right after my PhD, I started a startup (a spin-out of my PhD research) in the drug discovery domain and ran it for 6 years, mostly funded through grants. We had some wins, but funding status doesn't look great right now, and I may need to plan for my next job. I am wondering if I can enter the tenure track job market by positioning my startup experience as a long postdoc or as PI of a small lab. I know it’s very competitive, but I want to understand whether my post-PhD startup role has essentially thrown me out of the race, or if, based on the profile below, I still might have a chance and it is worth trying.\n\nMy profile:\n\n* Degree: PhD from top 20 universities in the US.\n* Grants: I am the PI on 6 NIH/NSF grants from small $200K+ awards to larger 1M+ awards. All after PhD. I also regularly sit on grant review panels. \n* Publications: I published well (I think) during my PhD but did not publish many papers after that partly due to IP concerns but also it wasn't a priority. As the startup founder, a couple of conference presentations and a couple of papers + 3 patents. I have 5 papers in the queue from the work we did in my startup that I could probably put on biorxiv in the next few months. Peer review will take longer of course. \n* Collaborations: worked with a few academic labs from top universities as well as companies on projects mostly under the awarded grants.\n* Mentorship: Advised 10+ interns and employees, ranging from high school students and undergraduates to PhDs and senior research staff.\n* Age: late 30s\n\nI would appreciate any insights, especially from people who have been on search committees and might have encountered similar cases. If you have had a similar experience personally, I’d love to hear how things went as well.",

They purchase one house that the researchers each get a room in; they purchase a second house whose monthly rental income funds the researchers' $500/mo stipend (and sets aside a small monthly amount for house repairs and property taxes). Since both houses can exist for perpetuity, it is self-sustaining after the initial investment of the two houses.\n- Relies on government programs to reduce philanthropist overhead massively. For example, with each researcher only earning $500/mo and each researcher paying $100/mo of that to \"cheap rent\" for their room, the researchers each qualify for government programs that fully take care of them: free utilities, free food, free medical, free internet, and free cellular plan. Their only expenses would be car insurance, basic supplies like toiletries, and personal outings, which is what the remainder $400/mo goes towards. \n- Relies on university affiliations so the institute gets free software packages for the necessary research. \n- The researchers would have Ph.Ds and benefit from being able to (a) fully dedicate themselves to research, instead of chasing grants or teaching (b) collaborate closely in their 3-4 person house. \n- In short, a 1 million dollar investment from a philanthropist can fund the two houses (one rental, one home) for a 3-4 person research team that exists for perpetuity.",

      "text": "Hello, this post is for my husband, not me. However, I \\*was\\* in a PhD program and left, so I have knowledge on the ins and outs of academia. My husband finished his PhD last spring, and we're at a crossroads in terms of what to do.\n\nHubby had an unsuccessful job hunt for a tenure-track position last year. As a result, he started applying for jobs outside of academia. He got a position to teach in secondary public school this school year and an offer to adjunct for a nearby college. Both don't pay as well as we would like. Secondary teaching seems to provide the stability we need at the moment, but the hours at that school are \\*long\\*, and we're worried he won't have time to prepare his materials for this year's round at the job market. That said, his professors highly discourage getting into adjuncting. We both know how adjuncts are exploited in general, but here's the dilemma:\n\nThere seems to be more flexibility in his schedule as adjunct faculty, despite the risk and the fact that it only guarantees him a job for 1 year. Also, the idea of still working within academia seems attractive, but we have also heard of friends who adjunct for 10 years without any success in the job market.\n\nBasically, what should my husband choose? We have heard of only 1 person who left academia for a couple of years by teaching in a public school, got a book publication, and successfully landed a tenure-track job. We also have not heard many success stories of PhD grads that land a tenure track job while working as an adjunct. His professors are supportive and willing to continue working with him to help him for this year's job market.\n\nI am leaning towards him staying with the school teaching, as I like how stable it is and it comes with benefits. He himself does not know what to do. Anyone with experience of going outside of academia for a bit and landing a tenure-track job? Or how about current adjunct faculty folks? How are you managing? Much help appreciated!\n\n/Edit: Husband's field is in English\n\n  \nUPDATE: My husband ultimately chose teaching secondary, because he felt he preferred the more predictable schedule and stability that teaching in school provides. That said, he will forego this year's job market cycle. Instead, he will focus on getting his dissertation published as a book and finishing up the 2 articles he has forthcoming with highly prestigious journals. My husband knows himself well. I also know him well. He can't multitask and hustle like a lot of other recent PhD's can. He'd rather put his efforts toward publishing atm than going through the crapshoot of the job market (for now). His professors seem to agree that getting his research published and a book on the way will strengthen his chances next time he decides to go on the job market. I will say, the grind in academia is exhausting. It's why I left, and I think my husband is kind of expressing he's a little tired of it too.",

      "text": "I’m one year into a tenure track position at an R1, and I think I'm done. I wanted to share my experience, because I’m hoping to commiserate with others about this.\n\nThe academic job market is hell in my field (like many others). I interviewed for years without much luck, so I was over the moon when I got this job. Decent salary, great benefits and steady work in my specific field of interest. My first year was a whirlwind as I secured some funding and got my research off the ground. But when I hit the one year mark this summer, I realized that I still wasn't happy with my work. I started to reflect on it, and it suddenly hit me that I haven’t been happy in academia since… the middle of my PhD? It’s been years.\n\nIt feels like I was swept along a current: I kept hitting milestones, so I never had a chance to stop and consider if I actually wanted to keep doing this as I moved from one position to the next. My PhD experience was difficult, so I thought everything would get better if I could just finish my thesis and get a postdoc. Then, if I could just get through my postdoc. Then, if I could just get through my time as an adjunct (literal hell) and land this position. For years, I was trying to stay afloat while pushing for the next thing, which fortunately always came just before my previous position ended.\n\nI thought my unhappiness was burnout and job insecurity talking, and that my passion for research would suddenly reappear when I reached the ultimate goal of a permanent tt job. Obviously, it hasn’t. My annual review was positive, but I haven’t rediscovered that spark of interest I felt when I started grad school. I’m tired of publish-or-perish. I’m exhausted by the grind. I’m completely uninspired by my research. Teaching has been fine, but not enough to keep my interest. I’m just… done. I feel like I'm chasing old dreams, and that realization hit me like a ton of bricks.\n\nThe final straw that broke me was location. I’m living in a small college town (closest city is 3 hours away, and my family/friends are a 9 hour drive). I’m an outgoing person, but it has been *impossible* to make friends or date here as a single person without kids. I’ve started spending all my free time driving, just to get out of town for a few days. My postdoc was also in a small town (although easier to make friends), so even applying to another academic job would likely lead to a similar situation. I think I’ve hit my moving limit. I don’t want to keep moving away from my supports, bouncing around the country.\n\nI’ve decided to cut my losses and leave academia, without another job secured. I know the smart decision would be to stick it out until I secure another job, but I’m *so tired* of sticking it out. I feel like I’m slowly wasting my life away, one “just one more year…” after another. I can’t do another one.\n\nBut it’s also hard to walk away from a career I spent over a decade fighting to have. I have absolutely no idea what I'll do next, because academia is all I’ve ever known. I’m embarrassed and angry at myself for sacrificing so much to get here (friendships, relationships, time, money), but now that I have the job I always wanted, I don’t want it. It’s hard to walk away without having “failed” out, for lack of a better term.\n\nI’m admittedly worried this is a combination of burn out, loneliness, and “the grass is greener” mentality, and that I’ll regret it the moment I leave.\n\nThis is mostly a rant, I guess. I’m looking for any advice, guidance, or a friendly listening ear.",

They pay for our tuition but we have to pay around $1,000 every semester for \"fees\". So essentially if we TA year round we get around $15,000. I can somewhat get by by being a US citizen with a good family to support me, but even I'm struggling to keep my will up. I'm open to any suggestions because this week (the week before school) they finally decide what my TA assignment is; it is a course i've never taught before so I have a week to prepare the course, and now I am finally at my wits end. The kicker is now even the school cafeteria is a luxury for me as it costs $7 to eat there. I did the math and I'd actually get paid more working fewer hours if I just worked at a fast food joint.\n\nI guess my question is, has anyone experienced something like this before and had success in getting a raise? If so, how did you go about this? Our faculty suggests that we go on strike, but we have very few domestic students, and international students are unwilling to (rightfully so).",

      "text": "Hello all! I graduated with my bachelors last year and did research all throughout undergrad. One of the labs I worked in allowed me to work alongside a post-doc and be involved on a project that I eventually used as a senior honors thesis. I would say I spent about 1.5 years on this project, and after I had defended my honors thesis and gotten honors credit I also presented a poster about the work before graduating. Fast forward, I am now in grad school, and more work was done to the project since I worked on it through a collaboration between two universities. Although I don’t really work in that lab anymore, I still keep in touch with the people there and this year they presented about the old work and new work at a conference and also submitted a manuscript for the work which has now been published.\n\nWhen the lab presented the poster on the work, they included my name as an author on the poster, and I was happy with this as I haven’t gotten any publications yet, and this made me think that I was likely going to be an author on the submitted manuscript. However as I have gone to view the publication, my name is not mentioned anywhere, and I can’t help but feel a little disappointed. Should I be an author on this work?\n\nI will say that I was not involved with the actual writing process of the manuscript, I only did data acquisition for the time that I worked there. But regardless, in my mind it seems that if I did enough data collection to write a 28 page honors thesis about it, I should likely be included on the work, especially if my name was on the poster that was presented by the lab later on. Does anyone have opinions on this or if I should do something about it? Thanks in advance!",

      "text": "For reference I’m in the US and in graduate school. \n\nAside from being able to practice and teach my field, I think a large part of the allure of academia is being able to have some kind of agency over my time. \n\nThe “9-5” jobs I’ve worked would have stupid rules over how your time is managed. Like if you finish your work at 4 and typically leave at 5, you have to sit there and wait even though you’re salaried. Asked to go out of state to a meeting on your day off? Need to go, uncompensated and must use your own resources to get there under the guise of “salary”. While I understand some industry jobs are better than others, I find myself prioritizing the want to teach, do research and really being able to make up my day-to-day schedule. \n\nThe impression I’ve got from real life as well as this sub is that good tenure track positions are hard to come by, and there’s unnecessary politics around publishing to make a name for yourself. I’ll admit, this is probably one of the bigger drawbacks that’s been on my mind. Another dilemma is the income. I live in a very expensive state and I’d like to start a family soon. In a perfect world, I’d want to make at least 100-120 to support my living expenses and family. Since positions are slim, I will have to face the “beggars can’t be choosers” reality. \n\nDuring a conference I went to last year, there were a few speakers employed at companies that offered a working arrangement where two days of the week you could teach at a community college or be adjunct somewhere and then you’d be in office the remaining 3 days. Something like this sounds interesting to me because you would be able to have a slice of the academic life without having to worry too much about income. However these arrangements and employers are rare, and that conference was across the country. \n\nI think this post is me thinking out loud. Thanks for any advice in advance. \n\nIf it’s helpful, my field is pure mathematics.",

      "text": "My partner believes I fully blew it when it comes to an upcoming interview. For some context, I’m defending in June, I have two little kids and I went back to grad school after working in the industry for 10 years. There is a local university that interviewed me two months ago for a tenure track position. It was two full days of interviews and two faculty dinners, a lecture and a research talk. I did not get the position. They invited me to interview for a visiting professor position in a different department, which I did two weeks ago. It was a full day, plus a faculty dinner, and a lecture. I haven’t heard yet about that position, but in the meantime they also invited me to apply for another role in yet a different department. I was interviewed via zoom call last week, and they just invited me to come for a full day interview on campus. This is a very small university and I will be interviewing with most of the same people that I have met before. In a moment of apparent insanity, I responded to the coordinator that I’d love to interview, though would it be possible to limit it to a half day since I have teaching and research responsibilities, I’ve already spent 26 hours interviewing on campus, and it’s crunch time for my defense. After my partner told me that was a terrible idea, I wrote again a few hours later and said “please disregard my previous email, I’ve cleared my schedule for the full day and I look forward to meeting with everyone.” \n\nMy partner thinks I blew it and he’s really concerned that they will either cancel the interview now or not give me the job. Thoughts?? Did I totally screw up??\n\nEDIT: for context, my partner is typically a very supportive, very positive person in my corner. But he’s been a manager at a large company for 20 years and knows a lot about how hiring works, so I trust his advice and was pretty freaked when he had this reaction. I realize industry is different from academia so yes he’s not fully aware of the whole deal. \nThanks everyone for your helpful responses!!",

      "text": "I earned my bachelor's degree about three years ago. Right after graduation, I got into a master’s program the following semester. Pretty quickly, I realized it wasn’t the right fit, so I withdrew and applied to another program at the same university.\n\n\n\nThat next semester was hell. The school was underfunded and losing more resources by the day. Professors didn't hold proper qualificiations, classes were constantly canceled...I was young and didn’t understand how much of it was the system versus me feeling like I couldn't commit to a masters. I just assumed it was my own fault. The experience wrecked my mental health.\n\n\n\nI ended up studying abroad and doing some research at Cambridge. After that, I stayed abroad traveling for a year. When I returned, I tried working in clinical research, then moved into teaching. Unfortunately, the school environment was toxic, students were abusive, and the administration normalized it. I left.\n\n\n\nSince then, I’ve started my own strategy company. It’s still in its early stages. I’m trying to figure out what comes next.\n\n\n\nI’m wondering:\n\n\n\nIs it normal for the academic/professional path to be this unstable?\n\n\n\nDo most academics find a “home” university to grow within, or is it common to be bouncing around like this?\n\n\n\nI’m considering going back for a master’s degree, this time online, so I can keep building my company, travel, write, research, and pick up seasonal work to sustain myself. Is that a reasonable path?\n\n\n\nOne of my parents is a professor, but they rarely talk about how they got there. They just say they always kept a job, and they’re pretty disappointed that my journey has been so scattered. They're pretty emotionless and very judgemental. \n\n\n\nWhat was your journey into academia like? Did you always know the direction you were heading? Or did it come together over time? I plan on going Phd but feel so stuck at this part in the journey.",

He's former professor of Geology in Istanbul Technical University. He was doing an interview on youtube with some another turkish physicist named Furkan Öztürk, who is former Harvard PhD student and assistant professor in Caltech currently. Celal Şengör says that there are currently a lot of nonsense in US universities that prevent people from doing research, such as \"Peer pressure, the MeToo movement, woke culture\" etc. which is why schools like Cambridge, Oxford, and ETH are much better than any top tier schools in the US. I'm curious what the American academy thinks about this, especially? Do these kinds of things really hinder your research, or is this guy just talking nonsense in your opinion? Thanks",

I think my concerns are somewhat field specific (due to the nature of environmental consulting) but any input from anybody is welcomed, regardless of the field. I just want to hear people’s opinions. For reference, I worked in an entomology lab and like community ecology. Our lab wasn’t that affected by the current administration compared to others, but it wasn’t unscathed either. If there is a better sub to post this, let me know \n\n—\n\nI graduated with a degree in environmental science, and my degree was actually very ecology-based. I love learning about ecology and completed an undergraduate thesis, which I really enjoyed. If the world and my life was perfect then I would pursue scientific research, maybe I still will. Many of the environmental consulting jobs just sound so unappealing to me, but I know beggars can’t be choosers, especially in this economy.\n\nI live in the US so it’s not really a good time to go to grad school anyway. And I want to work for a few years to really cement my direction in life.\n\nDid any of you ever want to pursue academia at some point and chose a different path instead? Or maybe, vice versa? You worked some regular jobs and then decided to go back to school?\n\nNowadays it’s hard to find an environmental career, especially if you’re entry level, and job satisfaction + pay can be questionable. Academia has its own problems, especially NOW… with receiving funding and such. As well as burn out and the rigid expectations + pressure. And it’s very competitive as well!! I guess if both paths have their pros and cons, why not choose the one I want more? The professors at my old university were once like me, young and inexperienced. I think I’m smart and hardworking. But I guess I have some sort of imposter syndrome and fear I can’t be successful. Besides, many graduate students end up going back to industry due to problems with academia.

      "text": "Hi, I’m going into my 3rd year of undergraduate studies, and with everything happening in the world (and in my personal life), it often feels *extremely* difficult to stay motivated in school. My love for scientific research is a defining part of who I am, but it is so fraking hard to hold onto my dreams and passions when it feels like climate change and bigotry will ruin my future. There is so much cruelty in the world, and I find it challenging to stay curious and hopeful. I want to pursue my love for ecology and evolutionary biology research, as this is what I love to do more than anything, but with the rise of anti-science, climate change disasters, and fascism, it feels impossible to stay motivated. I was always willing to do whatever it would take for my future, but I’m honestly just so tired. I’m already exhausted, and I’m not even in grad school yet. I used to enjoy studying and find comfort in learning, and while I still do to an extent, it doesn’t feel as natural. I’m studying for an organic chem exam right now, and I can’t get rid of the voice in my head saying that this is all for nothing. \n\nHow do you young researchers hold onto your dreams and stay hopeful when life right now is so overwhelming and the future is extremely terrifying and uncertain?",

My workdays (and most evenings) easily get sucked away from responding to emails, and not just students, but colleagues and staff passing along the torch of administrative duties and coordination of external requests.\n\nIt’s too much.

The fact that they acknowledged this as if it’s normal—encouraging us to take on additional work just to get by—felt absolutely disgusting. This is academia admitting that they’re aware of how poorly they’re paying us, yet instead of addressing it directly, they suggest we overwork ourselves even more.\n\nHow is it acceptable that we’re expected to juggle research, teaching, publishing, service responsibilities, and now an additional job on top of that? This just seems so far removed from what academia is supposed to be about. I’d love to hear if others have experienced similar conversations at their institutions.",

The offer letter states we need to make a final decision within about **two** weeks. We reached out to the department chair right after receiving the written offer to initiate negotiations, but it's been a week and we still haven’t heard back. This silence is making us very anxious.\n\nHere are my questions:\n\n1. If the department chair doesn’t respond before the deadline, are our only choices to **accept or decline** the original offer?\n2. Is it still possible to **negotiate**, even after the written offer is issued?\n3. The offer includes a **fall semester start**, but we had initially discussed a **spring start**—this change wasn’t explained. Can I ask for a correction?\n4. The **salary** in the offer is significantly lower than my current position (by more than $15,000). Without negotiation, I’d be taking a substantial pay cut. I really want to join this university, but the terms in the current offer make that difficult.\n\nIf anyone has advice or has gone through something similar, I would really appreciate your thoughts.

At 1.55pm I get another email - sorry there was a mistake, the interview is 2pm today! So in five minutes time. But even without the mistake in the first email it would only have been 2 hours notice (invited at midday to a 2pm interview). Then they started blowing up my phone with calls lol.  \n\nAre they crazy? I know that UK jobs in this field get barely any applications, I doubt this will help. I have never known a university to have such poor planning, what is going on at UCL? Luckily I'm not that desperate for a job so I can just laugh about it.",

Their proposal was rejected. I'm sure this is probably not how this works, but if you can suspend your disbelief this far.\n\nOne of the two staff members convinces the other that they should go ahead and do what they wanted to do anyway, after hours, in secret, behind the uni's back.

Given the current U.S. administration, are American university presses at any risk of censorship on given topics? \n\nAre international university presses from Canada, the U.K., E.U. and other countries safer to publish topics considered \"DEI\"? [I edited this because people were missing my point] Are there any U.S. or international academics who feel they would have more academic freedom publishing books and articles with international university presses rather than a U.S. presses these days?\n\nAs a Humanities prof I'm considering going with a Canadian or UK university press.

      "text": "Is this even a thing, accommodations, for faculty, with a formal ADHD (inattentive) diagnosis?\n\nI (F50s) was diagnosed recently, as part of ongoing treatment for long Covid; as brain fog improved (yay), it was clear another condition was impacting me. And tests with two neuropsych and psychiatrist clinics verified the diagnoses.  I am learning what makes this a condition vs. exacerbating into a “disorder” (sigh) and how to navigate both.  It’s really hard, but anyone with ADHD already knows that.  \n\nI am not sure can continue a job I love: the expectations around productivity and  added service/publishing requirements/grant funding/high metrics and citations —- all of these things that were not so common when I published articles and a book for tenure a decade ago- have skyrocketed since.  I feel like chasing my tail and akways behind, to no avail.\n \nSince diagnosis, I am doing many steps on my end: coaching, time blocking, sleep, meds, buddy systems.   \n\nStill, I understand that in R1 jobs, there is very little that will be considered a “reasonable accommodation.”  One cannot teach less: one must do their share.  One can’t research or publish less: that is not reasonable.  (Even if posters disagree, upper admin and colleagues certainly find this unfair and unreasonable.)  I cannot receive more time between annual reviews (post tenure).  What is left? \n\nI have to meet the ADA office next week and could really use advice about what if ANYTHING had worked for anyone as a workplace accommodation.   \n\nHave any faculty with ADHD shared this with your workplace and if so, what sort of accommodations did you ask for — and were they helpful?",

      "text": "I just read that IU is about to be taken over by their Republican-led state government, with plans of getting rid of majors and modifying the curriculum. This downgrade of academic offering is nearly always framed as 1) financial--job preparation, aka the state needs more coders or IT people and we can't afford to fund the humanities and/or 2) a \"divisive\" or \"woke\" curriculum that teaches disciplines like gender and queer studies, and critical race studies. I am interested in how state Republican governments are increasingly less shy to admit to 2, which is to say that they can't even bother to keep putting up façade about the neoliberal university needing to make money--it is deliberate, unashamed censorship of dissenting voices regardless of anything else. The number of academic programs and services defunded (Iowa, New College of Florida, every other state banning DEI) because of mainly ideological rather than \"financial\" reasons is concerning. \n\nI guess I was wondering if anybody working in a state school in a red or purple state had any wisdom to share regarding how to navigate this. I don't think the answer is giving in to censorship, but unfortunately money speaks louder than principles. That established private universities with endowments the size of European microstates entire budgets are giving in doesn't bide well for flagship state institutions or their smaller regional campuses with already limited resources. Other than voting and calling your representative's office, how may one get involved politically? How to manage to do critical pedagogy and research when they become, well, illegal?",

It had a world reputation for my field of study. But our ridiculously bad financial situation has meant that almost all of these staff members have either taken voluntary redundancy, moved to different jobs, or being reduced to part-time hours.\n\nYesterday, I found out that due to all of these shortages, my field of study won’t be taught at all in our department in the first semester next year. There will be NO FT staff members that term in our field. My students have already been complaining at me that there aren’t enough course options available in that subject area, and now this is just further proof. \n\nIt is difficult for me to work out whether my frustration is due to my own situation, knowing that I have to leave in September without a job to go to, or whether it is just despair at the erosion of the field. Probably a bit of both.\n\nBut what I would like some advice on, is how to manage this situation in the short term. I feel like going into class on Monday morning and having an enormous rant about how rubbish everything is, and probably breaking down in front of students! I probably won’t do this. \n\nBut what should I tell them? I feel like if I tell them all to complain, then I’m sort of massaging my own ego about having to leave, and making them even more upset that their course is not what they want it to be.\n\nAny other ideas (except just ‘leave academia’ which is probably coming for me whether I like it or not)?",

LCOL in a remote town (in a Red state)\n\nCurrently, I have an offer for a TT position at an R2 university, with an initial teaching load of 1-1 followed by a 2-2 load down the line. The 9-month salary is similar, but there is a better startup package and summer support for the first few years. Located in HCOL area and close to big cities. In a Blue state.\n\nI am confused if I should make this jump. I think the following are the pros and cons of making the switch to the new university:\n\nPros:\n\n1. More time to do research because of a lower teaching load\n2. Freedom to teach courses that are relevant to my research\n3. Close to big cities\n4. Have more faculty in my field in the department. More options for potential collabs (hopefully)\n5. Has grad students, but not sure about the quality of students.\n6. Potentially a better move in terms of career mobility, especially in terms of the types of jobs that I can switch to (if needed), with a potentially stronger research profile.\n\nCons:\n\n1. HCOL\n2. Current federal govt. funding cuts (NSF, NIH, etc.), and an uncertain future to secure grants\n3. Higher research requirements to get tenure.\n4. Not as relaxed a lifestyle as a teaching-focused job.\n5. The new university has lower enrollment numbers than the current university.\n6. The new university may be more affected by federal budget cuts because of it being a R2. Not sure about this.\n\nCan you give some advice and insights on what I should do, and if I am thinking correctly? This is in a STEM field",

      "text": "Since 2018, my university has required all faculty to include a DEI activity in their annual role statements, with no opt-out option—and the policy publicly visible on our website. While I support DEI’s intent, I worry that mandating it, especially amid growing political scrutiny, could backfire. With concerns about NSF canceling DEI-related grants and defunding faculty engaged in DEI, this policy could limit tenure-track faculty from getting funding and thus tenure. Is this mandatory DEI requirement common elsewhere? I tried raising concerns with our chair but was met with skepticism, as if questioning the policy equates to being anti-DEI.",

I absolutely *love* Japanese culture (and not just anime!) and that got me thinking about the possibilities of becoming faculty in Japan. Oddly, my uni has many connections to Europe, the US, and Canada, but we get very little interaction with Japan despite that culturally there are a lot of links. As a result, I have very little idea of what universities and research are like in Japan. I've obviously heard of Tokyo University but don't know anyone there. I've also heard that Kyoto University is pretty good, but again know very little.\n\nMy question is: what is the research environment like at either university? What's it like to teach there? Do either university hire foreigners, or is it pretty closed? What level of Japanese is needed?\n\nMost importantly: would you recommend career-wise going to a Japanese university or should I go somewhere else?\n\nThanks in advance!",

I don't have that pedigree, I come from no-name labs and just managed to published well, (but not CNS), so I think people just see through me here. Been feeling underappreciated, have been asked to move labs to different shittier buildings a couple times (a la Milton in office space) so basically, the writing has been on the wall re staying here long term. Spent a year secretly interviewing at other places and finally got an offer worth considering. \n\nWould involve moving to another place that is equally \"prestigious\" (aka high pressure) but which offers some core funding, which is huge. This would make a big difference for our work. Informally I've been told that they could offer funding for 1 postdoc and 2 PhD students, and *all* consumables (on top of the grants I bring in myself). However, will be evaluated 5-7 years in and need to be building an international reputation by that point. Can only go up for promotion *once* to keep core funding beyond 5-7 years, after which either you hold on to or go up in core funding, or you're asked to leave. Informally also been told they don't want to invest in people only to see them fail, so they'll help along the way, and if it doesn't work out, they won't put you out on the street right away (will make some sort of deal with the university so you keep your lab but core funding goes away).\n\nAnyway... It feels complicated. Thoughts? I feel like this is it, need to ask ask for everything I would need to give myself every chance of it working out. So from small things like parking spaces to big things like equipment. Need to get everything in writing and approved beforehand. Anybody been in this position before?",

      "text": "For context, I am based at a university in Canada.\n\nThere are circumstances that make me ponder if universities are becoming just glamorous and expensive community colleges … \n\nUniversities are bolstering their appeal by adding micro credentials, certificate programs, work-based placements, and other options to degree programs. Is the focus on enrolment? Attainment of employment? While yes and yes, the main goal of universities should always be to produce well-rounded, educated and responsible citizens. Philosophy and theory are pillars of that.\n\nWith the pedagogical trend of experiential learning, service learning, and other teaching methods that incorporate applied practice into courses. Labs were meant to be classes where students apply the theoretical knowledge from lectures, but traditional teaching is fading quickly and blurring the distinction between hands-on experience and classroom lectures (especially a blended didactic style and a drastic reduction in assigned readings for students). Going straight into the field is beneficial, but what about all the other angles of wisdom that are lost when students focus on a few areas of application before cementing a theoretical basis? \n\nCoupled to this, there has been a surge in external community organizations contacting university departments to ask if they can help with their programs and initiatives, including requests for student volunteers, guest lecturers to host workshops or presentations, or seeing if a project can be incorporated into a class or research proposal. There has been a stark decline in government funding for community groups, but the burden should not be put on the shoulders of already fiscally frugal post-secondary institutions. While there may be some great service-learning opportunities, it is administratively taxing for professors to coordinate, especially when there are liability requirements for student placements. Coordination does not fall within workload duties, and unless research can be conducted at the same time, the payoff for faculty is low. Teaching and service are becoming routes that faculty can apply for tenure, but where does this leave the wisdom of scholarship?",

      "text": "Hi all!\n\nI started working at my university as a full time researcher recently.\n\nHowever, I’m quite frustrated with my team and the job scope.\n\nThey’re very nice people and all, but the job itself is boring as hell. Also, the job has almost nothing to do with actual research, and I’m just unhappy.\n\nMy university is one of the best in the world and I’m sure there are other positions that will satisfy me. I only started this job 3 months ago, and I don’t wanna just quit. Maybe internal transfer will be the best option.\n\nCould anyone let me know how that works in your university? I don’t find much information on my school’s website.\n\nThank you!",

      "text": "Hi everyone,\n\nI’m a psychology student at a small American-accredited liberal arts college in Lebanon, minoring in legal studies. Due to the recent war, everything was put on pause, which disrupted many of my academic and extracurricular plans. I’m now trying to get back on track and prepare to apply for PhD programs in the USA or Canada, but I’m facing some challenges and would love some guidance.\n\nResearch opportunities in my university are quite limited, especially in psychology. Research assistant positions are mostly reserved for graduate students, and the only chance for undergraduates to conduct their own research is in the senior study course during the spring semester of senior year. This setup has me worried about the competitiveness of my PhD applications, especially compared to applicants from larger universities with more research experience.\n\nDoes anyone know how or where I can find remote research assistant positions? I’d also love advice on how undergraduates can publish papers. How can I get started, and are there any resources you’d recommend?\n\nFinally, has anyone here successfully transitioned from a smaller international institution to a reputable Psychology PhD program in North America? If you’ve been in a similar situation, I’d really appreciate your insights on how to strengthen my application despite these limitations.\n\nThanks so much for your time and advice!",

      "text": "In Europe, we are currently debating whether we should do more to attract American scientists. The so-called brain drain as a consequence of Trump policies is portrayed as a net gain for Europe. We, as European scientists in a very competitive environment threatened by budget cuts, are told that we should show 'solidarity' with scientists from the United States. We are told that this is an opportunity to attract 'the brightest scientists from the planet'. We are told that we should accept that our own position becomes even more precarious, but that it is for the bigger cause.\n\nI profoundly disagree. While I sincerely feel sorry for my American colleagues, I feel more sorry for colleagues from Palestine, Yemen, Syria, Iran, Ukraine, Sierra Leone or Myanmar. Dozens of countries are outright dictatorships where scientists face grave danger if they go against the will of the regime. I want to show deep solidarity with these people, and we should do more for them by setting up European funding. But why, in the name of God, should we spend millions aimed specifically at American researchers, that are way more capable of finding jobs in- and outside academia than people from any of these countries? Why do we need to show solidarity with you, but not with them? I am tired of the hypocrisy and the feigned exceptionality of Americans in any sector, especially science. We already communicate in your language, we publish in your journals. Your universities have gained the ownership of being the so-called \"best\" universities in the world. Yesterday, a university board member even told that we should provide special funds with higher wages, or 'that Americans will otherwise not come'.\n\nAnd now, when the cloud castle of neoliberalism collapses into outright fascism, Europeans should bail Americans out? Hello no. I will speak up in my university to resist this urge, and to let Americans in the regular way. Apply for a job. Submit a research proposal to one of our national scientific committees. Reach out to us if you need help during the process. You are deeply welcome. But not because of your nationality, not because of your hypothetical exceptional position. Americans need to realize that they are not exceptional, but part of the world community. That we all have concerns and that we need more global equality. I believe that your country is still salvageable, and that it is up to YOU, the intelligentsia, to take up the proverbial arms against this administration.  Organize, resist, protest. Fight back, while you can.",

For the past few months, I had been in contact with a professor at a major UK institution. Our correspondence started when I asked if she would be willing to host me as a visiting researcher. My dissertation focuses on developing, and in some ways correcting, a key aspect of her own previous work.\n\nDuring this period, our collaboration went far beyond what would normally be expected. I helped her translate manuscripts from Latin (which I’m highly proficient in) and Ancient Greek (which I know at a basic level). I also revised drafts of her publications and even ghostwrote for her at times.\n\nEverything seemed to be progressing. The time was coming when I needed an official letter of acceptance from her to secure approval from my home institution and begin the visa process. But just when I needed her most she vanished. No replies, no explanations, just silence.\n\nRecently, I discovered she had published a paper ON MY DISSERTATION TOPIC topicreasserting her original ideas. I bought the article and couldn’t even finish reading it. So much of what I had written is in there.\n\nI haven’t taken any action yet, but I’m heartbroken. I want to die. This was the opportunity of a lifetime. My dreams have been crashed so badly! Being a researcher in a poor country is hard enough, especially in these last years because of my nation positions in some wars and other political stuff I don't want to clarify now. I feel physically ill and right now I hate her so much I feel lije I could die. I want to report her somehow, but I’m afraid doing so would destroy any remaining chance I have of working abroad.\n\nI don’t know what to do. I just hope one day someone more powerful than her steals her dreams and work, so she knows how this feels. I wouldn’t wish this experience on anyone here. And I truly hope no one here ever treats another scholar the way she treated me.\n\nI don't even know of my english right now makes any sense. I just wish I could sleep I never wake up.

I have my PhD, and have supervised several since. I'm lucky that my own PhD students have been exceptional (no credit to me, they were simply brilliant thinkers in their own right), but I'm becoming increasingly aware that this is often not the case with other new PhD candidates, both in my field (philosophy) and beyond it, and especially at lower-tier institutions. I've read the output of some recent PhD graduates, and been horrified by the low quality of work, as well as the low standards some new PhD candidates are being held to in terms of dissertation lengths and timeframes for completion.  \n**(ETA: I'm thinking about this mostly as it related to fields where working in academia, rather than industry, is a common goal.)**\n\nToo many students being allowed into PhD programs is creating a surplus of junior academics that the academic job market has no room for, and while the obvious solution would be to limit entry to PhD programs to only the most exceptional candidates, universities seem to have no interest in that. Nor do they seem to be interested in raising the standards for actually staying in a PhD program and eventually being awarded the degree, so as to weed out those candidates producing sub-par work. Meanwhile some of the potential PhD students who might actually be capable of brilliant work are questioning whether or not they should bother (or even actively declining) to try to do one, because social media is overflowing with negative tales from recent PhD graduates who are struggling to get academic jobs because they've produced sub-quality PhD work. (I feel it's necessary to add that I know that's far from the only reason people struggle to get academic jobs, but it's inarguably a contributing factor for many.)\n\nI feel like any time I try to broach this topic, people just get angry and say I'm being elitist, but I'm sure I can't be alone in these frustrations.

I'm starting to feel a bit depressed about this. In academia, we already spend a lot of time alone writing and researching, so if we also have to eat alone and have coffee breaks alone, it becomes really difficult.\n\nI was wondering if I am the only one feeling like this, and if in other sectors, such as NGOs or private companies, people go to work and coordinate lunch, coffees, or after-work gatherings.\n\nThanks.",

Therapy has been useless for healing from trauma and I just want to hear from someone who has made it out the other side of academic abuse and thrived.\n\n\nAs a back story, I was tenured, applying for full.  A new hire got all my courses and I was put fully online asynchronous.  I left that hell for another university, which cut my program. My field is dying nationally.  \n\nI have been temporarily homeless, almost completely jobless, and just feeling totally useless for the past 6 months. I've been working a minimum wage job because it was the only work I could find (I paid a career coach to help me reframe experience and skills, and also got nothing).  I start two new jobs this month (two will just make up the financial difference) both are entry level positions, but are field related.\n\nI've lost everything career wise and feel like it's because academia ruined my marketability.  I have no retirement because of the mobility of academia from state to state. \n\nPlease, anyone. Tell me you can heal. Or tell me the truth that healing isn't going to happen. \n\nEdit: I'm turning off comments.  I honestly had hoped I'd find someone who would say \"here's how I healed\" instead of \"you're so stupid for leaving a tenured position.\" I was wrong.",

      "title": "A Call to Reverse the Retraction of Wolfe-Simon's Arsenic Paper",
      "text": "I'm writing this post in support of Felisa Wolfe-Simon and her coauthors, and to admonish the journal *Science*, in particular, editor-in-chief Holden Thorp, for unjustly [retracting](https://retractionwatch.com/2025/07/24/science-retraction-arsenic-life-nasa-astrobiology/) the 2011 paper \"[A bacterium that can grow by using arsenic instead of phosphorus](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21127214/).\" **Retractions should be reserved for research misconduct, not when a paper is \"proven\" later to be incorrect**. Based on the timeline and actions that I learned from Felisa and highlighted in the recent[ *New York Times*](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/11/science/arseniclife-felisa-wolfe-simon-retraction.html?unlocked_article_code=1.zE4.KNQf.Oxl_9052Q-e0&smid=url-share) piece, I believe that Thorp is acting with personal grievance rather than with the best interest of the scientific process. Thorp cites evolved norms that purportedly give new grounds and states “Science’s standards for retracting papers have expanded.^(1)” **This retraction sets a dangerous precedent:** folks in positions of power in the scientific establishment determine what is and isn't science. If the retraction is not reversed, I call for a boycott on *Science* from the academic community: no submissions, no peer reviews, and no subscriptions.\n\nFurthermore, I believe that Felisa has been victimized in this process and unfairly convicted in the court of public opinion in a way where folks are overlooking the travesty of Thorp's actions. Her team was exceedingly thorough, honest, and operating well within the standards of scientific research.\n\nTo take a step back and summarize: for the longest time, researchers believed that all DNA—present in all life, including humans, bacteria, animals, and plants—had the same chemical makeup of carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, hydrogen, and phosphorus. In particular, phosphorus is an essential part of the DNA backbone. Felisa's team discovered bacteria GFAJ-1 at Mono Lake, California that seemed to incorporate arsenic directly into DNA, stepping in for phosphorus to stabilize the DNA—a feat unheard of. Their paper presented multiple lines of evidence indicating this arsenic substitution.\n\nDuring my doctoral studies, I recall Felisa's team's paper dropping like a nuke into the academic news world. As the *NYT* piece highlighted, the burgeoning scientific[ blogosphere](http://rrresearch.fieldofscience.com/search/label/%23arseniclife) and Twitter mobilized, which culminated in sincere scientific concerns but also [personal](https://neurodojo.blogspot.com/2025/02/arseniclife-in-soft-focus.html?m=1)[ attacks](https://www.michaeleisen.org/blog/?p=346) laced with jealousy and animus. As an impressionable grad student, I recall also assuming the worst and fell in line with the prevailing opinion.\n\nCritically, Felisa couldn't defend herself. She was pressured from making public statements, even to address personal attacks. This enforced silence created a perception of guilt, while media coverage and social media amplified the critics' voices, making them appear definitively correct.\n\nThe situation parallels the media frenzy around the American exchange student Amanda Knox, who was publicly vilified for allegedly murdering her roommate Meredith Kercher in Perugia, Italy. The nascent internet and 24-hour news cycle fixated on Knox's behavior—such as not showing [\"appropriate\" remorse](https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=2&v=04bFaAZuuQM&embeds_referring_origin=https://www.perplexity.ai) in video footage taken before she even knew about Kercher's murder. Knox has since been exonerated, proving she was wrongfully convicted.\n\nSimilarly, I believe the public and scientific community have been misled about Felisa, transforming her into a pariah based on a one-sided narrative. Even her[ Wikipedia entry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Felisa_Wolfe-Simon) perpetuates this character assassination with loaded statements like \"As of May 2022, the paper has not been retracted.\" (It's worth noting that Felisa has been barred from editing this page herself.) We shouldn't allow this biased framing to legitimize Thorp's retraction decision.\n\nLet me be clear: I'm not claiming irrefutable proof that arsenic incorporates into GFAJ-1's DNA. Scientific knowledge evolves as we learn more and test previous conclusions. This happens routinely. Scientists[ initially](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1901/jeab.1958.1-69)[ concluded](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/0097840X.1979.9935010) that ulcers resulted from stress (1950s-1970s), before it was[ discovered](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(84)91816-6/fulltext) they were actually caused by bacteria. Importantly, those original papers weren't retracted because no misconduct occurred—the authors drew reasonable conclusions based on their available data. This is how science works, and how *Science* should work.\n\nThe[ authoritative guidelines](https://publicationethics.org/guidance/guideline/retraction-guidelines) from the Committee on Publication Ethics (COPE) specify that retractions are appropriate for falsification, fabrication, plagiarism, major errors, compromised peer review, or unethical research practices. **None of these criteria apply to the arsenic DNA paper.**\n\nFelisa's team reached reasonable conclusions based on their evidence using three complementary approaches: (1) cultivating bacteria in media containing arsenic but lacking phosphorus, (2) measuring arsenic and phosphorus in bacteria under different conditions using mass spectrometry, and (3) x-ray data suggesting arsenic substitution for phosphorus in various biological molecules, including DNA.\n\nWhen I reviewed this paper fifteen years later with substantially more scientific experience, I'm impressed by its methodological thoroughness. The claim was certainly bold, but the team employed three distinct and substantial approaches to support their hypothesis about arsenic incorporation into DNA.\n\nSkepticism is certainly valuable in science, and many researchers expressed doubts.[ Several letters](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.1201482) questioning the findings were published in *Science* six months after the original paper. These critiques raised reasonable concerns about the cultivation experiments (potential trace phosphate in the media) and DNA purification methods for mass spectrometry.\n\nHowever, I've yet to see anyone adequately refute the third line of evidence—the x-ray data showing arsenic in DNA. Moreover, Felisa's team never claimed complete replacement of phosphorus with arsenic. (Note: *Science*’s official press release about the paper didn’t help—it erroneously boasted to journalists that the “bacterium that can live and grow entirely off arsenic”). \n\nWhat about minimal incorporation—perhaps less than 1%? This would still represent a revolutionary finding.\n\nThe[ two replication studies](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3845625/) attempted to reproduce only the cultivation and mass spectrometry results, both reporting no detectable arsenic in DNA. But these findings don't necessarily invalidate the original paper. Mass spectrometry has detection limits—it cannot identify individual arsenic molecules, requiring a minimum concentration. If arsenic incorporation fell below this threshold, the results would be inconclusive rather than contradictory.\n\nAdditionally, replication studies operate under different incentives than original research. While I'm not suggesting these researchers were careless, they lacked the motivation to invest months perfecting cultivation techniques, optimizing DNA isolation, or meticulously conducting mass spectrometry. Indeed, Felisa and the other original authors have highlighted key procedural gaps from these reproduction attempts.^(2) For the replication teams, publication in *Science* was guaranteed regardless of their results.\n\nSo, I don't believe the refutation work has been as decisive as the writers of the[ GFAJ-1 Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GFAJ-1#cite_note-7) claim. **But even if future research conclusively disproves Felisa's team's findings, that still wouldn't justify retraction**. It would simply represent the normal progression of scientific understanding.\n\nI also feel uniquely positioned in that I've peripherally known Holden Thorp for nearly 20 years. I was an undergraduate at the University of North Carolina (UNC) from 2005 to 2009, during the time when Dr. Thorp quickly rose through the ranks, going from distinguished professor to dean of the College of Arts and Sciences to chancellor of the University all within my time there.\n\nThorp had a reputation for especially playing university politics well, particularly playing nice with donors. He resigned his chancellorship in 2013 amid the [UNC sports academic scandal](https://alumni.unc.edu/news/thorp-to-step-down-as-chancellor-in-june-2013/), where it came to light that an appreciable number of UNC athletes were relying on paper classes, where the sole deliverable was a modest paper at the end, to pad their GPAs and keep in good academic standing.\n\nThorp didn't suffer too much, though, and took up the provost role at another lofty university, Washington University in St. Louis, for another six years before assuming the editor-in-chief role at *Science*. In addition to his role at *Science*, Thorp became a Professor of Chemistry at George Washington University in 2023.\n\nNearly a decade later, I responded to an editorial he wrote \"[Looking ahead, looking back](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.abn8856?url_ver=Z39.88-2003&rfr_id=ori:rid:crossref.org&rfr_dat=cr_pub%20%200pubmed).\" Thorp laments the atrocities that were done in the name of science, and gives an example of a study in *Science* where the physiological effects of nuclear fallout were studied by injecting sodium iodide into children with developmental disabilities. Thorp writes:\n\n>*\"Science is not afraid to point out its role in supporting malicious science---it is history that should not be forgotten and can guide us in working with the community to confront shortcomings, past and present, in our pages and across the scientific enterprise.\"*\n\nIn my email to Thorp, I noted problems with animal experimentation. Where we've subjected animals to horrific experiments such as[ suturing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Margaret_Livingstone) the eyes of young monkeys shut to test sensory deprivation or[ sawing open brains](https://www.peta.org/blog/nih-monkeys-chaplin-lloyd-hightop/) of monkeys to inject toxins. The scientific benefit of these experiments is dubious—we don't know if the findings apply for humans.\n\nThorp was directly party to some animal experimentation issues at UNC and[ supported](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/secret-shame-tar-heel-karthik-sekar--ibbzc/) legislation that would have needlessly punished whistleblowers who raise concerns about animal welfare misconduct at UNC research facilities. \n\nHe never responded to my email.\n\nFrom my communication with Felisa and the details that have been shared with me, I don’t believe that Thorp has been acting in good faith during this process—he’s seemed undeterred and hellbent on retraction, merely looking for the right opportunity to do so. It’s hard to believe that, **more than a decade** after the initial study and controversy—complete with extensive peer review and editorial oversight followed by letters of concern and two replication studies, the journal suddenly *now* determines that “[the paper’s reported experiments do not support its key conclusions](https://www.science.org/content/blog-post/last-step-long-process-arsenic-life).”\n\nThis comes at a time when there is [record distrust](https://www.pew.org/en/trend/archive/fall-2024/americans-deepening-mistrust-of-institutions) in institutions. It’s disheartening to see the leader of one of our most venerated scientific journals politick the retraction of a paper. If institution leaders can autocratically determine what is and isn’t science, what does this mean for the future of vaccine and climate science?\n\n^(1)Thorp, Holden.

Trigger warning for disabled academics and students: many of the comments contain dismissive and harmful attitudes toward disability.\n\nOriginal post below:\n\nI’m a PhD student at a prestigious US university, and my advisor is the head of our department. I have a severe but invisible disability and chronic pain, which I’ve disclosed over the years for accommodations and medical leave.\n\nTwo years ago, I applied to TA her large undergrad class. Shortly after submitting tne application, she called me and suggested I TA a different course because of the physical demands of that class. A day later, I realized she might have just denied me an opportunity because of my disability. I asked to talk again and, through tears, told her how it felt. She reframed it as “protecting” me and said that if I really wanted the position, she’d help arrange accommodations. I decided to TA a different class. \n\nIt’s been 2 years. She will be an important reference, so I’ve tried to drop it but it still eats at me. The interaction has left me feeling like I don’t belong in academia and like I’m a burden for the department.

What I don't understand is, is this not the same as if you went out to get essentially any industry job straight out of college?\n\nAre tensured professors unfirable if the university downsizes? Or if their department closes, moves or if the professor is severely underperforming? Or if they are failing to obtain grants or bad at managing the research group? Or something else that might also be normal in industry?\n\nI understand that it's also primarily protection for research - you can't be fired due to the points of view you present in your research if understand correctly. Which makes sense. But everything else, it seems to me that what has been described as the pinnacle in academia is equivalent to the expected base level in industry? Or is there something I completely misunderstand?\n\nEdit: I seem to have forgotten about at-will employment which explains it. Thank you to everyone for answering",
