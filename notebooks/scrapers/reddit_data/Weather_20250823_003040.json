I’ve been noticing a steady stream of extreme weather events around the world this year - flooding, hailstorms, heatwaves, severe wind events - often in places that don’t normally experience this level of intensity.\n\nIs anyone else here tracking this? Does it feel like there’s been a noticeable increase in the number or intensity of weather disasters in 2025? Has this year stood out to you? And are there any weather events that felt especially unusual or out of season where you live?\n\nWould love to hear thoughts from folks in different regions about this.",

      "text": "Hello everyone, it's been a while. \nFor those who don't remember or didn't see my previous posts, it all started a couple of years ago when he got fixated with the iPad weather app rain animation and I asked here about coming up with a list of cities that would always ensure there's at least one with rain. Then he became interested in all the animations and kept asking me help in finding him thunderstorms, snowstorms, Blizzards, etc, which became quite an effort for me.\n\nSince then, he's become almost completely independent in using not only the iPad weather app, but practically any other weather app across all devices we own, including my laptop. He doesn't look at just the animations anymore, he is interested in the forecasts too, and compares across apps. He looks specifically for places he is familiar with because we either have been there, are planning to go there, or he knows part of our family lives there.\n\nHe gets pretty upset when the forecast changes, for example if there was a thunderstorm projected for next week in Mexico City and it goes away. As our home is bilingual, he talks about the weather in both English and Spanish. We have devices set to both languages, so he says \"I want to look at the weather in Daddy's phone in Spanish\" (or English depending on his mood).\n\nHe loves to play outside during light rain. But lately he has been really scared of loud storms. His way to cope is to take a shower, and it is very difficult to get him out of the shower while the rain is still raging. Basically he is covering the \"scary\" sound of the storm with the \"calming\" sound of the shower.\n\nHe also asks repeatedly our smart speaker about the weather. Seeing that he is interested in audio now, I decided to give another chance to the weather radio that I bought a couple of years ago based on a suggestion from this group, and he loved it now. He actually spent more than 30 minutes listening to it, which is quite a feat given his usual attention span.\n\nHe has mastered icons, dates, patterns and forecasts. But he is yet to show interest about magnitudes such as temperatures, wind speeds, humidity, etc. I assume that will eventually catch his interest too.\n\nMy wife and I think he may truly grow to become a climatologist.",

      "text": "###[Numerous severe storms are expected from the Southern Plains to the Upper Midwest. The Storm Prediction Center has issued a Moderate Risk of severe storms for the Upper Midwest, with the potential of a regional outbreak. Strong tornadoes, very large hail and damaging winds are possible](https://www.spc.noaa.gov/products/outlook/day1otlk.html) \n\n#####SUMMARY: Multiple corridors of severe thunderstorms are expected across the Upper Midwest later today into tonight, with a regional severe weather outbreak possible. The most dangerous period is likely during the late afternoon and evening when strong tornado potential should be maximized. Scattered large to very large hail and damaging winds are likely as well.\n_______\n\n###**Storm Prediction Center Resources:**\n\n#####[Public Severe Weather Outlook (if available)](https://www.spc.noaa.gov/products/outlook/pwo.html)\n\n**[Current SPC Day 1 Outlook](https://www.spc.noaa.gov/products/outlook/day1otlk.html)**\n\n**[For previously issued outlooks and Day 2-8 Outlooks, click here](https://www.spc.noaa.gov/products/outlook/)**\n\n**[Today's storm reports](https://www.spc.noaa.gov/climo/reports/250428_rpts.html)**\n\n**[Full list of active severe weather watches](https://www.spc.noaa.gov/products/watch/)**\n\n**[Current and previous mesoscale discussions for the day](https://www.spc.noaa.gov/products/md/)**\n\n_____\n\n###Severe Weather Preparedness Resources and Tips:\n\n###Having a NOAA Weather Radio:\n\n#####These transmitters give constant weather information and will immediately notify you with warnings in your area. [For info about the radio, click here.](https://www.weather.gov/nwr/) | [For info on where to buy one, click here.](https://www.weather.gov/nwr/nwr_receivers)\n\n**Know your location on a map! Typing your address or your city/town name on a street view app like Google Maps can help.**\n\n###[Find Your Tornado Shelter - A map with the locations of local storm shelters in your area](https://findyourtornadoshelter.com/)\n\n###Know where to take shelter:\n**If you don't have a storm shelter nearby, the safest place in your home is the interior part of a basement. If you have no basement, go to an interior room, without windows, on the lowest floor. This could be a center hallway, bathroom, or closet. \\*DO NOT STAY IN A MOBILE HOME. Find a sturdy shelter nearby*.**\n\n###Preparing an Emergency Supply Kit - It is recommended that your kit has the following items:\n\n1. NOAA Weather Radio\n2.  Helmets\n3. Blankets\n4. First aid kit\n5. Sturdy shoes\n6. Flashlights\n7. Food\n8. Water\n9. Chargers and extra batteries\n10. Medicine\n11. Air Horn or Whistle\n12. Dust mask\n13. Spare clothes\n\n\n###Supply kit information -> [Ready.gov - Preparing an Emergency Supplies Kit](https://www.ready.gov/kids/family-emergency-planning/build-a-kit)\n\n###Activate your weather emergency alerts (WEA) on your phone.

I've always been fairly vigilant during tornado season...  not being born and raised in the midwest, it is truly the scariest thing I have ever experienced.  My husband used to retort: BUT you grew up on the east coast with hurricanes... which I always responded, \"yeah but I had a week to batten down the hatches and get the hell out of Dodge, if necessary.  Tornadoes are different.\"\n\nIn light of the recent events, and the possibility that notification systems may be compromised, plus the upcoming tornado season, will local weather stations still have the ability to send out warnings...  or is it 1850 again and I just need to watch the sky, put out my wind chime turbines and hope for the best?",

I'm a weather geek. \nI don't watch local TV and haven't in years. \nBut occasionally I'll catch the forecast on our local.\nEven they aren't showing the high and low pressure systems on the map. \n\nThey are happy to show where the rain is. \nBut I want to actually see the high and low pressure on the map. \n\nI have tried probably every decent weather app possible. And I even go to our local Web sites weather. But no one shows this information anymore. \n\nHow hard is it for these apps to show where the high and lows are? It drives me crazy. \n\nIt helps me understand what the weather is doing. \n\nCan anyone recommend an app or something that shows this info?  I don't understand why they don't show it anymore. \n\nThanks :)",

Maybe could get used to it, tho. I like having someone that is live streaming while all the nasties are going on and also has chasers that check in when something is happening. I love severe weather stuff and learning about it. Found out about Ryan Hall from a comment here a bit ago. and gave him a try. \n\nSo, who does storm coverage like Ryan Hall but, isn't Ryan Hall?\n\nNitey-Nite Reddit 😴",

      "text": "On East Coasts all over the world you have Monsoon climates. These climates are defined by a wet summer and dry winter. You have a dry winter as with less/weaker sun the land is colder and therefore the colder air sinks creating high pressure. The wind then blows from the land in the direction of the sea.\n\nIn the Summer this is reversed, the Sun is stronger and there is more of it. As the sun heats the land in the Summer it brings the rain as it is a scientific fact that heat rises. As the air rises it creates low pressure which creates convection currents, thus driving the prevailing wind from the water onto the land and bringing rain.\n\nAll of this makes perfect sense from a physics standpoint, but for some reason this is reversed on West Coasts. In the Mediterranean for example the Summer is dry and the winter is wet. This is despite the sun heating the land in the Summer which should create a low pressure system but this fails to materialise and in fact the opposite happens, so why is this?",

      "text": "As with all significant weather events, one of the things that makes the news the most is that climate change is making weather more extreme. This is a correct correlation! The warming of ocean waters gives hurricanes more to feed off of. It gives large troughs a bigger temperature difference over a frontal boundary to generate stronger lift for severe storms. What I'm worried about (and it's more because I'm going to school for meteorology and it's something I've always cared about deeply) is that people will shut out other answers to what caused a significant weather event.\n\nMilton is a great chance to make this rant. Milton's initial strength *did* benefit largely due to a warmer Gulf of Mexico, which is positively affected by climate change. I wholeheartedly believe the two biggest factors to Milton's strength are the ENSO cycle and climate change. Lack of wind shear definitely helped as well, though often ocean environments lack wind shear. 897 hPa is astonishing for a hurricane to reach within a day and a half of becoming a tropical storm. Models which are normally quite aggressive like HAFS-B and HWRF even undershot how strong it would be.\n\nThe tornado outbreak on the 9th from Milton, however, I believe had little to do with an overall change in climate. Trey's video at Convective Chronicles is fantastic to explain this. Basically a mix of surface heating due to less cloud cover, strong low level wind shear, and strong instability due to a pseudo-frontal boundary like many central US events, and a solid EML led to this event. My issue is that people don't care about those things or what actually made something happen, because it's easier to blame something that is tangible to them and matters more in the long run. \n\nMaybe it's that I don't want people to get incorrect information, even if they blame a problem that definitely needs to be solved as soon as possible. I'd rather people be more knowledgeable about a topic than blame something that matters, but not know why they're blaming it. Know what climate change affects and work to solve those, but also know that these events won't be absent if we solve how we're affecting the climate. Rarer, maybe. Less extreme, almost definitely. But they will still happen.\n\nI really hate that climate change is a political issue. All nations need to fix this inherent human issue to the best of their ability using any resources available. Making all cars EVs won't help, restricting purchases of carbon fuels won't help. The whole supply chain needs to be abandoned in order to reverse what we've already done.\n\nThank you for coming to my TED Talk. My opinion doesn't mean much in the grand scheme of things but thank you for reading it if you care about our world, too. :)",

I have never needed to run my AC as much as I did so far this summer in a climate that used to be tolerable in the summer without AC. What has been cauding the Northeast USA and Southeastern Québec to be SOO hot this year. We've had like over 10 days of 90+ degree weather and our hottest day was 95 degrees with hot wind and blazing sun as if I were in semi-arid Texas. Most of the hot days have also been insufferably humid to the point where I couldn't even wipe my face anymore due to me being drenched in my own sweat when it'd be 90 with 60+ percent humidity. It'd also be like 80+ until sometimes midnight. Ten years ago, I'd have a sweater on after 10pm because it'd be under 60F sometimes but here we are with nights barely reaching under 70F with 90+ percent humidity. Will this also affect the intensity of how winter may turn out this year?",

Our dry season is late June to October, when it starts to snow. We have been experiencing weekly rainstorms (thunder, lightning, wind) for days at a time, which isn’t normal for the area. At this point in August the river is usually very low. Some years in July we have drought warnings and we can’t water our lawns at certain times. This year the river is so high it looks almost how it looked before the flood of 2013. My question I guess is, is there a reason for all the rain? Don’t get me wrong no one is complaining, our farmers have had abundant harvests this year. I’m just curious I guess why all the rain during the dry season, as I’ve never seen this before. Will answer any questions in comments",

One minute it’s blazing hot with not a cloud in sight, the next—BAM—torrential rain out of *nowhere*. And then 20 minutes later? Sunshine again like nothing happened.  \n\nI get that tropical climates are humid and prone to sudden storms, but how does it shift *that* fast? Is it just convection heating + ocean moisture creating instant thunderstorms? And why do some days feel like the air itself is trying to drown you while others are perfectly calm?  \n\nAlso, locals just seem to *know* when it’s about to pour—meanwhile, I’m sprinting for cover like a soaked rat. Any meteorology nerds or tropical residents care to explain the science (or share survival tips)?  \n\n**TL;DR:** Tropical weather is a chaotic rollercoaster, and I respect anyone who can predict it.

      "text": "I have lived in (north) Texas for 12 years (after living in colder northern states, before that). Each winter gets warmer and warmer. Sunnier and sunnier. Now -- even in the deadest of our supposedly \"winter\" -- the sky is always incessantly blue, the weather is always 65-70F, and the sun is always BLINDINGLY bright from 9A-5P. I would give so much for more cloudy, gloomy, wet, quiet, dreary winter days. They are a balm to my soul.\n\nI mourn the loss of winter days - where I could enjoy scarves, sweaters and coats, a warm beverage midday, comforting soups, a chilly afternoon run. I put up blackout curtains in my bedroom to seal out the sun in the midday -- but it still creeps in with its incessant loudness.\n\nI feel the loss of winter turning my depression into anger. Getting into my car to run errands for 20 minutes in the blinding sun makes me angry. Even in my own home, I can't seem to escape the sun. I feel the very real, visceral, physical effects of irritability and anger during daytime hours, seemingly every single day. I am working as much as possible to move to a more temperate climate, but the job hunt hasn't been successful so far. I'm in therapy, but it doesn't help very much. (I know climate change is real, and I am fastidious in lowering my carbon footprint) But of course, that doesn't change my current experience).\n\nDo others experience this? Any survival tips are so welcome 🙏🏼",

She is highly stressed. Every time there's a wild swing in temperature (20 or so degrees) between one day and the next she has a panic attack and gets an inflamed bladder and pees everywhere. \n\nI know this sounds insane but it's the ONLY consistent thing in all her episodes. I can literally predict her episodes based on the weather...\n\nShe's only 5 so she's got many years of worsening climate change, and we're looking to move anyway, so why not consider places where she's more comfortable? \n\nOur list of wants is impossible, but bonus points for - milder summers, not arid (we like some humidity I know its weird), and regular sun especially in winter. Seasons would nice too, since we're going for ideals lol. We were thinking Madison WI or the Twin Cities for example, before we figured out my cat's problem with temperature swings... now I'm not sure anymore.\n\n\nEdit: Thanks for the suggestions! I'm seeing a lot of CA and the PNW so I'll focus on those for now. Theoretically I'd entertain Hawaii but I've never even visited and that'd be a huge move physically and culturally. \n\nForgot to say Florida is a no-go (partner grew up there and his parents are still there and he's not going back lol)!",

In reality, a lot of the mtn west sees low humidity with reasonable summer temps. Winters in the Midwest/Northeast are just ice, slush, freezing rain, and gloomy for 3 months, and snow is rare (Unless you’re far north enough). But out west they have snow (powder) instead of sleet/freezing rain, more sun, and 25 F there feels way less cold than 25 F out east for some reason.",

      "text": "For more context: I once went to Murmansk, Russia (polar circle), and when it was calm -10 to -15 degrees I often walked without hat or gloves, while in my hometown Minsk, if its 0 or even ***+5*** degrees at a 40-60 km/h wind I cannot walk even a minute without a hat, while wearing similar clothes! I even once saw a comment (no joke) that one girl who came here to study from SIBERIA said she said she never felt so cold😃. And that's while in most areas of Siberia it can get both very cold and very windy.\n\nSo that brings me into conclusion that winters in Lapland+Murmansk region (excluding the Arctic Ocean coast), and maybe even some areas of Siberia, even though they have lower temperatures they feel much more pleasant than winter in the Baltics because there is much less wind",

What I’ve come to notice over the last 2.5 years is the court gets dangerously slick starting in late June and doesn’t revert to normal until early September. Slick to the point where any sudden stops or cuts will feel like ice and we’ve had several injuries due to it; yet, if you touch the floor with your hand, it’s completely dry. \n\nI did my own research and realized the basketball court gets slick every time the temperature goes over 58 degrees AND the humidity is over 86%. I sound crazy, I’m aware, but it has been full proof since I started tracking and I cannot understand why this is the case. It’s been 100% humidity and 50 degrees without issue, or 80 degrees with 70% humidity without issue. \n\nWhat could be causing this? Is it as simple as a poorly laid hardwood floor allowing condensation to accumulate under the tiles?",

      "text": "Some mountain valleys in the West like in the Interior regions of California (away from the coast, so no marine layer influence), or in other Western states have diurnal temperatures ranges of over 40 degrees F in the summer. There is a greater difference in winter too, but just not as stark as compared to the summer day to night temperature range. Some of these valleys are in well known Wine Country regions. Here is few examples:\n\n1. Paso Robles, California. Wikipedia lists the average high in Aug of 92 F and low of 53 F\n2. Hayfork, California. Wikipedia lists the average July high of 94 F and low of 49 F.\n3. Heber City, Utah. Wikipedia lists average July high of 90 F and low of 50 F.\n4. Pinnacles National Park, California. Wikipedia lists average July high of 96 F and low of 50 F.\n\nEven during heat waves when day time temperatures exceed 100 F or even 110 F for some of these, the lows are usually in the 60 - 70 F range, sometimes even lower than 60 F (Hayfork, Pinnacles ...). A rather extreme example that drives the point to heart is when Hayfork saw a high of 98 F the same day it saw a low of 38 F (Oct 1, 2024). This was during a consistent heat wave with no cold fronts or precipitation involved.\n\nThis is in stark contrast to locations like Las Vegas or Phoenix that have nights only dropping to 80s and 90s after 100+ degree days in the summer (diurnal range between 25 - 30 F). Higher moisture content doesn't seem to be the issue as these are desert locations. Even Death Valley which is surrounded by tall mountains on all sides doesn't cool off much at night, ,with many nights staying above 90 F during the summer.\n\nWhat causes certain mountain valleys to have such extreme diurnal temperature swings but not in others? If it's the cold air pooling effect at night, why does it only happen in some of these valleys?",

The coldest temperature ever recorded in Miami (25.8**°** N) was 28 on February 6, 1947, only ONE degree warmer than LA.  The earliest sub-32**°** temperature recorded in Miami is December 12, the latest March 2.  Meanwhile, the earliest sub-32**°** temperature recorded in Los Angeles is January 4, the latest February 15. Further, the southernmost point of California is still further north than the northernmost point of Florida.\n\nI understand that California's positioning on the western North American coasts means its climate is more influenced by westerly winds from ocean waters as opposed to Florida being more influenced by continental drafts from the north and a little from the west (made worse by the fact that few geographical barriers prevent cold fronts from pushing into the Deep South.\n\nOverall, Florida is significantly warmer than coastal SoCal and has warmer average temperatures.  My question is why is it that Florida is capable of having more extreme colds?",

The temperature reading on one day was 102 F (at 2 pm) but other official weather stations nearby showed a high of 100 F for the day. I did notice as I walked with the thermometer on the same day in a large area (not shown) with tall trees with several hundred feet in the shade that the reading dropped to 97 F just in that patch. Is it possible the true temperature was only in the high 90s and the indirect sunlight caused the thermometer to read 5 degrees hotter? Or is a large shaded wooded area really few degrees cooler than the area in the sun on a hot day?\n\nFor reference, there was a light breeze that day (not more than 5-10 mph speed). I would think the area was well ventilated given it's an exposed ridge top.",

      "text": "I’ve been living in Palm Beach County for almost 15 years, and I’ve never seen a rainy season summer be as dry as this year. \n\nUsually, we can count on almost daily thunderstorms to cool things down and just get some precipitation, but it feels like that has barely happened over the past few months. Just extremely hot, bright sunshine, and dry virtually every day. I know Southwest Florida and other parts of the state have been hammered, but not coastal Palm Beach/Broward/Dade.\n\nIs there anything that can scientifically explain this? Please pardon any ignorance, I just want to understand and the lawn desperately needs some free watering…",

      "text": "So, I went to Seattle for three weeks this June and July, and the weather there was the best I've ever experienced. It had all of the benefits of summer with none of the detriments. The highs were 65-75 most days, and it never got hot. Still, it was warm enough to still feel like summer and you didn't need layers, unlike say Alaska where summer is not bad but kinda like fall somewhere else. Also, the humidity was low enough to not feel sticky and gross (which was very helpful because I was biking all the time), but high enough to not get dehydrated. Summer is Seattle's dry season, so it doesn't rain much at all. The sun set very late (like 9:30 PM) and rose very early (like 4:30 AM) , which is one of my favorite things about summer. It is enough daylight to feel mystical, but not too much so you don't go to sleep. There were almost no bugs due to the cold weather. Combine the perfect weather with the amazing scenery, with Puget Sound, the Cascades and evergreen forests all visible within a small radius. I have not actually been to many places around the globe, so I was wondering if anyone's been to a place where summer is even better, I'll put it on my bucket list. I just can't think any way summer *could* be better than Seattle; literally the only bad thing about the summers was the freezing cold mornings, which is a tradeoff I'd take eight days a week if it means no >85 degree days. These summers seem literally unbeatable, but I'm wondering if there are any places that are even better or at least close to Seattle in the summer?",

Lots of people are wondering why this is so, and as the resident weather “expert” I need an explanation so I can continue pretending to be smart. Thanks in advance!",

To clarify, I am NOT using ChatGPT instead of my own brain. I do try to identify the cloud type myself first but wanted a way to check my thoughts, which is when I asked ChatGPT. \n\nIf there is anyone who have toyed with AI for this purpose, I would love to hear your thoughts😊",

Find a local hub [here](https://sunrisemovement.org/hubs).  Email the hub organizer to get involved.  They're volunteers, and often busy, so follow up if you don't hear back.\n* Citizens Climate Lobby — broader age range, studiously bipartisan.  In the US CCL is pushing a revenue-neutral carbon tax and dividend bill,  [H.R. 763](https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/house-bill/763)You can find a signup form for Citizens Climate Lobby [here](https://citizensclimatelobby.org/join-citizens-climate-lobby/?tfa_3590416195188=reddit-silence7&utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=silence7).Make sure you figure out where the monthly meeting is and attend.\n* 350.org — This is the biggest and oldest climate group.  They're involved in a variety of actions, ranging from divestment to lobbying for state/province level and municipal legislation. Broad age range.  Local groups can be found [here](https://350.org/get-involved/)\n* [Extinction Rebellion](https://rebellion.earth/) believes in the use of nonviolent civil disobedience, including a willingness of large number of people to be arrested, on a large scale to create political change.  They are most active in the UK, but also have a significant number of active local chapters in the US and other countries.  Local chapters are mostly listed [here](https://rebellion.earth/act-now/local-groups/) but some in the US are only listed at [the bottom of this page](https://extinctionrebellion.us/).\n\nIf you want to find one that works for you, go down the list (and check the comments) and find out which ones are active near you.  Attend a meeting or action or two to get a sense of what the group is like, and then start doing more to help.\n\nThere are others, and depending on you and your community, another group might be the best choice.  If you don't feel that one of these group is a good fit for you, tell us where you are and what your community is like, and ask for help.\n\nIf you think there's something significant that one of the big groups isn't handling, ask about it.  Maybe somebody can help you figure out how to get it done.",

I told him that these were the people who put the alerts out to the weather radios, and he told me to just turn on the weather channel. I've since found that most people I've talked to only have a vague idea of what the NOAA/NWS is and seem to have no idea that these organizations serve as the source of most of our weather data and alerts and many of our forecasts. \n\nPeople can't appreciate or understand the importance of a service they are not aware of.",

While I don’t know the specifics, the hail size ranged from golf balls to baseballs, and the wind ranged from 70–80 MPH. I stayed up late that night, and I was unsure why. Well, I found out at about 5:39 a.m.—the wind started to pick up slowly, then it all happened so fast. The wind roared and the hail pelted the house. We had window screens either removed or shredded, mainly where the direction of the wind was blowing. Other screens got some damage. All of the window awnings, since they were separate panels—some were completely removed and dropped on the ground. It cracked the support on one of them, and the awnings that took the majority of the damage were hanging by two bolts, almost falling off. It shakes with any wind, and it has not fallen yet. Long story short, we need a new roof, about seven awnings, and ten window screens. Other than that, our car outside got damaged. The plastic under the windshield got cracked, and some holes were in it. Tons of dents, the paint was scratched off where the hail hit, and the driver-side mirror had a hole in it. But no glass from windows or the mirror was broken. But some good news came from it—that was the first day I ever laid eyes on an SPC outlook, and ever since then, my weather interest has only grown. A brief other time was the PDS tornado warning we were under once, and that tornado outbreak we had in the high-risk area. But March 15, 2025 was the most significant to me.",

      "text": "I think this NPR article outlines the timeline of the flood quite well and explains the facts of what we know so far: [https://www.npr.org/2025/07/05/nx-s1-5457759/texas-floods-timeline](https://www.npr.org/2025/07/05/nx-s1-5457759/texas-floods-timeline)\n\nA few things to note from this article:\n\n* The NWS issued flood watches, and they disseminated information on social media and through other channels about the risk of flooding.\n* The NWS office in Austin/San Antonio issued flash flood warnings in the early hours of the morning, followed by a flash flood emergency – the highest level of warning – with clear wording about the imminent risk to life, stating that this is a life-threatening situation.\n* There were no outdoor warning alarms for some of the rural areas impacted.\n\nA few other things to note:\n\n* Although Trump/DOGE cuts have resulted in some NWS offices that are limited in forecasting staff, resulting in some offices in the country not being staffed 24/7, the NWS forecast office in Austin/San Antonio is not one of the offices that is not operating overnight. As mentioned above, they did issue flash flood watches, warnings, and severe weather statements.\n* Alerting the public in rural areas is not easy, when there may be limited phone service, some people might not wake up to phone alerts overnight, not everyone is reading social media all the time, and not everyone has an official weather radio.\n\nWhile I am adamantly against Trump and DOGE's cuts to NOAA and the NWS, I think it's important not to immediately turn to political opinions in a situation like this. This is a tragic situation, and there is still an ongoing rescue operation with several children missing. Please, let's not jump to conclusions.\n\nIt does sound like there was a lack of communication to the public, and also between agencies. Hopefully that is something we will be able to learn from, but sadly, I think it's already becoming a political blame game.",

      "text": "I recently released my own iOS weather app. It's basically the app I always wanted and never found elsewhere which is a purely chart based full screen format of hourly data, no fluff, no cute animations of raindrops or other unnecessary elements that use battery life. Its also got a few features I always wished I had such as an easy to read wind speed and direction chart, and the ability to move locations around on a map and see how forecasts change with geography (good for checking out the forecast on a mountain summit vs. trailhead, or offshore where I can't typically search for a landmark). It also shows a bit of observations along with every forecast trend so you can see how close the past forecast was to reality, and it shows old forecast \"model runs\" as well.\n\n[You can download it here](https://apps.apple.com/app/apple-store/id6742910513?pt=18415&ct=Reddit&mt=8).\n\nIt's simple and a bit minimalist (purely a data visualization) but it won't kill your battery and it tells me more than Apple Weather and many of the other apps out there.\n\nI was using it daily myself and really liked it, so I decided to soft-launch it (no marketing yet) and see how it was received. I did try to monetize it to support the cost of the API and Developer account, but all features are available for free (you pay if you want to add more locations and use the widget/watch app).\n\nI am seeking feedback because I'm genuinely curious whether other people find this format is as useful as I do. I'm happy to give out some promo codes for a month free if anybody would like to try out the full features, the only thing I ask is you DM me with some feedback.\n\nThanks and hoping to hear what people think!",

While I do use a radar (I use Windy), I'm worried about future access to it. I'm someone who has always loved weather and originally went to school for meteorology until I learned how hard the math is (I barely passed algebra) and picked another path. I took the introductory course for the field. I say this so you know my level of knowledge. I'm wondering how those who came before modern forecasting did it and how accurate it was. I'm not trying to  predict for the whole region or country, but just my local area.",

Especially when considering this information the weather centres are collecting is source data for so many other institutions, organizations, and governing bodies AND will, quite often be converted, and rounded again. I suggest NOT rounding to less than detection margin of error, and let the referencer of the data decide how detailed they need the number to be. Hasn’t anyone at the weather centre rounded a number too early in a calculation before? In fact, it’s almost remarkable that anyone often computing a nonlinear prediction model wouldn’t fight tooth and nail for as many decimal places as possible. Am I way out of line?

I’ve done some cursory research and there is a ton of info out there making it hard to know where to start.\n\nI’ve been considering having at least a thermometer that was accurate in real time and I could check with my phone and a weathervane because those are just dope as hell but I started thinking how cool it would be if I were able to implement some equipment that might help inform my area (rural and often the last considered) to get more accurate information. \n\nAbsolutely delighted it’s totally a thing. And an inexpensive one as far as I can tell. I was willing to go in several hundred dollars on one if it helped with the data sets that others could benefit from and they’re basically $50-100. \n\nIs there anything I should consider or look for specifically? \nAre there other important volunteer programs I should look to meet the qualifications for? \nAre there any personal weather systems to avoid entirely?\n\nAnd of course anything I didn’t think of. \n\nThank you to anyone who takes the time to fill in my gaps. This community was extremely helpful the last time I got a little lost in the woods trying to learn more about meteorology and I got way deeper in than I expected to which was awesome.",

Lately, I’ve been thinking about taking my coverage to the next level by doing weather livestreams—especially during severe weather events.\n\nI’ve noticed that some of the other weather streamers out there use really nice overlay graphics—things like radar boxes, alert scrolls, warning maps, storm impact meters, etc. I’d love to start building something like that for my own livestreams, but I’m not sure where to start.\n\nDoes anyone know where I can find good weather overlay templates or resources? Are there free or affordable tools you’d recommend for building clean, professional-looking overlays? Bonus points if they work well with OBS or Streamlabs.\n\nAny advice, links, or examples would be super appreciated. Just trying to level up and learn more from others who are already doing this!\n\nThanks in advance!",

And if yes, how powerful? or would it have occassional passable periods where suffeciently purposeful travel could potentially result in lifeforms crossing over it without excessive technology level?\n\nEDIT: South pole stays cold, or more like, is even colder. This ain't about climate change specifically :') There's an artificial heat source at the north pole, and artificial heat sink at the south pole",

An isolated fire on a remote mountaintop in the Great Smoky Mountains National Park grew from 200 acres to more than 1700 acres in a few hours.   More than 2500 houses were destroyed and 14 people died.    The firestorm was the result of weather--a deep drought in advance, a front moving in from the south, combined with Mountain Waves drove sustained high winds, with recorded gusts of 87 mph recorded just before the main firestorm occurred (and local monitoring stations disabled or destroyed).\n\nWeather reports earlier that day were predicting winds with gusts up  of 30-40 mph (along with rain, which arrived later than expected).\n\nI would like to find more details about this weather event--both the preceding drought, the predictions and what actually happened.   I am also interested in any information that can help estimate how much the fire itself contributed to the wind event.  I have found a simulation of the mountain wave, which is helpful, but wonder if there have been more academic studies or publications about the meteorological aspects of this firestorm.\n\nI am also interested in preparing a weather history--maps, forecasts, records, etc.--of the weather leading up to this event, especially beginning about a week before the 28 November 2016 firestorm.\n\nAre there particular journals I should look at to find any studies?  How does one find old weather forecasts and weather maps for a specific location?\n\nThank you in advance. I am researching this from a risk management perspective and have no meteorological background, so any assistance pointing me to the right resources would be appreciated.",

      "text": "I decided to install a weather station atop my home, being something of an amateur meteorologist and just having a general fascination with weather and climate.  In the instruction manual of the station, it encouraged making sure that the unit be located above surrounding obstacles (trees, buildings, etc.) in order to establish accurate readings on the meter.  Though I live in a suburban area without many high structures, there are a few obstructions that are slightly taller than my roof - so I decided to build a metal pole to get it up above the plane of these obstructions.  \n\n  \nMy concern is that although this will get the station high enough, that it will present another weather consideration - risk of lighting strike.  Although it will by no means be the highest object in the vicinity (there are plenty of much taller trees within a 1/2 mile, as well as telephone poles and even a cell tower) I'm wondering if it could attract (???) lightning being a large metal pole sticking out of my roof.  \n\n  \nI was thinking of using a plastic pole instead, which obviously wouldn't conduct like a metal pole, but would this not still pose a risk of being struck? Likewise, are there steps that could be taken to ensure the pole isn't dangerous, such as grounding it? \n\nThanks for any professional (or otherwise moderately well informed) opinions on the matter, I'd hate to overthink this any further than I already have.",

      "text": "Hi all,  \nI recently went on a diving trip in Raja Ampat, where the crew relied on Windy and a few other apps to assess wind conditions. Windy predicted winds of just 7.5 knots. However, while sailing at night, we hit a severe storm with winds closer to 35 knots and waves up to 5 meters. The boat nearly capsized, and we had to divert to the nearest safe harbor.\n\nOther boats in the area weren't so lucky — some capsized or suffered broken masts and were stranded at sea for days.\n\nWhen I reached out to Windy support, they responded with this explanation:\n\n>\n\nI understand forecasting isn't perfect — especially in equatorial regions — but surely, in 2025, we can do better than this? I'm curious if a meteorlogist can explain what are the inputs that go into the forecasting models and how they can be improved?",

I use to think that the passage of a cold front often lead to dry cool weather behind it. However, it seems there are exceptions. In Ireland anyway, I have noticed that behind cold fronts in winter, there are often bands of heavy showers with very windy conditions, and from time to time accompanied by thunder in coastal areas of the west, but occasionally moving inland. Often, there is just enough instability for just 1 or 2 rumbles of thunder and no more. The thunder is often accompanied by very gusty winds and grapple.",

      "text": "This theory came upon me in a dream\n\nWhat if localized deep organized severe weather or special weather like snow squalls are less likely to form over an area (and maybe travel to) simply due to how many roads or buildings are in an area because they disrupt the natural airflow and wind patterns of weather, and because all facets of weather are interconnected, this disruption radiates throughout the system, all the way into the upper atmosphere inhibiting storm growth over a region \n\nAnd then this could have lasting effects on the climate making that area a bit drier or hotter/colder than the directly surrounding areas\n\nI thought of this when I used to constantly (and still do) look at the radar all day, and noticed that most storms dissipated or those storms formed over the Pittsburgh airport, but there were storms that formed right over my house and like near my surrounding areas. After taking about seven years of data, albeit most of that was modeled and the other half used via a $200 cheap weather station, I have concluded that my area gets about 6-7 (six seven😄) more inches of precipitation in comparison to the airport. And this doesn’t just affect rain totals. It also affects my snow totals as well. I got an average about 10 more inches of snow compared to the Pittsburgh airport although that might’ve been caused by poor measuring. Obviously the Pittsburgh airport has a larger effect on this weather disruption thing because it has planes which can affect the atmosphere at a far greater level, which is probably why this discrepancy exists, but what I’m arguing for is that this discrepancy can be observed anywhere with a lot of roads, for example an interchange, or with a lot of buildings. \n\nBy no reason, am I saying this theory is correct. It could be complete horse poop. I am just simply asking you guys to give your opinion on it.\n\nTL;DR - Roads(cars) and buildings have affect on all parts of the atmosphere because of the interconnectedness of the weather; although very minute, hundreds or thousands of cars and buildings can end up altering the nearby atmosphere, like determining where storms form or are positioned.",

      "text": "Waaaay back in the stone age (mid 90's) I had a Davis (I think) weather station of some sort, and a wife unhappy with the contraption mounted on the roof. The data (RS232?) and power cables came into the house through a hole in the wall (wife was unhappy with that, too). I figured out how to push the info to my own static web site via a somewhat complex .BAT file hosted on my own PC. I posted my own weather summary for unusual events by hand-editing the HTML that sat in the root of my C:\\\\ drive.\n\nMy wife was also unhappy at any mention of my weather station anyone could view on this newfangled internet thing that was all the rage. Normal people just didn't ***do*** that sort of thing. Don't tell anyone, what is ***wrong*** with you?   \n  \nOver time, rather than take the obvious path of uninstalling defective Wife 1.0, I faded out of home weather observing. (sigh).\n\n30+ years later, I mentioned this history to new and improved Wife v2.0 (she is also a scientist, yay!). She exclaimed, \"...aaaannnnd we don't have a complete weather and AQI setup running yet? Why not? What is ***wrong*** with you?\"  \n  \n*(leftover marital PTSD, that's what, but I digress).*  \n  \nAnyways, I would like to get back into this world o' home weather - but of course via wifi, solar power, automatic sending info to web services, and so on.\n\nIn addition to recos for a basic weather station (temp, precip, wind, humidity, etc.), I'd like to record air quality, and automatically contribute all this to whatever networks y'all recommend. I have zero current clue on weather and air quality network options.\n\nFor example, what air quality network does Watch Duty display? What weather network(s) does this group recommend joining? If you have other related bits of advice and experience as I again start down this path, I'm all ears.   \n  \nThanks!",

While his standards are unorthodox (he has a slightly different \"canon\" than official meteorological organizations, in part due to applying far more scrutiny on old/hinterland heat records) and the sourcing on his main site is godawful, they appear to reveal several important trends,† including that **there has been a great dearth in recent absolute heat records in Central and Eastern North America in comparison to other parts of the world**, with the last very significant record-breaking event there being back in 2012. Even places with similar climates like Western and Central Europe, China, Korea, and Japan have been overcome with waves of record-breaking temperatures, sometimes breaking the old records by huge margins and *even in consecutive years or months*.\n\nSo... what's going on here? Why didn't, say, Chicago O'Hare experience a temperature of 108 °F two years ago in a heat wave breaking the vast majority of record highs in the Great Lakes region, only for it to reach 109 °F (111 °F at Midway) this year? This seems to be the pattern that's playing out in much of the temperate world, after all.\n\nThe trend appears to be too massive to be a result of selective memory—**are Cisaxosian‡ North Americans overdue for such patterns, or is (contrary to the global trend) climate change** ***actually subduing*** **extreme maxima in Central and Eastern North America?**\n\n†Another is that contrary to common debunker's wisdom, global warming is indeed an appropriate term—extreme heat events (at least those breaking absolute records) are generally *far* more common (and often much more intense) than extreme cold events in the present day, by a factor sometimes approaching two orders of magnitude.\n\n‡Huh. May be coining \"Cisaxosia\" as a term meaning \"North America east of the Rockies\". Frankly, there has been a meaningful amount of extreme heat records in peripheral areas of that region (Alberta, Texas/New Mexico, the Arctic), but still...",

I have rains in Cévennes which are not there (or rarely around) when it rains everywhere, we barely have any taste. \n\nWhat can I do to have more reliable forecasts at home? \n\nPs: I'm in the south of France, if that helps you",

      "text": "On East Coasts all over the world you have Monsoon climates (or at least climates where the Summer is wetter than winterr). You have a dry winter as with less/weaker sun the land is colder and therefore the colder air sinks creating high pressure. The wind then blows from the land in the direction of the sea.\n\nIn the Summer this is reversed, the Sun is stronger and there is more of it. As the sun heats the land in the Summer it brings the rain as it is a scientific fact that heat rises. As the air rises it creates low pressure which creates convection currents, thus driving the prevailing wind from the water onto the land and bringing rain.\n\nAll of this makes perfect sense from a physics standpoint, but for some reason this is reversed on West Coasts. In the Mediterranean for example the Summer is dry and the winter is wet. This is despite the sun heating the land in the Summer which should create a low pressure system but this fails to materialise and in fact the opposite happens, so why is this?",

      "text": "Hope this is allowed in this sub since I know it's more so based on meteorology. But I have always been fascinated by meteorology and climatology since I was little. Climate change has intrigued me ever since hearing about sea level rise at a young age and how it impacts so many people. I would like to be a climate scientist or climate data analyst. Currently, I am majoring in a B.A in Geography. For part of my coursework, I will tag on some programming classes and potentially add a statistics minor. Also started taking some GIS classes, which I so far have found to be my favorite classes so far. I thought about doing a Master's in Data Science after my B.A potentially. To become a climatologist or climate data analyst, is this path enough? What would you recommend? Would you add any other coursework or experiences? Thanks!",

I read that before Lake Okeechobee, Florida’s climate was dry and colder. Then about 5-6 thousand years ago, Lake Okeechobee formed and the seasonal rains began, converting the Everglades into a subtropical region.  What I am really curious about is how this change would have impacted other nearby regions.  If Florida suddenly got warmer and moist, what areas would have been impacted by that change?  I’m also curious about the humidity. I know that 80 percent of the water that comes out of the lake and heads south evaporates before it reaches the ocean. Where does all that humidity go? Does it just sit on South Florida? Thanks in advance for any help understanding!",

      "text": "Hi!\n\nJust to preface, I'm sorry this is long. I'm currently entering my junior year of college as an economics major, but thinking about switching out. Throughout my time in college so far, I have taken many environmental classes as electives out of my own interests while doing my Gen Ed's and major requirements. Other than doing tech-related projects as a fallback (kind of as this job market's atrocious), I have also done personal projects using ML for climate modeling (I would like to do more physical geographic based ones) on the side as well that I've enjoyed a lot. I've spent my first 2 years at community college (could be taking an unexpected 3rd year), and I'm supposed to be transferring to a new university this fall. In either scenario of what happens this fall, I have the option to switch to applied math as a major.\n\nHere are some questions I have:\n\n-What are some theoretical mathematical topics/frameworks that are relevant to climate/atmospheric science and physical geography? Examples: modeling the presence of GHG emissions in the atmosphere and the evolution of landforms from environmental degradation.\n\n-What should I look for in a well-structured applied math program? What classes would be relevant to this type of work? My local university houses its applied math major in their college of engineering and partners a lot with other departments, especially in the environmental field. It is structured very differently from their pure math major. At the university I'm supposed to attend this fall, applied math shares the same core as pure math, but electives are different.\n\n-After undergrad, would a masters be worth it? I would prefer to go straight to work, but what roles would allow me to take part in this field? How else should I further prepare?",

MS State does have a 4-5 day in-person research and exam session, that I do not see for Illinois.\n\nI am seeing some mixed thoughts on the programs, whether they hold meaning with employers, meeting the NWS 1340 requirements, etc. From people that have done either the programs, what experiences do you have with the program/courses/instructors, using the degree in post graduate employment, or any other information that you think may be helpful.",

However, of course, the whole Calculus and math sequence is not mandatory for my major. I did take up to Calculus I.   \n\n\nI am sort of using this B.S in Applied Meteorology as a guide: [https://catalog.ufl.edu/UGRD/colleges-schools/UGLAS/MET\\_BS/MET\\_BS01/](https://catalog.ufl.edu/UGRD/colleges-schools/UGLAS/MET_BS/MET_BS01/)  \nFor purposes like grad school or building my skill/set. should I take Calculus and Physics w/ Calc/ prereq classes after or during my B.A in Geography if they are not part of my major? Have those in grad schools for Meteorology have the experience with taking grad school prereqs after their Bachelor's degree?    \n  \nI am leaning towards at least taking Calculus 2 + Physics w/Lab based on this plan. Some have told me their private sector careers focus on GIS and programming rather than all the Calculus. Gives me hope that I can still find a good job with my Geography degree. Though again, I know I have also heard a strong foundation in both Calculus and Statistics is useful too.",

I really like working, interpreting through data, using GIS, a great interest in sea level level rise and climate change, disaster risk (hurricanes, tornadoes, flooding, etc), as well as being part of decision-making for solutions related to climate adaptation (thinking about the bigger picture like applying climate knowledge to protecting infrastructure or those living in coastal areas).  \n  \nWhat are some strong technical skills and useful classes to take that will help me in the future? I have thought about doing a minor in Stats and learning Python + R. In this current state of the world, I know there have/will be many changes that may create new jobs for new purposes or build on existing jobs as tech evolves. I am trying to look towards the future to see what I can do now to be more educated and as prepared/competitive as I can be when I get my degree, even while.  \n  \n I would love to hear anyone who has experience in the mentioned industries too by the way!

      "text": "I'm a 17-year-old high school senior from Ontario Canada who's unsure about what to study in university. Throughout high school, I've kept changing my mind about my future, sometimes I thought I wanted to be a lawyer, a video editor, or a computer scientist. But deep down, I really want to study something related to the environment and climate. I remember back in 7th grade, I read a short piece in a science textbook where a climatologist talked about his job, and that's when I realized that's what I wanted to do. \n\nProblem is since I realized too late in my high-school career what I wanted to pursue, I didn't take any science courses in Grade 11/12 whatsoever, so I'm missing the prerequisites for a lot of environmental university programs. I do not want to spend another year in high school catching up on missing prerequisites (I get bullied pretty bad in my school and I'm absolutely miserable here) so I was looking at environmental university programs that don't require the science prerequisites. I found this program called Geography and Environmental Management (https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-calendar/undergraduate-studies/catalog#/programs/HJ-o11RAin) and the courses I will have to take + the specialization's I can choose are listed on the website. \n\nA month ago, I briefly met someone who graduated with this degree in 2024 by chance. She told me that she now works as an analyst at an energy firm and is a current grad student on the side, while some of her friends who did the same degree are doing fieldwork on wetlands and carbon cycling, and another is in environmental planning. Most of the people she knew ended up in different fields because the degree is so flexible, but many are working in GIS. Honestly, I don’t really know much about what all of these areas mean.\n\nI was wondering if it's possible that I could tailor this degree to eventually lead to climatology related jobs, I'm fine with even getting a masters if that's recommended. I’m not too worried about specific job titles, my goal is simply to work in a field related to climatology.",

I started out my undergrad as a computer science major, but I felt the competition was too much and I wasn’t super passionate about CS specifically. I amassed enough credits to claim a computer science minor and am also about to finish a math minor.\n\nI initially made the switch to earth science because I had an interest in weather/climate, but my school doesn’t offer atmospheric science, nor do any schools very near me. I was told that this major would be a direct pathway to a master’s in atmospheric science or similar graduate studies, which I’m aware would be the ticket to working as a meteorologist for sure. \n\nThe only thing is, I’m already behind in my undergraduate because of switching majors, and graduate school feels so far away and it just feels like a lot. To focus on atmospheric science in my undergrad, I’ll have to take extra math, physics, and engineering courses to supplement the lack of those disciplines in earth science. I’ve taken calc I, II, III, linear algebra, and general physics 1 with a lab so far. I’m also taking GIS and remote sensing courses.\n\nWith all that said, is graduate school a must for me? Or can I really qualify for Meteorology Series 1340 jobs by filling in the gaps in my course work for atmospheric science?\n\nI think I just get discouraged because even though I know I can get there with the path I’m on, it doesn’t feel like I’m really “on” the path unless I’m for sure going to grad school. Just because I feel like my course work is spread so thin, and it seems like someone with a specific degree in meteorology would always have a leg up on me. (I’m guessing)\n\nAt the end of the day, I’m just considering my options. It’s something I kinda really wanna do but I’m just cautious because I’ve already spent so long on a major that I didn’t finish and I don’t wanna repeat that or go through a lot more time, money, and effort unless I’m sure it’s the right decision.",

      "text": "Hi meteorology community, I'm a long time enthusiast of weather and climate, though it was one of those hobbies that I never was passionate enough about to make a career out of. I hope this question isn't too esoteric or challenging to follow, but here goes...\n\nNow, I understand the basic principle that when it snows, the colder the temperature, the higher the \"snow ratio\" is (i.e. the more \"dry\" and fluffy the snow is). However, I notice that temperature alone cannot account for some discrepancies in snowfall I see, particularly between the west and east parts of the US.\n\nIn **Western US cities** (i.e. west of the Rockies), I notice that the snow ratio tends to be **higher** for a given average monthly mean temperature than an **Eastern US city** (i.e. east of the Rockies) with a comparable monthly average temperature. \n\n**To illustrate this:** \n\n[Tahoe City in California](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tahoe_City,_California#Climate) has a January mean temperature of 30.1F, an average water-equiv. precipitation of 6.21 inches, and 37.9 inches of snow. Approx. \"snow to precip\" ratio of 6.1.\n\n[Pittsburgh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh#Geography) in the eastern US has a **lower** Janaury mean temperature of 28.8F, a **higher** water-equiv. precipitation of 2.96 in., and yet has 13.3 inches of snow (snow to precip. ratio of 4.5), **much less snow** than Tahoe City in January.\n\nWhat gives?? I find a similar trend comparing numerous Western US and Eastern US cities with significant snowfall (Salt Lake City vs Boston, Flagstaff vs Chicago, etc...)\n\nMy hypotheses, from my anecdotal observations are: \n\n* West of the Rockies, precipitation days are **colder** than dry days. i.e. a rainy day in California tends to be below the monthly average temp. Thereby increasing the likelihood of frozen precipitation. East of the Rockies, however, precipitation days tend to be **warmer** than dry days, making the chance for frozen precipitation less, even though the average monthly temperature may be the same or lower than the West US city.\n* Maybe I'm not comparing apples to apples here. The Western US cities that get significant snowfall (Flagstaff, Salt Lake City, Lake Tahoe, etc.) are high elevation, while such high elevations don't exist in the eastern US. So maybe elevation plays a role here, rather than just West vs. East? Does orographic lift somehow increase the chance for snowfall?\n\nIf any of these were true, WHY that's the case would be interesting to know. \n\nHope this all makes sense. Would love to hear a good explanation for this.",

      "text": "For those who don't know, the Med. sea sometimes sees warm core systems indistinguishable from tropical systems that form in other basins. \n\nThere are a few good reasons they aren't considered tropical. They don't form in a true \"tropical airmass\" and on the contrary , Med. climates receive much of their rainfall in winter, remaining dry in summer. This not only indicates a different type of airmass, but makes the \"hurricane season\" a bit off from conventional seasons. They also form over cooler water (because the upper atmosphere, not being tropical, is cooler). But I feel this is a weak argument because storms that form in cool water under less than tropical conditions get recognized in the Atlantic. There was an unnamed subtropical storm in January 2023 that formed within a broader low that earlier brought near freezing temperatures to southwest Florida. But it was warm core and so got recognized after the fact (not operationally named though). I am split on whether this is a valid argument or not. I'd like to stop thinking of the tropical monicker and just start thinking of hurricanes as warm core non-frontal convective systems with a closed circulation. But that definition fails with polar lows. However, I would say that a medicane is closer to being a hurricane than it is to a polar low. AFAIK, there is not an official terminology for these systems and \"tropical-like\" is just a (likely?) unofficial term that serves as a compromise between both sides of the debate. \n\nWhat do tou think? Some have reached hurricane force and caused considerable damage. They are also unofficially given ratings on the saffir simpson hurricane wind scale, which is not something you see with extratropical lows.",

What caused this to occur? I have heard one opinion that climate change may have warmed the base state and allowed for a higher SST anomaly on top of what was essentially a \"moderate\" El Nino and that perhaps this is also the reason for the weak La Nina of this year. And that I should look at the newer RONI (relative ONI) index instead. Is this the likely reason?",

I am writing here because I hope to find some geographers who can help me maybe with their knowledge : we are doing a research project for deforestation in ***Amazon Forest*** using DeepLearning models. We got to the point where we wanted to introduce new variables to the model and I decided to try with [INMET](https://portal.inmet.gov.br/dadoshistoricos) data.\n\nAfter a post-processing step we have that for each station present (for some time periods it happens that they did not capture the measurement, so we will have null values) , for each time instances we have a meteorological measurement such as precipitation , wind , temperature etc....\n\nSince we need each pixel to have a value concerning the measurement of interest, I had to use these [interpolation techniques ](https://iri.columbia.edu/~rijaf/CDTUserGuide/html/interpolation_methods.html#CDT_spatial_interpolation_methods)to cope with the problem : in particular I used **Inverse Distance Weighting (IDW)** and **Modified Shepard.**\n\nI simply wanted to ask which of these 6 results can best reflect the natural occurrence of precipitation (and thus best reflect the shapes and patterns of the clouds).\n\n(Above are the original measurements captured by the stations for a specific date \\[the x represent a missing value for that station in that time\\], below there are the 6 interpolation options)\n\nMay I also ask instead how I should go about (same issue) regarding these measurements :\n\n1. Atmospheric Pressure (multiple measures in mB)\n2. Global Radiation (Kj/m²)\n3. Temperature (various measures in °C)\n4. Humidity (various measures in %)\n5.

With so much talk about how this is truly unprecedented, and a once in a thousand year storm, it's hard for me to believe that climate change couldn't just throw those thoughts out the window.  I've heard plenty of talk about climate change making hurricanes more powerful and frequent but can things like shifting ocean currents make certain paths like smack dab into the mountains a more regular thing?

A lot of it is fairly unsurprising - the Sahara is sunny, temperate and tropical climates are pretty cloudy, oceans are a bit cloudier than adjacent continents. However, what strikes me is that coastal areas in the polar regions (Ellesmere Island, Greenland, and coastal Antarctica) have cloud cover levels apparently closer to those of the Mediterranean or Southern US than to those of nearby inland or ocean regions. Does this mean these areas have naturally much clearer skies, and if so how come?",

Anywhere in the United States is great, but I’m specifically looking into the Upstate of SC.\n\nAlso, for a little context, my (f22)dad (m50) was sharing some conspiracy theories with me following Hurricane Helene. One thing he said was, “Think about how many clouds you see now compared to when you were younger. There’s not any cloudless skies like you used to see.” He brought this up to imply the government was behind this factoid, and not that climate change would ever be a factor. I brought up that I personally remember being surprised when I saw a cloudless sky, especially because I loved looking at the clouds as I was driven around. I also believe that there are other factors as to why he might remember seeing more cloudless skies, such as being inside more as an adult.\n\nIf you do know of any archives that have this type of data, please let me know! Also, if there are in fact less cloudless days now, I’d love to see any research that studies why. I have access to JSTOR’s free account that I use regularly, but not any other academic sources anymore. Feel free to drop any paywall-less research sources as well! Thank you!!",

I teach two python courses at my school and they are highly rated by the students.\n\nI am willing to learn new things to make the transition, but I need to keep my current duty. I have thought about DS, MLE, financial/weather risk modeler, and geospatial analyst types of jobs, but I am donot know the job prospect, nature of work, and ease of transition. I am not sure about SDE - I am not confident about myself being qualified as a SDE, although I wrote extensive python codes in my work. I enjoy learning financial investing.",

      "title": "Is this place on Earth truly a \"natural disaster oasis\"? (opinion)",
      "text": "So I've seen plenty of posts online about the safest places geographically from natural disasters in the United States. But what about the safest place in the whole world from natural disasters? \n\nI'd like to present the candidate of **peninsular Malaysia, Singapore, and Borneo**. I feel like this area isn't talked about enough in terms of its safety from natural disasters. \n\n* **Typhoons are extremely rare** due to proximity to the Equator (only [Typhoon Vamei](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tropical_Storm_Vamei) got as close to the Equator as Singapore). This also reduces the chance of extreme rainfall events that occur from typhoons.\n* **Rainfall is more uniform** than Vietnam/Thailand further to the north, reducing the risk of drought.\n* **Far enough from major fault lines** to not be in a major seismic zone. **Shielded from tsunamis** by Sumatra to the west.\n* **Less extreme heat waves** due to proximity to the ITCZ and maritime influence. Despite the hot humid climate year-round, [Singapore has never officially recorded a temperature above 100F](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singapore#Climate), and [Kuala Lumpur's record high is just above 100F](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kuala_Lumpur#Climate).\n* Further proving this area's safety from natural disasters, the rainforests of Borneo and Peninsular Malaysia are the most biodiverse parts of SE Asia (and one of the most biodiverse in the world), as the protection from natural disasters reduces the risk of species die-off. \n* **No place is perfect though**, and I'd say the greatest natural disaster risk to this area is probably **flooding** exacerbated by sea level rise, and [**forest fires** which are triggered by agricultural clearing](https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/images/17434/fires-on-sumatra). Air conditioning use year-round in this region also exacerbates the urban heat island effect, and could contribute to climate change (and therefore sea level rise) if electricity is generated with fossil fuels.\n\nI find it especially remarkable how safe this area is from natural disasters, given the oppressive tropical heat, the geographical proximity to the typhoon infested waters of the West Pacific, and relative proximity to the Ring of Fire. (I also imagine how boring it must be being a weatherman/woman in Singapore or Kuala Lumpur.)\n\nNow, as someone who lives in the US, and within North America, I agree the the US Great Lakes is a great option for avoiding natural disasters, although the cold winters aren't my cup of tea (same with heat and humidity). **Places on the shortlist, for similar reasons to equatorial SE Asia**:\n\n* Windward shores of the Great Lakes, including Detroit, Chicago, Toronto (windward because of less risk of lake-effect snow.)\n* Equatorial Andes (e.g. Bogota, Quito; although earthquakes/volcanic eruptions are a risk)\n* US Pacific Northwest/southern BC (although I'm tempted to disqualify it due to earthquake/tsunami risk, and the [2021 heatwave](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2021_Western_North_America_heat_wave))\n\nAny thoughts on \"natural disaster oases\"? To you, is it worth it to move to a \"natural disaster oasis\"? Would you live in a milder climate even if it meant greater natural disaster risk (e.g. Florida)? Feel free to discuss in the comments, and thanks!",

      "text": "I’m a 19 year old student who plans to transfer from CC to the University of Houston next year. I’ve recently found a pretty big interest in climate and extreme weather and have really focused on wanting my career to be in Meteorology not just because I think things like Tornados and Hurricanes are fascinating but also that I’ve been directly impacted by these things living in the Houston area so being a part of a field that can develop my knowledge and help my community to prepare for and aid after these things is really important to me. Something that is important to me though, is getting plenty of outdoors/ field work. I don’t care if it’s simply conducting some experiments outside and collecting date to full on storm chasing a tornado in Oklahoma with a crew of scientist and getting up close and personal to these fascinating beasts and even aiding local communities in relief / warning. My main question is what are these types of jobs / opportunities called? I’ve been trying to look it up elsewhere and I can’t really find anything. What jobs would get me outdoors and able to see / help with my own eyes and hands? I obviously know that there’s a lot of indoor work in this field and I don’t mind that either, but a job that would get me out would be preferred I just have no idea what they’re called because my knowledge / experience in the field is practically nothing but I really really want to grow and learn because I find it so interesting even with the little that I know. How would I get into these jobs / what are the steps I can take to find out what I like the most / internships that I can take up to gain experience especially in the Houston area / Texas in general\n\nThank you so much for the help it means the world!",

This is where the temperature readings are from (top half of picture). It was a calm and clear afternoon with record high temperatures, but as soon as sunset came the temperature dropped so fast, I have not seen it drop this fast at sunset in forever. No cold front came by (as far as I know looking at weather maps). Do you guys know what would be the reason for this? Additionally, readings from the airport (which is on the escarpment) do not show as dramatic as a decline (picture in bottom half). I dont understand how it could go from 22 --> 9 down here but only 20 --> 18/16 at the airport? Especially cause usually the airport has colder nights then here\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/wt2u8simsqpe1.png?width=852&format=png&auto=webp&s=fec8432d15572c029e037f7d7204280a86ce1340",

For this i need to know how these conditions influence the temperature within the green house. Since i control everything via an Arduino i dont want to use fancy and large models, but rather a small functions with like 10 parameters max. I doesnt need to be very accurate; +- 1 Kelvin would be good i think.\n\n\n\nI have access to:\n\n* outside surface temperature outside the green house\n* humidity\n* elevation angle of the sun\n* cloud coverage\n\n\n\nThe footprint of the green house is roughly 0.6 m²; height roughly 60 cm. Material: 16 mm hollow core panels and ALLTOP ceiling.\n\n\n\nThank you!",

      "text": "Hi everyone. As you can see from my title, I am wondering about the forecast for the hourly temperature forecast for my city, and the changes (or lack thereof).\n\nSimply, the temperature forecast for my city tomorrow is lowest at 4° at 4 am (typical I think), and starts to climb by 5 am and goes up until noon. By noon it reaches 8°. But then it stays at 8° through to 1 pm, 2pm, 3 pm, and all the way until 6 pm, before it goes down to 7° at 7 pm, and then lower into the night and next morning.\n\nMy question is why would the area stop warming? The sun warms the parts of the planet which are facing it, and that's what makes the temperature climb from 4° to 8°, but then after noon somehow the warming effect just turns off. But the sun didn't turn off its power, the sun kept shining like it was doing since 4 am. \n\nYou'd think it would climb to at least a couple more degrees at least, but the sun just stops heating up the area for 6 hours. Can anyone help me understand this please?",

Wanted to ask the community about the reliability of something like this\n\n    with temp_diff as (\n        select \n            date_time,\n            temp,\n            area,\n            lag(temp, 5) over (partition by area order by date_time) as prev_temp\n        from public.temperature_data\n        where area = 'Outdoor'\n            and date(date_time) = '2024-10-31'\n    )\n    select \n        date_time,\n        area,\n        temp,\n        prev_temp,\n        (prev_temp - temp) as temp_drop\n    from temp_diff\n    where prev_temp is not null\n        and (prev_temp - temp) > 1\n\nAnd here's the output for today.  We did have a rain morning today in Houston (77406)\n\n\n\n|date\\_time|area|temp|prev\\_temp|temp\\_drop|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|10/31/2024 7:54|Outdoor|73.6|74.7|1.1|\n|10/31/2024 7:55|Outdoor|73.4|74.5|1.1|",

      "title": "Why do some mountain valleys have huge diurnal temperature changes?",
      "text": "Some mountain valleys in the West like in the Interior regions of California (away from the coast, so no marine layer influence), or in other Western states have diurnal temperatures ranges of over 40 degrees F in the summer. There is a greater difference in winter too, but just not as stark as compared to the summer day to night temperature range. Some of these valleys are in well known Wine Country regions. Here is few examples:\n\n1. Paso Robles, California. Wikipedia lists the average high in Aug of 92 F and low of 53 F\n2. Hayfork, California. Wikipedia lists the average July high of 94 F and low of 49 F.\n3. Heber City, Utah. Wikipedia lists average July high of 90 F and low of 50 F.\n4. Pinnacles National Park, California. Wikipedia lists average July high of 96 F and low of 50 F.\n\nEven during heat waves when day time temperatures exceed 100 F or even 110 F for some of these, the lows are usually in the 60 - 70 F range, sometimes even lower than 60 F (Hayfork, Pinnacles ...). A rather extreme example that drives the point to heart is when Hayfork saw a high of 98 F the same day it saw a low of 38 F (Oct 1, 2024). This was during a consistent heat wave with no cold fronts or precipitation involved.\n\nThis is in stark contrast to locations like Las Vegas or Phoenix that have nights only dropping to 80s and 90s after 100+ degree days in the summer (diurnal range between 25 - 30 F). Higher moisture content doesn't seem to be the issue as these are desert locations. Even Death Valley which is surrounded by tall mountains on all sides doesn't cool off much at night, ,with many nights staying above 90 F during the summer.\n\nWhat causes certain mountain valleys to have such extreme diurnal temperature swings but not in others? If it's the cold air pooling effect at night, why does it only happen in some of these valleys?",

If the parcel is able to rise through this cold air, shouldn't it get through the warm air like butter? Why would warm air stop it from rising?",

Then, the air temp will rise about 1-1.5 degrees over the course of the next 30-60 minutes, then start to cool down again. I do live in a rather elevated area compared to my surroundings, I guess you'd say on top of a hill. Northeast Missouri is the location. I don't know if it's mixing going on as there tends to be a breeze around that time or if it's something else. Any input would be great!!",

In one hour it’s, we will receive 4 inches of snow to just rain and then back to 2 inches of snow. The temperature is set for 35° F and I’ve known it to snow at 35° F in the past and stick. What makes situations different? It’s almost like everyone is uncertain of what’s going to happen until tomorrow morning. It’s kind of like a waiting game more so right now. But also everyone is giving different forecasts and snow predictions. Schools and businesses have taken the precautionary steps to close down for tomorrow out of fear of another “ snowmageddon” that happened in 2014. We’ve been told at times oh, it’s just going to be flurries, and then have 3 inches of snow. But also there’s been times where it has been said, we’re going have snow and we have just rain. Is it because of the terrain in the south?",

Is it like comparing apples to oranges?\n\nExtratropical cyclone (euro wind) have a cold cores, and the stronger winds tend to be closer to the tropopause. \nTropical cyclones have a warm cores and have stronger winds towards the earths surface.\n\nOther than location, temperature, and formation criteria could I compare these two?\nAre the essentially the same thing. What makes one an apple and another an orange as opposed to having a Granny Smith a Fiji apple?",

      "text": "Last year was my first time visiting the United States. I visited it in July and I was in the Washington area. It was immensely hot; I've never felt such heat in my life and at one point I thought I will collapse. This was also reflected in the amount of water that I was able to drink.\n\nThe temperatures were around 40°C, which is not something strange to me. I come from Croatia and temperatures also can reach up to 40°C during summer there, especially on the seaside.\n\nI looked for the humidity as the next culprit and found out that humidity was a bit more than 80%, while on the Croatian seaside humidity was around 70%-something %. I even found humidity in Zagreb, which is not even on the seaside, to be 79% at one point.\n\nTherefore, I am wondering whether a 5-10% increase in relative humidity can really cause such drastic differences in heat perception, or could there be some other factors influencing the hotness I felt?",

I was beach  walking my dog on the Lake Superior shore, the ambient temperature was about 0**°** f with a stiff wind out of the NNE, so the wind is coming off the water.  it has been a warmish winter so the lake is still open.  I am paying attention to how my nose feels because I know my dog will die before she stops running in the sand.  I notice that when the wind blows harder, it feels warmer.\n\nits not too surprising, with the water temperature so much higher than the air temperature, and my spidey sense tells me to expect lake effect snow, but I started wondering is this was a case of positive wind chill, where the temperature perceive by the skin is higher than the ambient temperature?\n\nPretty sure its really a case of \"thermometer reacts to slow to air temperature, but I thought I'd check in with modern science.",

Local cloud forecasts, wind, and really important astronomical seeing, or how turbulent the atmosphere is. Finding that information prepackaged is difficult to find.\n\n100% clouds is a definite nogo unless I happen to be going 1200 meters above sea level on a mountain top and the clouds will all be below me. Those are actually the best nights because the light pollution is damped by the clouds.\n\nBecause finding prepackaged forecasts is a challenge, I thought I might try to learn how to do it myself. What sorts of topics should I research to get a handle on this?\n\nAnd if you are a meteorologist and you have an interest in astronomy as well you can be a rock star at star parties. The one I go to would give you free attendance and meals for the whole 4 night event if you came and gave a 1 hour talk one evening about weather for astronomers. Local astronomy clubs would likely love to hear what you have to say as well.",

      "text": "this has been on my mind since reading the post about apple weather earlier today. there are so many problems i notice when discussing weather with normal folks in my daily life. at work, friends, family, neighbors (i live in the midwest and wx is the #1 small talk topic. it's not small talk to me lol)\n\nspecifically, I'm thinking of topics like\n\n1) \"future radar\" which gets me every time, i want to shake a person and say \"NO! Just no!\" i usually just say \"it's not radar, and it's not a forecast. don't waste your time on it.\" but that's... still kind of rude? right? is there a better way to frame it?\n\n2) model data presented as forecasts - like hourly temp/wind/precip charts, those cursed \"future radar\" apps, apps with \"rain in 30 minutes\" notifications, etc. - model products with no human review or proper initialization. many of them don't even disclose which model runs they're produced from. people treat them like an actual forecast, then complain they're so inaccurate! i have no idea where to even start peeling this onion. \n\n3) basic misunderstanding of basic probability. \"forecast said 20% chance but it rained! it was obviously wrong.\" (or 90% and didn't rain. or it rained in the next town over but not here) i usually go with the bag of marbles example. again, it feels rude to me, because this is grade school math. it really is that simple. \n\n4) \"which forecast app is the best?\" i'm often asked which weather apps i use, and  i give a short answer \"radarscope for actual radar and none for forecasts. get a forecast from an actual forecaster at NWS or a local news station. for warning notifications, get a wx radio.\" again, i think i tend toward rudeness in my frustration with this question. \n\nwhat are your thoughts on all this data being available, packaged, and even marketed, to people who aren't qualified to properly use or interpret it? \n\nshould \"future radar\" and \"forecast\" apps have a big red warning banner at the top that says something like \"NOT A FORECAST. MODEL OUTPUT FOR FORECASTER REVIEW\"? would that change anything about how people use them? \n\nany suggestions for ways to talk about these problems with friends, family, coworkers, etc. in a way that's effective, not over explaining or rude? \n\nany personal stories about statements/questions you've heard from non-weather nerds and what was your response?",

      "text": "[I created an iOS app](https://apps.apple.com/app/apple-store/id6466650127?pt=18415&ct=Reddit&mt=8) for myself called ImageTracker a few hurricane seasons ago. This app lets me create widgets with any live image from the web for my iOS home screen. I made this app so I could keep track of storms approaching my parents' place in Florida. I wanted to always have the latest data at my fingertips without needing to keep visiting bookmarked webpages. I usually have two widgets in a stack on my Home Screen - the GOES satellite image from the east coast, and whatever active hurricane NHC is providing forecasts for. It worked so well that I put it up on the App Store, but it's really hard to find users because it's kind of a quirky niche product (an app which is more widget than app, and requires some user customization). I thought this might be something the community here would be interested in, especially during hurricane season. It's free to use although there's a small nag you can remove if you purchase it. \n\nBelow are some screenshots of it in action next to my other app widget [Weathercaster](https://apps.apple.com/app/apple-store/id6742910513?pt=18415&ct=Reddit&mt=8) showing offshore conditions near the storm.\n\nAlso since it might not be clear here are some instructions on how to use the app and customize it.\n\n* Go to [NHC](http://nhc.noaa.gov) or [GOES](https://www.star.nesdis.noaa.gov/goes/index.php) and find an image you want to track. You'll need the JPEG url of that image which you can copy using a web browser. The image needs to be one which updates periodically such as a satellite image or hurricane forecast and not too large (1000 x 1000 pixels is ideal but it can handle larger). For example [this](https://cdn.star.nesdis.noaa.gov/GOES19/ABI/SECTOR/taw/GEOCOLOR/900x540.jpg) or [this](https://www.nhc.noaa.gov/storm_graphics/AT05/refresh/AL052025_5day_cone_with_line_and_wind+png/191453_5day_cone_with_line_and_wind.png).\n* [Download the app](https://apps.apple.com/app/apple-store/id6466650127?pt=18415&ct=Reddit&mt=8) \n* Launch the app once (sometimes required for iOS to register that it has a widget).\n* Tap and hold on your Home Screen until things jiggle, press edit, and add a widget. Add ImageTracker widget.\n* Tap and hold the widget to edit its image URL. Paste in one of the URLs from the top bullet point.\n* The widgets will update every 30 minutes or so, and you can tap them to see the lates image in-app.\n\nLet me know if this works for you and if you think this is as cool and useful as I do!\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ohc533yxpzjf1.png?width=1206&format=png&auto=webp&s=2da2fc175b723c931c9b5b6139ca4a297ebc800c\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/jeafbrrypzjf1.png?width=1206&format=png&auto=webp&s=a084bd03d1c35854ea4e9f330e53a26cf5aedb25",

I've asked him to consider with the evidence of his own eyes that this is not happening but he's convinced he's developed health problems because of it and everyone else is lying. Sigh. He has agreed that if I am able to find up to date datasets and measurements of surface level UV including UVC demonstrating that UVC is not reaching the earth's surface he would drop it. Can you help me find anything like this? TIA!",

It'll say sunrise is at 6:15am, but I'll start seeing the sun coming up and a little bit of light coming it at around 5:20-5:40am. \n\nWhy is it always wrong? is sunrise not considered the very second the sun starts coming up? Is it perhaps only counting the peak, most visible times of sunrise and sunset?\n\nI've never once seen a correct time.",

I'm all on board if he's helping explain outcomes in layman's terms to people that may be in the path. I guess I just feel a little crazy that NOAA isn't providing concrete answers for this next storm and he seems to have all my friends on edge that we're getting a CAT-4 in my area this week. \n\nI guess I'm asking, is he leading people on prematurely, or are all the people I know putting too much stock into something he's not promising?",

Milton is currently forecast to reach hurricane strength on Monday morning and be very close to major hurricane intensity when it makes landfall over western Florida on Wednesday.\n\nMilton is expected to bring life-threatening and potentially devastating impacts to large portions of the state of Florida on Wednesday before crossing over into the Atlantic. These impacts include very heavy rainfall, destructive winds, and life-threatening storm surge.\n\n**START.**    \n**PREPARING.**    \n**NOW.**    \n\nAs always, the [**National Hurricane Center**](https://www.nhc.noaa.gov/#Milton) is the primary source of information regarding this system as it develops.

Development of this system is expected, and a tropical depression or storm is likely to form later today or on Sunday while it moves slowly eastward over the southwestern Gulf of Mexico.  By early next week, the system is forecast to move faster eastward or northeastward across the central and eastern Gulf of Mexico where additional strengthening is likely.  Interests on the Yucatan peninsula of Mexico, the  Florida Peninsula, the Florida Keys, and the northwestern Bahamas should monitor the progress of this system. Regardless of development, locally heavy rains could occur over portions of Mexico during the next day or two, and over much of Florida late this weekend through the middle of next week.\n        \n\n# Official information\n- -

Environmental conditions are conducive for development, and a tropical depression is likely to form within the next couple of days while the system moves slowly westward into the western Caribbean Sea.  \n\n> Afterward, further development is likely while the disturbance meanders over the western Caribbean Sea through the weekend.  The system is expected to turn slowly northwestward by early next week. Interests across the western and northwestern Caribbean Sea should monitor the progress of this system.  \n\n> Regardless of development, heavy rains are expected over Jamaica during the next day or so. For more information on this system, including gale warnings, see High Seas Forecasts issued by the National Weather Service.

      "text": "# Welcome!\n\nHello and welcome back to r/TropicalWeather!  We look forward to tracking tropical cyclones with you again this season and hope that everyone stays safe.\n\n# A look back to 2024\n\nThe 2024 season was peculiar.  Several environmental conditions had lined up to prime the season to be extremely active, including anomalously warm sea-surface temperatures across the basin and a weakening El Niño phase. However, the season experienced a slow start and an unusual lull during what should have been its climatological peak.\n\nWhy?\n\nThe slow start to the season was due, in part, to the presence of a large and stationary heat dome over the Gulf of Mexico and the Caribbean Sea, where tropical cyclones most frequently form during the month of June.\n\nThe lull in the middle of the season was caused by the alignment of several factors:\n\n* A strong Saharan air layer was present over the eastern Atlantic during the month of July.  The hot, dry, dust-laden air prevents African easterly waves from generating deep enough convection to begin the process of tropical cyclone development once they emerge off the coast of Africa.\n\n* During the months of August and early September, the monsoon trough over Africa had become displaced in such a way that African easterly waves departing the Ethiopian highlands emerged off the western coast of Africa at an unfavorably northern latitude, where vertical wind shear is much higher and prevents tropical cyclone development.\n\n* Across the Atlantic, temperatures in the upper troposphere were warmer than average.  This caused a lower vertical temperature gradient between the upper troposphere and the surface, creating a more stable environment over the Atlantic basin and suppressing the development of deep convection.\n\n* The Madden-Julian Oscillation (MJO) was observed to be in phases that were less favorable for the development of deep convection and tropical cyclone development over the Atlantic Ocean during the peak of the season.\n\n* Stronger than normal wind shear over the eastern Atlantic during the peak of the season inhibited the vertical development of convection, preventing tropical cyclone development until tropical waves reached the Caribbean Sea and Gulf of Mexico.\n\nOnce these factors waned, activity ramped up very quickly, resulting in an active September and October.  In all, the season was above average, with eighteen named storms, eleven of which became hurricanes and five of which became major hurricanes. Of the eighteen storms, twelve made landfall.  Some storms were particularly destructive, including Beryl, Helene, and Milton, which were retired by the World Meteorological Organization's Hurricane Committee following the conclusion of the season.\n\n# What is expected for 2025?\n\n[Several agencies and organizations](https://www.reddit.com/r/TropicalWeather/comments/1k07y62/2025_atlantic_season_forecast_rollup/) have projected another above normal season, due in part to a neutral ENSO phase and anomalously warm sea-surface temperatures.\n\nNOAA's Climate Prediction Center issued its [official forecast](https://www.noaa.gov/news-release/noaa-predicts-above-normal-2025-atlantic-hurricane-season) on 25 May, which calls for 13 to 19 named storms, 6 to 10 hurricanes, and 3 to 5 major hurricanes.\n\n# A reminder of our rules\n\nAs the season gets underway, we'd like to give you a brief reminder of our rules. For the sake of brevity, we invite you to read them in [our wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/TropicalWeather/wiki/rules). Some highlights: \n\n* **Please leave tracking threads to us.**  The moderation staff uses a template which consolidates information from various sources into one centralized location. If a significant cyclone threatens landfall over the U.S. coastline, we will begin posting daily meteorological tracking threads, along with preparation discussions.\n\n* **Please do not post model data or graphics for greater than 120 hours (5 days) in the future.** The accuracy of model guidance begins to decrease steadily after three days and rapidly after five. After that point, model data becomes speculative at best.\n\n* **Do not excessively speculate or intentionally mislead**. Many people come to our subreddit looking for the most accurate and timely information regarding weather which threatens their neck of the woods. Please defer to official sources or experts when discussing observed and forecast conditions.\n\n* **A slight change has been made to our no-politics rule** based on real-life developments over the past several months.  Political discussion related to the impacts of tropical cyclones is now allowed; however, political comments which also break any of the *other* subreddit rules will be removed and potentially subject to harsher penalties.\n\n* **A change to our banned sources list has also been made.** Content from AccuWeather is not allowed on this subreddit in any form.  Additionally, content from X—formerly known as Twitter—is discouraged. Content from X will only be allowed if the information provided cannot be sourced elsewhere.\n\n# Discord\n\nThis is a reminder that we have an active [**Discord server**](https://discord.gg/tropicalweather)! A link to our server is also featured in the sidebar on all three desktop versions of the subreddit.\n\n# Bluesky\n\nThis is another reminder that the subreddit now has a [**Bluesky account.**](https://bsky.app/profile/tropwx.bsky.social) We will be using this account to keep people updated on the content of the subreddit another tropical weather-related developments.\n\n# Verified user flair\n\nWe have special user flair for degreed meteorologists, atmospheric scientists, and emergency management personnel! If you would like this flair to be applied to your username, please [**contact us**](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FTropicalWeather)!",

This system could become a tropical depression at any time, but the latest satellite-derived wind data indicate that the system does not have a well-defined circulation center. The system is expected to move into a less conducive environment later today through Saturday, but could reach a slightly more favorable environment again late this weekend into early next week as it moves westward at 10 to 15 mph over the central tropical Atlantic and approaches the Lesser Antilles.*\n\n**Español:** *Aguaceros y tormentas eléctricas asociadas con una onda tropical ubicada a unas mil millas al oeste-suroeste de las Islas de Cabo Verde permanecen bien organizadas. Este sistema podría convertirse en una depresión tropical en cualquier momento, pero los últimos datos del viento derivados de satélite indican que el sistema no tiene un centro de circulación bien definido. Se espera que el sistema se mueva a un ambiente menos propicio a última hora de hoy hasta el sábado, pero podría alcanzar un ambiente ligeramente más favorable nuevamente a última hora de este fin de semana hasta principios de la próxima semana a medida que se mueve hacia el oeste a 10 a 15 mph sobre el Atlántico tropical central y se acerca a las Antillas Menores.*\n\n# Official information\n- -

      "text": "I'm an amateur weather watcher and don't go around making predictions and having strong opinions. I listen to the experts. And this whole poop show has gotten massively politicized. All I know is I saw them projecting a cat 1 hitting Atlanta and was shocked and said that is not normal and knew we were in for something dreadful. My sister is an hour outside the city and feared she was going to be slammed. She never lost power and got off so lucky. But elsewhere... \n\nI remember people talking here before the hit about not just paying attention to windspeed but total size of the storm and energy content. Sandy was invoked. I've been through tropical storms but that does nothing to inform you about what the results of a Sandy would be. \n\nSo my question is did anything surprise the meteorologists? We're the proper warnings issued and the affected areas just not have the means to do much mitigation? My thinking is the Mets had it right but the local authorities might not have appreciated what they were told because they're so far inland and what happens is, I think, fair to call unprecedented.",

      "text": "# Active cyclones\n- - - \n**Last updated:** Friday, 8 August — 22:55 UTC\n\n## Western Pacific\n\n* [**16W: Podul**](https://www.reddit.com/r/TropicalWeather/comments/1mkj1gz/podul_16w_western_pacific_philippine_sea/) — Satellite imagery analysis indicates that Podul is gradually become better organized as it continues westward across the Philippine Sea on Saturday morning. Environmental conditions are likely to support development over the next few days.  Rapid intensification is unlikely with dry air and stronger shear to the north of the storm.  Podul is forecast to become a typhoon by Sunday afternoon and continue to gradually strengthen as it nears Japan's Yaeyama Islands and northern Taiwan.\n\n## Eastern Pacific\n\n* [**08E: Henriette**](https://www.reddit.com/r/TropicalWeather/comments/1mkixsi/henriette_08e_eastern_pacific_east_of_hawaii/) — Henriette degenerated into a remnant low several hundred kilometers east of Hawaii on Friday morning as it struggled against dry air and unfavorably cool waters. Environmental conditions are forecast to improve as Henriette approaches Hawaii later tonight and the storm could completely regenerate by Saturday afternoon.  The storm is likely to remain well to the northeast of Hawaii over the weekend and will gradually strengthen as it passes north of the islands early next week.\n\n* [**09E: Ivo**](https://www.reddit.com/r/TropicalWeather/comments/1mjr4y0/ivo_09e_eastern_pacific_south_of_mexico/) — Ivo is close to reaching its expected peak intensity as it passes south of the Baja California Peninsula on Friday morning.  Environmental conditions are likely to remain favorable enough that Ivo could approach hurricane intensity this evening.  However, an increasingly stable and dry environment west of the peninsula awaits Ivo later in the weekend.  Ivo is likely to degenerate into a remnant low by Sunday and dissipate altogether by Monday.\n\n&nbsp;    \n\n# Active disturbances\n- - - \n\n## Northern Atlantic\n\n* [**96L: Invest**](https://www.reddit.com/r/TropicalWeather/comments/1mjs2j1/96l_invest_northern_atlantic_central_tropical/) — A tropical wave over the central tropical Atlantic continues to produce sporadic convection this evening.  Dry air surrounding the disturbance is likely to inhibit development for the next couple of days; however, environmental conditions may improve over the weekend, allowing the disturbance the opportunity to become a tropical cyclone as it continues northwestward across the Atlantic.  A tropical depression could form as early as Tuesday or Wednesday.\n\n\n&nbsp;    \n\n# Post-tropical cyclones\n- - - \nPost-tropical cyclones will be listed here if they are still being tracked via the Automated Tropical Cyclone Forecast (ATCF) system.  Placement in this section does not imply that these systems have any potential to redevelop into tropical cyclones.\n\n## Southwestern Indian\n\n* [**02S: Awo**](https://www.reddit.com/r/TropicalWeather/comments/1mkint6/awo_02s_southwestern_indian_near_the_seychelles/) — The remnants of Cyclone Awo are producing disorganized showers and thunderstorms as they drift westward toward the Seychelles. Strong northeasterly shear, combined with pervasive dry air and cooler sea-surface temperatures should prevent Awo from regenerating as it drifts northwestward over the weekend.\n\n\n&nbsp;    \n\n# Potential formation areas\n- - - \nPotential formation areas are areas that are being monitored for potential tropical cyclone formation within the next two weeks.  These systems have either not yet formed or have formed but have not yet been designated as an investigation area (invest).  A discussion will be created for these systems once they become invests.\n\n## Northern Atlantic\n\n* [**Area of interest #1**](https://www.reddit.com/r/TropicalWeather/comments/1mho9y5/the_nhc_is_monitoring_an_area_of_potential/) — A weak area of low pressure off the southeastern coast of the United States is producing disorganized showers and thunderstorms this evening.  Further development of this system will be limited by strengthening shear associated with an approaching deep-layer trough. The disturbance is likely to merge with a frontal boundary over the weekend.\n\n\n&nbsp;    \n# Satellite imagery\n- - - \n\nBasin | Visible | Infrared | Water vapor\n:-|:-:|:-:|:-:\n**Western Pacific**   | [Visible](https://col.st/2U3rR) | [Infrared](https://col.st/r8tAV) | [Water vapor](https://col.st/cEzo3)\n**Eastern Pacific**   | [Visible](https://col.st/R9eJh) | [Infrared](https://col.st/dREmL) | [Water vapor](https://col.st/Z7eHu)\n**Central Pacific**   | [Visible](https://col.st/fo5Eh) | [Infrared](https://col.st/VXvQF) | [Water vapor](https://col.st/o0wtl)\n**Northern Atlantic** | [Visible](https://col.st/8Z8Kv) | [Infrared](https://col.st/CVdts) | [Water vapor](https://col.st/ooTC7)\n**Northern Indian**   | [Visible](https://col.st/Mzbru) | [Infrared](https://col.st/OzMmB) | [Water vapor](https://col.st/66l4w)\n\n# Model guidance\n- - - \n\nBasin | GFS | ECMWF | EC-AIFS | ICON\n:-|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:\n**Western Pacific**   | [GFS](https://www.tropicaltidbits.com/analysis/models/?model=gfs&region=wpac&pkg=mslp_pcpn_frzn) | [ECMWF](https://www.tropicaltidbits.com/analysis/models/?model=ecmwf&region=wpac&pkg=mslp_pcpn_frzn) | [EC-AIFS](https://www.tropicaltidbits.com/analysis/models/?model=ec-aifs&region=wpac&pkg=mslp_pcpn_frzn) | [ICON](https://www.tropicaltidbits.com/analysis/models/?model=icon&region=wpac&pkg=mslp_pcpn_frzn)\n**Eastern Pacific**   | [GFS](https://www.tropicaltidbits.com/analysis/models/?model=gfs&region=epac&pkg=mslp_pcpn_frzn) | [ECMWF](https://www.tropicaltidbits.com/analysis/models/?model=ecmwf&region=epac&pkg=mslp_pcpn_frzn) | [EC-AIFS](https://www.tropicaltidbits.com/analysis/models/?model=ec-aifs&region=epac&pkg=mslp_pcpn_frzn) | [ICON](https://www.tropicaltidbits.com/analysis/models/?model=icon&region=epac&pkg=mslp_pcpn_frzn)\n**Central Pacific**   | [GFS](https://www.tropicaltidbits.com/analysis/models/?model=gfs&region=cpac&pkg=mslp_pcpn_frzn) | [ECMWF](https://www.tropicaltidbits.com/analysis/models/?model=ecmwf&region=cpac&pkg=mslp_pcpn_frzn) | [EC-AIFS](https://www.tropicaltidbits.com/analysis/models/?model=ec-aifs&region=cpac&pkg=mslp_pcpn_frzn) | [ICON](https://www.tropicaltidbits.com/analysis/models/?model=icon&region=cpac&pkg=mslp_pcpn_frzn)\n**Northern Atlantic** | [GFS](https://www.tropicaltidbits.com/analysis/models/?model=gfs&region=atl&pkg=mslp_pcpn_frzn) | [ECMWF](https://www.tropicaltidbits.com/analysis/models/?model=ecmwf&region=atl&pkg=mslp_pcpn_frzn) | [EC-AIFS](https://www.tropicaltidbits.com/analysis/models/?model=ec-aifs&region=atl&pkg=mslp_pcpn_frzn) | [ICON](https://www.tropicaltidbits.com/analysis/models/?model=icon&region=atl&pkg=mslp_pcpn_frzn)\n**Northern Indian**   | [GFS](https://www.tropicaltidbits.com/analysis/models/?model=gfs&region=india&pkg=mslp_pcpn_frzn) | [ECMWF](https://www.tropicaltidbits.com/analysis/models/?model=ecmwf&region=india&pkg=mslp_pcpn_frz) | [EC-AIFS](https://www.tropicaltidbits.com/analysis/models/?model=ec-aifs&region=india&pkg=mslp_pcpn_frz) | [ICON](https://www.tropicaltidbits.com/analysis/models/?model=icon&region=india&pkg=mslp_pcpn_frz)\n\n\n\n\n# Information sources\n- - - \n\n## Regional Specialized Meteorological Centers (RSMC)\n\n* [**National Hurricane Center** (United States)](https://www.nhc.noaa.gov/)\n* [**Japan Meteorological Agency**](https://www.jma.go.jp/bosai/map.html)\n* [**India Meteorological Department**](https://rsmcnewdelhi.imd.gov.in/)\n\n## Other sources\n\n* [**Joint Typhoon Warning Center** (United States)](https://www.metoc.navy.mil/jtwc/jtwc.html)\n\n# Global outlooks\n\n## Climate Prediction Center\n\n* [**Global Tropics Hazards Outlook**](https://www.cpc.ncep.noaa.gov/products/precip/CWlink/ghazards/index.php)",

The storm could restrengthen over the next 24 to 48 hours as shear weakens and sea-surface temperatures remain warm.  As Erin turns northward over the next couple of days, its wind field will expand greatly, bringing tropical storm conditions to the Outer Banks of North Carolina later this week.  In addition to winds, the storm is likely to bring life-threatening surf and rip currents to much of the Bahamas, the eastern coast of the United States, Bermuda, and Atlantic Canada over the next several days.\n\n## Western Pacific\n\n* [**18W: Eighteen**](https://www.reddit.com/r/TropicalWeather/comments/1musc0k/18w_western_pacific_east_china_sea/) — An area of low pressure consolidated into a tropical depression as it moved across Okinawa on Monday.  The depression is struggling to stay organized as it faces an onslaught of dry air from the south.  Warm sea-surface temperatures and strong upper-level divergence from a cyclone aloft should help maintain the depression's strength as it approaches Japan over the next couple of days, but significant intensification is not expected before this system nears the Korea Strait on Saturday.\n\n\n&nbsp;    \n\n# Active disturbances\n- - - \n## Northern Atlantic\n\n* [**99L: Invest**](https://www.reddit.com/r/TropicalWeather/comments/1mucx46/99l_invest_northern_atlantic_eastern_tropical/) — A tropical wave situated just south of Cabo Verde continues to produce disorganized showers and thunderstorms, but is slowly becoming better organized.  As the disturbance continues westward away from Cabo Verde later this week, environmental conditions may support gradual, but limited development.  \n\n* [**Disturbance #1**](https://www.reddit.com/r/TropicalWeather/comments/1msbl9r/the_nhc_is_monitoring_an_area_of_potential/) — A tropical wave situated over the central tropical Atlantic continues to produce disorganized showers and thunderstorms.  As the disturbance continues westward to west-northwestward toward the Lesser Antilles, environmental conditions are likely to support gradual development and a tropical depression could form by the end of the week or over the upcoming weekend.\n\n## Western Pacific\n\n* [**90W: Invest**](https://www.reddit.com/r/TropicalWeather/comments/1mtgkn7/90w_invest_western_pacific_philippine_sea/) — A broad area of low pressure situated north of Palau continues to produce disorganized showers and thunderstorms.  Although sea-surface temperatures remain very warm over the Philippine Sea and vertical wind shear remains weak, upper-level divergence is also weak and may limit the disturbance's ability to sustain deep convection as it moves west-northwestward toward the Philippines. The disturbance has a medium chance of developing into a tropical cyclone by early next week.\n\n&nbsp;    \n\n# Post-tropical cyclones\n- - - \nPost-tropical cyclones will be listed here if they are still being tracked via the Automated Tropical Cyclone Forecast (ATCF) system.  Placement in this section does not imply that these systems have any potential to redevelop into tropical cyclones.\n\n* [**17W: Seventeen**](https://www.reddit.com/r/TropicalWeather/comments/1mtfyxc/17w_western_pacific_south_china_sea/) — Tropical Depression Seventeen made landfall over the Red River Delta in northeastern Vietnam on Monday very shortly after developing.  Since then, the depression has been slowly winding down as it brings heavy rain to northern Vietnam and southern China.

      "text": "# Active cyclones\n- - - \n**Last updated:** Sunday, 3 August — 00:20 UTC\n\n## Western Pacific\n\n* [**12W: Krosa**](https://www.reddit.com/r/TropicalWeather/comments/1ma9vn4/krosa_12w_western_pacific_southeast_of_japan/) — Although Krosa has maintained strength through the morning, satellite imagery shows that strengthening vertical wind shear, unfavorably cool sea-surface temperatures, and dry air entrainment have had a significant impact on its convective structure.  A combination of rapidly deteriorating environmental conditions and interaction with an approaching baroclinic zone will cause Krosa to quickly undergo extratropical transition as it races eastward away from Japan over the next few days.\n\n* [**13W: Thirteen**](https://www.reddit.com/r/TropicalWeather/comments/1mfggpe/13w_western_pacific_south_of_japan/) — A tropical storm situated southeast of mainland Japan and north of the Bonin Islands is slowly consolidating this morning, but is struggling to stay vertically aligned.  Environmental conditions remain marginally supportive of further development, with dry air to the west of the storm being a significant limiting factor. As the storm moves northeastward over the next few days, environmental conditions will become increasingly hostile and the storm will transition into an extratropical cyclone early in the upcoming week.\n\n## Eastern Pacific\n\n* [**07E: Gil**](https://www.reddit.com/r/TropicalWeather/comments/1mdwcek/gil_07e_eastern_pacific_southwest_of_mexico/) — Gil is gradually becoming less organized as it moves over progressively cooler waters well to the west of the Baja California Peninsula.  A combination of cooler waters and a drier, more stable environment, will cause Gil's convective structure to become shallower and shallower until it eventually degenerates into a remnant low on Sunday afternoon. What remains of Gil may inject some tropical moisture into the trade wind flow, providing the Hawaiian Islands with some rainfall midway through the upcoming week.  How much rainfall the islands get will depend heavily on how close Gil's remnants approach the islands as they pass to the north.\n\n\n# Active disturbances\n- - - \n**Last updated:** Thursday, 31 July — 20:00 UTC\n\n## Eastern Pacific\n\n* [**90E: Invest**](https://www.reddit.com/r/TropicalWeather/comments/1mg29r3/90e_invest_eastern_pacific_southwest_of_mexico/) — An area of low pressure situated far off the southwestern coast of the United States continues to produce disorganized showers and thunderstorms this evening.  Environmental conditions remain supportive of further development and a tropical depression could form later this weekend or by Monday.  Model guidance suggests that this system will take a more westward track than Gil did, allowing it to avoid cooler waters and survive long enough to potentially threaten the Hawaiian Islands later in the upcoming week. For now, the GEFS and ECENS ensembles show Invest 90E passing closely to the north of the islands by the end of the week.\n\n## Northern Atlantic\n\n* [**95L: Invest**](https://www.reddit.com/r/TropicalWeather/comments/1mgbxrg/95l_invest_northern_atlantic_off_the_us_east_coast/) (Off the U.S. East Coast) — A non-tropical area of low pressure off the eastern coast of the United States remains attached to a frontal boundary and is producing a broad area of showers and thunderstorms.  Environmental conditions appear to be somewhat supportive of further development and should this system detach from the front, it could acquire tropical or subtropical characteristics later this weekend.  The window of time available for this system to develop remains small, as environmental conditions are likely to become increasingly unfavorable from Monday onward.\n\n## Western Pacific\n\n* **95W: Invest** (no discussion yet) — An area of low pressure has detached from a shear line over the central Western Pacific, several hundred kilometers north of Wake Island.  Environmental conditions are only marginally supportive of development, with warm sea-surface temperatures and upper-level divergence offsetting strong vertical wind shear.  This system could very briefly become a tropical depression within the next day or so before environmental conditions quickly become less supportive.\n\n## Southeastern Indian\n\n* **90S: Invest** (no discussion yet) — A broad area of low pressure situated off the coast of Sumatra is producing a large area of disorganized showers and thunderstorms.  Environmental conditions are marginally supportive of further development, with strong shear being a significant limiting factor. Still, model guidance insists there is some potential for this low to consolidate as it continues south-southwestward over the next few days and a tropical depression could form early in the upcoming week.\n\n# Post-tropical cyclones\n- - - \nPost-tropical cyclones will be listed here if they are still being tracked via the Automated Tropical Cyclone Forecast (ATCF) system.  Placement in this section does not imply that these systems have any potential to redevelop into tropical cyclones.\n\n## Western Pacific\n\n* [**11W: Co-May**](https://www.reddit.com/r/TropicalWeather/comments/1ma9k72/comay_11w_western_pacific_east_china_sea/) — What remains of Co-May's low-level circulation has exited eastern China and has emerged over the Yellow Sea, where some convection has flared up.  As the remnants of Co-May continue northeastward over the next day or so, any potential redevelopment will be hampered by strengthening shear, dry mid-level air, and interaction with the Korean Peninsula.\n\n## Central Pacific\n\n* [**01C: Iona**](https://www.reddit.com/r/TropicalWeather/comments/1mebs6y/iona_01c_central_pacific_southwest_of_hawaii/) — Iona degenerated into an open trough after crossing the International Date Line on Friday.  What remains of Iona is drifting west-northwestward toward an increasingly hostile environment associated with a tropical upper-tropospheric trough and is unlikely to regenerate.\n\n# Potential formation areas\n- - - \nPotential formation areas are areas that are being monitored for potential tropical cyclone formation within the next two weeks.  These systems have either not yet formed or have formed but have not yet been designated as an investigation area (invest).  A discussion will be created for these systems once they become invests.\n\n## Eastern Pacific\n\n* **Area of interest #1** (Southwest of Mexico) (no discussion yet) — An area of low pressure is expected to develop offshore to the west of Central America by the middle of the upcoming week.  Environmental conditions appear to remain supportive of development and a tropical depression could form later in the week as it moves northwestward, remaining well offshore to the southwest of Mexico.\n\n## Northern Atlantic\n\n* [**Area of interest #1**](https://www.reddit.com/r/TropicalWeather/comments/1mg4lou/the_nhc_is_monitoring_an_area_of_potential/) (Central Tropical Atlantic) — A tropical wave is likely to emerge off the western coast of Africa over the next couple of days.  Despite widespread dry air across the Atlantic, environmental conditions could otherwise be supportive of gradual development as the wave pushes westward to west-northwestward across the ocean.  The potential for this system to become a tropical cyclone within the next seven days remains low.\n\n\n# Satellite imagery\n- - - \n\nBasin | Visible | Infrared | Water vapor\n:-|:-:|:-:|:-:\n**Western Pacific**   | [Visible](https://col.st/2U3rR) | [Infrared](https://col.st/r8tAV) | [Water vapor](https://col.st/cEzo3)\n**Eastern Pacific**   | [Visible](https://col.st/R9eJh) | [Infrared](https://col.st/dREmL) | [Water vapor](https://col.st/Z7eHu)\n**Central Pacific**   | [Visible](https://col.st/fo5Eh) | [Infrared](https://col.st/VXvQF) | [Water vapor](https://col.st/o0wtl)\n**Northern Atlantic** | [Visible](https://col.st/8Z8Kv) | [Infrared](https://col.st/CVdts) | [Water vapor](https://col.st/ooTC7)\n**Northern Indian**   | [Visible](https://col.st/Mzbru) | [Infrared](https://col.st/OzMmB) | [Water vapor](https://col.st/66l4w)\n\n# Model guidance\n- - - \n\nBasin | GFS | ECMWF | EC-AIFS | ICON\n:-|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:\n**Western Pacific**   | [GFS](https://www.tropicaltidbits.com/analysis/models/?model=gfs&region=wpac&pkg=mslp_pcpn_frzn) | [ECMWF](https://www.tropicaltidbits.com/analysis/models/?model=ecmwf&region=wpac&pkg=mslp_pcpn_frzn) | [EC-AIFS](https://www.tropicaltidbits.com/analysis/models/?model=ec-aifs&region=wpac&pkg=mslp_pcpn_frzn) | [ICON](https://www.tropicaltidbits.com/analysis/models/?model=icon&region=wpac&pkg=mslp_pcpn_frzn)\n**Eastern Pacific**   | [GFS](https://www.tropicaltidbits.com/analysis/models/?model=gfs&region=epac&pkg=mslp_pcpn_frzn) | [ECMWF](https://www.tropicaltidbits.com/analysis/models/?model=ecmwf&region=epac&pkg=mslp_pcpn_frzn) | [EC-AIFS](https://www.tropicaltidbits.com/analysis/models/?model=ec-aifs&region=epac&pkg=mslp_pcpn_frzn) | [ICON](https://www.tropicaltidbits.com/analysis/models/?model=icon&region=epac&pkg=mslp_pcpn_frzn)\n**Central Pacific**   | [GFS](https://www.tropicaltidbits.com/analysis/models/?model=gfs&region=cpac&pkg=mslp_pcpn_frzn) | [ECMWF](https://www.tropicaltidbits.com/analysis/models/?model=ecmwf&region=cpac&pkg=mslp_pcpn_frzn) | [EC-AIFS](https://www.tropicaltidbits.com/analysis/models/?model=ec-aifs&region=cpac&pkg=mslp_pcpn_frzn) | [ICON](https://www.tropicaltidbits.com/analysis/models/?model=icon&region=cpac&pkg=mslp_pcpn_frzn)\n**Northern Atlantic** | [GFS](https://www.tropicaltidbits.com/analysis/models/?model=gfs&region=atl&pkg=mslp_pcpn_frzn) | [ECMWF](https://www.tropicaltidbits.com/analysis/models/?model=ecmwf&region=atl&pkg=mslp_pcpn_frzn) | [EC-AIFS](https://www.tropicaltidbits.com/analysis/models/?model=ec-aifs&region=atl&pkg=mslp_pcpn_frzn) | [ICON](https://www.tropicaltidbits.com/analysis/models/?model=icon&region=atl&pkg=mslp_pcpn_frzn)\n**Northern Indian**   | [GFS](https://www.tropicaltidbits.com/analysis/models/?model=gfs&region=india&pkg=mslp_pcpn_frzn) | [ECMWF](https://www.tropicaltidbits.com/analysis/models/?model=ecmwf&region=india&pkg=mslp_pcpn_frz) | [EC-AIFS](https://www.tropicaltidbits.com/analysis/models/?model=ec-aifs&region=india&pkg=mslp_pcpn_frz) | [ICON](https://www.tropicaltidbits.com/analysis/models/?model=icon&region=india&pkg=mslp_pcpn_frz)\n\n\n\n\n# Information sources\n- - - \n\n## Regional Specialized Meteorological Centers (RSMC)\n\n* [**National Hurricane Center** (United States)](https://www.nhc.noaa.gov/)\n* [**Japan Meteorological Agency**](https://www.jma.go.jp/bosai/map.html)\n* [**India Meteorological Department**](https://rsmcnewdelhi.imd.gov.in/)\n\n## Other sources\n\n* [**Joint Typhoon Warning Center** (United States)](https://www.metoc.navy.mil/jtwc/jtwc.html)\n\n# Global outlooks\n\n## Climate Prediction Center\n\n* [**Global Tropics Hazards Outlook**](https://www.cpc.ncep.noaa.gov/products/precip/CWlink/ghazards/index.php)",

Upper-level convergence and dry air have kept the depression from restrengthening.  A shift in mid-level wind flow will steer Co-May back over the East China Sea, where improving conditions will allow it to restrengthen as it nears eastern China.\n\n\n* [**12W: Krosa**](https://www.reddit.com/r/TropicalWeather/comments/1ma9vn4/krosa_12w_western_pacific_southeast_of_japan/) — Krosa has shaken off the effects of dry air entrainment and is becoming better organized as it passes to the east of Japan's Volcano Islands.  Environmental conditions are expected to improve and the storm could reach hurricane-equivalent strength over the next 12 to 24 hours.  This intensification will be brief as northerly shear is expected to strengthen on Monda, but another round of intensification is possible later in the upcoming week.\n\n\n# Active disturbances\n- - - \n**Last updated:** Saturday, 26 July — 00:52 UTC\n\n## Central Pacific\n\n* [**Disturbance #1** (Invest 90C)](https://www.reddit.com/r/TropicalWeather/comments/1m9oz25/90c_invest_central_pacific_southeast_of_hawaii/) — An area of low pressure situated several hundred kilometers east-southeast of Hawaii is becoming increasingly organized and is likely to become a tropical depression by Sunday or Monday.  Model guidance suggests that this system will remain well to the south of Hawaii as it continues westward over the next several days.\n\n## Eastern Pacific\n\n* [**Disturbance #2** (Unnumbered)](https://www.reddit.com/r/TropicalWeather/comments/1m9ysp7/the_nhc_is_monitoring_an_additional_area_of/) — A trough of low pressure situated several hundred kilometers east-southeast of Invest 90C is producing disorganized showers and thunderstorms.  Environmental conditions may allow for gradual development as it continues west-northwestward over the next several days.\n\n\n\n# Post-tropical cyclones\n- - - \nPost-tropical cyclones will be listed here if they are still being tracked via the Automated Tropical Cyclone Forecast (ATCF) system.  Placement in this section does not imply that these systems have any potential to redevelop into tropical cyclones.\n\n## Western Pacific\n\n* [**10W: Francisco**](https://www.reddit.com/r/TropicalWeather/comments/1ma9qdl/francisco_10w_western_pacific_east_china_sea/) — Francisco continues to weaken as it lingers along the eastern coast of China near Fuzhou.  Model guidance suggests that Francisco's remnants could get pulled back out over the East China Sea as nearby Co-May restrengthens over the next few days.  This system will be closely monitored for signs that it may regenerate as it moves back over the water.\n\n# Potential formation areas\n- - - \nPotential formation areas are areas that are being monitored for potential tropical cyclone formation within the next two weeks.  These systems have either not yet formed or have formed but have not yet been designated as an investigation area (invest).  A discussion will be created for these systems once they become invests.\n\n## Eastern Pacific\n\n* [**Area of interest #1**](https://www.reddit.com/r/TropicalWeather/comments/1m9ywie/the_nhc_is_monitoring_an_area_of_potential/) — An area of low pressure is expected to develop well offshore to the southwest of Mexico early in the upcoming week.  Environmental conditions are likely to be favorable and the disturbance is expected to gradually strengthen as it moves northwestward later in the week.\n\n# Satellite imagery\n- - - \n\nBasin | Visible | Infrared | Water vapor\n:-|:-:|:-:|:-:\n**Western Pacific**   | [Visible](https://col.st/2U3rR) | [Infrared](https://col.st/r8tAV) | [Water vapor](https://col.st/cEzo3)\n**Eastern Pacific**   | [Visible](https://col.st/R9eJh) | [Infrared](https://col.st/dREmL) | [Water vapor](https://col.st/Z7eHu)\n**Central Pacific**   | [Visible](https://col.st/fo5Eh) | [Infrared](https://col.st/VXvQF) | [Water vapor](https://col.st/o0wtl)\n**Northern Atlantic** | [Visible](https://col.st/8Z8Kv) | [Infrared](https://col.st/CVdts) | [Water vapor](https://col.st/ooTC7)\n**Northern Indian**   | [Visible](https://col.st/Mzbru) | [Infrared](https://col.st/OzMmB) | [Water vapor](https://col.st/66l4w)\n\n# Model guidance\n- - - \n\nBasin | GFS | ECMWF | EC-AIFS | ICON\n:-|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:\n**Western Pacific**   | [GFS](https://www.tropicaltidbits.com/analysis/models/?model=gfs&region=wpac&pkg=mslp_pcpn_frzn) | [ECMWF](https://www.tropicaltidbits.com/analysis/models/?model=ecmwf&region=wpac&pkg=mslp_pcpn_frzn) | [EC-AIFS](https://www.tropicaltidbits.com/analysis/models/?model=ec-aifs&region=wpac&pkg=mslp_pcpn_frzn) | [ICON](https://www.tropicaltidbits.com/analysis/models/?model=icon&region=wpac&pkg=mslp_pcpn_frzn)\n**Eastern Pacific**   | [GFS](https://www.tropicaltidbits.com/analysis/models/?model=gfs&region=epac&pkg=mslp_pcpn_frzn) | [ECMWF](https://www.tropicaltidbits.com/analysis/models/?model=ecmwf&region=epac&pkg=mslp_pcpn_frzn) | [EC-AIFS](https://www.tropicaltidbits.com/analysis/models/?model=ec-aifs&region=epac&pkg=mslp_pcpn_frzn) | [ICON](https://www.tropicaltidbits.com/analysis/models/?model=icon&region=epac&pkg=mslp_pcpn_frzn)\n**Central Pacific**   | [GFS](https://www.tropicaltidbits.com/analysis/models/?model=gfs&region=cpac&pkg=mslp_pcpn_frzn) | [ECMWF](https://www.tropicaltidbits.com/analysis/models/?model=ecmwf&region=cpac&pkg=mslp_pcpn_frzn) | [EC-AIFS](https://www.tropicaltidbits.com/analysis/models/?model=ec-aifs&region=cpac&pkg=mslp_pcpn_frzn) | [ICON](https://www.tropicaltidbits.com/analysis/models/?model=icon&region=cpac&pkg=mslp_pcpn_frzn)\n**Northern Atlantic** | [GFS](https://www.tropicaltidbits.com/analysis/models/?model=gfs&region=atl&pkg=mslp_pcpn_frzn) | [ECMWF](https://www.tropicaltidbits.com/analysis/models/?model=ecmwf&region=atl&pkg=mslp_pcpn_frzn) | [EC-AIFS](https://www.tropicaltidbits.com/analysis/models/?model=ec-aifs&region=atl&pkg=mslp_pcpn_frzn) | [ICON](https://www.tropicaltidbits.com/analysis/models/?model=icon&region=atl&pkg=mslp_pcpn_frzn)\n**Northern Indian**   | [GFS](https://www.tropicaltidbits.com/analysis/models/?model=gfs&region=india&pkg=mslp_pcpn_frzn) | [ECMWF](https://www.tropicaltidbits.com/analysis/models/?model=ecmwf&region=india&pkg=mslp_pcpn_frz) | [EC-AIFS](https://www.tropicaltidbits.com/analysis/models/?model=ec-aifs&region=india&pkg=mslp_pcpn_frz) | [ICON](https://www.tropicaltidbits.com/analysis/models/?model=icon&region=india&pkg=mslp_pcpn_frz)\n\n\n\n\n# Information sources\n- - - \n\n## Regional Specialized Meteorological Centers (RSMC)\n\n* [**National Hurricane Center** (United States)](https://www.nhc.noaa.gov/)\n* [**Japan Meteorological Agency**](https://www.jma.go.jp/bosai/map.html)\n* [**India Meteorological Department**](https://rsmcnewdelhi.imd.gov.in/)\n\n## Other sources\n\n* [**Joint Typhoon Warning Center** (United States)](https://www.metoc.navy.mil/jtwc/jtwc.html)\n\n# Global outlooks\n\n## Climate Prediction Center\n\n* [**Global Tropics Hazards Outlook**](https://www.cpc.ncep.noaa.gov/products/precip/CWlink/ghazards/index.php)",

      "text": "# Active cyclones\n- - - \n**Last updated:** Tuesday, 12 August — 17:30 UTC\n\n## Northern Atlantic\n\n* [**05L: Erin**](https://www.reddit.com/r/TropicalWeather/comments/1mr4bo5/erin_05l_northern_atlantic_western_tropical/) — After rapidly strengthening into a Category 5 hurricane, Erin’s intensification appears to have leveled off.  The storm is expected to at least maintain strength over the next twenty-four hours as it passes to the north of the Leeward Islands, but could undergo unpredictable fluctuations in intensity due to eyewall replacement cycles.  \n\n&nbsp;    \n\n# Active disturbances\n- - - \n## Northern Atlantic\n\n* [**Disturbance #1**](https://www.reddit.com/r/TropicalWeather/comments/1mremlq/the_nhc_is_monitoring_an_area_of_potential/) — A non-tropical area of low pressure situated off the coast of North Carolina has not undergone any significant development over the past twenty-four hours, but could it undergo some development as it moves over the warm waters of the Gulf Stream over the next couple of days.  Environmental conditions will become more unfavorable on Monday.\n\n## Western Pacific\n\n* **Invest 92W** (no discussion yet) — A surface trough situated a few hundred kilometers northeast of the Philippine island of Luzon continues to produce disorganized showers and thunderstorms.  Strong difference aloft and very warm sea-surface temperatures may offset stronger shear ahead of the disturbance as it moves northward toward the Japan’s Ryukyu Islands over the next few days, and a tropical depression could form by early next week.\n\n* **Invest 91W** (no discussion yet) — A broad area of low pressure over the central South China Sea continues to produce disorganized showers and thunderstorms.  Moderate to strong shear and decreasing ocean heat content could limit this system’s ability to develop as it turns initially northward and then northwestward toward the Chinese island of Hainan over the next couple of days.  Still, conditions may be just favorable enough that a tropical depression could form by early next week.\n\n&nbsp;    \n\n# Post-tropical cyclones\n- - - \nPost-tropical cyclones will be listed here if they are still being tracked via the Automated Tropical Cyclone Forecast (ATCF) system.  Placement in this section does not imply that these systems have any potential to redevelop into tropical cyclones.\n\n* There are currently no active post-tropical cyclones.\n\n\n\n&nbsp;    \n\n# Potential formation areas\n- - - \nPotential formation areas are areas that are being monitored for potential tropical cyclone formation within the next two weeks.  These systems have either not yet formed or have formed but have not yet been designated as an investigation area (invest).  A discussion will be created for these systems once they become invests.\n\n## Northern Indian\n\n* [**Area of interest #1**](https://www.reddit.com/r/TropicalWeather/comments/1msbl9r/the_nhc_is_monitoring_an_area_of_potential/) — A tropical wave moving westward across the central tropical Atlantic could consolidate into an area of low pressure by the middle or end of the upcoming week.  Environmental conditions appear to be favorable for further development much later in the week, and a tropical depression could form by next weekend.\n\n\n&nbsp;    \n# Satellite imagery\n- - - \n\nBasin | Visible | Infrared | Water vapor\n:-|:-:|:-:|:-:\n**Western Pacific**   | [Visible](https://col.st/2U3rR) | [Infrared](https://col.st/r8tAV) | [Water vapor](https://col.st/cEzo3)\n**Eastern Pacific**   | [Visible](https://col.st/R9eJh) | [Infrared](https://col.st/dREmL) | [Water vapor](https://col.st/Z7eHu)\n**Central Pacific**   | [Visible](https://col.st/fo5Eh) | [Infrared](https://col.st/VXvQF) | [Water vapor](https://col.st/o0wtl)\n**Northern Atlantic** | [Visible](https://col.st/8Z8Kv) | [Infrared](https://col.st/CVdts) | [Water vapor](https://col.st/ooTC7)\n**Northern Indian**   | [Visible](https://col.st/Mzbru) | [Infrared](https://col.st/OzMmB) | [Water vapor](https://col.st/66l4w)\n\n# Model guidance\n- - - \n\nBasin | GFS | ECMWF | EC-AIFS | ICON\n:-|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:\n**Western Pacific**   | [GFS](https://www.tropicaltidbits.com/analysis/models/?model=gfs&region=wpac&pkg=mslp_pcpn_frzn) | [ECMWF](https://www.tropicaltidbits.com/analysis/models/?model=ecmwf&region=wpac&pkg=mslp_pcpn_frzn) | [EC-AIFS](https://www.tropicaltidbits.com/analysis/models/?model=ec-aifs&region=wpac&pkg=mslp_pcpn_frzn) | [ICON](https://www.tropicaltidbits.com/analysis/models/?model=icon&region=wpac&pkg=mslp_pcpn_frzn)\n**Eastern Pacific**   | [GFS](https://www.tropicaltidbits.com/analysis/models/?model=gfs&region=epac&pkg=mslp_pcpn_frzn) | [ECMWF](https://www.tropicaltidbits.com/analysis/models/?model=ecmwf&region=epac&pkg=mslp_pcpn_frzn) | [EC-AIFS](https://www.tropicaltidbits.com/analysis/models/?model=ec-aifs&region=epac&pkg=mslp_pcpn_frzn) | [ICON](https://www.tropicaltidbits.com/analysis/models/?model=icon&region=epac&pkg=mslp_pcpn_frzn)\n**Central Pacific**   | [GFS](https://www.tropicaltidbits.com/analysis/models/?model=gfs&region=cpac&pkg=mslp_pcpn_frzn) | [ECMWF](https://www.tropicaltidbits.com/analysis/models/?model=ecmwf&region=cpac&pkg=mslp_pcpn_frzn) | [EC-AIFS](https://www.tropicaltidbits.com/analysis/models/?model=ec-aifs&region=cpac&pkg=mslp_pcpn_frzn) | [ICON](https://www.tropicaltidbits.com/analysis/models/?model=icon&region=cpac&pkg=mslp_pcpn_frzn)\n**Northern Atlantic** | [GFS](https://www.tropicaltidbits.com/analysis/models/?model=gfs&region=atl&pkg=mslp_pcpn_frzn) | [ECMWF](https://www.tropicaltidbits.com/analysis/models/?model=ecmwf&region=atl&pkg=mslp_pcpn_frzn) | [EC-AIFS](https://www.tropicaltidbits.com/analysis/models/?model=ec-aifs&region=atl&pkg=mslp_pcpn_frzn) | [ICON](https://www.tropicaltidbits.com/analysis/models/?model=icon&region=atl&pkg=mslp_pcpn_frzn)\n**Northern Indian**   | [GFS](https://www.tropicaltidbits.com/analysis/models/?model=gfs&region=india&pkg=mslp_pcpn_frzn) | [ECMWF](https://www.tropicaltidbits.com/analysis/models/?model=ecmwf&region=india&pkg=mslp_pcpn_frz) | [EC-AIFS](https://www.tropicaltidbits.com/analysis/models/?model=ec-aifs&region=india&pkg=mslp_pcpn_frz) | [ICON](https://www.tropicaltidbits.com/analysis/models/?model=icon&region=india&pkg=mslp_pcpn_frz)\n\n\n\n\n# Information sources\n- - - \n\n## Regional Specialized Meteorological Centers (RSMC)\n\n* [**National Hurricane Center** (United States)](https://www.nhc.noaa.gov/)\n* [**Japan Meteorological Agency**](https://www.jma.go.jp/bosai/map.html)\n* [**India Meteorological Department**](https://rsmcnewdelhi.imd.gov.in/)\n\n## Other sources\n\n* [**Joint Typhoon Warning Center** (United States)](https://www.metoc.navy.mil/jtwc/jtwc.html)\n\n# Global outlooks\n\n## Climate Prediction Center\n\n* [**Global Tropics Hazards Outlook**](https://www.cpc.ncep.noaa.gov/products/precip/CWlink/ghazards/index.php)",

      "text": "# Active cyclones and disturbances\n- - - \n**Last updated:** Saturday, 12 July — 17:45 UTC\n\n## Western Pacific\n\n### [**Six-W**](https://www.reddit.com/r/TropicalWeather/comments/1lx0no1/06w_western_pacific_south_of_japan/) (South of Japan)\n\n*A tropical storm situated near Japan's Volcano Islands continues to struggle to develop this morning.  Although the storm appeared to be consolidating earlier on Friday, recent satellite imagery analysis reveals that its core convection has rapidly weakened and its structure remains vertically misaligned. Environmental conditions appear to remain favorable for further development as the storm moves northward toward the Bonin Islands this weekend.  Warm sea-surface temperatures, abundant moisture, and moderate dual-channel outflow are offset by moderate westerly vertical wind shear. The storm is expected to continue to strengthen over the next 48 hours before initiating extratropical transition as it interacts with a deepening upper-level trough off the eastern coast of Honshu early next week.*\n\n\n### [**Invest 92W**](https://www.reddit.com/r/TropicalWeather/comments/1lwnjz9/92w_invest_western_pacific_east_china_sea/) (East China Sea)\n\n*A subtropical depression situated off the eastern coast of China is showing signs of transitioning into a full-fledged tropical depression.  Environmental conditions appear to be supportive of this transition, with weak vertical wind shear, warm sea-surface temperatures over the East China Sea, and favorable poleward outflow.  Though this system is now expected to become fully tropical,  it is not expected to strengthen significantly before it reaches mainland Japan later this weekend.  Model guidance suggests that this system will enter the South China Sea by Monday, where environmental conditions are not as favorable and may lead to weakening.*\n\n**This system has a 70 percent chance of developing into a tropical cyclone within the next seven days.**\n\n## Northern Atlantic\n\n### [**Area of interest #1**](https://www.reddit.com/r/TropicalWeather/comments/1ly6c9x/the_nhc_is_monitoring_an_area_of_potential/) (Along the U.S. Gulf Coast)\n\n*A broad area of low pressure may develop along the U.S. Gulf Coast over the next several days.  Environmental conditions appear to be marginally favorable for further development as the system moves east-northeastward in a similar fashion to Tropical Storm Chantal.  Whether this system develops or not, heavy rainfall is expected across portions of Florida and the southeastern United States late in the upcoming week.*\n\n**This system has a 20 percent chance of developing into a tropical cyclone within the next seven days.**\n\n\n# Post-tropical cyclones\n- - - \nPost-tropical cyclones will be listed here if they are still being tracked via the Automated Tropical Cyclone Forecast (ATCF) system.  Placement in this section does not imply that these systems have any potential to redevelop into tropical cyclones.\n\n* There are currently no active post-tropical cyclones.\n\n# Potential formation areas\n- - - \nPotential formation areas are areas that are being monitored for potential tropical cyclone formation within the next two weeks.  These systems have either not yet formed or have formed but have not yet been designated as an investigation area (invest).  A discussion will be created for these systems once they become invests.\n\n## Western Pacific\n\n### Area of interest #75W\n\n*See discussion for Invest 92W above.*\n\n### Area of interest #76W\n\n*An area of low pressure may develop near Palau and the Northern Marianas Islands over the weekend or early next week.  Long-range model guidance suggests that environmental conditions will be favorable for further development and a tropical depression could form as early as Tuesday.  The latest GFS model suggests that whatever does develop could move northwestward across the Philippine Sea toward Japan's Ryukyu Islands.*\n\n**This system has a 50 percent chance of developing into a tropical cyclone within the next seven days.**\n\n## Southern Indian\n\n### Area of interest #77S\n\n*An area of low pressure could develop southeast of Diego Garcia over the next several days.  As this system is developing well outside the normal cyclone season for the Southern Hemisphere, environmental conditions are not likely to be particularly supportive of further development, model guidance does hint that something could develop midway through the upcoming week and move west-southwestward across the open waters of the southern Indian Ocean.*\n\n**This system has a 20 percent chance of developing into a tropical cyclone within the next seven days.**\n\n\n\n# Satellite imagery\n- - - \n\n## Regional imagery\n\n### Western Pacific\n\n* [**Visible**](https://col.st/2U3rR)\n* [**Enhanced infrared**](https://col.st/r8tAV)\n* [**Water vapor**](https://col.st/cEzo3)\n\n### Eastern Pacific\n\n* [**Visible**](https://col.st/R9eJh)\n* [**Enhanced infrared**](https://col.st/dREmL)\n* [**Water vapor**](https://col.st/Z7eHu)\n\n## Central Pacific\n\n* [**Visible**](https://col.st/fo5Eh)\n* [**Enhanced infrared**](https://col.st/VXvQF)\n* [**Water vapor**](https://col.st/o0wtl)\n\n### Northern Atlantic\n\n* [**Visible**](https://col.st/8Z8Kv)\n* [**Enhanced infrared**](https://col.st/CVdts)\n* [**Water vapor**](https://col.st/ooTC7)\n\n### Northern Indian\n\n* [**Visible**](https://col.st/Mzbru)\n* [**Enhanced infrared**](https://col.st/OzMmB)\n* [**Water vapor**](https://col.st/66l4w)\n\n# Model guidance\n- - - \n\n## Regional guidance (GFS)\n\n* [**Western Pacific**](https://www.tropicaltidbits.com/analysis/models/?model=gfs&region=wpac&pkg=mslp_pcpn_frzn)\n\n* [**Eastern Pacific**](https://www.tropicaltidbits.com/analysis/models/?model=gfs&region=epac&pkg=mslp_pcpn_frzn)\n\n* [**Northern Atlantic**](https://www.tropicaltidbits.com/analysis/models/?model=gfs&region=atl&pkg=mslp_pcpn_frzn)\n\n* [**Northern Indian**](https://www.tropicaltidbits.com/analysis/models/?model=gfs&region=india&pkg=mslp_pcpn_frzn)\n\n\n# Information sources\n- - - \n\n## Regional Specialized Meteorological Centers (RSMC)\n\n* [**National Hurricane Center** (United States)](https://www.nhc.noaa.gov/)\n* [**Japan Meteorological Agency**](https://www.jma.go.jp/bosai/map.html)\n* [**India Meteorological Department**](https://rsmcnewdelhi.imd.gov.in/)\n\n## Other sources\n\n* [**Joint Typhoon Warning Center** (United States)](https://www.metoc.navy.mil/jtwc/jtwc.html)\n\n# Global outlooks\n\n## Climate Prediction Center\n\n* [**Global Tropics Hazards Outlook**](https://www.cpc.ncep.noaa.gov/products/precip/CWlink/ghazards/index.php)",

      "text": "# Active cyclones and disturbances\n- - - \n**Last updated:** Saturday, 31 May — 09:00 UTC\n\n## Eastern Pacific\n\n* [**Tropical Storm Alvin**](https://www.reddit.com/r/TropicalWeather/comments/1kyf1xm/alvin_01e_eastern_pacific_southwest_of_mexico) — Alvin continues to struggle to stay organized as environmental conditions become increasingly hostile.  The storm is likely to degenerate into a post-tropical cyclone or a remnant low as it approaches the southern tip of the Baja California peninsula later today.  \n\n## Western Pacific\n\n* **Invest 91W** (10% potential) — A broad area of disorganized showers and thunderstorms remains offshore to the southeast of the Chinese island of Hainan.  Environmental conditions are not likely to support further development, especially as the disturbance becomes embedded within the prevailing mid-latitude westerlies over the next day or so.  This disturbance could bring heavy rain to portions of southeastern China and Taiwan over the next few days.\n\n\n# Post-tropical cyclones\n- - - \nPost-tropical cyclones will be listed here if they are still being tracked via the Automated Tropical Cyclone Forecast (ATCF) system.  Placement in this section does not imply that these systems have any potential to redevelop into tropical cyclones.\n\n* There are currently no active post-tropical cyclones.\n\n# Potential formation areas\n- - - \nPotential formation areas are areas that are being monitored for potential tropical cyclone formation within the next two weeks.  These systems have either not yet formed or have formed but have not yet been designated as an investigation area (invest).  A discussion will be created for these systems once they become invests.\n\n## Eastern Pacific\n\n* [**Area of interest #1**](https://www.reddit.com/r/TropicalWeather/comments/1kyqo6k/the_nhc_is_monitoring_an_area_of_potential) (30% potential) — An area of low pressure may form to the south of Mexico and Central America midway through the upcoming week.  Long-range model guidance suggests that environmental conditions could be supportive of further development as the disturbance drifts westward to west-northwestward.\n\n## Western Pacific\n\n* **Area of interest #1** (P74W) (20% potential) — An area of low pressure may develop over the Philippine Sea to the east of Japan's Ryukyu Islands later in the upcoming week.  Environmental conditions appear to be somewhat favorable for development.\n\n# Satellite imagery\n- - - \n\n## Regional imagery\n\n### Western Pacific\n\n* [**Visible**](https://col.st/2U3rR)\n* [**Enhanced infrared**](https://col.st/r8tAV)\n* [**Water vapor**](https://col.st/cEzo3)\n\n### Eastern Pacific\n\n* [**Visible**](https://col.st/R9eJh)\n* [**Enhanced infrared**](https://col.st/dREmL)\n* [**Water vapor**](https://col.st/Z7eHu)\n\n## Central Pacific\n\n* [**Visible**](https://col.st/fo5Eh)\n* [**Enhanced infrared**](https://col.st/VXvQF)\n* [**Water vapor**](https://col.st/o0wtl)\n\n### Northern Atlantic\n\n* [**Visible**](https://col.st/8Z8Kv)\n* [**Enhanced infrared**](https://col.st/CVdts)\n* [**Water vapor**](https://col.st/ooTC7)\n\n### Northern Indian\n\n* [**Visible**](https://col.st/Mzbru)\n* [**Enhanced infrared**](https://col.st/OzMmB)\n* [**Water vapor**](https://col.st/66l4w)\n\n# Model guidance\n- - - \n\n## Regional guidance (GFS)\n\n* [**Western Pacific**](https://www.tropicaltidbits.com/analysis/models/?model=gfs&region=wpac&pkg=mslp_pcpn_frzn)\n\n* [**Eastern Pacific**](https://www.tropicaltidbits.com/analysis/models/?model=gfs&region=epac&pkg=mslp_pcpn_frzn)\n\n* [**Northern Atlantic**](https://www.tropicaltidbits.com/analysis/models/?model=gfs&region=atl&pkg=mslp_pcpn_frzn)\n\n* [**Northern Indian**](https://www.tropicaltidbits.com/analysis/models/?model=gfs&region=india&pkg=mslp_pcpn_frzn)\n\n\n# Information sources\n- - - \n\n## Regional Specialized Meteorological Centers (RSMC)\n\n* [**National Hurricane Center** (United States)](https://www.nhc.noaa.gov/)\n* [**Japan Meteorological Agency**](https://www.jma.go.jp/bosai/map.html)\n* [**India Meteorological Department**](https://rsmcnewdelhi.imd.gov.in/)\n\n## Other sources\n\n* [**Joint Typhoon Warning Center** (United States)](https://www.metoc.navy.mil/jtwc/jtwc.html)\n\n# Global outlooks\n\n## Climate Prediction Center\n\n* [**Global Tropics Hazards Outlook**](https://www.cpc.ncep.noaa.gov/products/precip/CWlink/ghazards/index.php)",

      "text": "Is there any1 (qualified) who can answer whether Erin's predicted path that excludes SSMIS Data, is just as reliable as if it were done utilizing SSMIS .\n\n  So Im a little confused bc SSMIS usage was extended then it wasn't and so now I don't know if its been \"discontinued\" (forgive the phrasing) since July 31, 2024. AND if that is no ,onger being utilized then how accurate or reliable is Erin's predicted path? The weather is \"unpredictable\" bc there is so many variables that effect it. Therefore being able to monitor the different variables individually is actually what provides effective weather predictions, right? Is it unreasonable to deduce that if a component that is capable of gauging  certain weather variables that others can't is no longer being utilized, then we wouldn't be able to know if 1 of those variables suddenly changed significantly enough to effect the weather until its picked up by the other monitoring systems, thus extending the time that passes from  when that exact  changed occurred (a change that SSMIS would hav alerted us as it occurred ) to when we finally realize that a change has taken place?.. I know my post is wordy, but im a layman..lol hopefully some1 understand what Im asking and is capable of answering some of questions. THANK YOU",

      "text": "# Active cyclones and disturbances\n- - - \n**Last updated:** Thursday, 17 July — 16:51 UTC\n\n## Western Pacific\n\n* [**96W: Wipha**](https://www.reddit.com/r/TropicalWeather/comments/1m0yry6/96w_invest_western_pacific_philippine_sea/) — A broad area of low pressure continues to bring heavy rain to the northern Philippines this morning.  Although the official Regional Specialized Meteorological Center for the region—the Japan Meteorological Agency—has already upgraded this system to a tropical storm and has assigned it the name *Wipha,* the Joint Typhoon Warning Center still considers it to be a monsoon depression and not a true tropical cyclone. Thus, this system is still being tracked via the United States' Automated Tropical Cyclone Forecast (ATCF) system as *Invest 96W.*  **A new discussion will be created with the updated name once both agencies get on the same page.**\n\n## Northern Atlantic\n\n* [**93L: Invest**](https://www.reddit.com/r/TropicalWeather/comments/1m14k74/93l_invest_northern_atlantic_gulf_of_mexico/) — A broad area of low pressure is moving onshore over southeastern Louisiana this morning and is bringing heavy rainfall to much of the state. The disturbance continues to produce disorganized showers and thunderstorms and is now unlikely to develop into a tropical cyclone as it turns northward and moves farther inland later today.  Long-range model guidance suggests that the remnants of this system could get thrown back into the Atlantic by a small area of high pressure centered over the southeastern United States, giving it a second shot at development next week.  **This system now has a 10 percent chance of developing into a tropical cyclone within the next seven days.**\n\n\n## Southern Indian\n\n* [**01S: One**](https://www.reddit.com/r/TropicalWeather/comments/1m1ufpt/01s_southwestern_indian/) — A tropical storm which formed well to the northwest of the Cocos Islands earlier this week has not undergone significant development as it trudges southwestward against strong deep-layered shear. This shear is expected to briefly weaken on Friday, giving the storm a chance to strengthen slightly while it remains over warmer waters. However, the storm will ultimately weaken and dissipate over the weekend ans it encounters stronger shear, cooler waters, and dry mid-level air.\n\n\n\n# Post-tropical cyclones\n- - - \nPost-tropical cyclones will be listed here if they are still being tracked via the Automated Tropical Cyclone Forecast (ATCF) system.  Placement in this section does not imply that these systems have any potential to redevelop into tropical cyclones.\n\n* There are currently no active post-tropical cyclones.\n\n\n\n# Potential formation areas\n- - - \nPotential formation areas are areas that are being monitored for potential tropical cyclone formation within the next two weeks.  These systems have either not yet formed or have formed but have not yet been designated as an investigation area (invest).  A discussion will be created for these systems once they become invests.\n\n## Western Pacific\n\n* **Area of Interest #76W** — See discussion for Invest 96W above.\n\n* **Area of Interest #78W** — A second area of low pressure may develop on the heels of Invest 96W later this week.  Environmental conditions are likely to remain favorable as this system moves west-northwestward toward the Philippines.  **This system currently has a 50 percent chance of becoming a tropical cyclone within the next seven days.**\n\n* **Area of Interest #70W** — A third area of low pressure may develop over the Northern Marianas Islands much later in the upcoming week. **This system currently has a 20 percent chance of becoming a tropical cyclone within the next seven days.**\n\n\n\n\n# Satellite imagery\n- - - \n\n## Regional imagery\n\n### Western Pacific\n\n* [**Visible**](https://col.st/2U3rR)\n* [**Enhanced infrared**](https://col.st/r8tAV)\n* [**Water vapor**](https://col.st/cEzo3)\n\n### Eastern Pacific\n\n* [**Visible**](https://col.st/R9eJh)\n* [**Enhanced infrared**](https://col.st/dREmL)\n* [**Water vapor**](https://col.st/Z7eHu)\n\n## Central Pacific\n\n* [**Visible**](https://col.st/fo5Eh)\n* [**Enhanced infrared**](https://col.st/VXvQF)\n* [**Water vapor**](https://col.st/o0wtl)\n\n### Northern Atlantic\n\n* [**Visible**](https://col.st/8Z8Kv)\n* [**Enhanced infrared**](https://col.st/CVdts)\n* [**Water vapor**](https://col.st/ooTC7)\n\n### Northern Indian\n\n* [**Visible**](https://col.st/Mzbru)\n* [**Enhanced infrared**](https://col.st/OzMmB)\n* [**Water vapor**](https://col.st/66l4w)\n\n# Model guidance\n- - - \n\n## Regional guidance (GFS)\n\n* [**Western Pacific**](https://www.tropicaltidbits.com/analysis/models/?model=gfs&region=wpac&pkg=mslp_pcpn_frzn)\n\n* [**Eastern Pacific**](https://www.tropicaltidbits.com/analysis/models/?model=gfs&region=epac&pkg=mslp_pcpn_frzn)\n\n* [**Northern Atlantic**](https://www.tropicaltidbits.com/analysis/models/?model=gfs&region=atl&pkg=mslp_pcpn_frzn)\n\n* [**Northern Indian**](https://www.tropicaltidbits.com/analysis/models/?model=gfs&region=india&pkg=mslp_pcpn_frzn)\n\n\n# Information sources\n- - - \n\n## Regional Specialized Meteorological Centers (RSMC)\n\n* [**National Hurricane Center** (United States)](https://www.nhc.noaa.gov/)\n* [**Japan Meteorological Agency**](https://www.jma.go.jp/bosai/map.html)\n* [**India Meteorological Department**](https://rsmcnewdelhi.imd.gov.in/)\n\n## Other sources\n\n* [**Joint Typhoon Warning Center** (United States)](https://www.metoc.navy.mil/jtwc/jtwc.html)\n\n# Global outlooks\n\n## Climate Prediction Center\n\n* [**Global Tropics Hazards Outlook**](https://www.cpc.ncep.noaa.gov/products/precip/CWlink/ghazards/index.php)",

Furthermore, a [recent scatterometer] pass further emphasizes the broad nature of the system as it approaches the eastern coast of Luzon.  The [scatterometer] data suggests that the system may be starting to close off into a closed circulation, though one that remains very broad.* \n\n*Environmental analysis reveals a favorable environment for development with low (10 to 15 knots) [of] vertical wind shear, moderate outflow, and very warm (30 to 31°C) sea-surface temperatures.  Deterministic and ensemble models are in agreement that the circulation will track westward over Luzon with consolidation in the South China Sea over the next 36 to 48 hours.* \n\n\n\n# Official information\n- -

      "text": "A prolific marine heatwave is currently present in the Mediterranean Sea, with SST anomalies up to 5-6 C present.\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/Cg9havF.png\n\nIn terms of raw temperatures, the 27C isotherm has emerged near Italy and offshore the Levant. 26C SSTs are already beginning to dominate the Western Mediterranean. (h/t Alex Boreham)\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/FstPH9M.png\n\nThis is important because...\n\n1. It makes hybrid to pure tropical cyclones, affectionately called \"medicanes\", increasingly possible this season. But more importantly,\n\n2. Literature suggests that an anomalously warm Mediterranean is associated with northward displacements of the West African monsoon circulation and the monsoon trough. \n\nhttps://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2010JD014436\n\n>A warmer eastern Mediterranean in August–September feeds the lower troposphere with additional moisture, with a consequent reinforcement of northerly moisture transport toward the Sahel. Furthermore, warmer SST is linked to a strengthening of the Saharan heat low and to an enhancement of the moist static energy meridional gradient over West Africa, favoring the northward displacement of the monsoonal front.\n\n>... Thus, anomalous eastern Mediterranean warm conditions are linked to a northward migration of the monsoon system accompanied by enhanced southwesterly flow and weakened northeasterly climatological wind.\n\nThis is very important because.. as agencies such as TSR and CSU noted last year, a strong northward displacement existed last hurricane season. This means that tropical waves emerged offshore Africa at a much higher latitude than normal.\n\nFrom TSR: https://www.tropicalstormrisk.com/docs/TSRATL2024Verification.pdf\n\n>The monsoon trough was unusually far north during August and early\nSeptember. This resulted in easterly waves exiting Africa further north than\nnormal into a more hostile environment. Advection of dry air from the midlatitudes related to a positive North Atlantic Oscillation index aided in\ngenerating unfavourable conditions for tropical cyclone genesis.\n\nFrom CSU: https://tropical.colostate.edu/Forecast/2024_0903_seasondiscussion.pdf\n\n>While normally a vigorous and northward-shifted monsoon trough favors an\nactive Atlantic hurricane season, the current sea surface temperature configuration of an\nextremely warm Main Development Region combined with relatively cool sea surface\ntemperatures near the equator may have helped push the monsoon trough too far north\n(Figure 8). If we look at low-level zonal wind anomalies during August, anomalous lowlevel westerly winds extend north to ~20°N, favoring the northward shift in the monsoon\ntrough (Figure 9). While as noted earlier, a northward-shifted monsoon trough is typically\nfavorable for an active Atlantic hurricane season, the monsoon trough has shifted so far\nnorth in 2024 that easterly waves are emerging over the cold waters of the northeast\nAtlantic west of Mauritania. This far northerly track also brings down dry air from the\nsubtropics, helping to squelch deep convection in the tropics (Figure 10). The Climate\nPrediction Center’s Africa desk has also noted a pronounced northward shift in the\nIntertropical Front in recent weeks (Figure 11). \n\nDue to the northerly (north-to-south) flowing Canary Current present in the Eastern Atlantic, very cool SSTs are present along with a very dry and atmospherically stable airmass above it. This means that if the monsoon trough and African monsoon are displaced anomalously north enough, then tropical waves will encounter astronomically hostile conditions relative to if they emerge at climatological latitudes. \n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/SpktLqI.png\n\nThe strong Mediterranean warmth could be an early sign that another northward displaced season is going to occur. There are many other factors that contribute to where exactly the monsoon trough extends, but I found this connection very interesting. Climate change forcing is responsible for much of the anomalous Mediterranean warmth, so this represents another example of the nuances involved regarding this topic and how climate change forcing is not necessarily always positive for tropical cyclones. I recently [made a very extensive comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/hurricane/comments/1lhuxxr/a_line_graph_of_all_atlantic_hurricane_seasons/mz73cf0/?context=3) discussing this.",

Environmental conditions appear to be more favorable at this time, which could lead the disturbance to quickly develop into a tropical cyclone by next weekend.  **This system has a near zero percent chance of developing into a tropical cyclone within the next seven days.**\n\n\n# Satellite imagery\n- - - \n\n## Regional imagery\n\n### Western Pacific\n\n* [**Visible**](https://col.st/2U3rR)\n* [**Enhanced infrared**](https://col.st/r8tAV)\n* [**Water vapor**](https://col.st/cEzo3)\n\n### Eastern Pacific\n\n* [**Visible**](https://col.st/R9eJh)\n* [**Enhanced infrared**](https://col.st/dREmL)\n* [**Water vapor**](https://col.st/Z7eHu)\n\n## Central Pacific\n\n* [**Visible**](https://col.st/fo5Eh)\n* [**Enhanced infrared**](https://col.st/VXvQF)\n* [**Water vapor**](https://col.st/o0wtl)\n\n### Northern Atlantic\n\n* [**Visible**](https://col.st/8Z8Kv)\n* [**Enhanced infrared**](https://col.st/CVdts)\n* [**Water vapor**](https://col.st/ooTC7)\n\n### Northern Indian\n\n* [**Visible**](https://col.st/Mzbru)\n* [**Enhanced infrared**](https://col.st/OzMmB)\n* [**Water vapor**](https://col.st/66l4w)\n\n# Model guidance\n- - - \n\n## Regional guidance (GFS)\n\n* [**Western Pacific**](https://www.tropicaltidbits.com/analysis/models/?model=gfs&region=wpac&pkg=mslp_pcpn_frzn)\n\n* [**Eastern Pacific**](https://www.tropicaltidbits.com/analysis/models/?model=gfs&region=epac&pkg=mslp_pcpn_frzn)\n\n* [**Northern Atlantic**](https://www.tropicaltidbits.com/analysis/models/?model=gfs&region=atl&pkg=mslp_pcpn_frzn)\n\n* [**Northern Indian**](https://www.tropicaltidbits.com/analysis/models/?model=gfs&region=india&pkg=mslp_pcpn_frzn)\n\n\n# Information sources\n- - - \n\n## Regional Specialized Meteorological Centers (RSMC)\n\n* [**National Hurricane Center** (United States)](https://www.nhc.noaa.gov/)\n* [**Japan Meteorological Agency**](https://www.jma.go.jp/bosai/map.html)\n* [**India Meteorological Department**](https://rsmcnewdelhi.imd.gov.in/)\n\n## Other sources\n\n* [**Joint Typhoon Warning Center** (United States)](https://www.metoc.navy.mil/jtwc/jtwc.html)\n\n# Global outlooks\n\n## Climate Prediction Center\n\n* [**Global Tropics Hazards Outlook**](https://www.cpc.ncep.noaa.gov/products/precip/CWlink/ghazards/index.php)",

      "text": "# Latest update\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - \n\n**Since the previous update to this post:**\n\n* After a long pause with no significant development, Hurricane Kirk's intensification resumed on Thursday afternoon.  The storm is expected to reach Category 4 hurricane intensity later this evening.  Although the storm is not expected to directly impact land, it is likely to generate large swells which will propagate across the central and western Atlantic.  Dangerous surf conditions and rip currents are possible along the Leeward Islands by Friday, Bermuda and the Greater Antilles by Saturday, and Bermuda and the eastern coast of the United States by Sunday.\n\n* Tropical Storm Leslie is slowly becoming better organized now that Hurricane Kirk is moving farther away from the storm and deep-layered shear is decreasing.  Leslie is expected to strengthen into a hurricane by Friday night and continue to strengthen as it turns northwestward toward the central tropical Atlantic this weekend.\n\n* The potential for tropical cyclone development over the Gulf of Mexico is becoming less likely within the next several days.  Although a broad area of low pressure is still expected to develop over the Gulf of Mexico this weekend or early next weekend, its further development will be limited by its interaction with a passing frontal boundary.  Heavy rainfall from this system is still possible across portions of Florida over the weekend and early next week.\n\n* Typhoon Krathon made landfall along the southwestern coast of Taiwan on Thursday and has rapidly weakened into a tropical depression.  Heavy rainfall is likely to continue across the island over the next few days as Krathon's low-level circulation meanders over the island.  Model guidance suggests that the depression could drift back over the South China Sea by early next week, but significant development is not currently expected.\n\n* Tropical Depression Eleven-E degenerated into a trough off the coast of Oaxaca on Thursday afternoon. Heavy rainfall is likely to continue across southern Mexico over the next few days as the remnants of this system make landfall and move farther inland.\n\n* Cyclone Ancha degenerated into a remnant low over the southwestern Indian Ocean.  The remnants of this system are not likely to regenerated and are not likely to produce impacts to land.\n\n\n\n\n# Current discussions\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - \n**Last updated:** Thursday, 3 October — 20:30 Coordinated Universal Time (UTC)\n\n## Northern Atlantic\n\n* [**12L — Kirk**](https://www.reddit.com/r/TropicalWeather/comments/1fupk1o/kirk_12l_central_tropical_atlantic/)\n\n* [**13L — Leslie**](https://www.reddit.com/r/TropicalWeather/comments/1fuxtcs/leslie_13l_eastern_tropical_atlantic/)\n\n* [**Disturbance 1:**](https://www.reddit.com/r/TropicalWeather/comments/1frk04w/the_nhc_is_monitoring_the_northwestern_caribbean/) (Gulf of Mexico)\n\n## Eastern Pacific\n\n* [**11E — Eleven**](https://www.reddit.com/r/TropicalWeather/comments/1fuls4y/13l_eastern_tropical_atlantic/)\n\n## Western Pacific\n\n* [**20W — Krathon**](https://www.reddit.com/r/TropicalWeather/comments/1frcbfe/krathon_20w_western_pacific_philippine_sea/)\n\n## Southern Indian\n\n* [**01S — Ancha**](https://www.reddit.com/r/TropicalWeather/comments/1fuls4y/13l_eastern_tropical_atlantic/)\n\n\n# Areas of interest without current discussions\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - \n\n\n\n# Satellite imagery\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - \n## Regional imagery\n\n### Infrared imagery\n\n* [**Western Pacific**](https://realearth.ssec.wisc.edu/s/H30rsG)\n* [**Eastern Pacific**](https://www.tropicaltidbits.com/sat/satlooper.php?region=epac&product=ir) \n* [**Northern Atlantic**](https://www.tropicaltidbits.com/sat/satlooper.php?region=atl&product=ir)\n* [**Northern Indian** (Arabian Sea)](https://realearth.ssec.wisc.edu/s/u30qOZ)\n* [**Northern Indian** (Bay of Bengal)](https://realearth.ssec.wisc.edu/s/E30qQQ)\n* [**Southwestern Indian**](https://realearth.ssec.wisc.edu/s/q30qyl)\n* [**Southeastern Indian**](https://realearth.ssec.wisc.edu/s/G30r2f)\n\n# Model guidance\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - \n\n## Regional guidance (GFS)\n\n* [**Western Pacific**](https://www.tropicaltidbits.com/analysis/models/?model=gfs&region=wpac&pkg=mslp_pcpn_frzn)\n* [**Eastern Pacific**](https://www.tropicaltidbits.com/analysis/models/?model=gfs&region=epac&pkg=mslp_pcpn_frzn)\n* [**Northern Atlantic**](https://www.tropicaltidbits.com/analysis/models/?model=gfs&region=atl&pkg=mslp_pcpn_frzn)\n* [**Northern Indian**](https://www.tropicaltidbits.com/analysis/models/?model=gfs&region=india&pkg=mslp_pcpn_frzn)\n* [**Southern Indian**](https://www.tropicaltidbits.com/analysis/models/?model=gfs&region=india&pkg=mslp_pcpn_frzn)\n\n\n# Information sources\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - \n\n## Regional Specialized Meteorological Centers (RSMC)\n\n* [**National Hurricane Center** (United States)](https://www.nhc.noaa.gov/)\n* [**Japan Meteorological Agency**](https://www.jma.go.jp/bosai/map.html)\n* [**India Meteorological Department**](https://rsmcnewdelhi.imd.gov.in/)\n\n## Other sources\n\n* [**Joint Typhoon Warning Center** (United States)](https://www.metoc.navy.mil/jtwc/jtwc.html)\n\n\n# Global outlooks\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - \n\n## Climate Prediction Center\n\n*  [**Global Tropics Hazards Outlook**](https://www.cpc.ncep.noaa.gov/products/precip/CWlink/ghazards/index.php)",

A combination of dry mid-level air and some deep-layered shear may slow any development.\n\n## Northern Indian\n\n* **P77A — Arabian Sea:** An area of low pressure is increasingly likely to develop off the western coast of India later in the upcoming week.  Though the disturbance may develop in an area with strong easterly shear, it may move far enough north to escape the shear and consolidate into a tropical cyclone.  The India Meteorological Department is tracking a moderate chance that this system could become a tropical cyclone by next weekend.\n\n* **P78B — Bay of Bengal:** An area of low pressure may develop to the southeast of India later in the upcoming week.

      "text": "My thoughts and prayers are with everyone in FL. My heart is breaking for our family and even strangers being affected by these storms back to back. \n\nHelene and now Milton have gotten me thinking - why are we just now seeing so many extremely intense storms forming in the gulf and what do we think is causing them to form in the Bay of Campeche and move eastward when historically these storms move west? \n\nObviously, climate change is a portion of the answer, and possibly the totality of the answer, but the gulf has always had the warmest water and the path eastward largely wouldn’t be driven by climate change, but I would guess by ocean currents. Even historic storms that have formed in the gulf almost always made landfall in TX or LA until Michael in 2018. \n\nAre there other hurricanes formed in the gulf that made landfall in FL I’m unaware of? \n\nAs we know, most hurricanes form in the Atlantic and either strike the east coast of the  US or intensify through the gulf. However, very few storms actually form in the Gulf and even fewer of those seem to hit Florida. \n\nCharley was technically the Caribbean Sea and Ivan and Andrew formed out in the Atlantic.",

      "text": "Atlantic continues to look comically (but climatologically) hostile. Here's a GFS modeled sounding for less than 72 hours out for the Main Development Region:\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/TyQpVUm.png\n\nWe can see that every parameter we look for regarding hurricane development is hostile.\n\nThe vertical shear is astronomically high (area-average exceeding 35 kt), with seasonally strong low-level trades and westerlies aloft. \n\nThe surge in trade easterlies around the 800-600mb layer along with the temperature inversion is representative of dry, dusty Saharan air. This is also extremely unfavorable. \n\nOverall, the atmospheric column is dry, dry, dry. Low-to-mid level relative humidity is area-averaged at 36%. We consider anything below 60% to be hostile. PWATs are around 1.3 inches; there is insufficient moisture for hurricane activity on top of everything else. The dynamics are about as bad as it gets. However.. June + July are typically extremely unfavorable months. This is not unusual. In fact, the Tropics having good conditions for development during this time of year would be very unusual. \n\nWe look to be on track for our latest season start since 2014 (first system developed on 1 July). Barring any surprise development over the subtropics from a non-tropical system (such as a decaying cold front which becomes a stationary front and then degenerates into a surface trough, which can act as a focus for tropical cyclogenesis is shear is low and moisture sufficiently high), we could experience quiescence until August.\n\nIt is important to emphasize that historically, 90% of hurricane activity occurs after August 1st. \n\nhttps://www.nhc.noaa.gov/climo/images/2021climo/AtlanticCampfire.png\n\nJune + July only account for 6-7% of activity and those months being hostile has close to *zero* correlation to peak season (August-October) conditions. The forecasts from agencies such as NOAA and CSU for a moderately above-average season are thus entirely unaffected by this quiescence. In fact, here is a direct quote from NOAAs' hurricane forecast: \n\n>Most of the predicted activity is likely to occur during August-September-October (ASO), the peak months of the hurricane season.\n\nhttps://www.cpc.ncep.noaa.gov/products/outlooks/hurricane.shtml\n\nTheir numbers account for the fact that little activity during this time of year is expected. It is literally already baked into the forecasts. \n\nFurthermore, and just to really drive the point home, here are some (of many) examples of historical seasons with a quiet or weak early season:\n\n1998, with the first storm forming on 27 July. \n\nA hyperactive season with Category 5 Mitch which killed over 11,000 people.\n\n1999, with one weak tropical storm in mid-June, a short-lived depression in early July, and then absolutely nothing until Bret formed on 18 August.\n\nA hyperactive season with five category 4s.\n\n2000; where only two depressions formed all the way until Alberto formed on 3 August. \n\nAn above-average season. \n\n2004; First storm formed on 31 July.\n\nIn the top 5 most active seasons ever observed. Major hurricanes Charley, Frances, Ivan, and Jeanne pummeled Florida into submission. \n\n2019; An extremely weak and short-lived subtropical storm in May, a very messy low-grade category 1 Barry in July, and a depression. \n\nThen on 24 August, Dorian formed. Another above-average season.\n\n2022; We had tropical storms Alex, Bonnie, and Colin form in June/July. Each of these storms were weak and did not last longer than 24 hours. Then, *zero* storms formed in August.\n\nBy late September, Ian. Enough said.\n\nThis is a copy-paste of a comment I made earlier in a different post. Apologies for the laziness, but I felt that this was relevant enough to post as a thread, too.",

The storm has lacked organized deep convection since about 03Z, and it has generally consisted of a low-level cloud swirl since that time.  Therefore, Kristy no longer meets the criteria of a tropical cyclone, and this is the last advisory on this system.  The initial wind speed is lowered to 40 kt, assuming some decrease in winds from the ASCAT pass overnight that showed maximum winds close to 50 kt.\n \n> The gale-force low is still moving north-northwestward at about 7 kt, but it is expected to turn to the west and west-southwest later today and Monday when it moves in the low-level flow.  The post-tropical cyclone is also expected to continue to weaken and dissipate completely on Monday.\n \n> This is the last NHC advisory on Kristy.  For more details on this system, including gale warnings, see High Seas Forecasts issued by the National Weather Service.

The low is forecast to move northwestward or northward over the warm waters of the Gulf Stream toward the coasts of North Carolina and South Carolina, and it could become a subtropical or tropical storm during the next day or so if the associated front dissipates and showers and thunderstorms become sufficiently organized.  An Air Force Hurricane Hunter aircraft is currently investigating the system.\n\n> Regardless of tropical or subtropical development, the low is likely to bring gusty winds, heavy rains with the potential for flash flooding, coastal flooding, and dangerous beach conditions to portions of the U.S. Southeast and Mid-Atlantic coast during the next couple of days, and interests in these areas should monitor the system's progress.

The latest total precipitable water imagery indicates a decrease in the supply of warm, moist air into the system from the southeastern Arabian Sea.  Upper-level divergence has decreased over the past six hours; however, poleward and equatorward outflow is still observed in the upper levels.  Mid-level shear is moderate (20 knots) over the system and along the predicted path.  Surface friction, a decrease in moisture supply, and moderately favorable wind shear should lead to gradual weakening of this system.  The system is expected to continue to be steered under the influence of westerly wind flow in the lower and mid-tropospheric levels and an approaching trough.\n\nSome models suggest that, after landfall, the depression will move across Maharashtra, Telangana, and Andhra Pradesh and emerge over the west-central and northwestern Bay of Bengal on Tuesday.  This could lead to the formation of an area of low pressure which will gradually move north-northwestwards and may lead to enhancement of the monsoon current over the Bay of Bengal.\n\n\n## Joint Typhoon Warning Center (United States)\n**Last updated:** Friday, 24 May — 11:30 PM IST (18:00 UTC)\n\nThe area of convection (Invest 93A) previously located near 17.1°N 75.6°E is now located near 18.2°N 75.7°E, approximately 164 nautical miles west-northwest of Mumbai, India. Animated multispectral satellite imagery (MSI) reveals a weak and exposed low-level circulation center (LLCC) over land with a dislocated area of flaring convection along the western coast of India. Environmental analysis indicates unfavorable conditions for development with strong equatorward outflow significantly offset by moderate to high (20 to 25 knots) vertical wind shear and significant terrain interaction. Global deterministic models indicate a low likelihood of development as the circulation continues over India.\n\n\n\n# Official information\n---\n## India Meteorological Agency\n\n*

Environmental conditions appear conducive for some additional development over the next day or so, and a short-lived tropical depression or storm could form before the system moves inland over Central America on Saturday. Interests in Belize and the Yucatan Peninsula of Mexico should monitor the progress of this system, as tropical storm watches or warnings may be required later today.

      "text": "Sandy had a much larger 34kt wind field, and a larger maximum 64kt radius of 150 mi in one quadrant. But it was only in one quadrant. Currently, Erin has a diameter of 64 kt winds of about 220 mi, and it's almost circular with at least 100 mi radius in all 4 quadrants. From what I can find, only Lorenzo matched this, but it's hard to find information on this since the record books mostly care about radius of gale force winds.",

      "text": "I often see comments saying that even if a storm does not hit the coast, it can cause life threatening rip currents. I live in Western Europe, so I'm not personally familiar with tropical cyclones (just interested in reading about them), but am familiar with rip currents. I've always understood rip currents to be caused by local geography, when receding water is forced through a funnel (usually a sand bank, but also artificial structures). So how do tropical cyclones affect this dynamic, even when they are far out on sea? Do they increase they occurrence of rip currents, or do they make existing rip currents more powerful? If caught in one, is the advice still the same as usual, that is either swim parallel to the coast or let it drag you out until it dissipates?",
