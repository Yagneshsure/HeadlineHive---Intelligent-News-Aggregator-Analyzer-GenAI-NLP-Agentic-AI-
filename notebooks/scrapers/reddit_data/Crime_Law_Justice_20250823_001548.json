Sources in the Republican Party at the state and national level report to The Atlantic that the Trump campaign is discussing contingency plans for him to illegally hold office even if he loses. According to this contingency plan, with a public (though baseless) accusation of rampant voter fraud, Trump would ask Republican state legislators in battleground states to choose a slate of presidential electors directly, regardless of the state’s popular vote count. Should this happen, these electors would purport to hand an electoral college victory to Trump despite a near certain loss in the election.\n\nIt sucked to be vindicated so quickly and thoroughly and we'd have preferred to have been wrong. But we weren't wrong then and we aren't now.\n\nOur endorsement this time will be shorter because there is no more reasonable doubt about who this criminal is. We all saw him post that he wants the “termination of all rules, regulations, and articles, even those found in the Constitution”; we all saw him try to get his own vice president killed by an angry mob in a vain effort to install himself as a king; we all saw him glob onto a bizarre lie about cat-eating immigrants that’s led to dozens of bomb threats and terrorized a small Ohio town. He’s an undisciplined lunatic who seeks absolute power for himself, and his Republican friends on the Supreme Court and in Congress are all too willing to help him or get out of his way. His own chief of staff said he's a fascist to the core.\n\nA vote for Trump is a vote for treason.\n\n#We endorse Kamala Harris and Tim Walz.\n\nWe encourage every US citizen who can to vote for Kamala Harris and Tim Walz.",

The video is a full bodycam and graphic video of what happened. When it happened it was on the news but they never released any information other than the driver who killed him. \n\nThis channel blurred the bloody and graphic footage of my partner, but nothing else. They did not care to blur my face, nor did they blur any of his family. There is nearly 15 minutes straight of myself in visible shock, covered in blood and sobbing, trying to recount what happened to police.\n\nI know this sounds so selfish. I am graduating college in June, and going into education. It is embarrassing and traumatic to relive, and to have my employer not only know about a personal tragedy, but to see me in such a vulnerable state. I worry it will affect future job opportunities/my life once I graduate.  I am so unbelievably angry and upset. The cherry on top is that they posted it on the anniversary of his death.\n\n Is there anything I can do at all? \nThank you so much in advance.",

He has no license, permit, or any experience behind the wheel.\n\nNew: I decided to report this to the police because my son is completely out of control, showed zero remorse, and frankly needs to face some accountability for his escalating criminal behavior.\n\nHere’s where the story takes another twist…the police say NO crime occurred and it’s a civil matter. I’m flabbergasted. He didn’t provide any details, just that it’s not a crime. WTF?\n\nI looked up [ORS 164.135 Unauthorized use of a vehicle](https://oregon.public.law/statutes/ors_164.135), which reads:\n\n > (1) A person commits the crime of unauthorized use of a vehicle when:\n \n >   (a)(A) The person knowingly takes, operates, exercises control over or otherwise uses another’s vehicle, boat or aircraft;\n \n >   (B) The person is aware of and consciously disregards a substantial and unjustifiable risk that the owner of the vehicle, boat or aircraft does not consent to the taking, operation or other use of, or the exercise of control over, the vehicle, boat or aircraft; and\n \n  >  (C) The owner of the vehicle, boat or aircraft did not consent to the taking, operation or other use of, or the exercise of control over, the vehicle, boat or aircraft;\n\nFrom my reading, this is exactly what happened and I don’t see any loopholes for family members, people who don’t reach a public roadway, etc.\n\nCan anyone justify to me the police officer’s lack of action in this matter? Is there some loophole to this statute that I’m not seeing? Thank you.",

I spoke directly with the DA and it became clear that I was not the person they were trying to summon. There is apparently another person with my first and last name who did witness the event and they mistook me for her. It was a bitch to get sorted, but it wasn’t a scam, just a shitty clerical error made by the officer. I did actually have to file a police report about it because I was worried someone had stolen my identity, and they very quickly realized their error after that. I think I’m in the clear now, but I’m still a little nervous that somehow it’ll come back to bite me.\n\nSeveral months ago I randomly received a phone call from a Nevada DA in a town about an hour away from where I live telling me that a court summons had been returned to them from my previous address. A man in this town is accused of battery, but I have never heard of the man or the victim. I also haven’t set foot in that town since 2020 and the crime happened in 2023, so there is zero chance I was anywhere near it. I explained all of this to multiple people and they just called again yesterday saying the court date is soon and wanted me to confirm that I’d be there. Who do I speak to to get taken off the witness list?",

Smith, as having been arrested, not him.\n\nThe only difference in our names is that my father does not have a middle name, as that naming convention wasn't around in the old country. So the inclusion of a middle initial in the news report points it at me.\n\nI have contacted the police department, and they insist that they have correct name/birthday for my father. No middle initial on their records of the arrest.\n\nI have sent an email to the news station asking them to correct the story, they haven't responded or corrected the story.\n\nI am worried about future job prospects, employers searching my name and this arrest and news report being the only result to show up.\n\nMy dad was arrested on Tuesday, I found out about the news story yesterday on Thursday.\n\nAny and all advice is appreciated.",

      "title": "Divorce my disabled husband for our kids?",
      "text": "Location: Ohio, USA, 30F— Let me just start by saying I don’t want to leave my disabled husband, just want to know if I can divorce him on paper. \n*****************************\n\nEDIT FOR CONTEXT: I don’t literally make 2,000/ month. I was rounding a bit. I make 2800 a month. So after insurance I’d be left with 800-ish which is nothing in this economy, sadly. \n\nMy husband is recently loosing his battle with his Crohn’s disease. He has lost two jobs in the last year so he/we decided it’s finally time to come to terms with his illness and file for disability. \nWe have a 6 year old bio child and a 10 month old we have been fostering that we are set to adopt legally in October.\n\nHere is our problem. My job is almost impossible to afford the insurance. It’s $2,012/ month. To which our HR just says “yeah people have been complaining about that for years. It is kinda pricey”. It’s almost my entire income, and I can’t quit this job \nbecause it’s a “unicorn” job. I work at an express care run out of a local school so I get to work with kids at school all day. It’s a dream and I love it so much, I’d give the world to keep it. \nOnce my husband is on disability, he gets state insurance for him and any dependents he has. I am having to work a second full time job just to afford insurance for me and the kids and I can’t keep working like this. I’m missing everything, I’m so exhausted but I, myself, do not qualify for state insurance because I make too much money. \n\nMy husband and I were thinking. If we got a “divorce”, he could claim the kids and have them in his insurance. And I’ll have my own, which is VERY affordable. \n\nI have heard of disabled people not getting married because they loose benefits and they still love together and have kids and have their whole life but without a stupid piece of paper, and that’s totally legal. \nBut his illness started to worsen after we got married, so, now we just want to undo it so we can afford to live. \n\nAm I legally allowed to divorce my husband for this reason or is this considered some type of crime? Idk what to do.",

      "text": "Location: Columbus, Ohio\n\nI am moving and getting rid of 2 couches and an ottoman (selling as a set). I listed the set on Facebook marketplace, and a woman who was interested came to my house to look at them. She sat on them, liked them, and said she would purchase. \n\nHere’s the thing: while this woman was at my house looking at the couches, the movers were there packing up the rest of my stuff. I told her it was important that we finalize the transaction as soon as possible, because if she didn’t want the couches I’d need to have the movers take them. She said she definitely wanted them, sent me $3k on Venmo for the set, and she took the ottoman with her. She said she’d come back for the rest later. \n\nNow she’s telling me she actually doesn’t want the couches, she doesn’t believe that the fabric is “performance” (it is) and says the color is off, and she says she’s coming to return the ottoman and wants her money back. I told her that’s fine, but I’m going to subtract the amount that it costs for the movers to come back and move the couches. She says her husband is a lawyer and she’ll sue me if I do that. \n\nWhat can I do here?",

      "text": "My mom got a call from her bank in Maine this evening asking if she had written a check dated 1995. She obviously said no and told them it was fraud. The bank said they would try to reverse the transaction, but also told her to report it to the police.\n\nWhen she tried to report it to the police in Maine (where her parents’ old house is located and where the checks were likely stolen from), they refused to take the report because she no longer lives there. She then went to the local police in Connecticut (where she lives now), and they said they couldn’t do anything since it's not in their jurisdiction.\n\nShe went back through her account thoroughly and discovered that multiple checks have already been cashed, all dating from various points in the 1990s. This amounts to several thousand dollars that has been stolen.\n\nThese checks are likely from her parents’ house which was broken into a few years ago and may have been broken into again more recently to steal these old checks. She sent a detailed email to the bank making it very clear that these checks are not valid and should not be honored under any circumstance.\n\nIt’s after hours now and all she can do is wait but we’re not sure what else she can do.\n\nWhat else should she do?\n\nLocation: Connecticut (Crime occurred in Maine)\n\nEdit:  \nUpdate!\n\nShe has been refunded the initial first large amount/check. They are working on the other charges. She has to fill out a lot of paperwork and mail it to them and may even need to go up there in-person. Apparently someone was supposed to call her about the situation and help resolve it yesterday but they were busy. From what the bank has told her these were old checks that were processed/cashed in the 90s and were then sent back to her or held in the bank vault. They were then stolen and photocopied and presented at an ATM. Now it's just the waiting game after she gets her paperwork notarized and mailed. Thanks so much everyone!",

On the night before going back to Denmark, he was invited to a bar to get a couple of \"farewell beers\" with some of his fellow students. After having two beers in the bar, he decided to just walk the 600 yards  as he couldn't get an Uber. College police stopped him as he was walking home. They asked him if he had consumed any alcohol, to which he said yes...\"two beers\". He was immediately arrested, and spent the night in the local (20 minutes away from where he studied) jail. He was released the next day, but told to meet in court some days (weeks?) later...he would receive anything ranging from a $200 fine to 30 days in jail. \nHe didn't want to miss his flight back to Denmark, so he did not show up in court... So.. My question is: will him not showing up in court in Iowa prevent him from entering the USA in the future?",

      "title": "Sister Stole My Identity and Committed a Crime - Now I'm Struggling to Legally Clear My Name ",
      "text": "Hi everyone. Last year my sister apparently committed a crime and was arrested at the scene. When arrested, she told the officers and the booking clerk at the jail that her name and date of birth was mine. She lied and stated she did not have an ID, so she was arrested and booked under my name. Little did she know, her fingerprints were already in this particular county's system, so her real name appeared as well. Now her charges are under both her name and my name! It says my name \"also goes by\" and then her real name. Insanity! She was arrested in in 2023, and I just discovered this news in October of 2024 when my dad randomly received a court document addressed to me. The charge is listed as also giving fictitious information and failure to identify, but again it is still under my name within the system.\n\n I spoke to the county clerks, and they told me that I would have to file a form called a \"Petition For Expunction of Records\" and then I would need to stand in front of a judge to explain the situation. I tried to fill out the paperwork to request an expunction, but there is no \"other\" option for me to explain why I am requesting this expunction on the document. The only options given are 1) the case is no longer pending and did not result in conviction 2) person was acquitted or 3) the state has requested expunction. None of these options apply to my situation, so I can't file the document! I need an option for innocent people! An \"other\" option to explain such situations; \"My sister committed a crime, stole my identity when arrested for a crime that I still have no details about and have nothing to do with at all\". I lived in a totally different state when this occurred! \n\n  \nHas anyone experienced something like this before? If so, how did you approach this to get your name cleared? Did you have to also file an expunction record, even though you did not commit the crime? I know the county clerks told me to fill out an expunction form, but it feels like a misdirection, because expunction are for people who actually committed the crime or have been accused. I told them I would even show proof that I lived in a different state, and I would attend my sister's court dates, but they said I HAD to go through the expunction route and see a judge separately. But I cannot, due to the inapplicable paperwork. It's highly frustrating! \n\nSorry for the long explanation. I can't afford an attorney, I tried to apply for free legal aid for veterans, but I had to be a resident of my county for six months (I just moved). My situation feels weirdly unique, so I'm not getting much help elsewhere. Hopefully someone can lend me some advice. Thank you so much for taking the time to read, and I apologize again for the lengthy post.  \n\n\n  \nTLDR: My sister committed a crime and used my identity when she was arrested, resulting in my name being charged with her crimes under the county criminal record system. The county told me to file an expunction request to clear my name, however the documents are very limited and it does not allow an option for people who are innocent to explain their reason, therefore I cannot file this document. Is there any other way to clear my name from this case and inform the court that I want my name cleared from the criminal records?",

He has a setup in the back for sleeping, so he slept and was woken up by a couple officers. They immediately assumed he was impaired, he tried working with them and complying. They said they smelt weed in his car, which he hasn’t smoked in years. He allowed them to search his car, he passed the breathalyzer, so they made him do a field sobriety test, he didn’t do terribly, but it’s up to their opinion on whether he passed or not, so of course they failed him. They found a scale in his car that is used to weigh food, because he’s big into the gym. They assumed it was for drugs. They arrested him and took him into the station, where they did a blood draw, and then he sat in jail for 10 hours before being released. \n\nBased off of the information above, does he have a case to sue? He was completely sober, doing the safe thing by not running out of gas on the highway and waiting for the station to open, and somehow he’s guilty until proven innocent and arrested for no reason. He’s got a court case in a month that should be an easy win, after that should he look for lawyers to sue? Or is this pointless and just move on with life. \n\nSide note: this is the reason people hate cops, I’ve never had a problem with them, but the few power hungry pigs ruin it for the rest of them.",

This happened in New York City, so what charges will they possibly be facing. Under NY laws, I can sue for damages and take the minor's parent to court from the ages of 10-18 years old. How long do I have to file? How can I obtain the minor parent's information to file a suite? \n\nMy car did suffer damages severely enough mechanically that I had to take it to the dealership.

They were a group of visibly affluent white guys, my friend and I are also white so it wasn’t a hate crime, it was just unprovoked assault, I specifically was punched on the face and head by 3-4 of them simultaneously. They basically beat me bloody and just ran to their car, which like I said, they got the license plate, the camera footage caught it, it was morning, so clearish, and the waitress from the restaurant it happened outside of came out after seeing what happened, seemingly recognizing who did it and noting they were regulars.

My brother’s ex has charged my brother with s**ual a***ult against her daughters, he’s likely autistic and didn’t understand the consequences of not asking for a lawyer when pressed during interrogation and ended up giving a false statement (plus a week in a psychiatric ward afterwards). A family member has stepped to become his power of attorney because he’s hopelessly confused and terrified but the lawyer he currently has stated that family member cannot see the evidence because there are minors involved. This man has never had a history of violence and the children in question are not biologically his so he’s never kept them overnight, I believe he’s innocent but his current lawyer hasn’t asked us anything or subpoenaed his cellphone records…effectively we can’t verify that any evidence for or against has been found because we just keep getting turned away. Should we contact a disability group? He’s not diagnosed but I would bet money that he would likely pass for on the spectrum and likely CPTSD. Are they being truthful about the power of attorney not being enough to make decisions on his behalf? Is there another option that would allow family to help him make decisions? I fear a mentally disabled man is going to go to prison because of scare tactics and him taking a plea deal just to get back out. He has happily complied since the very beginning and he’s now been jail for 3 months plus they just delayed his hearing for another two months. I don’t want to hinder any investigation but we know nothing more than what he has been charged with. Any websites, organizations, or general advice is appreciated",

My spouse became abusive very quickly after marriage and staged a situation with my dog who is terrified of them now. They made a false accusation to the police. Three weeks later my spouse actually got physically abusive and they fled and the police asked if wanted an EPO which I said yes. The crime report I requested says it's a felony domestic violence charge for 273.5(a). I don't think they were ever served because they flew to the east coast and evaded arrest for a while. Fast forward 4 months later I was terminated from work because I had a hard time coping with PTSD. We were in the process of a dissolution and I was in a vulnerable place so I stupidly asked them for help. Surprise, surprise three weeks later the police was involved again...and then we both got released in the middle of a 51/50 evaluation? No arrests or anything so they went straight the courthouse and got a TRO in retaliation which was mostly denied on the basis of \"other party seek restraining order\" and the implications of that sentence are baffling to me.\n\nThe court hearing identified that we were spouses and the hearing for the temporary DVRO was over in 5 minutes \"on the court's own notion.\" I spent the whole month preparing. Neither of us had a criminal record nor were we ever arrested for domestic violence either. After the temporary hearing we both received a letter saying we were scheduled for another hearing and that we were facing identical charges which made no sense because I had the crime report and surveillance cameras and all they did was file a DV100. They basically said sorry bout this good luck get a lawyer and just like that my life was over.  The actual court hearing day finally came and the permanent DVRO was granted against me after the judge refused actual acts of domestic violence and apparently had my juvenile case file in front of them.\n\nWhat happens now if we encounter each other is it legally enforceable and what would happen if I request an extension for the EPO in an emergency? Will we both get arrested? Am I criminal now how does it work if neither of us were ever arrested? The only relation between the criminal charges and the DVRO is that they were both presented to the victim aka me the spouse that got battered. I am genuinely confused how a DVRO is supposed to work and I've never read a law book but I read the disrespect and I know things are fucked because they started mumbling about constitutional rights like I was Rosa freakin' Parks. What can I do now the detective was confused too and recommended I file with the court which I will be doing soon.",

While he's still in the store she calls the credit card company and they tell her there is no problem on their end and they refund the charge. All of this can be seen on her side since it's her credit card and she has access to the card info on her phone and a receipt matching her card for the purchase.

      "text": "Location: Ohio\n\nHello. I want to share a little context for this situation. A couple years ago my friend and I weren't making the best choices. We were involved in addictive substances and getting them any way we could. It got to the point where we borrowed a substantial amount of money from someone and in the middle of laying them back, we decided to get clean and try to better our lives. After about two years without paying him back, one night we were awoken by someone calling up the stairs. It was the guys who we owed money to. He came to collect. At that time we still owed him around $7000. This guy beat me up a bit until my friend told him we have no money. As I was laying on the floor she begged him to stop and we would figure out how to get it for him within the next month or so. \n\nThe lender told us that we were out of time, and that if we wanted to clean the slate, we had to do a couple favors for him. If we didn't do what he asked, he would have to resort to \"extreme circumstances\". And if we tried to call any law enforcement, he had connections all over that could find us and \"take care of us\"\n\nSo to make everything copacetic, we began doing these favors for him. These \"favors\" mostly turned out to be dropping off certain substances to people we wouldn't ever meet. We would deliver whatever it was to a certain landmark in a park or something and call the lender when it was dropped off. \n\nWe were on our final dropoff and my friend went to do it on her own since I was due to go into work the next morning. She ubered to a friend's place in the next town over so she could make the drop in the morning. On her way there, the Uber driver got pulled over and during the stop, she was arrested for possession of the substance she was forced to carry with her. \n\nWhen she got out of jail she told me she didn't want to bring up this part of the story to her lawyer or anyone else because she didn't want us to get hurt or killed. So now her trial is about to begin and the prosecutor wants to give her 6 years. The guy that lent us the money had dropped off the radar entirely, but I know his name and everything. Is there a chance to get her sentence dropped if I come forward with this information? I just want to make sure she doesn't have to pay for anything this guy put her up to. \n\nI know this is a shot in the dark, but I have no other options in this matter. I don't know what else to do. Thanks in advance.",

      "text": "Location: Carson City NV. Long story short I am being accused of Domestic Battery by strangulation. Not only did I not block access to the \"victims\" air or blood flow to the head, but the \"victim\" has already come forward and admitted to lying to the police. I have been offered 4 different plea deals which is alarming in itself, and have MULTIPLE witnesses that are testifying on my behalf including the \"victim\". There is absolutely no evidence as far as I am concerned (because it didnt happen) but I have discovery sometime soon. I have one previous battery charge for instigating a fight that they keep bringing up (it was high school) and overall have a very strong case. I have done a bunch of petty illegal stuff in my childhood thus far but that doesnt make it fair that I would be charged with a felony that I didnt even commit. What can I do to prevent a false charge and if it comes to it, how would I go about appealing to a higher court than the district court (which the judge working my case has connections in)? Sorry this is long but its just so scary that I could be charged with something I would never bring myself to do and I need advice. Please feel free to ask questions and I will respond as soon as humanly possible. I have trial on the 30th of this month and as much as I hate to admit it, I am scared.",

      "text": "Location: Arkansas. In 2023 I had an estranged family member get arrested for theft and whatever he stole was worth enough to be a felony charge. When he was arrested he gave the cops my correct name and date of birth date but he gave them incorrect info on my social security number and address but the cops let him go and when he(technically i) didn’t show up for court i there was a warrant issued for my arrest. \n\nI wasn’t aware of any of this happening until after I had a warrant, after I found out I called the police and let them know that they had the wrong name for the person who committed this crime. They suggested I call the public defenders office and they PD got the warrant taken off. I still have emails showing that the finger prints that were taken the night of “my” arrest were the same finger prints of my family members previous arrest. I had to send photos of myself and it looks nothing like the mugshot of my family member when he used my name, he has long hair and glasses I have short hair/no glasses.  \n\nI recently was denied a job because of this felony still being on my record. For whatever reason I assumed it would be off my record when the warrant was taken off.  I’ve tried to call the police department, prosecuting attorneys office, and public defenders office and it they all keep telling me they can’t help me or to call elsewhere, the prosecuting attorneys office say they can’t help me because technically I’m the defendant. \n\nHow can I get this felony off of my record and how can I get the person who committed this felony and stole my identity held accountable for their actions?  The person who did this is not a good person as and has used other family members names in the past multiple times when he has been arrested and has a very extensive criminal history and he is getting away with this",

      "text": "We were at my place alone and I noticed his phone set up in the bathroom with the camera facing the toilet. \nIt wasn’t recording or anything so I was hoping he just forgot it there. \nThen he tried it again in my bedroom to see me get dressed for work. \nWhen I grabbed the phone it was on the camera and then it quickly went to the Home Screen. So I knew he was watching through his Apple Watch. I’m not sure if he was necessarily recording or just watching. \n\nMy boyfriend and I called him a couple days later and he admitted it. I recorded part of the conversation. In the video you can hear him say “I was being pervy. I was being gross” and him apologizing.\n\nPeople keep telling me to take legal action but do you think I have enough evidence to do anything? \nI don’t know if I necessarily want him to go to jail or anything but I want to at least sue him…cause this shit has really fucked me up..\n\nUPDATE: I took everyone’s advice and went to the police. I hesitated taking it that far cause I honestly didn’t feel like dealing with all of it.\nThat’s why I brought up the option of suing because I thought it would be a way for him to get consequences without jail. Not necessarily cause I just want money from all this. \n\n\nBut that would be a selfish decision on my part because if he just walks free then he will do it to someone else. If he’s capable of doing this to someone he’s considered a close friend for 4 years, why wouldn’t he do this to someone else? He’s been close with my boyfriend for even longer. Since kindergarten… and this has been affecting him as well. \n\nAs much as it sucks to do this to someone who was our friend, it must be done…\n\nI gave my statement and sent them the video of him admitting it. They said a judge will go over everything and decide if it fits the criteria of the crime. If it does, there will be a warrant out for his arrest. \n\nANOTHER UPDATE: \nSo they told me that the video was not enough evidence because he didn’t straight up admit what he did. So they brought him in for questioning. I called for an update a few days later and they said they are going through with the charges. I don’t know if that means he confessed or what. The person on the phone with me didn’t know all the details. So now he has to appear in court and they will let me know if they need me to go as well. That’s the last thing I’ve heard! \n\nUPDATE 9 months later:\n\nHe is being charged with two felony counts of video voyerism (auto correct won’t help me with this one 💀) which he plead not guilty to. And I now have a no contact order against him. \n\nHe has had several court dates but every time he goes, they seem to just schedule another one so it’s definitely going to be a long process. \n\n\n\nFeel free to follow the case here:\n\n[https://publicportal.courts.ri.gov/app/RegisterOfActions/#/9821DF3E4E95A6CD0B7868BBC78D606E56EDF47E2D71A9A04AF8F77404882C6F/anon/portalembed](https://publicportal.courts.ri.gov/app/RegisterOfActions/#/9821DF3E4E95A6CD0B7868BBC78D606E56EDF47E2D71A9A04AF8F77404882C6F/anon/portalembed)",

      "text": "Location: IL\n\nHello, this is my first time posting here, but I've had this thought in my head for a while and wanted to see if I can get any advice. So, a few years ago, my friends and I were out drinking at a bar, and near the end of last call, we decided to sit on the town's sidewalk across from the bars. I happened to see a couple of guys arguing aggressively, so I pulled out my camera and quietly recorded them. Two guys were fighting outside the bar; only one of them threw a punch, though. The guy that threw the punch knocked out the other guy, and he hit the concrete hard, then got back up. The guy swung at him again, and he fell to the floor for a second time. Then the guy who hit him left while the victim was lying on the ground unconscious. A stranger or his buddy, I'm not too sure, tried to pull him up, and he was unconscious and limp. He finally got to his feet and was bleeding heavily and stumbled away, and to this day, I have no idea what happened after that.\n\nI wanted to know if I went to the police department to share this video with them in case it would help them with anything and help me clear my mind. Could I face any charges for not contacting the police or submitting the video? I didn't stay long for the police to arrive (if they did) and have not heard anything about that night since. I just recently came across the video.\n\nThank you for any help. I want to take the video, but I'm not sure if I'd be in trouble or if I'd be any help.\n\n\nEdit for more info: I just saw the date on the video, and it has been about 4 years and 2 months. Does this mean that they wouldn't care to have the video?",

A search warrant was executed and all I was told by the detective was they found more, he said they found “enough”. He couldn’t tell me if it was more pics or videos, if they were of the same family members I originally reported being in a photograph, etc. just that they found enough to arrest and charge him on 3 counts of possession of child pornography a 3rd degree felony. That was last year and we have been waiting for his indictment since. Today, I was contacted by his pre trial officer, she said I was listed as a victim and that as part of the accused’s release terms, he has a no contact order for me, one of his victims. This is the first I’m hearing that I am a victim. I was a minor when living with this person who was an adult at that time, a “father figure” so around that age difference between him and me. It is possible definitely that he took discreet video or pictures of me as a minor when he lived in my home. Can this be a mistake, it has to be? I was never contacted to identify myself in any evidence they collected. Is there a way law enforcement can identify a victim without their cooperation? I would cooperate of course if asked, but I never have been. They gave me the run around all day to get answers! I left messages with the DA and detective and victims advocate. Just looking for peace of mind until someone calls me back! Please, is there a way this is possible? Or does it sound like a mistake and they listed me, the person who reported the crime, as a victim on accident? Please I am physically ill at the possibility I am one of his victims.",

      "text": "Location: Maine, USA\n\nMy adult stepsister lives with my Dad and has a long history of drug use, theft from their home, etc. She had already faced legal repercussions once for this, about 7 years ago, after an immense amount of theft from the home one of which being a gun which is a felony. Yes, I know it’s absolutely insane that he still allows her to live there, don’t even get me started. \n\nShe’s back into the drug world currently, and my father received an anonymous call from someone in her circle who was concerned he was going to be a victim of her again and wanted to notify us of what they had been observing, one of which was my stepsister with $14,000 in cash that they were concerned may have come from our home. Lo and behold, it was then discovered that there was exactly $14,000 in cash missing from my father’s safe, theft of which is also a felony in my state. As an extra layer of salt in the wound, the $14,000 was given to my Dad by his dying father, for safe keeping to distribute amongst the siblings when he dies. As far as I know, no action has been taken because he doesn’t like to ‘ruffle feathers’ and doesn’t want to cause household issues/issues with his wife. She needs to be held accountable. Is there anything I can do",

      "text": "Hello all,\n\nI am located in NYC and I was the victim of a slashing in 2019. My assailants attacked me unprovoked at a gathering hosted by a family member at their home. Myself and 3 other attendees were attacked and slashed with a knife by a group of men that were looking to harm the host due to a previous issue that the victims were not made privy to.\n\nThere was a restraining order against one the assailants and the other who did the majority of the slashing is known to the police. I was never called in to pick anyone out of a line up or to file any charges. I called back again in the beginning of 2020 and they said that since they were unable to reach myself, any of the victims, the homeowners, etc. (which was a complete lie as no-one received any kind of phone calls, written communications, emails etc.) they had to drop the charges against the one that I had a restraining order against due to lack of evidence (which they never collected from myself or anyone involved). They essentially said there was nothing to be done about that but I could still file charges against the one who cut me and the detective would call me in to follow up. I called again and was told due to COVID there were delays and the detectives will reach out to me eventually. After hearing nothing, I reached out to my local Council Member, and again nothing was done. It is now 2025 and I know it has been almost 6 years since this happened, but does anyone know what I can possibly do to get justice. I have been walking around in fear as my attackers are likely still in the same city as I am. I have severe trauma and PTSD. I have lost my career and have been permanently disfigured. I am considering hiring a lawyer to handle this as well. Does anyone have any suggestions or advice?\n\nLocation: New York",

      "title": "Airbnb guests defaced the property, filmed themselves doing so and are profiting from it on YouTube. ",
      "text": "I'll try and keep this as brief as possible. I have several Airbnb rentals located in what can briefly been described as an artists' compound, where we regularly host well-known/world-class artists and perfomers, and encourage them to create here. Until this point, all the Airbnb guests have been almost universally respectful and appreciative of the art and the grounds here in general. However, I just had the worst guests ever in the 5 years I've been doing this.\n\n\n They were a group of skaters and street artists, who took it upon themselves to tag various walls and structures and objects all over my property, as well as a trailer on my neighbors property. They also saw fit to paint large pieces of \"art\" on the front of my refrigerator, as well as OVER an existing commissioned art piece from a much more well-known and valued artist on a wall outside and spray painting several sculptures. In addition to defacing the art, they also broke into an art installation, breaking down a wall and tearing down/stealing the components of it before tagging their name in there as well just so there was no mistaking who was responsible.\n\nI filed a complaint with Airbnb, and despite the thousands of dollars in damage done, I intended to leave it at that because in general I believe in not involving police or criminal charges in instances not involving violent crime. \n\nHowever, yesterday I stumbled upon their YouTube channel, where I learned that they weren't just a couple of skateboarders... they were here filming a video for their skateboard magazine, which has several hundred thousand subscribers. Te video itself is monetized and nearing a million views. Of course, right there in the video, clear as can be, was footage of them defacing the artwork on my property.\n\nThe fact that they are not just some broke skater kids, and are in fact profiting from vandalizing my property as part of their seemingly-successful business model (including their website which seems to be selling quite a bit of merch, and I assume a print magazine) has motivated me to seek some sort of compensation, and I'm wondering if it is possible or advisable to file in small claims court without filing criminal charges?\n\nThoughts? Any advice or recommendations would be greatly appreciated. I've brought cases to small claims court before, but they were just over accidentally damaged rentals with signed contracts and bills that went unpaid, not willful destruction like this, and I'm unsure if that's the right avenue to take this time. Thanks so much. \n\nEDIT: I knew Reddit wouldn't be able to grasp the nuances of this situation. But in short: This is not a million dollar company. Nor are these multi-millions worth of airbnbs (in fact, the property was purchased for $5000... I'll leave it at that). No it's not thrasher. I stand by my refusal to involve the police when I'm just looking for basic compensation. Airbnb has been no help whatsoever. Just because other artists are invited to stay here does not remotely imply that it's open for paying Airbnb guests to paint their own pieces, let alone over them, that's absurd -- and sounds to me like arguing that if Asher Roth purchased a ticket to see Eminem, he could not be held responsible for storming the stage and attempting put on a performance louder than the ticketed event. \n\nAnd finally, while I do genuinely thank the people who offered actual help and constructive suggestion, clearly I need to stop using Reddit, as the user base seems to have devolved into nothing but confused 19-year-olds who can't even fathom life outside of their comfort zones, and because they grew up strictly in this post-9/11 corporate-run American hellscape, they automatically assume the mere act of owning a business must by default mean that the owner of that business is a) wealthy and b) hurting their community in some way rather than being a part of it. And then they fail to see the futlity in decrying \"late-stage capitalism\" while advocating for police involvement... which is genuinely concerning. The police protect the wealthy and the wealthy alone, and they are otherwise only interested in ruining lives and keeping the for-profit prison system operating for purposes which involve modern slavery. I'm shocked at how vindictive the majority of the people who responded seem to be. Anyway... this sure was eye-opening.",

I record him coming out of his room after the police leave and have him screaming at us, taunting us saying things that would show he is knowingly abusing the system to stay here and threatening us. I also have a video of him taking a guitar from the room he was in, coming out, and throwing it on the floor. After this, he wants to prove to us that'll happen every time we call so he calls again and ends up hanging up on the dispatcher, frustrated. the same police come back, and they talk through the window while I invite them in, he flips out saying they can't come into the house because he didn't invite them, then he backpedals and say they can't come into the room. he then later leaves the room and I wasn't watching so I can't say in what sense, but they ended up taking him away for assaulting an officer. My mom has gone to the commissioner to get an order to have him out asap. I don't know how long this will take and I'm terrified if they release him tonight, he will come back but that's beside the point.\n\nI realize this is probably word salad but partly because I'm still pretty much having an anxiety attack and partly because I don't know what is relevant. Are the recordings I took of him from my phone while he came into the living room valid, or would it violate 2-party consent and lead to me having my own problems down the line?",

      "text": "Location: Florida/Utah\n\nI don't know how much backstory this requires to get a decent answer, so I'll try to summarize best I can. A while back I was watching one of the live cop shows, and they had a \"wanted\" segment for a guy in Utah who broke into a car and stole a garage door opener from a car at the airport and used it to live in their house for a week while they were on a family vacation. He ultimately stole over 20,000 dollars in cash and jewelry, and stole their second car when he left.\n\nThey showed a very clear, very lengthy surveillance video of him at the airport and he was IMMEDIATELY recognizable to me. I knew this guy, and I knew him very well. He was a childhood friend of mine in Florida who grew up to be just an absolutely horrible person. Conman/sheister/local vagrant. He has extremely recognizable tattoos on his leg and arms which are easily seen in the video. I know his name, where he grew up, where his family is. I know his Facebook and Instagram accounts showing all of his tattoos that are clearly visible in the video. So after a few days of contemplating what to do, I felt obligated to let somebody know, if only because of how violated this family was by this guy. He absolutely ransacked their house. Slept in their beds, went through every inch of their lives for a week straight.\n\nMy mistake may have been not going to the police, but instead I reached out to the home owner on social media after a quick search. Keep in mind this happened maybe 6 months before I first saw that surveillance footage, so I had no idea if they had anything at all or if they had just given up really trying to find the guy who did this. So I reached out, and I told him everything I knew. I sent side by side pictures of his tattoos from his Facebook and the footage and it's very clearly the same person. They had what they needed. The funny thing is...the guy NEVER responded..I didn't push, I let it go, and completely forgot all about it.\n\nThis was February of 2024 when I contacted the homeowner. Now, yesterday in June 2025, I get a lengthy text message from a mutual friend  that I had not spoken to in YEARS. He tells me that he  read \"the discovery documents of the message I sent to the homeowner\" and now our friend is \"potentially facing 7 felonies and 15 years in prison\". He continued on about how it was messed up I could do this to our friend like that. I told nobody about that message I sent to the homeowner, and I was kind of hoping to stay anonymous in this, and I'm being told that message is now potentially a discovery document in a felony trial. So that parts out the window it looks like\n\nI guess what I'm asking is, what should I expect from this?  I don't know whether he was arrested in Florida or in Utah or somewhere else, but it's pretty clear that he was arrested because of the information that I shared. If anyone wants to know more I can post the link to the story for more context.",

      "title": "The man who molested me and my siblings is threatening to sue us for defamation because I called him out on Facebook",
      "text": "For some background info: I 25F, was molested as a child by my mom's boyfriend for a few years. This happened in Georgia. He also molested my older sister and younger brother. My sister told my dad what was happening to her, and the police did an investigation. My mother defended him, and me and my brother were unable to be honest with the police, so the case was dropped. As a step in my healing process, I decided to make a post on facebook (which I never use and all my friends on there are people from the small town I grew up in). The post just stated what happened to me and my siblings, included his full name, and that I wanted to make the town aware so that this wouldn't happen to any more children. I used the words \"molest\" and \"pedophile.\" The response was immediate and was 100% supportive. People began messaging me and talking to me about different experiences with him. None were crimes, but they were all creepy and concerning situations involving children. His own sister and niece messaged me and told me they believed me. His sister actually later called the elementary school at which his great-nephew attends and told them that he's a pedophile and is not allowed around her grandson). I made this post a little over a month ago. On friday, my sister and I received a packet in the mail from a lawyer representing my mom's ex. We are being accused of defamation. All my sister did was share my post. Apparently, he has also filed a police report. The letter also states, \"Your allegations were investigated on ........ 2007 by investigator ......... and case worker ........... The investigation concluded that the claims were unfounded...\"\n\nFun fact, I never alleged anything. How can my claims be proven unfounded if I never claimed anything. They even included pictures of the entire police report which names me as \"Sister of the accuser.\" Like did this lawyer even read it?\n\nIt says that me and my sister both have to make apology posts on facebook. The lawyer wrote a hilarious script that he wants us to use. It's insanely long and literally includes: Upon further reflection and verification, I have come to realize that my statement was inaccurate and misleading. It's a full retraction and apology and apology of the claims and sounds like it was written by chatgpt. His client also threatens to seek Punitive, general and compensatory damages along with attorney fees and costs. If me and my sister want to avoid litigation, we must delete the initial post and make the retraction statement. And we have to send a response in writing by this Friday March 21st.\n\nI'll make something clear. There isn't a singular reality where me or my sister makes that post retracting the allegation. If anything, I want to double down and make a second post. I'm afraid that if I immediately respond via lawyer that it'll scare off his attorney.\n\nMy ultimate goal here is to counter-sue him. Me, my sister, and the molester all live in different states. I'm in NC and she's in FL. What should I do next? My brother and sister both confirmed that they would be happy to go on the stand and recount what happened in court. I'm also quite sure that there are many other people who would as well. (Specifically, his sister and niece who don't let him around his great-nephew, my older cousin who lived with us at the time and confronted the molester when he came over to the house while my mom wasn't home to \"cuddle\" with us. My cousin new nothing at the time but obviously knew that was weird as hell. The confrontation that ensued was apparently very intense.)\n\nAnyway, I'm a bit overwhelmed and would really love to hear from someone who knows more about this.\n\nEDIT: Since the post is now locked, I would like to clarify a few things.\n\nOne: Of course I'm going to find a lawyer, I felt like that was so obvious that there was no need to add it.\n\nTwo, the \"investigation\" was not a real investigation. There's a specific thread of comments that are very loud and very wrong. I can't reply to ya'll directly, so I'll do it here.\n\nYou assume I'm stupid for assuming I could possibly win the case because \"These are the same testimonies that weren't found credible on a police investigation, not newly found witnesses or testimonies that were ignored the first time.\"\n\nEvery single thing you said is actually 100% wrong. The testimonies of his sister, niece, and my cousin were not a part of the police investigation. They are quite literally newly found witnesses that WERE ignored the first time. It amazes me the faith that some of you have in the legal system. Do you know how I was involved in the investigation? Some cops came to my house, took me outside, and asked me \"when he touches you, is it a good touch, or a bad touch?\" And because I didn't want to get in trouble, I said \"in-between.\" And then the police left and never spoke to me again. That's it.\n\nThree: When I said I never alleged anything, I thought it was obvious that I was referring to in the past, in reference to the original investigation of my sister's claims. But I see this caused some confusion. I'm saying the letter from the lawyer specifically says \"He was cleared of YOUR allegations in 2007.\" He was not cleared of MY allegations in 2007 because I didn't make any allegations until February 2025! He was only cleared of my Sister's allegations.",

Would the therapist be obligated (or likely) to report that, and if they did, would that lead to legal consequences for the instance that already occurred?",

I'm a hairstylist who specializes in nurodivergent kids and kids with higher needs. Im the only stylist in the surrounding area with this specialty. I have a pretty good reputation with kids and their families and my clients trust me. I've been very transparent about the legal battle my family has been dealing with. My husband was accused of a crime against a child before I had even met him. Given the circumstances of the case, his charecter, and his past, I fully believe he is innocent and am working with a good lawyer to clear his name. Unfortunately living in a small town it's been on the news. One other stylist who i worked with for a short period of time but I thought we had gotten along great, has taken apon herself to tell every single person who comes into her shop that I am just like Jeffery epsteins wife and am using my clientele to find victims for my husband. This is absurd and completely baseless and has nothing to do with the actual case. Im not involved in my husband's case in anyway whatsoever.  My current clients know this and think it's insane. Its gotten to the point where people who I dont know are going to my bosses (I have two jobs) and insulting them for working with me. So there are people who are believing her. Im afraid it's going to hurt the businesses I work for, and hurt my ability to get new clients. Is there anything I can do legally to make her stop?",

      "text": "Location: Georgia\n\nI live in Los Angeles now but all of this took place in Georgia in 2006 and 2007.\n\nMy best friend died recently and we were both really into public storytelling—think like, The Moth, or Risk… those types of podcasts. I’ve been workshopping a story to honor him and what we went through together but I’m wondering if I might be putting myself in legal jeopardy.\n\nI know this is not a storytelling subreddit, and I plan to refer to most of this obliquely, if at all, in the story, so I’m going to try to eschew the humor and lay out the bare facts—everything I think could possibly be relevant legally:\n\n1. My friend was a gay man whose parents didn’t accept him. We met the day we moved to college in 2003. He was 17 and about to turn 18 and I was already 18. His parents knew he was gay but threatened to cut him off financially if he didn’t change his sexual orientation.\n\n2. He had a really hard time in school and flunked out at the end of 2005. He didn’t tell his parents. We were living together in an apartment and they continued to send him checks for rent.\n\n3. When tuition would have been due in early 2006 for spring semester that year, his parents wanted to know how they could pay. He wasn’t enrolled any more but wanted to hide that from them. I helped him set up a system using PayPal where his parents thought they were paying tuition directly to the university—on their credit card statement it looked like they were paying tuition—but the money went directly into his checking account. We did this in January 2006, August 2006, and January 2007. I don’t remember the exact amounts but I estimate the total of all three transactions to be between $8,000-$9,500.\n\n4. In Spring 2007 they expected him to graduate. He made excuses for why they shouldn’t attend graduation but they still wanted to see a diploma. I made a fake diploma for him that was very convincing. It satisfied them. As far as I know it’s still hanging on the wall in their house. He never falsely presented it as a credential for employment or in any other context—just to placate his parents. He eventually did finish his degree on his own and moved on to bigger and better things.\n\nMy question is: if I tell parts of this story and the whole truth comes out, can I still be criminally or civilly liable even though all of this happened at least 18 years ago? Again, everything that occurred took place in Georgia. Thanks for reading.",

I tried to ask the detective some follow up questions and was shut down very quickly, he told me he could not give me any more information about the investigation. I learned about FOIL and am considering using that to request access to the records associated with the investigation because I just want to know what happened, I’ve spent a long time with a lot of unanswered questions. I’m just not sure where to start with that process. Is FOIL something people consult a lawyer about?

      "title": "Neighbors destroyed water lines to shared source that our deed states I have water rights to.",
      "text": "Location: New York \n\nI live on an old, decommissioned farm. The previous owners and their family had originally owned hundreds of acres since the 1800’s, but had sold off more and more of their land as time went on. We bought the house in the early 2000’s, along with the remaining 4-5 acres that they still owned, while the surrounding, sold off land had mostly been bought by real estate developers and been untouched since the 1970’s. \n\nOur previous owners had dug a pond to use as a water source for farming well before selling off any of their land. We continued using this pond as a water source, for our own farming/gardening and even in emergencies/droughts as our main source of water is a well which can vary by season or weather. This pond is right next to the shared property line. While the pond is not on our property, the original owner had put in the deed while selling that he and his property (now ours) kept water rights to the pond and the right to have a line going to it.\n\nIn recent years, someone bought the neighboring ~40 acres of woods from whatever developer owned it, built a house and started clearing it all out to turn into a grass lawn. While clearing it, they saw our water line and pump and destroyed it all with a bulldozer, pushing it all onto our land in a big mangled pile. \n\nInitially I brushed it off as a mistake and didn’t want to deal with an already aggressive and confrontational neighbor. They also clearly have significantly more money than us which is always daunting when it comes to disputes. This past year however, I went up to check out the pond and look into setting up another water line since this year was particularly dry and we were preparing our yearly garden and wanted a better water source than our own hose.\n\nThey must have hunting cameras set up because shortly after going up to the pond, we got a threatening letter thrown on our doorstep from the neighbor saying if we ever go there again they’ll resort to legal action and if we set up any waterline or pump they’ll destroy it “just like last time” (this being the first time it was confirmed that they destroyed the water line intentionally). I was sort of taken aback that they didn’t just talk to us and wrote a threatening letter instead, both when they initially destroyed it and the recent development - but they seem very much ‘from out of town’ and have no interest in being neighborly/friendly. I even bumped into the guys wife in the neighborhood just on a walk and I said something to the extent of like “Hey, I’m sorry I didn’t mean to offend, when we moved in that waterline was already built and we were told we had water rights to the pond” sort of like a ‘ha-ha that letter was a little uncalled for..?’ And she responds “well just be thankful it was a letter and not in person” implying.. idk, “be glad you didn’t talk to my husband in person” like a threat in itself(?)\n\nAnyway, the property since initially being sold in the 1970’s has been passed around multiple developing companies before this current owner. I went to the town and got all previous deeds to see if the water rights were included in those deeds, and it seems with each purchase the deed was essentially a boiler plate template with only the specific lot’s property line being updated with each sale - and for the ‘details’ of the property, each deed just referred back to the previous deed, going all the way back to the original 1970 sale that included we and our property would maintain water rights to the pond. I’m including a quote from the initial 1970 sale below:\n\n“The party of the first part, his successors and assigns shall have the perpetual right to use the water from the pond located near the\nexcepted 4.073 acre parcel, and to lay, repair and/or replace pipes from the buildings located on said parcel to said pond and to enter\non the aforedescribed 118 acre parcel of land to do so.”\n\nI guess my question is how much legal standing do we have and how hard we should go after these people for damages or anything of the sort? I’m not looking for revenge or payout, I just want access to the water and to not deal with them again.\nAlso if the above language was written in a “mortgage to bond” that all proceeding deeds referred to, saying “all premises are the same” does that have an effect on its validity? Does that standing disappear once the land had been transferred multiple times (even if each time the deed states ‘refer to previous deed’)?\n\nTLDR: Neighboring property has a pond that our deed states we have water rights to and have been using for years. New neighbors destroyed our waterline and started threatening us when I looked into replacing\n\nEDIT: I’m including the note left at our door just to give an idea of the type of person we’re dealing with. While it in itself doesn’t add much to the legality of all this, it does paint a picture as to their ‘unhinged’ attitude and why we might worry about them retaliating or anything of the sort. Again, this is the note the wife referred to when she said “you’re lucky it was a note and not in person”:\n\nhttps://imgur.com/a/9Z58eMO",

      "text": "My brother (27M) and I (29M) lost our mother in October. Shortly after that, my brother got an eviction notice from the apartment complex where he lived with her. Short of it is, she was the only income, he hadn't worked in over a year, and rent wasn't paid. He got evicted, and   my husband (26M) and I offered to let him come stay with us in our home in New York. He hated Arizona, wanted a fresh start, and *promised* he'd changed and shaped up. He had not. After a month of trying to get him to do *anything* to better his situation, we had enough of his laziness and entitlement and kicked him out. All legal, all above board, all in accordance with NY law, and not the subject of the post. However, we were gracious enough to let him store his valuables, including a state of the art gaming PC he built himself and multiple hard drives, at our home until he finds something permanent.\n\nA few days later, I happened to look him up to see if he was still posting online; he may be an entitled lazy dipshit but he's still my little brother and I still felt love and duty towards him. And I found an online wiki-style article detailing potential *actual crimes*. Cyber stalking, including of a minor; talking to and about a minor re:sexual shit; general online harassment campaigns. Now I have no plans of speaking to him ever again, but I worry about the computer and what might be on it. What if he has CSA material on it? I mean, he sexually harassed a *kid* to the point that they tried to kill themselves. What if he's done and downloaded worse? \n\nI paid to have that PC shipped to my home. I don't know what's on it. If I were to search it and find illegal stuff on it, am I liable for having unknowingly transported a potential stash of illegal material across state lines? Is it illegal to go through it? *Should* I go through it? Should I call local police and say \"hey, I *just* found out my brother might have committed crimes *seven years ago* in another state and I worry about what might be on his hard drives?\" I don't know what I should do or if there is a correct action here or if I'm on the hook. I'm not necessarily freaking out but the fact that there might be a cybercrime bomb in my guest bedroom is not a comforting thought.\n\nTL;DR: **Moved my brother into my home temporarily out of pity, kicked him out, then found out he very likely committed crimes. Now I have his computer sitting in my house and I have suspicions of what might be on it. Am I criminally liable if I find out I unknowingly paid to have a CP bomb shipped to my house???**\n\n***SMALL UPDATE:*** sent in an email to my local police to explain the situation and my suspicions. Saved the page I found that detailed my brother's online behavior so I can pass it on. Reaching out to some of his ex-friends to see if I can find out more info to pass on to police, especially regarding the harassment of that minor.",

      "text": "Location: South Dakota, United States\n\nMy best friend has been wrong accused and jailed on a charge of child abuse in reference to a crime that happened a little over a year and a half ago. She’s a single mother of two with literally no support system other than a couple close friends, including my boyfriend and I. \n\nOn Saturday, 3/29/25, police showed up to her house and arrested her and she’s in jail on a 10k bond. She had court on Monday and the judge refused to lower it to a cash surety. The story is not mine to tell, but here are the basics.  \n\nShe was in an abusive relationship but the man was always amazing to her child, until one day he wasn’t. She was at work when it happened and her child was under the care of the man. Her roommate heard it and all and did nothing. She immediately took her child to the hospital when she returned home and DSS took the child. The kid was placed in the care of her abusive aunt and uncle who got custody of her when she was a teenager. She’s been fighting ever since to get the kid back and is genuinely the best mother ever. She would do anything for her kids. \n\nHer other child was taken later the same night she got arrested, and DSS claimed the other child was abused and neglected. I personally lived with this baby and her after she left her husband while she needed a place to stay, and this is the most loved baby ever. She has so many toys, and is rich with love. She’s also a very large and healthy and smart baby, and I had seen the baby a few days before she was taken and she was perfectly happy and healthy, chubby and cute, only thing wrong was she had a diaper rash. \n\nI have no clue what else to do, she’s an amazing mom and I know she didn’t do anything wrong. She doesn’t do drugs, just drinks occasionally on the weekends and never around her kids. Any advice??",

      "text": "Location: Philadelphia PA my Girlfriend is going to college at temple university in Philadelphia. I visit her quite often and have to travel though a high crime area sometimes when I get close to where she lives. She has a house that is a couple blocks from a high crime / open air drug market,  the closest grocery store that I would walk to is in the bad part. I have been stoped twice, once in a car and once while walking.  I circled around the area for a few minutes to find a spot big enough to park my car. I finally found a spot, parked and started following my gps to her house. I walked down a treat and as I turned the corner  I was stopped by a few officers.  They said they knew I was there to buy drugs and said they had to search me. I told them no but they kept going and ended up searching me. I didn’t have anything illegal and they let me go. How am I supposed to know what blocks they sell on or where I can and can’t walk?\n\nI am wondering is this legal for them to search me just because I walked down a street that supposedly sells drugs ?  I guess they saw me go down  the top of the street  and stopped me on the other side / end  of the street. Don’t they need probable cause  to search someone ?  It’s mostly just annoying and wastes a few minutes of my time but I think they are wrong.   I would assume even if I did have a drug or something it would get thrown out in court. It seems like they don’t like to follow the rules / laws to try and intimidate people. \n\nIf it ever happens again what can I say to avoid it? Can I just ask if I am being detained and if they say no just keep walking ?\n\n\nWhat are your thoughts ?",

      "text": "Location: Atlanta, GA.  \n\nTo make a long story very short, I use to work for my dad’s business. To my own lack of foresight I kept some firearms there for safe keeping in my office.(I had my own room)\n\nUnfortunately due to a legal battle with his former business partner the business went into receivership and was subsequently closed and liquidation was the next step.  Unfortunately my guns were in the building when it was shut down. \n\nDue to some weird legal things that I do not know enough about my dad ended up being held in contempt of court for 5 counts by not submitting 5 documents related to a business loan with 20 days for each count.  (my understanding). He is scheduled to get out in mid April. Most importantly, He let his lawyers go due to the cost of them before the final court order that closed the business basically going in pro se. (Ik VERY dumb.) \n\nThe guns. They’re a semi auto-matic .22, a 12GA Mossberg, and a mil-surp Carcano Rifle. My dad also had 2 other guns there. Total value of everything is maybe less than $1500 dollars. When I went to retrieve personal items, they refused to give me my firearms unless I had a receipt or something that I could prove it was mine. Okay, bet. \n\nI obtained a copy of a bill of sale for the carcano rifle cause my friend had sold me it and he needed a copy of it (mistake 1). It is my personal favorite and I do wish to have it back as much as possible. Made during WWII. \n\nI give bull of sale to the receiver and his former business partner. They refuse further to give me back the rifle. And say they are surrendering them to the county sheriff’s office and they will be basically background checked. They will have another hearing later after the checks are completed. \n\nThe thing is, the Carcano rifle, the one firearm that I gave them a bill of sale for, has been giving the most trouble. The receiver has called the detective in charge of investigating the firearms with questions about the validity of it. He called my friend who sold it to me asking about the validity of it. Because it wasn’t made in the U.S. it’s exempt from a few laws and they can’t really identify the maker of the gun. Even though Beretta imported it. \n\nMy question is basically, will the judge release my gun(s) to me???? I cannot see any reason as to why they would. Outside of one reason. The receiver and his former partner have it out for my dad and my sister and I. He’s threaten to arrest me for doing nothing, my sister as well. Was rude to my friend when he asked him about selling me the gun. He’s very much a ✨dick✨ and his former business partner. \n\nI don’t care if I lose the other guns, just not the one I have a receipt for. (Carcano)",

Everything seemed to be going well until he got arrested about 2 weeks ago. We live in Idaho and the boyfriend is being flown back to New Mexico. He claims he’s innocent but he is being charged with homicide. He claims he was kidnapped by the cartel with his neighbor and the neighbor was found dead. He claims he was held captive for 4 months and was able to escape. Once he got back into the US he claimed he was cleared, but the feds showed up a couple weeks ago and arrested him and are taking him back to New Mexico. Now I love my brother dearly, but he swears up and down his boyfriend is innocent. I don’t know if I buy this because I feel there must now be some serious evidence against his boyfriend if they are flying him back and are going to try and charge him with murder…I don’t know much about the legal system but I feel there is no way he is completely innocent. Is this something that happens often? I’m telling my brother he needs to let this guy go but he is so love drunk he really believes he is innocent. He is about to pack up his life and move to New Mexico to support him. Is there even a slight chance he really is innocent? I appreciate any insight. \n\nLocation: Idaho",

We’re related biologically but I adopted them after they were taken away from a family member and they’re all siblings. A few hours ago ago I discovered on my 13 yo son’s computer (which he has for online schooling and I monitor)a discord account where he’s been having conversations with people from his online school and that he met on Roblox. In these conversations it is clear that he has created this whole fake identity and persona where he brags about doing drugs and being in a gang and lies about our living situation when in reality, he lives a comfortable life in a gated complex in a nice neighborhood.  He has been confronted about lying for even the littlest things and making things up almost daily. The problem comes from in some of these messages. He is sending links to a Gore website where they cut peoples limbs off, and he makes mentions of going on 4 chan where he says he has come across inappropriate content, including adult and minors. He also brags about being on the dark web and finding a website that is of child 🌽\nHe also made a message asking about bestiality and how it works. He’s been sending who knows what content across multiple platforms/accounts and asking others for nudes. I don’t know how much of it is real, This is a boy who doesn’t even curse in real life or leave the home because he is homeschooled. I know that something has to be done about this, but I don’t know how to go about it because I am worried and scared about my other children being removed even though they are all well taken care of, and there’s never been any form of neglect or abuse",

It’s not, “continuous use,” but the only other option is to select the last date I used it, which was a year ago when I moved - but I’m guessing they will assume I was regularly using it up until that point which isn’t the case. I don’t want to lie and say I never used it at all, but I also don’t want to admit to the crime of driving around all the time in it, because I legitimately didn’t do that. What am I supposed to do here?",

      "title": "Roomate got arrested for child pornography. What now?",
      "text": "I apologize for this being long. My brain is very scattered and I am a tad traumatized. \n\nLocation: NC. I will try not to list any specific personal information. I am living with my two roomates. We've lived together for a while and one of them is my best friend who I've known like 8 years, and the other is his friend from college. I was not too close with him, but we all got along decently. \n\n So yesterday morning I was woken by loud banging, and had barely enough time to put on shorts before opening the door to what seemed to be an army of police and investigators outside. They pulled me out into the breezeway and stormed in and went through everything. They had my best friend ziptied and brought him over to me, and were pulling my third roomate out of his room, also ziptied. I was not ziptied, just told to sit. They brought us all unto the livingroom and sat us down, and after looking around some more they took my two roomates into separate rooms.\n\n They would not tell me anything until after about an hour of grilling my third roomate and then bringing him back out to the living room to arrest him. Just that they were there because they suspected a crime has been comitted. My best friend was in the other room and they brought him out shortly after, but they let him go. They went through all of our devices and our rooms, and then confiscated my third roomate's electronics. They didn't question me, except to ask me how long we'd been living in our apartment and how long we've lived together, and if I knew what was going on. It was then I was informed that they were there for child pornography. \n\nApparently my third roomate was talking to minors and buying and exchanging child pornography with other pedophiles on kik. He was using private browsers and VPNs, but I think either kik or our internet provider reported suspicious activity. The police didn't know who they were after until they searched our place. I am assuming they weren't very interested in me because the child pornography was male on male, and the suspect was obviously male based off the interactions listed on the warrant. The police have been investigating for about 6 months. \n\nMy best friend and I are absolutely horrified and pretty traumatized from both the raid and reading the warrant. It was very graphic and descriptive. We had no idea we were living with such a horrible monster. I am still in shock and sick to my stomach. Everything still hasn't fully sunk in. This is not a case of a 16 year old lying about being 18. There were VERY young children/babies listed and the descriptions were GRAPHIC. Nothing physical occurred to my knowledge, it was all online activity. He was charged with second degree exploitation of a minor. \n\nMy question is what do we do now? Are they still going to be watching us? What do we do with our roomates stuff, legally,  if he doesn't come back, or if we have to vacate or remove him from the lease? I am the account holder for our internet. Do I need to worry? \n\nWe went to the front office to ask them to remove him from the lease. The police had not informed them of anything due to the office being closed when they showed up, so they were unaware that anything had happened. The office manager said she cannot make a decision without a copy of the warrant, so we provided it to her. I also sent an email follow up detailing what we talked about in the office just for our records. \n\nWe are very concerned about being evicted, so I am mentally preparing for that. Is there anything we can do to avoid it?  \n\nWe don't know what to do with his stuff. We can't just leave it, weather we get evicted or are able to remove him from the lease. But I don't know what we are allowed to do legally about it. The police told us we are not allowed to prevent him from coming back as long as his name is on the lease, so for now we are waiting until we know if we can remove him or are going to be evicted. \n\nWe are not expecting him to get out anytime soon. Almost his entire family is outside of the US amd the bail amount is extremely high. He also does not have any savings. \n\nThis entire situation is just so stressful and I am in complete shock. I was having sharp chest pains all day and felt like I was going to pass out or cry. I would really appreciate some advice on what the heck to do and what steps we need to take legally to protect ourselves. \n\n Thank you. \n\nEdit: Thank you so much for all the responses! I really appreciate the support and advice! I was feeling pretty lost.",

I didn’t realize my state (California) has a two party consent to recording statute. The conversation took place in a private location.

I’m just not sure if this is something I could use in a court of law if I wanted to press charges against this person. I also fear that, because it is an audio recording and the persons face is not in it, he could argue it wasn’t him I was speaking to? I’m not looking to get a restraining order because I’m moving very far away soon. I’m mostly worried that if I fail to report the incident, he could do harm to someone else.

      "text": "Location: Maryland, 18, I’ve been subpoenaed to court in 2 weeks in April for a court proceeding to testify and also another subpoena in May for trial - jury. Me and my ex broke up in January the beginning of the year and when the district office called me I asked if there’s a way I can avoid my ex because I don’t want to be in the same room with him or even around him. He said he’ll try to have us go in at a different day or time. He lives an hour away which is where we witnessed the crime happening, me and him were witnesses of a guy with like 7 charges all related to illegal possession of firearm and stuff. The thing is, I do not want to be anywhere around my ex or in the same room as him. He caused me so much pain to the point where I had to seek help from suicide hotline and I also go to therapy because of his cheating actions & the break up. Even to this day, it still hurts sometimes and I feel like the moment I see him in person I’m just gonna start sobbing… is there anything I can do to avoid it? I can gladly do it online and attend an online court but I do not want to drive down to where he lives an hour away and have flashbacks of memories. I’m pretty sure for the testify thing in April we would not see each other but in May it says “trial - jury” so I’m assuming we’d be in the same room together? Could my therapist provide documentation or anything so I don’t have to be in person in the same room as my ex?\n\nI know I’m only 18 and it’s probably not serious but this was my first relationship and going through so much traumatic events in that relationship has fucked up my mental health and I feel like if I see him in person again I’d be back at day 1 of healing. I’d really appreciate if anyone knows something I can do, thank you.",

      "text": "I live with my boyfriend in his house. Before I moved in, he had a roommate. Recently, the house was raided because of the roommate’s illegal online activity. The GBI and sheriff’s department had a warrant to search all electronics in the house, and they ended up collecting the roommate’s electronics and arresting him.\n\nGiven the nature of his crimes, I don’t think he’ll bond out—there’s no bail set, and he’s already facing a felony with more charges likely coming. We also don’t want him back at the house. His charges involve children, and we live in a neighborhood with kids, so it’s completely unacceptable. I asked the sheriff’s department what we should do with his stuff, but they didn’t give much guidance beyond suggesting we contact his family. Unfortunately, he wasn’t close with his family, so that’s not much help.\n\nMy boyfriend wants to throw everything out, but I’d rather handle this legally. My plan is to rent a storage unit, put his belongings there for two months, and send certified mail to his old address letting him know to collect his things.\n\nThe other issue is his two senior cats. I can’t care for them, and they need to go to a loving home where they’ll get the care he neglected to give them.\n\nI just want his stuff out of the house as soon as possible. It feels gross even having it here after what he did.\n\nEdit: Here is some other help information. We are in Ga. My bf dad own the house but he lives out of the country. There was no formal lease. Just a roommate agreement with rules. My bf was helping someone down on his luck and was trying to provide him a place to start over.

The cop ended up finding and confiscating one of those disposable plastic pill bags you can get at your local pharmacy in his work lunch bag. He uses those sometime to store Tylenol since he works at construction sites and it's just easier to store in his lunch bag. The cop lets him go with a warning and he thought that was the end of it. About a week later, he gets a summons to appear in court for a magistrate hearing for Class B Drug Possession. My husband is contacting legal services through his union but I guess I'm just trying to find out if this will hold up in court? I did ask him if he has a problem that he's been hiding and he said no. I have no reason not to believe him. What should he expect when he goes to court? First he didn't want to use a lawyer but his union has free legal services he can use. Since I've known him the past 14 years, he has never been arrested or in trouble with the law. \n\nLocation: Massachusetts",

      "text": "Due to an ownership change,  I have a new Landlord for my restaurant space who decided to increase all the NNN charges and claimed that everything was done legally according to the lease.\nAfter about 2 years I find out that some of these increases are not allowed according to my lease and I'm wondering whether it was even illegal for them to over bill me on some of these charges.\nThe biggest increase was the property tax component and it turns out that they over billed me by more than twice the amount that they actually paid to the state. According to my lease, they can bill me estimates but at the end of every year, they need to reconcile these estimates to what they actually paid to the state. They presented me with year end reconciliation bills that showed an over inflated tax number for the 2 parcels that are used to calculate my share of property taxes. They kept on saying that due to ownerchip change, the property value will be re-assessed so they were pre billing me for this expected increase. Well that wasn't allowed in the lease so for 2022 and 2023 they should have only billed me what they paid to the state. In Nov 2024 the reassessment finally happened and the new tax was only about 10 percent more, not more than doubled. They probably knew what the new tax bill was but decided to overcharge me anyway. This over charge alone would have costed me close to 100k over the duration of the lease.\nTo me it looks like the landlord was trying to steal from me and should be punished by either or both a large fine and prison sentence. However, I realize that they are a large corporation and probably wouldnt try this unless they can get away with this easily.",

      "text": "After my husband and I announced our engagement in 2011, his mother offered to help us buy our first home. The agreement was that she would pay the down payment and get the home in her name as she had great credit, my husband and I would pay the mortgage and taxes and when we were able to secure refinancing  in our names, she would sign the house over to us. This was presented as a wedding gift.\n\nI spent several months working with a realtor and finally found a home that fit out budget and was in a town near to our jobs. We ended up signing a \"lease agreement\" because without it,  we were unable to get utilities or insurance in our names. She has done little to no maintenence or repairs to this 100 year old house (aside from helping us out once with a plumbing issue we couldn't afford at the time). I was responsible for anything that broke in the home, even appliances required to be provided such as stoves, refrigerators, heating systems etc. because she said we were only renters on paper. \n\nA few years back, I was able to secure financing and was ready to proceed with the transfer. I even offered to not only repay her for the down payment, but also give her a share of the equity, even though that was not part of the original agreement. The house was purchased for around $100k and was estimated to be worth around $600k at that time. She originally said she would sign over ownership as soon as I was able to obtain financing that would pay off the remaining mortgage which she said was around 40k. \n\nShe kept changing her story, saying she already paid it off in full,  then she said she didn't. Just kept giving me the run around. I finally just stopped trying as it was infuriating and time consuming and I was dealing with my husband's mental health and addiction issues. \n\nSo we come to today. I have been making good faith payments on a home I was told would be mine for almost 14 years. My husband and I are now getting divorced. She has filed eviction papers against me alleging non payment of rent. I have proof that payments were made during the time she is claiming they weren't. My husband is now telling me that back when I tried to refinance, his mom put the house into a family trust with the stipulation that he would be allowed to live here as long as he lived. I have never seen this trust or truly know what it says. \n\nDo I have any case against her or my husband for the investment and maintence I have put in or the equity that has accrued? We would have been able to purchase our own home within a few years of our marriage without any help from her, but based on her assurances, I have instead basically bought a house for her and she stands to profit around $500k. At this point I believe she and my husband planned this from the beginning and he has admitted that to me. \n\nThere is a lot more to this, but this post is already so long. I'm happy to answer questions or provide more info if needed.",

I'm really upset about this because she basically told the other lady she would pay to get her car fixed out of pocket and then just started ignoring her and isn't planning on taking any responsibility, the other women had reported it to her Insurance already so I'm hoping they actually end up finding out the truth. I'm also really upset because she neglected to tell me she got into an accident with my daughter until the next day and even though my daughter is fine, never had her checked out. Legally what could happen to her? Will the other woman's insurance company find out she has a suspended license? She got a picture of her registration. Could I legally file a police report for child endangerment if I wanted to? Should I be reporting any of this? She told us she isn't going to stop driving and right now she has no plans to get her license reinstated.",

I don’t even live there. I live in Michigan. I’ve never been summoned, never received any court notice, and I only found out when ADP emailed me randomly saying my wages would be garnished.\n\nI’ve called ADP, I’ve called the law firm. ADP told me I need to get a court order to stop the garnishment, but when I called the law firm, they said they can’t do anything and and that even now they can’t even speak to me and that I “have to wait for the investigation,” which could take up to a month. Meanwhile, they keep taking money from me every single week.  The craziest part is the file they have is for someone with the same name as me, but a “Senior.” I’m only 21 years old. I only opened my first credit cards last year, I’ve filed for identity theft for the cards that weren’t mine. They have the wrong address on file. It’s clearly a mistaken identity, and they even admitted they can’t find me in their system. But they’re still taking my money while they “look into it” ??? How is this even legal? How can they keep taking money when they haven’t proved it’s actually me? No court summons, no due process, and I’m in a completely different state.\n\nEdit, additional info: the garnishment amount is between $4,000 and $5,000, I can’t remember the exact amount, but it’s definitely at least $4,000. I’ve contacted corporate HR two or three times now, and it’s almost  impossible to reach the garnishment department. They’re either “on break” for hours so the line hangs up, or I get stuck in this automated loop that always takes me to ADP. The law firm refuses to talk to me since it’s “under investigation,” so they claim they’re not allowed to discuss anything with me. I’m also sure the date of birth doesn’t match, I can’t recall their exact words, but they’d basically say the person they have isn’t the same age as me.\n\nLocation: Michigan",

My friend’s dad said we should be in the clear but to just keep an eye out if we get anything from the actual plaintiffs, which he doubts we will. \n\n\nLocation: Los Angeles\n\nWe got a letter from a law firm today  post dated 6/29 that looked suspicious so we opened it only to find out that it’s a law firm letting my wife know she is getting sued by synchrony bank for over 6 grand related to a Sam’s club Mastercard which we never opened. They were offering to defend us. The plaintiff that filed on the banks behalf is a law firm specializing in debt collection in San Diego. I looked up the case number and lo and behold a case was filed on 6/24 at the Norwalk courthouse with my wife’s name on there.\n\nHere’s the thing, I was able to get all the court documents online and there was no proof of service that the summons was received. We haven’t received anything at all in the mail…we had just moved to our current place back in march and had all our mail forwarded from our old place. \n\nWe checked all our credit accounts, credit karma, Experian…and nothing. Clean. We’ve got great credit btw…I’m at 750+ and my wife is at 800+. We called synchrony banks fraud department and gave them my wife social and they pulled up every account we knew of and no Sam’s club Mastercard whatsoever. \n\nSo legally they have my wife’s name and address on court documents but the debt is for sure fraudulent. We’re past the 30 days from when the case was filed on 6/24. Haven’t received summons nor has a proof of service been filed. We are unsure how to go about this besides calling our credit bureaus and putting a fraud alert and trying to contact the plaintiffs law office in the morning. From what I read online on their 2 out of 5 star review they rarely pick up. I’m still doing my research, so far I’m looking into requesting a validation of debt letter. I really don’t want to hire an attorney just to tell another attorney to kick rocks when we did nothing in the first place. \n\nAny advice or experience with this sort of situation guys?",

      "text": "Location: Oklahoma\n\n\nAlmost a year ago, my brother, an oilfield worker, unfortunately fell asleep on his way home from his 8 hour drive from work leaving behind a wife and 4 kids. My sister in law has debated going after DOT as there were no rumble strips on this very busy turnpike but decided against it, thinking it would get nowhere. \n\n\nCoincidentally, my sister in law was contacted by State Farm yesterday informing her that they paid $50,000 of the $157,000 DOT is trying to say was due to damages to the overpass my brother hit. [He veered off the highway, ramped the grassy foot of the overpass and hit the horizontal bottom support beam beneath the above roadway.] \n\n\nMy husband and I visited the crash site recently and it's obvious very minimal was done - a small patch job of welded metal to fix the small area of damage. $157,000?!! This feels like a kick in the teeth being that not only were there no rumble strips, they now want to pursue my sister in law for damages they ultimately potentially caused. You can purchase a new construction home in some areas for $157,000. SIL is worried though because the truck was in her name [for credit reasons] but he was the single deceased driver. \n\n\nWhat does she do now?! DOT is coming off like buzzards, and it sounds like they're even attempting to commit insurance fraud. Luckily I have before and after pictures of the so-called extensive repairs.",

      "title": "Future In Laws are demanding we take the full fall on their car.",
      "text": "Location: Idaho.\nSo this is a long one. My fiance about 2 years ago got into an agreement with her parents (nothing legal, just verbal with some texts confirming the agreement) that the car is now hers. It's a expensive luxury car. They refused to co-sign a car with her as they have said multiple times that \"they dont trust her since she has stabbed them in the back multiple times.\" So they decided to give a young adult a luxury car that they had for 1.5 years for her first car that she could BARELY afford (We talking about $1,000 on monthly payments and insurance and as of now still owing 32,000 on it.) Now she has told them multiple times apparently that she wants to keep the car. \n\nBut, we got engaged and back in May we began to look into our finances and look at what we can afford housing and other future things. I learned about the finance situation on the car and my gut dropped. Almost immediately I told her we cannot afford this car. We ran through multiple drafts into our budgets and there is just no way we can afford this car. So over 2 months we agreed that we need to return the car to her parents and let them take care of it however they see fit. This is because the car is still under their name. My fiance does not have her name on anything, only the payments going into her account and the insurance in her name. \n\nOver the next 2 months she would come back and propose a new way that we could keep the car, mostly refinancing the car under our name. Each time I would reaffirm that I would love to find a way to keep it, but a luxury car is a sinkhole in my opinion and even after paying it off, which won't happen for quite some time, we still will have massive payments whenever anything goes wrong with it (a headlight bulb alone is 2500 if its not under warranty). Thus happened about 8 times. \n\nTurns out her parents kept sending her back with new ideas for us to keep it everytime we came to a conclusion. Finally things got heated and after a few group chat messages with us all in they were very hurt and offended that we are trying to drop this car on them 2 months before the wedding. They were assured that they wouldn't have to worry about the car and now we are stabbing them in the back. So we ended up having a phone call with everyone and they spent 10 minutes essentially yelling at their daughter for breaking the agreement and how she is very untrustworthy, they should have never helped her out, and plenty more awful things that pissed me off. They then laid down that if we truly don't want the car, we would have to return it that night, pay for a full interior and exterior cleaning and repairs if needed, an oil change, and they would cut all contact with their daughter. So, broken hearted and in tears my fiance agreed and we dropped it off. \n\nNow its been a few days and we have had hours and hours of phonecalls with them trying to fix things, saying things like, \"we didn't expect you to throw everything away for a car\". We took the car back and agreed with them we would continue with the payments until the wedding in 2 months. From there we are still arguing about what to do. \n\nPersonally I have been willing to have them sell the car, since it is theres, and that we would split the remainder 50/50. But every inch we give them they take a mile. Now they demand that no matter what happens to the car, whether selling it or renting it out for the forseeable future, we are in charge of paying the full lose. Also they have talked to an attorney and have threatened to sue. They also insist tomorrow we come over and sign a document agreeing to this. I obviously don't agree to this, but I really just don't know what to do right now. \n\nI hate to drop this car on them, with them having 2 other car payments and a house they are trying to buy. But I have told my fiancé that I'm not willing to ruin my financial future for her parents, especially when I feel like they have taken advantage of their daughter. \n\nAny advice is appreciated.",

One of our labor laws says that if you are involuntarily terminated from your job you must be paid your final wages THAT DAY for hours you've worked that pay period. Even if they pay you the next day, it's still violating the law. An employer could face fines from the state, be required to pay the employee twice what they're owed, and if it needs to go to court they will have to pay all legal fees. At least this is how I understand it after reading the actual laws and the summaries on the official state website.\n\n2 weeks ago I was fired for violating a policy. I was told by the manager that he would make sure I got paid \"as soon as possible\" and I agreed to leave quietly and not make a fuss. 2 weeks later I still haven't gotten my money. I assumed they were direct depositing it on the normal payday, but that came and went. I got a paystub in the mail yesterday saying that my pay was put on a \"PayCard\", but  I had never been given any cards and I checked for any unopened junk mail and found nothing. \n\nI just got off the phone with my manager and he said that after I left he loaded a PayCard with my final earnings and sent it to me in the mail. Like I said, I'm 100% sure I never received it. \n\nSo my question is, did he violate the law but not giving me my pay at the time? I know he must have had the time to do it because he had enough time to arrange for another manager from somewhere else to be in the room as a witness. Even if he did mail it the day that I was fired I wouldn't have received it until 2-4 days later. He'll be able to provide proof that the card was loaded that day, but I never signed anything acknowledging that I had received any money that day.",

      "text": "Location: Oregon \n\nUPDATE:\n\nThank you everyone for your helpful advice! I wasn't expecting so many responses! \n\nI see a lot of people mentioning why we didn't do something sooner, when I say we just moved in, we just moved in this past Monday. We haven't even been at the new house for a week! I wouldn't say I'm a pushover, just with buying a new house and planning a move, this was not on my bingo card.\n \n\nBut\n\nTurns out he did good on his promise and talked to a lawyer, who told him it was illegal to block a driveway, regardless of any contract and that the contract in question is null and void since the previous owner moved away,  but regardless blocking someone else's driveway is still illegal 😂 \n\nhe came over and apologized,  he also brought some store-bought cookies, an apology letter and the contract with the former owner for us to keep or destroy. I think this is a nice olive branch for the situation. \n\nHe wants to start over again and welcome us into the neighborhood.\n\nI'm hoping we can turn the corner and start a new with our new neighbor. \n\nHe seemed pretty embarrassed and genuinely seems sorry. He's an older guy so maybe he just didn't know the laws or isn't good with change????\nHe definitely he has egg on his face... hopefully we can just enjoy being each other's neighbors in the meantime...and maybe one day this will just be a funny story. \n\nAnyways, Definitely an interesting way to be greeted into the neighborhood 😂\n\n\n\n\nOkay, so this is pretty straightforward but not really sure where to go or what to do. Just bought a new house How exciting! Our realtor told us to expect some surprises. Here is our first and major surprise, our neighbor likes to park and  block our driveway. He seems to be an avid car collector and has quite a few. \n\nWe didn't really notice it because I guess he parks his daily driver in front of our driveway. So when we were touring the house and whatnot, he was away at work. We've noticed the issue when we need to leave our driveway for work and his car is blocking us in. We've knocked on the door and had a few discussions with him about how that's not acceptable and he's busted out a handwritten contract that he had with the previous owner stating that it was okay for him to block her driveway. He let me read the contract and it does state that he can block our driveway from the hours of 8pm to 8m everyday of the week. \n\nThe previous owner was an elderly woman who did not drive so I can imagine it was not an inconvenience to her. \n\n He's threatened us with legal action and told us that because he has a contract he can legally park there. I don't think that's true. Also, I'm aware that we have to live next to this man for the next handful of years and I want to approach this situation delicately without necessarily getting the courts involved but I just would like to know what my rights are. \n\nI think because the contract was with the former tenant, it's null and void. \n\nAny idea how to make peace with our new neighbor and still have the ability to pull in and out of our driveway? I'm kind of at my wit's end so any advice is majorly appreciated.\n\nTo summarize: \nBought a new house. New neighbor blocks our driveway. Was given permission by previous owner, has contract. What can I do?",

      "text": "Hi \n\nSo my husband’s mom has been harassing him for months and I was her most recent target after he decided to cut off contact with her close to two years ago due to things she has done to him. \n\nI’m currently 4 months pregnant with our first kid and we just want to make sure she will never meet our children this one I’m having or any future kids we may have. I don’t want her to ever have the chance to be racist to our baby since she’s white and I’m Mexican and recently she made racist insinuations to my husband about me along with other things in her most recent rant about us not talking to her (she blames it on me when it was all his decision due to her actions but whatever) \n\nafter seeing that she made racist insinuations about me and me recalling previous conversations and comments she made I realized this wasn’t the first time that she’s been racist against Hispanics. in the past I did actually stop talking to her for about 5 months due to racist comments and lies she said about certain minorities (over two years ago since he decided to cut off contact with her December 2023) \n\nSo ultimately because of her history of psychological and financial abuse towards her child (my husband) such as saying repeatedly to him as a child that she wished she had aborted him and stealing his college fund which caused him to not be able to graduate college after he lost a scholarship (he worked to pay his own tuition once she told him she had used the money but once they took that scholarship a few years in he decided against getting student loans because he didn’t want the debt and he found a good job at the time) so he’s harbored resentment towards her and in his own words he doesn’t want her to lie or or hurt his child the same way she did to him. \n\nSoooo is there anything we can do to legally not have her have any right over our baby when he or she is born? We’re moving from CT to the south west and she lives in RI so there’s that too that I don’t know how things work in different states. Can we just chose to not have her near our kid? We don’t want her to know when the baby ir born or even what they will look like or where we will live. \n\nPlease help 🙏🏻\n\n\nLocation: Connecticut, USA",

      "text": "Hi, just wanted to come back and update in case this helps anyone in the future. After a week of no access I was finally able to access my account. It’s amazing how fast things changed when I reported them to the CFPB. Lessons were definitely learned here and I have closed this account with this bank and found a different one. I now have two bank accounts at two separate institutions, now have a credit card, and am working on getting a US passport. Thanks to everyone for the advice. I truly appreciate it!\n\n\nHi, I am just reaching out to see the legality behind my current situation. \n\nLocation: Louisiana\n\nBackground: I came to the US in 2011. I opened a bank account using my green card and Cuban passport. I have since become a naturalized citizen. I was notified on 6/23/25 that my bank account has been restricted because my Cuban passport and green card has expired. I brought my naturalization certificate, state id, veterans ID card, and social security card to the bank. They are saying they cannot unfreeze my account with these documents because they cannot verify that I am legal citizen. They also stated that since I came from Cuba and it is a country on a restricted list, it further complicates things. They keep saying I need a primary document as proof. When I ask them what constitutes a primary document they tell me a valid passport or green card. I do not have a US passport, my Cuban passport expired, and obviously no longer have a green card because I am a naturalized citizen. They refuse to take my naturalization certificate as a primary document. I have spent the last 3 days trying to get this sorted out just to be told by the bank I won’t get answers until maybe Monday. I have filed a complaint with the CFPB yesterday, and received a call from the bank today saying they are going to investigate the issue and will hear back from them in a few days. I asked a few days ago if I could get a W-9 to fill out to see if that would be helpful, and they said they requested one and will let me know when they receive it.  Since my bank account has been frozen, I cannot buy food, buy gas, pay bills, pay for my dog’s emergency medical bills, or the emergency surgery she needs. I am left with nothing. \n\nQuestions: \nIs lawful for the bank freeze my account and refuse to accept my naturalization certificate, state ID, veterans ID, and social security card as proof of citizenship? \n\nWhat rights, if any, do I have here?\n\nAnyone encounter a similar situation and have any advice on how to resolve it? \n\nThis entire situation has me so stressed. Thank you to anyone who has taken the time to read this far.",

After the funeral my stepmother told me that he didn’t leave me anything and since he died unexpectedly (my dad had a heart attack) I guess it was believable to me that he didn’t have a will in place and I wasn’t thinking about will anyways, as well as since I was told that if there was a will I’d get something in the mail and since months went by and I didn’t get anything, I didn’t question it. My dad and stepmother were married for 3 years if that’s relevant.\n\nYesterday I got a piece of mail about property tax reassessment and I realized the address was another house my dad owned and (used?) to rent out. I called my mom and she helped me to check the records online (I’m 22 and embarrassingly don’t know anything about how all this works) when we checked we saw my name is on the title and it was added by a quitclaim and my mom said that she’s pretty sure it means the house belongs to whoever’s name is on the title and when I checked online that seemed right. \n\nToday I called my stepmother to tell her what I saw on the records site and to ask about the keys/accessing the house. She told me that because her and my dad were married that the house is community property by law and after renovations are done it will be sold and now I’m unsure what my rights are to the house and how to move forward ?  Are there steps I can take myself or do I need a lawyer? Also I’m assuming the flair for this would be Real estate but please correct me if I’m wrong!",

Because we work in a gross environment, showers are provided in locker rooms at these facilities.\n\nThere is a larger locker room at each facility with a single shower, single toilet, and urinal labeled “men’s locker room”. There is a smaller room with a single shower and single stall toilet labeled “all gender restroom” at each. There are no women’s facilities. \n\nI was told that the reason for no women’s facilities is because of the newer California law requiring employers to provide all gender restrooms, so they simply redesignated the women’s locker rooms all-gender. \n\nIs that true? Our facilities are older and don’t have the budget to redesign to add restrooms, and I don’t want to be nitpicky, but I really resent losing my private space. The men vastly prefer using the old women’s locker room, and they don’t always treat the space well. \n\nEmployer details if applicable: public agency, >250 total employees but the facilities in question staff ~7-10 employees regularly.",

For liability reasons we would like to secure our property.  Our neighbor has two small children and pets (cat/dog) but he told us if we build a second fence he will sue for damaging his property value.  We have already had the city come out to make sure we are not blocking his view and we plan to try our best to keep it out of his view.  Our house is downhill from his house and there are hedges between the two properties.  He has a fence on his side of the property line but it does not meet the height for our pool.  Our city has a view ordinance in which you can’t block the view of the houses above you which includes buildings, trees and hedges.  The city determines the view from inside the house and he has taken pictures at the property line outside.  He has also threatened to cut his hedge down so he can get a better picture of our fence when it is built.  Does our neighbor have a case? He told us he will file a claim once we finish building our fence.  He told us not to follow the law.  Is this something that we could report to the State Bar of CA for attorney misconduct or is this just as petty as his threat to sue us?

      "text": "I'm 27, my wife is 29\n\n\nTLDR I'm seeking advice, do I need an attorney for a divorce here? Is the marriage and mortgage papers even valid?\n\nWe had an 18 month engagement and lived together the whole time. We married 18 months ago on new years\n\nShe's perfect in every way, she doesn't drive is really the only annoying thing but it doesn't even bother me anymore. We do a lot together, almost everything to be exact\n\nWe moved bought a house a year ago. Once we moved in, she absolutely stopped cooking, cleaning, vacuuming, and any housework \nNo, she doesn't work. Her part time job at the school cafeteria, imo doesn't count as she's only there when someone calls out so maybe 1 shift every other month\n\nAnyway, 6 months into the marriage, I discover my extremely narcissistic mother in law has a guardianship over my wife and was receiving 1k a month for care of her ward from social security.\nI kicked her out,cthen the night before my attorney appointment we made up and her mother said wlshe would end it\n\nWell, a year later, now, she never did. I found out because her sister came over while we were playing a video game and said (my wife) come with me, it'll only be 10 minutes. She went her real estate office and came back. Apparently she gave her printed a copy of her February bank statement (glad I took her off my accounts a year ago they'd all see my money if I didnt ), and I asked wife why, she didn't know she just gave because they asked. So I made her ask why, she was directed to her mother and her mother said it's for Medicaid. \n\nI can't deal with this again, this is too much. For one that means her mother has stolen well over 35k from her daughter (I read the paperwork, it's actually supposed to go to me, but since its all fraud, no one should ge it, legally once marriage happens its supposed to be with the husband or immediately dissolved)\n\nI accidentally managed to transfer that to me(I didn't know what it was) and I got 1 payment when we updated her marriage with social security, but her mother transfered it back and that's when we found out\n\nI'm pretty sure her sister is in on it too, they are all super close with tight knit family. They all go on girls trips regularly, etc\n\nI know for a fact mother in law asked neighbors to spy on me and they actually told her to f*** off then proceeded to let me know\n\nNo wife will not put foot down, she was brainwashed her whole life to think this is normal, and fixing this would require her to actually say this is enough and kick her entire family on her mom's side and all her friends out of her life. Wife also has asburgers \n\nAlso, the weird thing is, I feel like the marriage ended a whole ago when we moved into the house and she quit cooking and cleaning and started the I got a headache. So I really don't feel bad. I'm just wondering if I will regret this \n\nI want children, but I no longer see myself wanting kids with this family. The mother in law is so controlling and narcissistic, and the wife just dies every command, even cancels vacations and dates to do what her mom says. She tried to control me, but I blasted it so much that her friends overheard it and she went so red in the face she no longer tries to control or even initiate conversation with me now\n\nI have made it very clear to these people that this crap isn't ok, but apparently my feelings and wanting a normal marriage don't matter. I was actually told by the mother in law a year ago she had it since wife turned 18 \n\nBtw, wife is on mortgage.\n\nLocation: Texas \n\nTLDR I'm seeking advice, do I need an attorney for a divorce here? Is the marriage and mortgage papers even valid?",

      "text": "EDIT: y’all, the iPad *is* backed up to the iCloud. I don’t have another *device* for her to use and I cannot afford one rn. Stop lecturing me on the importance of back ups. \n\nMy wife and I live in the upstairs unit of a duplex in Minnesota. The two units have separate house numbers and are independent, aside from a shared entryway, garage, and trash cans. We have our own keys, front doors inside the entryway, mailboxes, electric meters, etc. \n\nEarlier this week, multiple police officers and a SWAT unit executed a search warrant for the downstairs unit. The warrant was for narcotics and firearms.\n\nAt 7 am on the dot, the Minneapolis Police Department showed up with no sirens and blocked off the street on both sides of the house. They then forcibly broke down the shared entryway door, then the downstairs neighbors’ front door, and also the man door to the garage, which actually left a small dent in our car parked inside (not major, but still).\n\nOur front door, the one to our upstairs unit, is the only exterior door that still works in the entire building because I opened it myself when they told us to come up with our hands up. \n\nThey shoved rifles in our faces, cuffed us, and put us in the back of a squad car, where we were for about two hours while they searched both apartments. They uncuffed us about an hour in but we were not allowed to leave the car. \n\nThey initially told us that the warrant was for downstairs (street address 50—not the real number), and asked us repeatedly if we lived there. We said no, we live at 48 and have no connection to the people in 50. We literally just moved here less than six months ago from out of state. The most we interact with the folks in 50 is a “hey how are you?” if we happen to be in the entryway together. \n\nThey asked if the apartments connected at all once inside the respective front doors (they do not). They also asked my wife multiple times if she was a specific downstairs neighbor (she is not). Both my wife and that specific neighbor are black women. \n\nThen they told us the warrant was for “the entire building” and the garage. Eventually, they printed us a second warrant on the spot that listed our upstairs address, which we only got after the searches were over. We were also directly told by an apologetic sergeant that this had nothing to do with us and we were “just caught in the crossfire.” \n\nDuring the search of our unit, which was not as thorough as 50’s, they seized my wife’s iPad. The only thing on this iPad is my wife’s art. Nobody touches this iPad save for my wife, not even me. They left all other electronics untouched, including my own iPad and our laptops. Meanwhile, they took *every single electronic device* from all the folks in 50, including their cellphones and work computers. \n\nMy wife did sign a document allowing them to search the iPad. We were told it could take a month or more if she didn’t, and her art is one of our revenue streams. We can’t afford to be without it for an extended period of time. We did get a receipt. \n\nWe don’t own firearms and don’t use or sell illicit drugs. We are law abiding citizens with nothing to hide. The worst things in our apartment are weed (legal here), blunt prop swords, prescribed medication, and angry cats. All were left unharmed. No arrests were made, so I’m assuming nothing illegal was found downstairs either. \n\nThe whole scene was very overwhelming and frankly a little terrifying, especially with guns pointed at us first thing in the morning.\n\nI’m kicking myself for not paying better attention because the situation feels off to me. I was more worried about making sure the cops didn’t manhandle my wife and knew about our escape artist cat. I’m also disabled, so sitting with my hands cuffed behind me so tightly for so long was not a great experience and I was/am in a lot of pain. \n\nWas this all on the level?

Soon after my freshman year of college, I stopped even visiting or calling. I was unaware he was stealing benefits while I was in college. Without this person, I wouldn't have even known about the benefits. I signed up for the program right before my freshman year started and used it for all 4 years. (Money is money, and it did help a lot- despite how much I hate them). Time passes, I graduate, and eventually, he is convicted of fraud. Now, VA and SSA want me to pay them back? Am I obligated to pay this debt? I had no idea he was committing fraud in the first place!\n\nI received a letter stating they'd been trying to reach me and received no response, and now they want their money within the month, or they will start taking action. I have lived at the same address for over a year now, and I am diligent with updating my address and checking my mail. I received absolutely zero attempts to notify me about this before this month. I started an appeal online, but I don't know how long that will take. Haven't heard anything yet. I've tried calling the number on the letter, but the operating system just tells me to wait in line for over 110- 130 minutes repeatedly. What do I even do at this point? The month is basically over already. How did they expect me to pay this with only weeks of notification? What steps should I take?\n\n  \nEdit: Wow, thank you for all the advice. Definitely sounds like I have some work to do on my part. For people wondering, yes, it was a parent and yea I received ch35 benefits.... wish me luck.",

      "text": "Location: Colorado\n\nEdit to add:  i would like to sincerely thank the numerous responses and advice.  I took a mental health day, declined the meeting, and spoke to a law office with a meeting set for later this week.  The union rep confirmed I made the right choice and still offered whatever support the union can, although it sounds as though this is even larger than what their legal team typically encounters or handles.  I truly appreciate the support! ❤️❤️❤️\n\nI work at a public elementary school, which my daughter attended last year.  She reported inappropriate interactions by a male administrator, which I reported to the principal along with other concerning behaviors I had observed.  He is relatively new to the position, and has yet to prove his ability to be trusted, hold people accountable, or follow through on things.  His reaction to my concerns bothered me.  He argued that males are okay to use the children's restrooms, as they \"just need to run in real quick.\"  I received little to no reassurance that this man would stay away from my child.\n\nI then went and reported my daughter's situation and my expectations to other key staff, including the social worker and her teachers.  I needed to know she would be protected from him.  She was completely unnerved and creeped out by the way he interacted with her. I needed to know the other children would be protected from him. \n\nThe remainder of the year, I watched him like a hawk.  He never again went near my daughter. \n\nAbout a year from this initial set of incidences, I receive a message from another mother (I've been here for 6 years, I have relationships with numerous families.)  They had contacted the police over what this man did to their daughter. Not knowing the full story, but knowing that i had issues with this man prior,, she informed the detective and he asked to speak to me and interview my daughter, which I agreed to.  Several other children, parents, and staff were interviewed as part of the investigation. \n\nThe case is closed/active and he was removed from the position, yet not officially terminated.  The principal and his direct supervisor received a copy of the police report from the head of security, and unleashed absolutely anger in my direction.\n\nI've been asked to \"debrief\" numerous times, where I get cornered alone and am told it's my fault for talking to the police and dramatic emphasis on the word \"allegedly\" indicated my child lied.  I joined the union and got a rep so I no longer have to have closed door meetings without a witness on my side to hear this crazy shit.\n\n2 months ago, I was informed I was receiving a write up for breach of confidentiality based on the contents of the police report.  When I attended the meeting with the HR rep and principal to receive the write up, I lost my mind.\n\nThey quoted pieces of my daughter's victim statement in the write up!  I stopped the meeting to explain this was entirely unacceptable.  The principal got aggravated and spouted more insane bs. I told him this was no longer a discussion and I was signing to note that I was receiving this bs write up, but that I would follow district policy with a formal rebuttal within the given 10 day period.  \n\nI did write a quite aggressive rebuttal, quoting board policy, social contacts, and the state law.  The union rep reviewed it and found it to be assertive but appropriate.  No one responded to my rebuttal and my call for higher level of accountability, fair application of policies, and refrain from retaliation.\n\nBecause they chose crickets, I chose to file a grievance with the district.  I finally received a call from someone in the superintendent office after almost 4 weeks following the filing of the grievance.  \n\nHe claims he is neutral.  He wants to meet to hear my side of this.  He won't allow my union rep to be present with me.  HR did not provide a copy of my rebuttal with the write up, even though it is district policy to always attach the rebuttal to the write up when it is requested.\n\nWhat should I be doing here?  Colorado is one party so I could record our meeting.  Do I need to talk to a lawyer?  I feel like I'm walking into a trap.\n\nI feel like I'm taking crazy pills.  I am a mandatory reporter.  This man's actions were wildly inappropriate.  Why am I now the bad guy?  I also feel that they are dragging this out to simply not renew me as an easy way to get rid of me.  I need some advice please!",

      "title": "Can my boyfriend get custody of my daughter when I die?",
      "text": "Hi,\n\nSo this is a throwaway account because I haven't told anyone yet and I don't want them to find out yet. I (44f) was diagnosed with terminal Pancreatic Cancer two weeks ago. The oncologist has given me about 6-9 months. I'm naturally terrified, but the worst part is that I have no idea what is going to happen with my 13 year old daughter. Her father has been out of her life since she was 1 year old. He's never paid child support or tried to visit, but we've done fine without him. I put myself through college and got a really good job where I make enough to comfortably support my daughter and I.\n\nSix years ago, I started dating someone at the company I work for. He has a child from a previous relationship and his exwife has custody, but he sees the child regularly. Over the years, he has stepped in to the father figure role for my daughter. We have gone on vacations as a family with both kids. We rent a house together in the suburbs. He comes to my daughters basketball games and cheers her on. He takes her on roller coasters at the amusement park. She plans on having him teach her how to drive in a few years because she says I'm a bad driver. He has provided way more financial support over the years to her than her sperm donor ever did.\n\nThat brings me to the topic of my post. I want my daughter to go to my boyfriend when I die. I know that courts will prefer bio parents, but her dad hasn't been in her life and he doesn't deserve to have her. My boyfriend is great with her, knows her friends and their parents, knows what she does and doesn't like, her favorite foods. I don't have time left to marry him and have him adopt her since the law wants you to wait one year after marriage for adoption. I'm open to us having a quick marriage, we have been talking about getting married for about a year now, so it wouldn't be out of the blue.\n\nI also have a $500k life insurance policy that my daughter is the sole benefactor of, so I know she is set. I also trust my boyfriend to do the right thing with that policy, whereas her sperm donor is a drug addict and alcoholic and would likely blow through it. I also don't have much in the way of family. My dad left my mom when she was pregnant and he said he doesn't want to take care of another kid and my mom is very toxic and emotionally abusive. I have no siblings and most of my extended family are drunks or addicts, so slim pickings.\n\nI guess my question is given my circumstances, what is the best way to approach this? I want to make sure this happens the right way so that there is minimal disruption to my daughter's life and I don't want to cause more hurt than necessary.\n\n  \nLocation: Ohio",

Right now we are preparing for the worst and are not okay. \n\nMy husband left behind a gun in a rental condo in the state of NY. He didn’t realize until we were two hours away. He tried to call the management office to let them know but had to leave a message. \n\nThe booking was under my friend’s name and contact info. She got a call from the local county police about an hour after we called the management office. The officer stated they would call her back on Wednesday with more information (today is Sunday). \n\nMy husband then called this county police and explained that the gun was his and that our friend had nothing to do with this and that all of the communication about this should be through him since it is his gun. \n\nHe was told the same thing, they will call back on Wednesday.\n\nWe are expecting the worst. I’m seeing that this is a class E felony which means he could face a year in prison or a fine. Everything I’m seeing does say “OR” a fine, not both. \n\nWe are so scared that he will have to go to prison for up to a year for this, even any amount of time we are very scared. \n\nHe is very accepting that he broke the law and the likelihood of him being charged with a felony. He has a clean record and has never been in trouble with the law except for speeding tickets (3 total I think?) he feels so so so terrible and understands these are his consequences but we just really are hoping he doesn’t go to jail for this. \n\nI told him he should probably talk to a lawyer to be prepared for this conversation with the sheriff when they call back on Wednesday and he mentioned waiting until after the conversation to see what they’re gonna tell him. I just really feel like that is a bad idea and I don’t want him to accidentally incriminate himself but he thinks lawyering up will escalate the situation into something worse than if he didn’t. \n\nSo can anyone give guidance on what to expect and/or what we should do next? \n\nAlso, is there any way my friend will also get in legal trouble for this since the booking was in her name? She had nothing to do with this and my husband is taking full accountability for what happened. \n\nUpdate:\nA lot of people are asking for an update on the situation. My husband is not being charged with anything and his lawyer is contacting a person with an FFL license to pick up the gun in New York and give it to my husband in the neighboring state we reside in.",

      "text": "Hey r/legaladvice! Apologies in advance if this is the wrong sub to ask for advice. I work as a secondary math teacher for a school district in Northeast Texas (Location: Texas). As I hope many of you can understand, for the sake of my own job, I would prefer not to be more specific about my location.\n\nEarlier today, our district sent out an email informing all staff how new laws (e.g. HB 1481, SB 12, and SB 10) would impact our schools. In regards to **SB 10**, which requires schools to display a copy of the Ten Commandments in every classroom, the email specifically mentioned that “[the Ten Commandments] is the *only* religious text that will be permitted to be displayed in [our district’s] classrooms,” unless otherwise tied to an appropriate TEKS (Texas Essential Knowledge and Skills) standard.\n\nAs a math teacher who strongly believes the Ten Commandments do not belong in my classroom for any reason whatsoever, I want to know what my options are for legally ‘protesting’ this new law? What other posters can I hang in my classroom (i.e. a First Amendment poster) without worry of serious/legal repercussions and what other recourses do I have?\n\nThanks in advance! :)\n\nEdit: Wow, this gained a lot of traction very fast! Thank you for all the wonderful people who gave incredibly helpful advice. Unfortunately, as it has been pointed out by a moderator, the law is pretty clear about the size, font, language, wording, and location of the Ten Commandments in the classroom. Also, as a few people noted, I would only need to hang the poster in the event that it was donated from the community or provided by the district, but to avoid any legal issues our district is already going to provide every class a poster. In other words, any potential loopholes in the law are going to be blocked by my own district’s policies to avoid a law suit.\n\nIt seems my options are limited to hanging first amendment posters and reaching out to foundations or organizations that are involved in fighting for religious freedom, which I will absolutely be looking into. Thank you again for the overwhelming support and (mostly legal) advice from everyone!",

      "text": "Can anyone who is a lawyer give me some advice?\n\nI prepaid for a $5K MacBook Pro for pickup at the Americana Apple Store in Glendale. When I went to pickup the computer the Apple Store employee scanned my bar code without looking at ID and then casually told me the computer had been picked up. At first I was confused and told him it must be a mistake because I clearly wouldn’t be there if I had picked it up. He went to the back room for a long time and then returned and said the same thing. The manager then came out and told me the computer had been picked up and there was nothing they could do. I was shocked. I thought Apple was a premium brand with amazing products and security. How could they so easily be duped out of such and expensive product? In addition, how could this be legal? I never once touched the computer or had it in my possession, and yet they are pushing this problem onto me.\n\nAfter leaving the store I did the following things:\n\n1. Filed a police report (the officer said this happens all the time)\n2. Called Apple. They said this has never happened (lie). They then said someone would follow up in 48 hours and they never did. (Lie #2). Last they said to file a dispute with my credit card.\n3. Next I called my credit card to file a dispute. Unfortunately I put this laptop on the Apple Card. I got this card specifically to finance this computer since it was so expensive. My experience so far has been terrible. The employees can't give you any information and you can never get ahold of anyone that can actually help. From day one, I never felt like they had my back in this dispute since they are technically an Apple product. \n4. After filing the dispute the charge was removed pending investigation.\n5. After two months I recently got an email from Apple Card saying “Based on available information, we determined that the transaction was authorized.”\n6. I call Apple Card to get more info. The first employee can only re-read the automated email to me. I ask to be transferred to the manager. I’m on hold for 20 mins and ask to be called back. I’m never called back.\n7. I start a chat with an Apple customer service agent and explain all this. They escalate my story to a senior customer agent who will call me within 24 hours. I specifically ask to be called within certain hours so I can pickup. The agent of course, doesn’t call within those hours and leaves a voice mail saying Apple can’t help me and that i have to take this up with law enforcement and my credit card aka Apple.\n\nCan someone help me or offer advice? How can this be legal? I never touched this computer. It was stolen from the Apple Store. Apple is refusing to give me what I paid for. Meanwhile I'm stuck with paying off this computer every month that I never received.",

The case happened in February of 2021 and he was 20 at the time. He claims that a 14 year old female coworker started to pursue him, then falsely accused him of SA in retaliation when he turned her down because of her age. The way he describes it, all it takes to get charged with CSC and put on the sex offender registry in Michigan is the word of the victim, no other proof or witness is required, and because he had no money for a lawyer, he had no choice but to accept the plea deal. \n\nI know people get framed for SA and it’s devastating, and I don’t want to downplay that. However, his explanation seems a little fishy and I’m concerned about my friend. Is his explanation consistent with MI law?",

      "title": "My family nearly died of acute CO toxicity in a hotel this morning [WV, USA]",
      "text": "My wife and I have been staying in a hotel for the past 3 weeks in order to take care of her ailing parents. Until this morning, we were in a room on the first floor of a hotel. There is a parking lot outside of course, and one of the parking spaces is adjacent to our(former) room.\n\nSometime between 5 and 6 this morning, another guest of the hotel who was using that parking space started idling his truck, which was backed into the space. One of those lifted jobs with the long truckbeds that you have to back over 3/4 of the sidewalk to fit into a normal parking space. The sort of vehicle that says \"I come from out of state to hunt at a resort.\" This caused the exhaust from this truck to flow directly into our room, filling it with exhaust fumes while my wife, cats, and myself slept.\n\nMy wife woke me first, discovered the smoke and believed it was a fire. We moved to capture and move our cats away from the emergency. Then we went out into the hallway and discovered no fire. Then we discovered the running truck outside of the room and that we were being, for all intents and purposes, gassed to death by this man. While I do not believe that the act was intentional at this time, the fact remains.\n\nAs a result of this, my wife and I both had to go to the emergency room. In addition to testing, we were both on oxygen for 3 hours for a total of 6 hours. We were told by medical staff that our CO levels and the related indicators were dangerously high and that we could have died basically at any time. We expect a significant bill, and are not adequately insured.\n\nWe also have an appointment with a veterinarian to examine the cats, one of whom did not awaken until several minutes after we removed her from the area. We thought she had died.\n\nI am just trying to keep perspective so that I can help us deal with the consequences of this event.\n\nThe hotel did agree to move us to another room, after we informed them of the situation.\nThe hotel staff did ask the vehicle owner to move the vehicle and not use that space.\n\nI have not had contact with the guest who gassed my room.\n\nThe fire control systems did not discharge.\nThe room did not contain a carbon monoxide detector.\n\nSo my question(besides the more general \"what the hell\"), more-or-less, is that I don't know who's responsibility this is supposed to be?\n\nI paid for a room that was safe to sleep in, and that room turned out to be unsafe to sleep in. Does that matter?\n\nDoes it matter that this guy had his exhaust pipes pointed into my room AC and left his car running? Like I was sleeping, in a room I paid for, and my whole family nearly died because of something this other guy did. Has anything like this ever happened before?\n\nIf he had driven the same truck through the window itself, I assume his insurance would have to pay out? Is that even like, relevant?\n\nOr am I just stuck paying a huge ER bill out of pocket?\n\nFollowup:\n\nThanks everyone for the advice. It seems pretty clear that according to the law in WV the hotel should have CO detectors at least, which they did not. I am following up with a police report and the fire marshal, who is at least the local contact for code and compliance issues. I am also in touch with my attorney. My hope is that they don't want the trouble I'm willing to cause over this, and the insurance covers it, but if it doesn't the paperwork is in motion, so to speak.",

A couple of us talked it over and want to go to the township, or the company that hosts that app to kick him off of it.\n\nI'm sure he'll get a hefty couple of fines after tonight, but we're done with this crap, what are our options?\n\n\nEdit: I've been reading through all of these comments and will definitely collect evidence to use for this. Body cam footage, the pictures I took, etc.\n\nEdit2: I will be bringing all evidence to the county government and gathering any footage, bodycam or otherwise to them as well. We will also speak with our local fire marshal and see if there is anything he can do regarding fines or putting a lawful end to this.

It is, unfortunately, legal, though I find it really gross and predatory. But Tennessee law says it's legal so I don't get a say in it.\n\nWhat it IS about is this: the gf is saying she will be giving the baby up for adoption, and my brother says he supports her- that his opinion doesn't matter anyway. But our mother is going to want the baby when it is born. The gf's parents are abusive and don't want the baby anyway. But my mother is insistent that my brother keeps the baby.\n\nMy brother lives at home with our parents and grandmother. There are only two bedrooms in the house, with our grandmother sleeping on the living room couch. Our mother will make my brother get rid of his massive gaming setup to make room for a crib, but even then that's four adults and one infant in a house with only two bedrooms.\n\nWill the state let the child go into the system if there is someone (grandparents in this case) who is related and wants to take on the baby? Will that be allowed even in these conditions?",

There is no issue about them being special needs. The issue is that they are adults and taking spots and crafts away from children who the program is meant for. Is it in violation of ADA laws to say no to them participating in a children's program? We do offer adult programs, but they aren't the same as children's.

      "text": "I purchased an electric car 2 months ago.  I use a LVL1 charger at my townhouse from a regular outlet outside of the house I rent. I am a 22M in student housing and I recently graduated but am trying to take advantage of cheap rent as long as I can. I got an email saying that I cannot use my charger to charge my car anymore because it is a tripping hazard. I replied back saying I will take the proper safety precautions to make sure it is not a hazard and that if they can tell me where I am breaking the lease by charging my car then I am more than happy to stop. The landlady called me right after saying that I was being \"Snappy\" and \"Rude.\" Then she said that if she tells me something that I better listen. I asked if I covered the cord with one of those construction cord channels that is discrete if it would be an issue and she told me that I cannot use the outlet to charge my car at all. I asked her why can I not use the outlet when there are plenty of diesel trucks and other electric cars that use the outlets all the time and she said they \"figured it out with them.\" I asked if we could work out an agreement and I would be happy to increase my rent for any extra electricity I use but she snapped at me again and she told me if I continued to use the outlet they would tow my car and it would be my fault. I read that in my state there is a \"Right to Charge Law\" where landlords cannot prevent tenants from charging as long as it is safe and I pay for the electricity and I am not sure how to bring this up, and from my POV she seems completely in the wrong as I pay rent and that outlet is connected to the house I rent can be used how I want(in a safe manner). I have a feeling it may be a political thing because its a Tesla and those are controversial but there are at least 4-5 people who use the outside outlet to charge their car or plug in their diesel trucks.\n\nIs she trying to take advantage of me because I am some 22 year old naive student, and what course of action should I take?  I think she called me because she didn't want it in writing that if she tells me to do something I better listen.\n\nEDIT: I am located in Colorado\n\n  \nEDIT2: Thank you for all the advice, I do see her point of view and as to why it may not be a great idea. I am going to talk to her and see if there are any safe options that the company would be okay with me using and if not just give up on it for now. \n\nTo clear some confusion from the original post: I pay a flat rate for electricity and offered to pay for any excess I used. I know I came off like a dick but it was sort of hard not too when she was degrading me on the phone and told me that she came to agreements with other tenants but did not want to come to an agreement with me. I apologized for coming off snappy in my email and explained that I just did not think it was a violation of the lease, and she has responded since saying that maintenance is going to see if there is anything they can do and to not use the outlet for now and I plan on respecting her wishes.\n\nAlso for everyone concerned about me being in student housing, prior to signing my lease I asked if I graduated early would I be able to stay for the remainder and they said this was a common occurrence and there was no issue with that.\n\nFINAL EDIT\nI met with the leasing office today and fortunately this does have a happy ending. They agreed to install 240v outlets that I can pay for a parking spot to use. This is actually better than the current situation I had and I just have to pay an extra 30 per month to use the outlets and have my own dedicated parking spot. The landlady said that she didn’t mean to be rude and I apologized as well and she said that there have been many requests for dedicated outlets to use, and with this solution there will be no extension cords or any cords running on sidewalk. I think that while I may have not went about this the best way, it ended up working out well. Thank you to everyone for the advice and the insight to this situation.",

My sister in law was made to lie to us about it at first, she witnessed some key events, and even had to call the police 3 times in fear for her and her mother’s life. \n\nEventually, after the man threatened to beat my sister in law, my mother in law finally filed for a PFA order against him. However, the man is a leech on her and had nothing to his name and became homeless as a result of it. \n\nOver time he sweetened my mother in law back up and gradually went from sleeping in his truck on their driveway and using their bathroom, to fully living in the home again. My sister in law was once again made to lie to us about this fact until we found out. \n\nMy SIL flew in to visit us and on the last day before we flew her back she had an hour and a half long panic attack saying that she doesn’t feel safe in that house with him and that her mom doesn’t listen to her. \n\nWhen we came back, I walked down the stairs and recorded him sleeping the basement and in no uncertain terms told him to kick rocks. My MIL let him back in later on that day so I called the police to report him in violation. That was today and he is currently in custody. My MIL is very angry at me, has been very selfish, and even told me flat out that she is going to lie to the judge and try to withdraw the PFA entirely. \n\nKnowing this, I cannot in good conscience let my SIL live there anymore. He’s not there now but I can’t trust my MIL to not let him back in the future. Here’s the evidence we have: \n\nRecorded instances and police reports of the many times they came on the domestic violence calls \n\nThe PFA as well as footage of it being broken\n\nMy wife telling the officers responding to the recent call today that the mom will likely lie, and then her actually lying on the body camera footage before being found out. \n\nRecording of SIL panic attack. \n\nTestimony of 7 family members who all feel she is unsafe in the home with her mother in the current state. \n\nTestimony of SIL saying the same \n\nMy question is, do my wife and I even have a case to begin with? What can we do to strengthen it? Any advice is much appreciated, I feel pretty helpless right now, but I know that can’t be true.",

We both applied to get our passports for the first time, since this is our first time traveling abroad. Mine went through but his was put on hold. My brother is transgender (Female to Male) and has undergone the process of changing all of his identifying legal documents, including his driver's license and birth certificate. He also filed a legal name change, so there is virtually no evidence that he was ever female. \n\nI am unsure how, but the Department of State or whoever is in charge of passports deduced that his birth certificate had been changed. They are now asking for a copy of his birth certificate that reflects his biological sex. The problem is that such a copy does not exist, as it was taken when he got it changed. \n\nEssentially, they are denying him a passport unless he somehow finds a birth certificate that says 'female' on it. I am also doubtful that doing this would satisfy the requirements, since under the Trump administration, the mismatch would prove that he is transgender and they would continually find reasons to put his passport on hold. I feel like the only option for him is to change all of his gender markers back to female, and we want to avoid this at all costs. What should my family do in this situation?

      "text": "Location: Florida\n\nMy father went into a state-owned hospital in Florida on February 26th for what was supposed to be a routine outpatient pacemaker procedure — simply replacing the leads and battery. He was a healthy, sober man in his early 60s, practiced yoga daily, and wanted longevity. His current leads were only lasting 2–5 years, and he wanted them replaced with ones that would give him 8–10.\n\nDuring the procedure, the surgeon punctured his right ventricle. He went into cardiac arrest and was placed on ECMO for 36 hours, along with Epi and Levo to maintain vital organ function. These drugs severely impacted blood flow to his extremities, leading to wet gangrene causing him to become a quad amputee.\n\nDespite that, my dad fought hard and recovered to the point of discharge. He was sent to an LTAC (long-term acute care hospital) to continue building strength and focus on nutrition.\n\nWhile there, the LTAC cleared him for a full diet without doing a proper swallow study test — something that had been strictly followed at the previous hospital. He began silently aspirating, and within days he rapidly declined. The staff ignored our concerns, saying he was fine because he could state his name and the president.\n\nThen we got the call: they called a rapid response. We demanded a transfer to an ICU. Upon arrival, the ICU confirmed he was in septic shock from aspiration pneumonia. He nearly recovered again to the point of discharge… until he caught an ICU bug (candidemia) blood infection, which his body was too weak to fight. He passed away June 27th. \n\n⸻\n\nWhy I’m Posting:\n\nWe’ve spoken to several attorneys and no one will take our case. We’ve learned:\n\t•\tFlorida’s “free kill” law prevents adult children from suing for medical malpractice when there’s no spouse or dependent minor.\n\t•\tThe primary hospital is state-owned, meaning there’s a $250K cap on claims — and most firms say it’s not worth pursuing even with obvious negligence.\n\nMy dad lived a peaceful life, and it was ripped away from him (and us) due to a series of negligent medical decisions. We’re looking for accountability. \n\nWe are 25 and 27, our dad was divorced, and we feel like the system has completely failed us.\n\n⸻\n\nMy Questions:\n\t1.\tIs there any legal path forward at all?\n\t2.\tCan we petition a state board, file a complaint, or go through another route for accountability?\n\t3.\tIs there any workaround to Florida’s wrongful death laws in situations like this?\n\nAny insight is deeply appreciated.

      "text": "Location: Illinois (Boone County)\nCitation: 625 ILCS 5/11-1303, illegally stopping, standing, or parking where prohibited\n\nLast night I was driving home after a full day of work. It was close to midnight, and I still had about an hour left in a four-hour drive. I started nodding off and realized I didn’t feel safe to keep going. I pulled completely off the highway into the grass, around six feet past the shoulder. I shut the engine off, got in the back of my van, and laid down to rest.\n\nAbout 20 to 30 minutes later, a state trooper pulled up. He parked, walked through the grass, shined a flashlight inside, and circled the van. I was still asleep until the light and sound woke me up. As soon as I realized someone was there, I moved to the front and made myself visible. He asked if I’d been drinking or if the empty cans on the side of the highway were mine (they weren’t). I offered to take a breathalyzer without being asked, and he declined. I explained that I pulled over because I felt too impaired to drive safely. He still issued a citation under 11-1303 and told me there was a rest stop 13 miles up the road and I should’ve kept going.\n\nI’ve prepared a written statement for court and I’m willing to take responsibility for not stopping sooner, but I genuinely believed I was doing the safest thing I could. I wasn’t blocking traffic, and my van wasn’t visible as a hazard from the road. He also made it sound like being in the grass was worse than being on the shoulder, which doesn’t make sense to me. I intentionally pulled off as far as possible to avoid being a danger to anyone. The only way I could’ve caused an accident is if someone had already left the highway and was crashing through the field.\n\nI’m not local to Boone County, so I’m deciding between going to court myself or hiring a local attorney to appear for me.\n\nDoes this qualify as a valid emergency under Illinois law? What are the odds of dismissal or court supervision? And is it worth getting a lawyer involved or just handling it myself?\n\nAppreciate any advice.\n\nEdit: I don't know what sort of purge just happened in the comments, but I appreciate everyone deleted or otherwise.",

      "title": "[Colorado] HOA suddenly tells us we can't go in/out of our condo for 10 hours a day starting Monday, lasting for at least a month with no definite end, and we just have to deal. We rent. This can't possibly be legal, can it?",
      "text": "Before I get into this: We know that it's the landlord who is supposed to be dealing with the HOA/property manager, and that's why we pay rent, yada yada, but we have had a good working relationship for years and have always just handled basic interactions with the HOA/property manager on their behalf (like reporting things around the complex, if something's broken, trash issues, etc.). We know about the state's Warranty of Habitability laws, and we are aware that our landlord is responsible for possibly putting us up somewhere else if we can't live in our home reasonably or releasing us from the lease without penalty. Since this is really a problem with the HOA and not our landlord (landlord also thinks this is insane), I'm trying to see if there's something we can do/say to them to get them to halt this insanity or be reasonable about making us larp as Sing Sing residents before we lean in on the landlord to fulfill their legal obligations to us. As renters everywhere know, if you have a decent and nice landlord, you want to keep them happy.\n\n---------------------\n\nWe rent a condo in a complex with an HOA and a property management company. The community is majority owner occupied, with a few renters like us.\n\nA notice posted on our door on Thursday says that, starting Monday, we cannot leave or enter our apartment from 8:30 am to 5:30 pm due to construction work. It was posted by the construction company contracted by the HOA/property management company to complete a major project. The work is scheduled to end early December, but knowing what's/who's involved, there's no way they're going to get done in time during the cold season, this will almost definitely continue into new year. The notice was a complete surprise to us and our neighbors, there was no heads up about this beforehand whatsoever. Our landlord was also taken by surprise, they only knew because we CC'ed them on the first email to the HOA.\n\nThe notice was very light on details (the whole thing is around 75-100 words long), we had to call the construction company to clarify what the notice really meant. They confirmed that, yes, we really can't open our front door between those hours, we need to either be locked in all day or be out all day. We then immediately emailed the HOA board member in charge of this project (CC'ed landlord, property manager, HOA president) and pleaded our case about how this notice is woefully inadequate and we have full lives and kids and everything, their response was unhelpful and did not even address our concern, just some canned response about how this project is important to the community, blah blah blah [Charlie Brown teacher noise].\n\nEssentially, we were given one full business day (Friday) to completely upend and rearrange our lives and just hope and pray they get they done by early December. We have very full lives between work and toddlers, we are in and out of the house all day, there is absolutely no way we can comply with so little notice, not to mention that we have family scheduled to fly in and visit over the holidays.\n\nPls halp, and thank you.\n\n------------------\n\nEDIT:  There are a lot of questions about what this work is exactly.  I'd have to look at the city's permit to see what exactly it all entails, but essentially it is a major repair to fix long-term water pipes/leaking problems.  Our details-deficient notice only said that the \"inconvenience\" is due to \"concrete removal and replacement\", but I think I know what the whole project is tackling.  As renters, we are not privy to HOA business and discussions, so I only know superficially what's going on.  \n\nThe building is roughly 45 years old, and for the last several years there have been water leaks and problems that have seeped through what is the ceiling of our underground parking garage.  I am no engineer or construction expert, but I suspect the old pipes were galvanized and they're now old and weren't replaced and, well, here we are.  (I'm just talking out of my ass here, were galvanized pipes still allowed in the late 70s/early 80s?  I don't know why exactly the pipes are bad, I'm just spitballing.) The ceiling's drywall/insulation was stripped years ago for the continual bandaid fixes, and now, I think, they're finally doing the major work to get everything fixed permanently.  I imagine that the concrete work has to do with the fact that part of the parking garage's ceiling is also our building's main walkway above, and they have to dig all that out to get to the pipes (I think, again, no real clue).  It's been properly unattended to for so long and the project is, admittedly, massive, to the HOA's ever-so-sight defense.    \n\nWe don't consider ourselves unreasonable people, we fully understand that construction means inconveniencing people, and with enough notice and proper planning on their end I would have been totally amenable to days here and there where I couldn't leave my house.  Given the nature of the work and it involving my floor/garage ceiling, I'm concerned that my ignoring the construction company and going about my life means I can't safely leave my house.\n\n------------------\n\nUPDATE 1:  It’s been about 9 hours since this post went up and, woaw, did not expect it to blow up as it did. I’ll provide updates and responses as I can but, y’know, full life with cute lil’ tyrants, and it’s just about beddy-bye time.   \n\nAn important detail I initially left out is that we do not have another proper egress, our front door is it.  Also, the toddlers are too young for kindergarten, so there's no school they legally need to get to.  We're still in the \"crayons do not go in your mouth!\" phase of life.  \n\nThe majority opinion here is to report it to the fire marshal.  We haven’t done so yet.  My husband and I talked it over and read all your messages (thank you all for your help!), and we decided [to message the HOA one more time](https://old.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/1gneatr/colorado_hoa_suddenly_tells_us_we_cant_go_inout/lwbe2r2/).  We’re trying to be civil about this and allow them the opportunity to be more transparent and forthcoming about this whole debacle, especially now that more neighbors are getting involved and also think this is insane.  In our message, we asked what the safety plan is since we can’t use our front door.  We also said we will be sending the construction company and them our weekly schedules so they can work with us.  We’ll see what happens.  With the holiday on Monday, we still have a couple of days.  \n\nA neighbor forwarded me some gossip/info.  Part of this project apparently involves demolishing our “front decks”.  We… don’t have front decks?  Some units have little front alcoves where they could put small patio table and chair, we don’t have an alcove, so I guess that’s what that means?  We do have back decks, and they’re definitely also above the parking garage.  But it’s all just conjecture until we hear more from the HOA and construction.  My guess is that this is such a big project that they’ll just tell us last minute at the point in the project they get to the next major thing.  In the construction company’s slight defense, I guess they don’t know exactly when they’ll get to it since so much is going to be dependent on weather and who knows how it’ll cooperate in the long term, but you’d think they’d at least give us a roadmap to how this whole thing goes?    \n\nWe haven’t heard back from our landlord today, so we don’t know what they’ve learned.  They, too, think this is insane.  With this situation become a real shit show, we are hoping we can just be released from our lease early and move ASAP since, really, this isn’t supposed to be our mess.  Landlord has been pretty great over the years, didn’t raise our rents during the pandemic and has been attentive when there have been issues, so we’re hoping they’ll see that this is quickly devolving into an untenable situation for us and let us go. \n\nI'll update tomorrow/as I can.  Thank you again for all your help!",

Thanks again!!\n\n Hey everyone, just trying to figure out what to do in this situation, my partner and I have been struggling with his dad being violent, unpredictable, and unreasonable for the last 4-6 years. He has, on multiple different occasions, threatened to cause bodily or property damage to both his son and I, he has also used intimidation tactics to insight fear and obedience in us many times. For example, just yesterday I had told his dad to be more fair to his son and he got aggressive; walking towards me, pointing at me, and stating that \"You better listen to me\" before I started yelling for him to stop walking towards me. He did not. He didn't touch me but he got close enough to where I felt extremely unsafe and in danger. \n\nI have no true evidence of him treating us this way, best I got is old therapy notes from my doctor stating that I am experiencing domestic abuse and what I've shared with them at the time about his past treatment but that's about it. What future steps should I take to ensure that I can gather what information I need to put a stop to this behavior, anything helps. Thanks all.",

We know not to answer the door or speak to them without a warrant.\n\nIs there something that we can do? Do we have anything to worry about ? We are in contact with our immigration lawyer, but he has told us nothing except for “ do not answer the door. “ \n\nWe all work, pay taxes, follow the law, do not own any firearms, or have any criminal record. \n\nWhen she went about getting her green card, we did it completely by the book. My boyfriend is his mother’s sponsor.\n\nPlease let me know if we should be worried or if it may just be a misunderstanding. Happy to answer any questions you may have. \n\nETA:\n\nI understand this is a controversial topic, but I hope you all can understand my concern.\n\nDespite us all having status in good standing, ICE still did visit us. I just want to know what everyone’s thoughts are and if there is anything I should do. Thank you!",

They have scrapped the vehicle and they said everything that was in the vehicle is gone. We only found this out because of security cameras. Now they are offering 7.5k for financial compensation. Which is a much better payout than I was expecting so I don’t want to screw that up. My claims guy doesn’t want to pursue legal action against them and just get our money. But the more I think about it I feel like pursuing legal action is the right thing to do. They stole my car and stripped it, they knew it wasn’t right or legal and more likely than not multiple employees knowingly broke the law and it feels like I’m doing a disservice to my community by not pursuing legal action against them. \n\nEdit: people keep using the expression “honest mistake” and I’m just saying how do you take a car from a lot that you don’t have permission to tow from, then scrap it without the owners permission all quickly under the cover of night. Not to mention all the personal items in there that are now in the dump/employees possession. The only reason they are trying to make the situation right is because they were caught on camera and are scared I’m going to treat it like it is.

      "text": "Location: Texas\n\n\n\nI am 34M, and my Fiancé is 41F, and her 2 kids are 17M and 18F.  We are in Texas (North Dallas area). We are renting, and only me and Fiancé are on the lease.  Also, this is relevant.  My fiancé and family are Black and I am White.\n\nWhen I moved in with her family, her mom moved out of the house.  This was about a year and a half ago, but when my step-daughter graduated, she snuck her way back in.  She came to stay a couple of days for the graduation, then she had a client in the area (she is a caregiver/sitter) and asked if she could stay until the weekend.  I agreed but said that after that, she needs to leave.  Well, she stayed long and kept guilt tripping my fiancé to let her stay.   \n\nI had talked to her about paying $200 to help with bills, and we asked if she would move out before our wedding at the time in 6 months.  That was 2+ months ago. Today, I asked about the $200 to help with bills, and she blew up saying how she supported my fiancé before I came along.  I am drowning, consistently over-drawn, and 2 maxed out credit cards.  I'm am the sole income.  Hence, why I asked for a little help. \n\nShe went on a tirade and started saying how this is how white people do and calling me multiple names.  I am an atheist, and she would consistently call me satan and says god will smite me. It never really bothered me, but I have never said anything back.  Today, I had enough.  This has already caused a rift in her family, and our wedding in 3 months no longer has a venue.  Fiancé's brother now states we can no longer have the wedding/reception at his house because he will only believe his mom.  They don't want to take his mom either.\n\nSo is there something I can do about having her removed from the property since she is not on the lease?  I can give notice, and she says she would refuse to leave regardless.  I really don't want to have to call police to remove her.  Also, should i inform the landlord about this and her refusing to leave?\n\nUpdate:  Right after I made this post. My fiancé brother stormed into our house, threatening to fight me. Multiple he got up in my face, ready to swing, while I stood there. (I more or less him vent as I did argue with his mom)  I ended up calling the cops and had him escorted off the property, and MIL left to stay at his house.  We dont expect her to come back and try to live with us. \n\nThe officer mentioned if we are going to legally move her out, then we have to go to the justice of the peace and get a formal eviction. He also recommended a constable to come when they get her stuff.   Fiancé agrees she will not live with us again but doesn't want to do the eviction. \n\nThanks, everyone, for the advice!\n\nUpdate: Thanks everyone for the advice. Mother in law left Sunday and is not coming back. The extended family is coming to get her stuff.  Since she is not on the lease, can we refuse her? If she ever tries to come back?\n\n Fiancé and I are still going through with the wedding with or without them. We will have itbat our house. The kids completely understand and are with us. The relationship between me and the kids didn't change and even seemed a little closer.",

Their motivating factors sound to be \"everyone has always been intended to be a part of the HOA and this was a mistake\" and \"only those who are part of the HOA are allowed to use community ammenities\" (small park in 1st phase of the community about .75 miles from the entrance of our segment, and a pool/pool house scheduled to be completed May '26). They also cite that \"not being part of the HOA can effect resale value of your home negatively\"\n\nMy question is, is this something I HAVE to comply with and sign to join? Or is this a once in a lifetime opportunity to be free from the HOA and I actually have a legal right to do so?\n\nAs of right now I have only been living in this community for about 8 months and paid 1 years worth of membership dues but at the same time there are no \"ammenities\" readily available in our community and the services/standards they provide are more along the lines of common area maintenance, entrance landscaping, some privacy trees for the community and a new community sign (from what I have heard from neighbors). I have also found out that no homeowners within the community are currently on the HOA board, when meetings are held they are quick to announce what they are meeting about but do not allow for comments from the community or input on budget and expenditures. I believe the board seat issue is currently being fought as a larger number of the homes have been purchased by the home owners and are not being used as rental properties.\n\nI took pictures of their letter and FAQs but it does not look like the post allows for pictures to be added.",

She has been in the hospital and out of this house for around three months her daughters told me.  They live just down the street so they have been coming over to their mother’s house to feed and water said dogs, and to ultimately help to catch and put down the dog that attacked the elderly woman. \n\nSo, we went over with the expectation of a room with feces in it. They warned us of a bed totally covered in it. We were going to clean it up and get her a new bed. We walked into a totally different monster. \n\nThe woman is a hoarder, and so are her daughters. The house was filthy, hard wood floors destroyed by YEARS of urine. Poop caked on the walls from the dogs climbing and pooping on the boxes and piles of stuff. Nose burns as soon as you go inside. And then we walked to the basement. It was dark, I thought there was white shaggy carpet everywhere. I thought, “oh this sucks, I know the basement just recently flooded.”. I stepped down onto it, and I SANK INTO IT. It was an entire later of dog feces covered in white mold. I mean YEARS of it. I was absolutely appalled. We tried to help. We had five people shoveling poop into bags and throwing it away. We didn’t last long before we all had to get out of there from just the smell. And from the fact that her daughters wouldn’t let us throw away feces covered clothing and blankets. \n\n\nI guess all I’m wondering is, if I reported this to the city for the woman’s health, (her daughters are forcing her to move back when she heals) would the city deem it unlivable? This might be a dumb question, but I don’t know the laws around it. Or would I just be causing more trouble? (Kitchen sink doesn’t drain, neither does her only toilet I should add) I’m genuinely worried about this woman coming back to a house like this. It’s only going to accumulate again with the dogs she still has. I cannot fathom anyone living there. \n\n\nEDIT: Thank you all so much for the advice and resources! As of today I’m getting a group of two to three people together to all submit reports and get this ball rolling and get this woman help. The dogs have been removed from the property as of right now, and the daughter is attempting to rehome them as we speak. Though One shows quite a bit of aggression toward other dogs so this worries me. But, at least they are out of their own filth for the moment. Again, thank you all so much.",

We don't have money to afford a lawyer. Is there some public office in the US that can help with these matters?

      "text": "Georgia Code. Article 1 General Provisions (§§ 40-6-1 — 40-6-17)\n\n> (b) The operator of a motor vehicle approaching a stationary authorized emergency vehicle that is displaying flashing yellow, amber, white, red, or blue lights shall approach the authorized emergency vehicle with due caution and shall, absent any other direction by a peace officer, proceed as follows:\n\n>(1) Make a lane change into a lane not adjacent to the authorized emergency vehicle if possible in the existing safety and traffic conditions; or\n\n> (2) If a lane change under paragraph (1) of this subsection would be impossible, prohibited by law, or unsafe, reduce the speed of the motor vehicle to a reasonable and proper speed for the existing road and traffic conditions, which speed shall be less than the posted speed limit, and be prepared to stop.\n\nLocal law cited me for the \"move over law\". Officer was on the shoulder of the exit lane from a highway. I could not safely move out of the lane as I was being passed on the left by an 18 wheeler. I reduced speed to 35mph by the time I was perpendicular to him - posted speed 55. Dashcam supports these facts\n\nAs I approached, he swung his arm and clipboard into my path and you can see how much separation there was. Also, he didn't feel so alarmed as he was already turning his back and entering the cruiser before I was beside him\n\nIs that enough to have it dismissed? If not... \n\nShould I present my dashcam footage upfront as evidence or can I first try to argue them down with a not guilty plea?\n\nJust wondering where I might stand from a legal perspective if I have to fight it\n\nPlan: Enter a plea of not guilty, request to speak to solicitor. State that I wish to move to discovery with a line like, \"the officer's dashcam and speed detection equipment will prove my innocence\". Wear down solicitor, just before they sign my plea in I will float the idea of using my nolo but raise concerns of, \"i am not sure it is worth it for such a charge. i am concerned that my insurance rates will cost me thousands of dollars over time\"\n\nThis plan got me out of a \"failure to obey traffic officer\" ticket, reduced to like a 40 dollar parking fine. The solicitor ended our discussion with, \"congratulations\" and a hearty laugh so I'm hoping for a remotely similar outcome\n\nThank you all",

They are asking for every other weekend visits, Spring break, holidays, and a few weeks in the summer. Basically the patenting plan we have with bio mom who lives out of state. The past two years have been a nightmare. Long story short grandma does not know boundaries and thinks my step-son is her child, she even calls him her “son” instead of grandson or by his name. She has made false reports to CYFD, called my job and lied to get me fired (didn’t work), the list of awful stuff goes on and on. How likely is it she will actually get what she is asking for?",

My wife researched and found a vendor and they agreed on a rate / terms. The provider required purchase order. My wife reached out to her accounts payable team and they set up the vendor for payment. I believe the terms were Net 45 or 60.\n\nThe photo shoot happened and all was good.\n\nMy wife was let go about 5 week after the photo shoot. Whole team re-org.\n\nSeveral weeks later the vendor reached out to my wife via text asking to get paid. She told her how she didn’t work there anymore and to reach out to the company.\n\nThey continued to reach out periodically up to May of this year. By now my wife didn’t know anyone at the company and they had closed down the office where she worked.\n\nToday she received a letter in the mail, not registered or certified, from a law firm representing the vendor. Summed up by saying they demand payment in 5 days or they’ll proceed with legal action.\n\nI told her to ignore the first letter as you can’t trace that it was or wasn’t delivered.\n\nAny advice?\n\n  \nPLOT TWIST\n\nMy wife just casually mentioned how the lawyer called her and left a message about a week ago. We'll have a short talk later about why she blew this call off... \n\nHe stated that he represents the vendor and he knows that the company she worked for is, most likely, ultimately responsible but since she is the only contact they have, they sent her the letter. He also mentioned that he advised the vendor that my wife may/may not be responsible, but they want to proceed with collecting. No response, hence the letter. \n\nI told her all they want is the money, so she better start connecting some dots and getting some contact info from primary / secondary sources of someone at the company the lawyer can sink his teeth into.",

      "text": "I joined my roommates lease last October and the rent is about 3400 but we agreed I would just pay 1300 each month (location: San Jose, California). Plus 50 dollars I pay for a parking spot within the community. Is it a nice apartment with a gated community and pool. I rent out a room and next to my room is a bathroom that I use the most but others like her daughter or visitors will use because it is the hallway bathroom. She has the master room that has its own bathroom and she shares that with her 9 year old daughter. Today she sent me a rent adjustment notice telling me that rent will change from 1300 to 1800 on December 1st. This is exactly what she said:\n\n“ I wanted to give you advance notice that starting Dec 1 the rent for your portion of the apartment will be adjusted to $1850. This change is based on a few factors: - The overall rent and utility costs for the apartment have gone up, and I've been carrying the main responsibility for the lease, payments, and utilities. - The new amount is still below the market rate for similar rooms in this area, especially considering the amenities here (gated community, pool, gym, extra closet storage, private bathroom, and utilities included). - Parking will now also be included in your rent. - The month-to-month arrangement provides flexibility and convenience compared to a fixed lease, which is another benefit.\nThis adjustment also helps make things more balanced since I remain fully responsible to the leasing office and cover the majority share. I understand this is an adjustment, so I wanted to let you know ahead of time to give you notice. Please let me know if you'd like to discuss further. Thank you for understanding.”\n\nWhen asked for exact amounts of why it increased so much her main reason was because she’s the main lease holder so if there’s damages she hold more responsibility and it’ll affect her credit score and rental history. So I’m basically paying more because she holds more legal responsibility. Im confused on if that all holds and validates the rent increase. I read through the lease agreement but I’m still really confused if this holds up. I just want some clarity from anyone who knows anything about California rental laws. I also thought maybe she would cover more of the rent and utilities because her daughter also lives here and sleeps in the living room area. But when I did some research I think that doesn’t hold up.This is my first time joining a strangers lease like this and first time renting in California. Sorry for the very long post but just any clarification would help.",

When my (28m) Husband and I began dating over 5 years ago he had just discovered his mom opened up credit cards under his name and using his social security number that she didn’t pay, his credit was in the 400s. He got her to close the accounts and “promised” to never do it again. We are now trying to buy a house, as we got married last year and have been living with my parents to save, and the financial officer alerted us that he has accounts (including a utility one) that have gone to collections, totaling over $2,000 and has 4 open credit cards. I only know of 2 credit cards he has open (he was actually proud to open them and be able to pay them off each month to build his credit, after his mom wrecked it so badly).\n\nUnfortunately this woman is beyond the point of a conversation. I won’t put all their drama on here, but she’s not a good person (only 1 of her 4 kids speak to her). At this point, I know we should file a police report, but would that clear the collections or would someone have to pay? I know she doesn’t have the money to pay and I’m really worried about this delaying us from buying a home. \n\nI’m also open to suing if that’s an option. She has caused so much damage over literally a decade, he has lost so many opportunities because of her. Right now we don’t speak to her, so I’m not worried about hurting her feelings.\n\nAny advice would be great, and any insight from personal experience would be great.\n\nEDIT: thank you all for the advice! We are going the identity theft route, hopefully this will all be cleared up by the fall 🥲",

      "text": "Location: Florida\n\nThrowaway since I don’t know who might see this.\n\nMy girlfriend and I were together for 7 years. She passed away 2 years ago. She lived with me for 5 of the seven years we were together. I bought my home a year into our relationship. I was the only one on the mortgage and now I own the home. I came into full ownership of the home after she passed. My name is also the only one on all bills. My girlfriend did not pay rent. \n\nMy girlfriend’s mother has contacted me and has informed me that she intends to sue me for equity in the home, claiming that she has proof that my girlfriend invested in the home and that she paid to have renovations done to the house (we renovated one of the bathrooms and a bedroom and I paid all costs related to that). She did so via her family attorney who I looked up and I don’t believe works in this type of law, he appears to do wills and estate planning. She is saying I owe my girlfriend’s estate $100,000. I have no idea where she could have even come up with this number.\n\nFor what it is worth, my girlfriend’s mother has never liked me and has been particularly vicious towards me, including an accusation that I was responsible for my girlfriend’s death (she died of natural causes). I have not spoken to her since this outburst which was shortly after my girlfriend’s funeral. Her mother was the executor of my girlfriend’s estate. My girlfriend’s family, including her father and siblings, have always supported me and have denounced her.\n\nBasically I am wondering if I need to actually need to worry about this and what questions I need to ask when I meet with an attorney on Monday. My name is on everything, I can’t even find any receipts or anything that even has her name on it. This coming from an actual attorney does have me spooked a bit. I received this notice yesterday.\n\nThanks for your time.\n\nEDIT: By saying “come into ownership of the home” I mean to say I paid off the mortgage. Sorry for any confusion \n\nEDIT 2: Thank you to everyone who has answered my questions.\n\nTo clarify some things: No, her name has never been on the deed to the house and also no, we did not share bank accounts. I paid for everything out of my own accounts: the mortgage, the renovations, everything. She at no point contributed to these.",

      "title": "Oregon — Was my eviction from university housing after reporting domestic violence and an assault lawful?",
      "text": "Location: Portland, Oregon\n\n**My question is:** I'm Editing my question- How do i get in front of a judge? I know I have a case, but how should I proceed? I just want people to be held accountable. What type of lawyer would I even approach about this?\n\nI’m a former University student. After escaping domestic violence, I moved into campus housing. I disclosed my history to Residence Life after a separate on-campus incident that left me seriously injured. Soon after, I was subjected to a forced medical evaluation, my room was entered with police while I was gone, and I was evicted based on false claims of felony convictions (which I do not have).\n\nI tried to appeal, but was told no such process existed — also untrue. I believe this may have violated Oregon landlord-tenant laws and/or federal housing protections for domestic violence survivors.\n\nBelow is my statement as submitted to the University's Oversight and Compliance Committee, I am sorry about the long post.\n\nBegin statement.\n\n\\[I was in an previously undisclosed domestic violence situation.\\] I utilized \\[University\\] housing to safely leave the relationship and begin rebuilding my stability. I did not manage this alone — I received help from someone I believed I could trust. However, once I was safe and asked this person to leave so I could focus on my studies, they became confrontational. I was ultimately forced to raise my voice and inform them I would contact security if they did not leave immediately.\n\nApproximately one week later, this incident was reported to Residence Life by my former roommate. Residence Life staff visited my room to follow up. I was fully transparent with them, providing a detailed account of both the incident and the previously undisclosed domestic violence situation I had been fleeing.\n\nOn the following day, around 6:30 p.m., outside \\[Location redacted\\], my dog and another dog became aggressive with one another, barking and growling. During the altercation, my dog pulled out of her collar. As I attempted to regain control, the other dog’s handler approached me and, without provocation, kicked my left kneecap from the front, causing it to hyperextend and resulting in a torn ACL, PCL, and meniscus. I screamed and collapsed in pain, asking, “Why did you do that?” She responded, “You’re just lucky I didn’t do something worse to you,” and then walked away.\n\nAt the time of my housing application, I had low-level, non-violent warrants and I disclosed this information in accordance with \\[University\\] housing policy. After the assault, I specifically requested that police not be contacted, hoping to complete the academic term without disruption and address my legal matters in June 2025. Despite this request, police were contacted.\n\nOn the night of the assault (May 7th), Residence Life booked a room at \\[a Hotel\\] and offered it to me. I declined. The following morning (May 8th), at 9am, \\[a Residence Life employee\\] arrived at my dorm unannounced and told me that, because the assault had occurred on campus, I was required to be evaluated at the Student Health Center. When I objected — explaining I had already seen medics the previous night and intended to go to the emergency room later — she insisted that the medical evaluation was not optional and that I must leave with her immediately. I complied.\n\nWhile at the clinic, I coordinated with \\[University\\] staff to allow a friend into my dorm to watch my dog in my absence. Later that day, I visited \\[a crisis center\\] and met with \\[an advocate\\]. During this meeting, I was informed that \\[an employee of\\] Residence Life had attempted to enter my room with three \\[University/County\\] police officers to conduct a surprise inspection. They had expected the room to be vacant and were ultimately unable to gain entry.\n\nThe next day, I was told I was being evicted for violating the housing contract due to felony convictions. I have no felony convictions. I provided proof. I was then told the eviction was based on pending felony charges. I reviewed the housing contract with them and confirmed that pending charges did not violate the terms. They then claimed I had felony convictions from Georgia — again, I do not. I provided proof. Then they said I had a conviction for assault in Georgia, which is also false. At this point, it became clear that they were searching for any reason to justify eviction, regardless of the facts, my rights, my safety, or my well-being.\n\nAdditionally, \\[a Residence Life employee\\] misrepresented my rights. She stated that there was no official appeal process for the eviction (false), no formal appeal form (false), and no deadline for filing (also false). When I challenged this and mentioned that my housing rights were being violated, she responded that she did not know what rights students had while housed on campus. When I asked about protections afforded to survivors of domestic violence or sexual assault, she claimed to know nothing. This level of ignorance, in a role of such responsibility, amounts to negligence.\n\nI believe \\[the University\\] failed to apply applicable Oregon landlord-tenant laws, as well as additional housing protections for survivors of domestic violence and sexual assault. Upon learning of the eviction, I informed \\[a Residence Life employee\\], my \\[University counselor\\], and my \\[University advocate\\] that I felt targeted for being a victim of violence. This should have triggered an investigation into retaliation and fair housing violations. The Federal Fair Housing Act makes it illegal for a landlord to retaliate with tactics such as surprise inspections, false accusations, or unlawful evictions. Additionally she violated my HIPPA  rights by forcing me to have a medical examination at the \\[University\\] health clinic and conspired to violate my Fourth amendment rights protecting me from unreasonable searches and seizures. \n\nOn May 18th, my former partner located me at the hotel and attempted to sexually assault me. I filed a police report and obtained a restraining order. I am currently residing in a shelter for women who have experienced domestic violence and am on medical withdrawal due to ongoing complications from the knee injury sustained during the assault on May 7th.\n\nEnd statement.",

      "text": "Location: Texas\nHi Reddit this is going to be a complicated situation. Looking mostly for advice. My younger brother 20M is engaged to a girl who is 18F. She became pregnant when she was 17 and he was 19. Her birthday was right before the birth of the child and she is now 18. Some things to know is that they would like to be married, and would like to find a place together. However, her parents are being stubborn and are providing stipulations on them, saying that in order to be married my brother must first have a job. He agreed and found a job that was recommended by her father, and then the father stated this job was not good enough and he needed to find a second job. He has been looking in order to get married. Recently the child was born 3 days ago and the mother of the child was moved to the upstairs portion of the home, as she still lives with her parents. My brother went over today to see his baby as he is excited to be a dad and bond with his baby, but a text was sent today from the father of the fiance and mother of his child detailing that he was only appointed certain times to visit his child. I really am just looking for advice and the legality of the situation, because I agree that he needs to find a second job to support his baby but it feels not right to deny time with his child. Here is the text:\n\nFirst several weeks while the baby can’t go out:\n- Monday-Thursday C(father) can come over 6-9pm. Saturdays 1-6pm and Sundays after church until 5pm. \n- Bedroom is off limits except for changing of a diaper / putting baby in her crib\n- E(mom) we will pay for your cell phone, food and rent while here\n- A(mom's sister) is allowed to go upstairs to watch tv anytime she wants. It’s a shared common space.\n- Put an alarm on your phone to honor the end time. \n- B or B (parents of fiance) have to be home for Chance to come over.\n\nLet me know thoughts, comments, opinions and advice!!!\nThank you!!!\nAlso to clarify, the father of my brothers fiance is a pastor",

      "text": "Location: Michigan\n\nHoping someone here knows more about this than anyone I’ve been able to talk to about it.\n\nI work for a massive corporation in a manufacturing facility with around 1000 employees. My understanding is that, by (new) state law here in Michigan, my employer is required to provide 72 hours of paid sick leave over the course of the year (can be earned by hours worked or given all at once). However, my job has opted into just taking our sick leave out of our vacation, and once we’re out of vacation, no more sick time (whether we used it via requesting time off or calling in sick). I get 80 hours of vacation a year, so that technically would cover the 72, but if I take a week vacation, I’m screwed on almost half my sick time? Shouldn’t it be separate?\n\nTLDR: My large corporate employer uses my 80 hours of vacation towards sick leave. Once I’m out of vacation (regardless of how I use it), I get no more paid sick leave. Is this lawful?",

      "text": "Location: Kentucky\n\nEditing w fake names so it's less confusing, also I'm in a gay relationship if that helps clear some up\n\nMy fiance (Pam) co-owns a drywal business with her family. The officail distribution of shares is 25% her dad (Michael) 25% brother in law (Darell), 50% Pam.\n\n Originally her mom (Angela) also owned 25% but she had to file for bankruptcy  because she insisted the company buy another drywall company and long story short, Angela got sued. Before Angela filed for bankruptcy she signed the shares to my fiance Pam. Amgela is claiming they had a verbal agreement she would eventually sign it back over. She often lies about things like this when its convinent. Pam doesn't recall this conversation and was under the impression they were hers to keep. My first question is, is that bankruptcy fraud?  To sign over shares and then sign them back over?They arent buying and selling it, just moving it back and forth.I ask because one of the solutions she was considering was to just give the shares to Angela and quit but I warned her she might want to double check that she isn't accidentally committing a crime.\n\nPam doesn't want to sign the shares over because there is a long history of threats being made against the business as grabs for control. Angela has said herself that she has no \"cards\" right now and she wants leverage. One of the threats Angela made was demanding they pay back all the money she has given the business in 30 days on a whim, which would basically put them out of business.There is no written agreement that they pay her back for this money at all let alone by a certain time, can she legally demand all this money at once?\n\nAnother threat Angela has made is to make them change the business name. The business is named after Angela's maiden name and periodically she will demand they change the name because its her maiden name but she doesnt even own any shares. Does she have any right to demand they change the name just because it's hers?\n\nAngela also threatened to go around Pam and take Michael's shares in their divorce.\n\nThis has been a problem on and off for years where threats and personal digs are thrown around. It's amplified because Michael left her and Angela and Angela blames Pam. She tried to discuss giving Angela up to 15% under the condition she stops threatening her as a comprimise. Pam thinks she should keep 50%, and Michaels shares (her dad just left the company to cut all ties with Angela) 15% for Angela and the rest for Darrell. On the day-to-day Angela owns 2 other business and is only considered a business mentor and an investor since she's given the business money. Angela has not worked directly for the company in 5 years. Pam does all the managing of the company and finishing and her sister kelly (Darrells wife) keeps their books, Darrell does the hanging along with a crew which is why she thinks chain of command should be Pam then Darrell then Angela. Pam consulted Darrell about this before the conversation happened but in the midst of the conversation, Darrell said no words the entire time. Angela has tried to make designs for them on multiple occasions when she didn't have all the information because she is not operating the company like Pam and Darrell.\n\nPam is thinking about dissolving or selling the company, if she did is she under any legal obligation to pay her Angela back for any money given to the business they sell? Would Pam be breaking any laws if she left the company and kept her phone number which is associated with the business or kept any of her clients? (She's not planning on keep the number or contacts, I'd just personally like to know)\n\nI would love some perspective, I think everyone is caught up in family dynamics and I just want to know what legal position were in so she can make an informed decision.",

      "text": "Location: Utah\n\nMy husband grew up with a very controlling mother. The classic \"I'm the mom, so I'm always right\" kind of parent. We all know the type. But ever since my husband started dating me during his senior year of high school, things have gotten a lot worse.\n\nFor a little bit more context, my husband has seven siblings, six of them younger. The youngest is currently 3 years old. My mother-in-law doesn't work. She does \"projects,\" which often involve her to be away from the house. My father-in-law pays for the house that they rent even though she kicked him out five years ago. My in-laws are NOT legally separated or divorced. They just live separately and my FIL pays for his wife to live in the house that he's renting while he lives in his parents' basement.\n\nWhen my husband was eight-years-old, his mother had a miscarriage. I've had miscarriages as well, so I understand the pain. It's heart wrenching. She blamed the miscarriage on my then eight-year-old husband. To this day, he carries guilt for the death of his unborn sibling. According to him, the reason that he got the blame was because he was \"rebelling\" at that time. An eight-year-old. Rebellious enough to cause a miscarriage. \"Sometimes God gives us gifts,\" she had said to him. \"And sometimes He takes them away.\"\n\nShe had six kids at the time. She stopped taking care of them when she miscarried. My husband is the one who stepped up to cook dinner for his four younger siblings throughout this time. His mother was too grief-stricken, and his father was too busy \"supporting his wife.\" From what I've heard, my MIL cared more for her hyper-realistic baby doll that she bought after the miscarriage than her six living children. \n\nAs the children grew, and even more were added, my husband took on more and more responsibility of his younger siblings. Whenever he wasn't at work or school, he tended to them. Even after my husband moved in with me, he was expected to babysit his siblings for free. It wouldn't be a problem if they had asked him to babysit, but they didn't. They expected and relied on him to care for his baby siblings full time with no compensation. \n\nAnother thing you need to know before we get into the main issue is that my in-laws have joined a cult. If you live in Utah, you may have heard of \"Impact Training.\" On the surface, it seems to be a type of group therapy or confidence building course. But the more I learned about it, the more apparent it became that it is simply a destructive, life-ruining organization that has caused my in-laws to be away from home even more than they were before.\n\nNow, my husband and I have our own place and a baby of our own. We used to visit his family whenever we were invited, which was maybe every other week. My husband also started running every Saturday morning with his seventeen-year-old brother. Over the following weeks and months, we started hearing and witnessing more and more things that made us question if we should intervene.\n\nTo start off, my husband and I had an event at the end of June at a place of worship in our religion. Afterward, we were taking family pictures, and my six-year-old BIL was reluctant to participate. My FIL picked him up and carried him behind us to get in place for the picture. My 6yo BIL was crying, but he stopped very suddenly. I didn't think much of it until my mom and my sister both told me after the event what had happened. Apparently, my FIL shook his 6yo son to get him to stop crying, and it worked. Keep in mind that we are in public, in a place of worship, no less. We don't have proof, but we are confident that this couldn't have been the first time that it's happened.\n\nA few weeks after that, my in-laws kicked out their 18yo son, and he was only given three days to gather his things. After those three days, he spent a night in a church parking lot, at least one night with his grandparents, and then was graciously allowed to stay at his mom's house again. This sparked a lot of controversy within their household. A lot of feelings were brought up as everyone felt a bit blindsided. My one and only SIL, who's 12, admitted to my husband and I that she never feels safe around her parents. She told us that she wanted to live with us. My 17yo BIL claimed to feel the same way. He said that he \"feels sick every time he walks in the door.\" My siblings-in-law have always expressed a desire to live with me, even before I married their brother, but this information just broke my heart. Home, with mom and dad, should always feel safe.\n\nWe started getting calls from my SIL quite often (she uses their home phone to call). She would always be sobbing, telling us that she just needs us around so that she can feel safe. She wanted to sleep over at our house. After a few of these calls, we went over to my in-laws house, and I'll admit that I was very upset. My husband and I told them that they need to respect their children's boundaries and stop trying to control them if they want their children to feel safe around them, but my in-laws insisted that there was nothing unsafe about their home. My SIL was shaking. She refused to speak to her parents. She was crying so hard she couldn't breathe. Even still, her parents insisted that they couldn't possibly be the cause of her feelings. The only way that my SIL was even able to speak was if I held her in my arms. Despite my SIL's efforts, my in-laws managed to coax her back inside and she didn't sleep over with us. Neither my husband nor I have seen her since.\n\nDuring our conversation/argument, my MIL claimed that my 12yo SIL doesn't know what she's talking about when she says that she wants to live with us. She said that my husband's siblings just want to see us more often. But they definitely don't actually want to live with us. They just don't understand what it means to live with someone else. (My 6yo BIL has also made many comments about living with my husband and I instead of his parents.)\n\nThis argument happened weeks ago, and despite attempts to make plans with my siblings-in-law, we haven't seen any of them. Finally, my MIL admitted that she won't let them see us until the issues between my MIL, FIL, husband, and I have been resolved. She has also made no effort to resolve these issues with us, and we don't know exactly what issues she's referring to.\n\nMy SIL can only call us when her parents aren't home, which is still fairly often. She has started keeping a journal of everything that her parents do to her physically and verbally. She says that she wants us to adopt her, which I know is unrealistic, but I do know that I need to do something to keep her safe.\n\nToday, she called to tell us that her dad grabbed her arm very tightly and twisted it, which left some red marks, but not necessarily bruises. I really want to call CPS. I want this little girl to feel safe, and I want her to know that someone is willing to stand beside her. My husband asked his 17yo brother to confirm what the red marks looked like, and asked him what he thought about us potentially calling CPS (my SIL didn't hear this part of the conversation). My BIL admitted that he was hesitant to encourage us to call because he was afraid of what might happen next. He told us that he thinks we should wait until the school year starts because he believes that the abuse will escalate to more obvious and reportable levels.\n\nI understand what he means. He's worried that there isn't enough evidence against his parents because most of their abuse is verbal/mental/emotional and not as physical. I understand that calling CPS without much evidence probably won't lead to any actual results, and it might even make things worse for the children.\n\nBut on the other hand, I'm a mother. I can't just sit idly by and watch these innocent children get hurt. I'm so torn on what to do.\n\nAny advice? Anything I should know before making a call to CPS? What evidence do I need to have a case? Is there any good way to get evidence of verbal abuse? None of the kids have phones, so taking videos doesn't seem to be an option.\n\nI'm also open to any advice on how to help these kids feel safe even when we aren't there. Thanks in advance!\n\nEdit: CPS has been called on my in-laws before because they've left their underage children at a park alone for extended periods of time and without notice, but nothing came of it. Neighbors have threatened to call CPS because my in-laws lock my 6yo BIL outside when he's upset, and they've been doing that frequently since he was 3.",

Though it's not super physically demanding, it sort of is for a pregnant woman. There's lots of bending over while scrubbing and chemicals as well as occasional heavy lifting. My work week was also 42 hours. My boss initially offered to put me on for less hours if I needed to when I first told I her I was pregnant. I declined because it was early pregnancy and I wasn't having problems yet. A month or so later I was feeling way worse each day and I found out there were some risks in my pregnancy and I have to take it easier. I brought it back up to her that I need to reconsider her offer for less hours and she told me that I may need to take the day to consider other options (she mentioned government assistance or other jobs.) She told me she could no longer offer me a part time schedule because there was already becoming a decline in speed and quality of my work and basically it was either full time or get a new job. I ended up leaving and not coming back. I was upset and just felt like I'd been screwed over. I felt like she was talking me into quitting so I left. I knew it could not continue working 42 hour weeks. It was the only accommodation I had asked for. I knew i couldn't risk my baby for a job. I just can't help but wonder how legal her actions were.\n\nLocation: Oklahoma.",

      "text": "UPDATE:\n\nDaughter’s psychiatrist appointment was this morning and all parties were present. Explained what had transpired to psychiatrist, she was shocked. She informed all of us she will be required to report this to CPS and police. Encouraged us to do the same, and we have. Have also contacted the hospital compliance and ethics department to remind them by law they have 3 days to report this as well. \n\nThank you all for the comments and encouragement!  \n——————\nOriginal Post:\n\nLocation: Harris County Texas\n\nStory:  \nHi, and thanks in advance for your help! Kind of a un-believable situation. Divorced with 13yo child, I have primary with TX standard custody. Child has a rare genetic condition called Pyridoxine Dependent Epilepsy. Pyridoxine is vitamin B6, her neurologist has prescribed her to take 900mg of B6 a day. She has been seizure free for 12 years, since the very first dose of B6. For the past year or so she has been having unexplained neurological symptoms. (seeing spots, hearing ringing, clouded memory) Sunday she had a seizure and stopped breathing, CPR administered, 911 called, had a second seizure in the ER. Sent to epilepsy unit at different hospital. It has come to light that her father has not been giving her the proper dose. He believes she has outgrown her genetic condition. He admitted this to Doctors and it is on recording.\n\nComplications:  \n1. Ex husband is an attorney and uses it as a tool. I've spent nearly $100,000 between divorce, custody and just constantly being sued. I'm over this fight, don't want to spend any more money in family court.  \n2. The doctor office did make a typographical error in the dosage. She went from 400mg AM / 400mg PM to 400mg/500mg. Dose is based on weight and has gone up each visit for 12 years due to her growing. Doctor explained the new dosage based on her heavier weight. Everyone was aware of the new dose. But somehow in the chart it was written as 200mg/300mg. He was well aware of the 900mg dose, the typo wasn't even noticed until the ER contacted her Dr office for the info. I feel like this supports his case and makes the case impossible to win\n\nQuestions:  \n1. Do I have any legal recourse outside of family court?   \n2. Are there criminal or civil charges that can be pressed?   \n3. Should CPS be called?\n\nThanks!",

      "text": "Location: Texas\n\nHello friends,\n\nCurrently I'm enrolled in law school as a 3L in Louisiana. This past summer I took a road trip vacation. I bought 200mg total of THC edibles (legal from dispensary) in California. I left Cali with about 150mg left. An officer pulled me over in Texas on my way home to Louisiana because my plate \"wasn't showing up in his system at all.\" He asked if I had drugs or weapons in the car, and stupidly assuming THC is legal in Texas like it is in my home of Louisiana, I told him about the edibles. He searched the car and took them, and of course found nothing else.\n\nI now have a Class C ticket for possession of drug paraphernalia for 150mg of THC edibles. Will this ticket hurt my chances of employment or my character and fitness examinations, considering it was a small amount that I legally purchased, and had no intention of illegally consuming? Should I go to court and ask for leniency, or the DA to amend the charge? I've never dealt with this type of issue before.\n\nI plan to move out of Louisiana to practice in a northern, more blue state if that helps. Oregon and Washington are my current prospects.\n\nThanks.",

      "title": "How do I, or am I able to seek justice against my mother? (TW, SH mentioned)",
      "text": "New-ish redditor here, seeking help because quite frankly, I'm fed up. I (25M) was raised in the deep south ( Location: North-east Arkansas ), but never quite fit in. I, along with 4 other siblings, were adopted and raised by a Christian couple . Unfortunately, I was picked as the favorite by my mother, as she has an affiliation for the youngest baby in the room (She had 4 miscarriages, I think she has some kind of emotional attachment to babies.). I never realized how messed up the practices she had while raising us really were until I gained the context and perspective of an adult. Her favored treatment of me caused my other siblings to conspire against me, making me the target of their frustration that a cruel woman put upon them. They'd bully me, and tell others to do the same, and my mother would coddle me and put them down, perpetuating the cycle. As more and more of my siblings moved out, her anger and ire toward my other siblings only grew. One of my brothers was stressed to the point of SH, and my mother labeled him a \"Cutter\" and said he was \"just lookin' for attention.\". Chores grew more frequent, and our \"allowance\" was getting to use the water. I once asked to go to the doctor to see if I had some form of Autism, and she refused because \"Those bullies at school were getting to me\", and I was her \"perfect little angle, there is NOTHING wrong with me because GOD made me that way.\". She once strip-searched my sister in front of me, and said that she'd do the same to me if I ever hid anything from her. So, I became the perfect child. I made good grades, got baptized, put myself through local theater performances, all for the sake of pleasing someone who would never be pleased. Then, my father's Alzheimer's diagnosis. When I was roughly 13, the news became official from the doctor, and only myself and 2 other siblings lived at home. 1 of the two was driven away. My mother told me he had sold my Gameboy for meth and heroin, and she had kicked him out for stealing. He smoked a joint in the woods near our house and borrowed a lighter, and I didn't know why he had really left until last year .The first sign that hit me that she wasn't the good guy came after church one night. The pharmacist at our local drug store was a dude wearing some (Rather dashing) eyeliner and lipstick. This woman ranted and raved about the \\*F-slur\\*'s poisoning the public as she clinked her cross necklace around, then got SUPER suspicious when I was angry about her words. I wasn't even out of the closet (2017) or cracked my egg (2023) yet, I just knew that God told us to love our neighbors. The final, FINAL straw for me went a little something like this:\n\nMy sister-in-law pointed out that my mother's side of the family would be having a family reunion at my grandmother's house, roughly 2 months before the event happened. I told her that I'd probably like to go, maybe introduce the husband to the family. We agreed that it'd be fun, and she promised to send me a text, or have someone in the family who had my number send me a text, with details on the time and date of the reunion. But, months rolled by, and I heard nothing from my family. It wasn't until I was serving one of my former church members at my retail job that I even heard the reunion had happened. I had to explain to this woman that I hadn't been to the party she had seen all over facebook, even though my last name was all over it. I fumed. I sat and cried with my husband, and was depressed for days. I used to struggle with thoughts of suicide in my younger years, especially when my father's disease got worse and worse by the day, and may have had a relapse if it hadn't been for that wonderful man assuring me that the family I had chosen cared for me. But, after about a week or two, I texted my mother about it. We talked a little bit before I brought up the reunion. In this conversation, I never mentioned my husband, or the fact that we live together, or anything about our relationship. So it was totally unprompted when she told me that she \"loved me, she just hated my lifestyle and the path I had chosen.\". I snapped. I took my time, writing a paragraph or two that carefully and respectfully told her about her hypocritical, abusive, neglectful ways, and how they made me feel fragile and dumb all my life. I poured my heart out for this woman, hoping to crack that obsidian heart and make her see how much she had been hurting others and me all these years, even having my husband proofread my text to make sure it was clear and concise, almost professional. My \"mother\" then accidentally sent me a text, saying \"THIS is what op said to me\", before quickly replying with a hearty \"I'm sorry you feel that way\". I blocked her, and we haven't spoken since. I still have the conversation and screenshots of it for evidence, and could provide them if needed.\n\nIt's been roughly 3 months since then. And, being honest Reddit, I want justice. I know I wasn't a perfect person growing up, but I KNOW I did my absolute best. I followed her rules, I tried harder each time she moved the goalpost, I work hard, I love with all my heart, and I believe in kindness above all else, like she taught me to but never did herself. She once gave me a pillow for my birthday with a note that said \"you'll always have a place to rest your head with us.\", and I had to cuddle that pillow under a bridge because I wanted to \"Go to work, like we ADULTS have to\" at 18. This \"god-fearing\" woman left a teenager to live on the street because he wanted to do what she told him to do and be responsible, and I'm not gonna lie, I'm starting to get angry about it. I need to know that I didn't suffer for nothing, that my siblings didn't suffer for nothing. I need to know that karma works, and I need to know the right thing can be done. This woman made me feel useless, stupid, lazy, and told me I'd be friendless unless I did what she wanted, and I know that isn't what you say to a child, ANY child. IDK what I want, legally... I just want something to be done. That's why I'm here, to hopefully find out if I even have a case here. So, I guess I submit myself to you, lawyers of the internet. I'll answer any questions/tell as many stories as I need to.   \n  \nPlease, from a broken man who is beginning to lose faith in karma.",

      "text": "He was one of my closest friends (close enough that my card was linked to his Apple Pay because he was constantly short on money). When we first moved in together, I loaned him $3,000 to help cover move-in costs and the first month’s rent. Over the next six months, he only repaid about half — and only in small amounts, always after I reminded him multiple times.\n\nI kept swallowing the “I don’t have money” excuse, even while he was buying a huge TV, redecorating his room, and going on vacations with his girlfriend. But now something happened that just blew my mind.\n\nI had to leave town for 20 days. After a week of offering him a debt reduction to watch my pup (and getting shut down every time), I arranged for a friend to stay in my room and take care of pup for free. She was totally fine with it and happy to help.\n\nHe immediately refused to allow anyone else in the apartment and said he’d kick her out if she showed up. Then he suddenly changed his mind and said he’d do it himself — after blocking my free solution. I told him clearly I wasn’t hiring him — I already had someone who was happy to do it for nothing.\n\nA few weeks later, he sent me an official certified letter demanding $1,000 for dog-sitting and said he wouldn’t repay me unless I subtracted that amount from the debt.\n\nThat was the final straw. Now, I’m determined to take him to court. It’s not even about the money anymore — it’s about the betrayal.\n\nI’d really appreciate any advice — especially if you’ve been through something similar or know what kind of evidence actually works in small claims court.\n\n\nLocation: Florida, Hollywood\n\n\nUPD:\n\n**Quick clarification** (since many seem confused):\n– Yes, we are both on the lease.\n– Breaking the lease early would cost around $8,000, which I would have to pay alone.\n– He refuses to be removed from the lease and won’t agree to replace me.

      "text": "Location: Arkansas \n\nI’ve recently decided to pursue a case against my abuser who also became my youth pastor. The grooming and abuse began when I was 13 and he was 18 in 2016. It quickly developed into a romantic relationship that involved kissing, touching over the clothes, making out, etc. There was no penetration. This continued until early 2019. He also became my youth pastor in 2018 and despite his position of power, he continued our relationship and the inappropriate touching. He made small inappropriate comments here and there, like how he almost couldn’t wait until I was 18 or how I’d look cute if I was pregnant with his child. But I believe he was purposefully careful to not take it too far. \n\nWhere I’m asking for advice is can he get prosecuted? Almost no one knew that our relationship went past talking. Everyone in our youth group knew we were in a relationship, including the adults who were in charge. Everyone can at least corroborate that there was a romantic relationship. But I didn’t tell anyone there was sexual contact. So basically it’s my word against his. The detective on my case said that my abuser was caught in a few lies when asked about our relationship, but never admitted to the sexual contact. He said due to no one being able to corroborate my story about the touching, that it’s unlikely for him to be charged. \n\nIs this true? Am I just never going to see him be punished for him ruining my life?",

When I bought house and asked for help then he escape saying he don’t believe in investment n have loans, he denied me buying car since he gets cars from govt , he denied me to study abroad for uplifting skills where as his brother allowed to study with 1 cr money for masters and PG. in covid , when started WFH 👨‍💻 ( 2yrs expenses covered by govt setup ) then for one year 2022 he paid household expenses and started saying don’t I have contribute any thing in 2023 and got laid off after 16 yrs experience in Feb 2023 and at same time conceived , I enrolled mba with scholarship 2023 but this man abondan me in my 7th month of pregnancy by taking me to my mother house and cancelled flight tickets just 3 hrs before.

      "text": "Location: Illinois \n\nHi all,\n\nI'm seeking legal advice about a deeply traumatic experience I had in 2022 while detained in Macon County Jail, Illinois. I was booked on a non-violent Class 3 felony (Theft <$500). I spent what should have been ~30 days in jail, but my booking/release paperwork oddly spans from March 20 to May 6, 2022.\n\nHere's what happened:\n\nI was transferred to suicide watch shortly after booking.\n\nFor 7 days, I was held completely naked in a disgusting cell, with no bedding, no soap, no toilet paper, and no food or water for at least 3 days.\n\nCOs passed by every 15 minutes as required — I heard them mock me, laugh at me, and even one said, “I am poking you,” after I accused them of intentionally antagonizing me.\n\nOne officer even said, as a nurse was trying to draw my blood through the door slot, “This motherfucker wants war.”\n\nI hallucinated due to sleep deprivation, dehydration, and isolation. I hadn’t eaten or drank anything, and I lost touch with time completely.\n\nI never received information on how to file a grievance or seek help.\n\nI submitted a FOIA request — they said food/water logs “don’t exist,” video footage is withheld for “security,” and no emails were found.\n\n\nI’ve drafted a federal civil rights complaint (42 USC § 1983) alleging Eighth and Fourteenth Amendment violations, and I’ve started seeking representation. But I’m terrified of retaliation or being ignored. I already sent a formal demand and FOIA appeal.\n\nQuestions:\n\nDo I have a viable civil rights case based on the facts?\n\nHow much will the lack of internal logs or footage hurt my case?\n\nWhat can I do to strengthen my claim with the documents I was able to obtain?\n\nCan I sue both the jail and the hospital that called the cops on me while I was there voluntarily for mental health treatment?\n\n\nAny insight — especially from lawyers or people with similar experience — would help me navigate this and get the justice I deserve.\n\nThank you.",

      "title": "Debating getting Justice after 10 years of sexual assault/harassment from a family member’s baby daddy. She helped keep me quiet.",
      "text": "Location: New York City, USA. Cousin’s baby daddy 27-28 Male came into a room I was in with his children when I was 16 and told his children to leave the room. He closed the door and began pinning me down on the bed, my body kept getting up instinctively. Eventually he just stopped and his back was facing me as he just sat there. I got up and left the room , terrified and lost on the experience.\n\nMonths later, there was a celebration at my house, I was 17 now. All adults were drunk or busy, he came into my room and laid down by my leg, too close for comfort as I was on my laptop. He touched my leg and asked me if I wanted to have sex. At that time my blood ran cold, and my body too, I was terrified. I shook my head and said no, he asked me why. \n\nA few weeks later, I told his baby mother, my cousin and her younger brother, separately. The first thing she asked me was if I told anyone, then said I should keep it between us because I know how the family is. And asked me why I didnt say anything to her first, and if I do tell someone, to let her know so she can explain what happened. Even if she wasnt there when he tried both times. He calculated it. I explained to her that I blamed myself even if I didnt do anything. She was also pregnant with her baby girl at the time and put her hand on her stomach and said “do you think I want something to happen to my girl?” Then a few minutes later added “or to you.” But I didn’t trust it. It was part of her manipulation.\n\nAfter this she told me he hits the kids by spanking them etc. and that he doesn’t know how to act around girls because he never had a mother and his birth mom abandoned him. He was raised by his aunt. In my head I was thinking “im 17 right now.. he doesn’t know how to act around a minor? And is she making excuses for him..?” I remember asking her if he hits her, she said no, years later the family find out he does. \n\nI texted her younger brother everything that happened to me prior. I go home and a few minutes later she texts me “do you feel safe coming down?” I texted yes because she would be there. I go downstairs and long story short. She has me talk to her baby daddy, he said he never wanted to hurt me, that he’s known me since I was a child. My response was “im still a child” SHE LOOKED PISSED when I said that, he looked defeated. Throughout this conversation she was on her Ipad and didn’t look up until he put his hand out to shake it. I looked at her and shook his hand. Minutes later she told me to delete the text I sent her brother. \n\n^ above was 2014-2015\n\nIn Dec 30th-31st, 2023. She told me that she found out he touched her niece, and tried more than once. Was successful a few times. From what she was told. She doesn’t want me to say anything because she found out from her brother (niece’s father) and im not supposed to know. She said she told me because she thought I would understand. I recounted some of mg experience to her and she told me “thats not sexual assault.”  She also lied and told me he was 10 years older than her which is a lie, he’s 3 years older than her. I told her I wanted to get the cops and she was worried about her kids. Her blood pressure went up. \n\nLater on I spoke to her youngest brother about reporting or not, and recorded it. Even though it was a noisy diner. He said he’s not against me reporting but if I choose to, to let her know. I needed evidence that people knew.\n\nI have texts of her from Dec 2023, begging me not to say anything because her niece doesn’t want anyone to know. And I believe about her telling me to delete the evidence all those years ago, but I cant find it on my phone , I think its on her phone though.\n\nNow every time her baby daddy goes to visit the kids while she stays at her mom’s house, she texts me heads up or anytime he goes for their birthdays. \n\nHe lives with them in their home. \n\nWhat can I do to make sure they land in jail? Especially him? \n\nIm 27 now, 28 very soon. I want to know what legal measures I can take in case I choose to report. \n\nShe doesn’t know I want to report and thinks I wont because I care for the children very much. But I have to care for myself and my inner child. She was 25-26 he was 28-29. I was 16-17.\n\nAlso, after those incidents as a teenager and early 20’s, she has called me a few times after that to take care of her children. as she ran to do errands. \nHe was there so I didn’t fully understand why I was called there especially after what happened and being alone with him knowing I feel uncomfortable around him. I don’t think she trusted him fully to care for them.\n\nI have more wisdom now as a 27 soon to be 28 year old. I want to know my options, I don’t want anyone getting hurt and I want to do whats right for myself. \n\n** In my early 20’s the same guy (cousin’s baby daddy) said something to me in front of my brother who was 16 at the time and my brother remembers. My brother told me “how young does he think I was at the time to not know what he was saying?” I don’t remember what was said but my brother and I remember it was some pedophile thing and we both felt weirded out and never spoke on it again. Until ironically Dec 2023-Jan 2024.",

      "text": "Location: Scotland\nFriends location: England\n\nI was only informed of his passing yesterday and am still in shock, so I can’t think clearly but I know at least his suicide was a result of shocking police and social work incompetency.\n\nBack in June, myself and two other friends who knew him had to call for a welfare check. My friend who I’ll refer to as A, had received a package of poison which was illegally sent by some guy in Ukraine. I have a pic of the package but sadly, my friend had edited out all identifying info so all I can hope is that there’s been some kind of investigation.\n\nWhat I primarily wish to focus on is filing a report about the police officers who were told A had poison in his possession. The social workers who looked after him were aware as A had told his therapist. They were trying to seize the package once it arrived, but A got to it before them. The police, for some reason, decided it was good enough just to have a 15 min chat outside then leave. And that was it. At the time I was absolutely shocked that they just left without even trying to retrieve the poison, now I’m filled with rage. \n\nA had a long history of mental illness. He had been sectioned quite a few times and treated horrifically, but I would rather he at least been given the help instead of just left to do what he wanted. His therapist and the police believed him when he said he wouldn’t take it, but suicidal people LIE. He was essentially abandoned by them and I can’t even imagine how painful it was. The psychologist (knowing he had ordered the package) discharged him because he wasn’t engaging enough. \n\nA was an online friend who I knew since 2023, his only irl friend was the one who broke the news (A’s sister had contacted her). To make any kind of report, we would need a confirmation of death but asking his sister is out of the question right now. I have spent hours trying to find any kind of death confirmation online, but in cases of suicide it’s not uncommon for it to be kept private out of respect for the family.",

      "text": "Location: Australia.\nSo my partner acquired a spinal cord injury a year ago, he became a quadriplegic with no movement below nipples and no sensation. He spent 8 months in hospital. During his time in hospital he was treated inhumane and was neglected on multiple occasions. One incident was when they gave him the opportunity to dedicate either in his bed or on the floor (due to him being in isolation for Covid, which he also spent most of that time lying in bed due to the mental strain of how he was being treated) he chose to do it on the floor as in bed just felt feral. They didn’t give him a bed pan they put some mats in the floor sat him in a commode then left him to defecate on the floor. He was put in moldy shower commodes, his urine container was put in his bath bowl, and his food bowl was left next to these on the same floor he was to defecate on. He was left in his own blood mixed with urine for over 4 hours (which they knew about) when asked if he could have a shower he couldn’t because the two other men he shared a room with were in a routine. His phenomena with Covid was neglected to the point he coded and needed to be resuscitated and spent days in icu (I called numerous times to stress my fear of him choking on his phlegm and to monitor him but was ignored). I contacted R.E.A.C.H  and still not a lot of progress was made. There’s a few more things but those are the main complications and inhumane acts that occurred to my partner while just sustaining a life altering injury. This has also caused him to constantly put himself at risk because he doesn’t trust hospitals he just got out of icu because of a collapsed lung because he neglected his cold for so long because he didn’t want to go to hospital when he needed to. I wanted advice as to what if any steps we can take for action against the hospital. I documented everything and took pictures of EVERYTHING with dates and times. What is everyone’s opinions?",

After being unresponsive for a couple more hours they called again. Same EMS operator showed up, with my friend and the grandmother both asking to take her to the hospital.

      "text": "Location: Tarrant County, TX\n\nHello,\n\n   My question is regarding a tow hearing appeal from justice court to county court.  The original tow hearing was held in the Justice of the Peace Precinct 2 of Tarrant County. Not to go into too many details regarding the specifics of the case, basically the judge sided in favor of the tow company citing only the 14-day rule. From the research I had done, it was my understanding that if a notice isn’t provided to the owner properly, then the 14-day rule doesn’t apply.  Which is the reason I filed the appeal. \n\n \n\n  Anyway, after filing the appeal, I was told that it would be a trial de novo or basically I would have the opportunity to present my case again to a different judge. However, I recently requested a hearing date be set and I received a letter in the mail from the court clerk.  There is a sentence in the letter that I don’t understand. It states the following:\n\n \n\n“If you wish to have a voice in any future proceedings in this matter, please retain an attorney, licensed in the state of Texas.”\n\n \n\n  I am currently using the inability to afford court costs affidavit and can’t afford a lawyer. I have done everything up until this point, why wasn’t I told I would have to have a lawyer before I went through with the appeal? Are there any other options or ways of going about this? Any advice is much appreciated!",

      "text": "Location: California \n\nI just found out a family secret that a family member confessed to 2 different relatives that she abused a puppy of hers. To one family member she said the puppy ate a chicken so they hung it 3 times. Unsuccessful with their murder attempts they ditched it at a dog park. When asked by another family member where the dog was (was playing with her last time she visited) the response was “well we had to kill it since it tasted blood”. \n\nAfter hearing about this, I checked her Facebook and found she had gotten another puppy within 2 months of torturing her previous, that she doesn’t have now. I had a feeling she killed that one too and confronted her. She said “both ate chickens so we gave them away to the humane society” I plan on contacting the humane society to confirm she never gave them up if possible. \n\nThis happened in 2018. I know statute of limitations is only 3 years for felony animal abuse so I’m out of legal options.  The problem is she has adopted a few dogs from rescue shelters, and “fostered” a few different dogs also. She shouldn’t be allowed near dogs with what she’s done. Would it be okay for me to reach out to the foster and rescue facilities with the proof I have? Is there any other action that can be taken after all this time?",

      "text": "So this actually happened to my sister (28F) and her boyfriend (29M), I'm just looking for more info on what could be going on. This is the story I was told:\n\nAbout a year ago my sister and her boyfriend were at the Lights All Night 2023 festival in Dallas. They had taken some molly (MDMA) prior to entering and her boyfriend had 2 additional \"hits\" in pill capsules on him. They were taking a picture with friends when her boyfriend was tackled from behind by 2 officers, and another came up and cuffed her. They were taken to a tent with more officers, lab/testing equipment, and searched. Apparently, 2 female cops made my sister strip naked and searched her, but it was in front of 2 or 3 other male officers and her boyfriend, who they didn't strip naked. She was mocked for wearing \"basically nothing\" humiliated, and they found nothing on her. They found the 2 capsules of molly her bf had, and they tested a spoon or something that was on a chain around his neck and found ketamine residue. The officers took their IDs and info, and afterwards my sister asked something along the lines of \"what happens now?\" or \"do we need to do anything else?\" and an officer cut their wristbands and told them to gtfo and not come back, so, they left, and drove back home to OK. They weren't given any paperwork or anything. My sister and her bf were so distraught by how she was strip-searched that they called a couple lawyers to see if anything could be done (the answer was no, it was ultimately a lawful search/seizure) but they suggested she file a complaint with Dallas PD, so she did. They also asked about potential pending charges, and the lawyer \"couldn't find anything.\"\n\nWell, its been over a year, and yesterday her boyfriend was called up to HR at his job, and arrested on a fugitive from justice charge and completely humiliated. They are holding him here in OK without bail while he awaits extradition to Dallas, where he has 2 felony charges—possession 1 and 2. His next court date is in 2 weeks and he has to spend it in jail, I'm guessing because he's considered a \"fugitive\". He has never been in trouble before, theres nothing on his record.\n\nMy sister assures me they never received any phone calls, emails or letters informing them of the charges. Nothing. They really seem to have been completely blindsided. We actually all went on vacation about 4 months ago and he was able to board the plane? Surely if he was in THIS much trouble, labeled a fugitive, he would have been flagged and arrested then? He was also in a wreck about a month ago, and wasn't arrested then either. Maybe that cop didn't run his info or something? Idk. All of this just seems so sudden and extreme for ketamine residue and the small amount of MDMA they confiscated (~1/10 of a gram)... (yes, yes, I understand that it's still extremely serious)\n\nDoes any of this sound right? Because it feels bizarre. Obviously, they broke the law and there are consequences. I get that. But why weren't they arrested then, at the concert? Why let them go? Why weren't they given any paperwork stating charges and a court date right then? If I'm pulled over and only get a warning, the cop still gives me a piece of paper stating why I was pulled over. We're all just really confused and frustrated. \n\nDoes it sound like we have the full story? Is this common? What do you guys think?",

      "text": "Location: Colorado and Iowa\n\nIn the 90s my brother and I were severely abused by two men. It came out later (once we were safe) that there was also severe sexual abuse and assault. We were minors. Physical abuse was reported in Colorado and we moved back to Iowa where a few months to a year later the sexual abuse was reported. We provided multiple statements with 3 different police departments between Colorado (1) and Iowa (2). Colorado does not have a statute of limitations for sexual abuse/assault and that is where all of the abuse took place. We also provided video testimony but were told the audio didn’t come through. We were so young and I still don’t understand how the system failed us. One department sat me in a room to watch my brother’s testimony and it was the most heartbreaking and further traumatizing thing I’ve ever been through. He was only 5. \n\nIt has been years. My brother suffers severe mental health issues due to the trauma and abuse that are debilitating. He cannot live a normal life and function normally. I also have PTSD and other issues. Our abusers have never faced any consequences for their actions while I watch my brother, who my brother could’ve been, fade and cycle through reliving the abuse and trauma daily for about 30 years. \n\nI have feared that these people have and are hurting other children. I recently learned that they are living somewhat near each other. I have no doubt. I also have no doubt that these people are also accessing children online. I search regularly to see if he turns up on the registry or in the news.. nothing. Under the radar for decades. It’s almost impossible to try to find other victims by these people without going public online about it, which I cannot do for my brother’s privacy. \n\nWe tried to work with an attorney years later to try again to go after him and there wasn’t enough money in the case for her. \n\nHow do we go about trying to put our abuser away for good so my brother can hopefully begin to heal and no one else is hurt by this person? Are there attorneys or organizations that work on cases like this? I obtained copies of our affidavits and all the records from when the original reports and when we tried again in the early 2000s. It seems there is nothing we can do! We have been failed so many times and just want to see justice. \n\nAny advice, guidance, insight to how these types of cases get pushed forward is appreciated. Bonus if you know someone I can actually contact to help.",

Little did we know that one of my \"friends\" would send someone to the bathroom to record us and got me completely naked trying to redress. she knew about it beforehand bc of me. We didn't know there was a video until the next day that same \"friend\" (I think was about 16f at the time) created a fake Snapchat account, added everyone that popped up in quick add, then shared it to them. I believe the same was done on Instagram from what I heard, but I never saw it for myself. The reason I can't let this go 2 years later was bc it wasn't your normal leaked video. People within a 2 hr driving radius, and probably more, seen it. And it stuck around, re circulating for moths before people finally started to forget. I was kept in the dark for the most part \n\nI know a few days later she told someone on the phone that I didn't want to press charges, and she wouldn't let me bc \"it was my fault it happened bc I put myself in that position\" I told her I wanted to, and I feel her not taking action allowed it to spread the way it did. She hid everything else related to it and soon sent me to a military school to kick me out of the house later. \n\nI have tried everything, contacting local police, the school, and everyone keeps sending me in circles and sending me to the other. I don't know what to do. I really want justice and don't know how to get it, and I think she took it from me.\n\nEdit, I also tried the hotline for exploited children, and they said I need to find out if there was already an investigation, which it sounds like, but I can't get anyone to confirm that either. This whole thing has been really frustrating with how I keep getting ping-ponged between the city, sheriff, and school police bc my school has its own police force for some reason. All sent me to each other, and I finally gave up and came here. I also tried finding some attorneys, and the ones I reached out to won't take my case",

However, he continues to call and generate new numbers anytime I block them. One of his previous girlfriends did reach out to me, as I never reached out to her since people tend to shoot the messenger—once she did, I sent her all of my SS and everything to expose who this guy is. He is now with another new girl, but he is harassing me. I never respond to the messages, I screenshot and block.\n\nI have changed my # and he somehow got it - I don't use social media really at all anymore, I speak to no one we ever had mutually because I am now in a constant state of anxiety and fear. I went to court and expressed to the judge possible charges or anything, and they stated that since there is no current DV, I can't do anything (and there has been in the past).

She was walking along a creek when someone aimed and shot her with a .22 hollow point pellet. Nothing was seen or heard at the time of the incident. \n\nI’m making this post because the detective assigned to the case told me a week in that we would likely never find who did it unless someone comes forward with information. I’m hoping to uncover different avenues that might be worth exploring to find who’s responsible. \n\nThe surgeon confirmed that the pellet entered her right side from ahead of her and at a slightly downward angle. A row of homes run along the creek that sit on top of a slope so we’re fairly certain it came from one of those homes. \n\nEven though the pellet was a hollow point, it failed to expand on contact. It still managed to hit her diaphragm, pancreas, spleen, and intestines, so the surgeon also believes the shot was made at close range. \n\nDoes anyone have any suggestions as to what else we can explore to increase our chances of holding the person responsible accountable?\n\nLocation: Nashville, Tennessee",

Well when it came to file the appeal, out of no where the attorney decides to flip around and throw in the towel and EMAIL, not call, even though he’s always called her to set up appointments to talk, but emails her tell her that their work is done and there’s nothing more he can do or wants to do for her. And gave her less than 24 hours to find a new attorney to be able to pick it up and appeal the case. \nThere was a mediation video conference date set two or three different times talking about settling out before it all was dismissed.\nMy dear friend is heart broken. \n\nTo me it seems like the attorney took a side pay off. \nIs there anything that can be done?\nWhere’s the justice in any of this?",

      "title": "Can I file a Motion for New Trial under Rule 59(b) Small Claims North Las Vegas Justice Court",
      "text": "Location: North Las Vegas, Nevada \n\nAs my title says, I want to know if Rule 59(b) is applicable to small claims in North Vegas Justice Court. I learned about this Rule from the document to file Motion to Set Aside Judgment. It's #2 on reasons you can file. (Not able to attach a pic) it says \n\"The court may set aside a final order or judgment pursuant to Nevada Rule of Civil Procedure 60(b) for the following reasons:  (1) mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect;  (2) newly discovered evidence which by due diligence could not have been discovered in time to move for a new trial under Rule 59(b); \"\nI understand it to mean, you can file to set aside judgment so long as the new evidence wasn't discovered in time to file for a new trial, as in the new trial is the preferred first step? \n\nBackstory (short version): I'm the plaintiff, only part of my case was \"won\". Received $1,100 + court cost, out of $6,000. I was suing for return of my full deposit $2,500 (zero damage house left in PERFECT condition) and double my deposit for not returning it withn the 30 days. =$5,000 +\n\n*$1,000 electric & water bill reimbursement... (if interested details on bottom page, not directly relevant to question)\n\n* Majority of case depends on date keys were returned, to determine if deposit was returned within 30 days*\n\nPart of my deposit was kept for rent they said I owed, I moved out & returned keys in dropbox Oct 4, 7am. They charged through Oct 13th. Mailed deposit Nov 9th (sent it to the address of their property i just moved from, instead of my new address I provided).\nTo show my move out date, I provided the judge the following proof I no longer lived in the property. \nReceipts of the airbnb I was staying in Oct 1-12. \nElectric bill showing electricity was cut off Oct 5. \nCarpet Cleaning receipt Oct 3rd.\nEmails w property management where I state I would drop off keys early Oct 4. Their reply was to leave them in the dropbox. Which I did.\nI testified under oath that I called that morning & left a voicemail that the keys were returned. (No visual proof to submit)\n\nThe property management company lied saying they never received the keys and had to get a locksmith Oct 13th, I was charged a rekey fee as well, taken from deposit. \nAs proof they had my keys I submitted an email I received from them Oct 13th confirming they were in receipt of my keys. Their story was they meant the locksmith keys? Makes no sense to notify me that they got keys from a locksmith & no mention of having to get a locksmith. Email said \"We\"re in receipt of your keys.\" The judge agreed it didn't make sense. \nMore proof they KNEW they had the keys Oct 4, after I dropped them off, emails stopped. I never heard anything back about \"are you moved out yet\" which we communicated about everyday from Oct 1-3. They would have harassed me for rent or asked if I was out yet, if they didn't have my keys.\nJudge agreed it was weird communication stopped, yet he wanted more proof I dropped keys off? I remembered in court that I emailed my boss that morning stating I was running late due to driving to Henderson (their location) to drop off my keys. The judge said that would suffice. I tried to locate the email using my phone, I was rushing due to it being during the proceedings. \nI also remembered I had a screenshot of my maps showing my trip to their location, (had a feeling I could need proof one day). I was unable to locate it during court as well. \nI didn't know I would need more evidence than I provided and was unaware they would lie about receiving the keys. I thought it was a misunderstanding easily cleared up. \nI found both, the email and screenshot after court. \nBy the judge not ruling I returned the keys the 4th, it dismissed my double the deposit suit since Nov 9th was within 30 days of Oct 13th. Leaving me to also pay rent for that time. I only owed for the 1st-4th\nThey had an attorney, I was unable to find ANY attorneys in Vegas willing to represent a tenant, only landlord's. If anyone knows an attorney I can hire or at least pay for a consultation, or to write the Motion, please share their information. \nMy other option is to appeal by Tues, but I need an option that allows me to include new evidence. (Email & screenshot of map) Is it right that an appeal doesn't allow new evidence, only a review of the case as is?\nMy questions:\n\nCan I file a Motion for New Trial under Rule 59(b) in Small Claims Court, North Las Vegas Justice Court?\n\nCan I file a Motion to Set Aside Judgment based on the below 3, from the information I've provided \n(including what's below about the bills & pool)\n\n1) mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect;  \n(2) newly discovered evidence which by due diligence could not have been discovered in time to move for a new trial under Rule 59(b);  \n3) fraud, misrepresentation or other misconduct of an adverse party;  \n\nIs my email, screenshot, or daily bills ( from info below) considered \"newly discovered evidence which by due diligence could not have been discovered in time\"?\n\nDoes an appeal allow new evidence, or only a review of the case, as is?\n \nInformation for an attorney I can pay for a consultation or hire for small claims?\n\nRecommendations on next steps?\n\nTHANK YOU FOR ANY HELP!\n\nBelow is more details of my case not directly relevant to my original question. It's a lot of info probably boring if not involved. \n\nI was also suing for partial water & electric bills incurred from the owner for draining & refilling the pool FOUR times, twice the month before I moved out, to make sure I had to pay for it. The last month he used 59 THOUSAND GALLONS! On top of running the pump to empty it for 3 days straight each time. The whole time i lived there I also had to pay electric to run a pump that didn't work, but they kept running.\n \nHe lied in the home listing advertising it as a sparkling pool & pool service included in rent. It didn't work the year prior, so it was 100% false advertisement.  (I spoke to the previous tenant who confirmed it never worked & the city cited him for a non working pump during her stay). The city also came and gave him a citation for it while I lived there. \nIt was green and nasty, attracting mosquitos the whole time.. Instead of fixing it he would drain & refill it at MY COST. By doing it right before I moved out, he charged me to get the home ready for the next tenant. It was malicious, there's MUCH MUCH more to this story but I'm sure it's already more than anyone cares to read. \nAs proof, I provided the judge numerous pictures of the green pool, the city citation, pics of them emptying & refilling it, my monthly water & electric bills. The judge said I needed a DAILY breakdown of water & electric use to prove what they cost me vs my usage! I provided information of what an average 3 person family uses (6-8k gallons) there are months my usage was 19k, 33k, 39k, 59k, with the highest months right before I moved out. Paying multiple extremely high water bills up to $360 & electric as high as $900, for a pool that never worked, on top of the added rent for a home with a pool.\nAl I was asking for was $1,000 of it back. If I can get a new trial or judgment set aside, I will check with the water & electric company for a daily breakdown. Again, evidence I was unaware would be required, believing my monthly bills would be sufficient, along with visual proof of the usage. Would the daily bills be considered \"newly discovered evidence\"?",

When my parents (the pastors) were made known of this they let the court handle it. Since I was a minor when this happened (14 y/o) I was oblivious to what was really going on. \nThe man plead guilty to everything but my parents didn’t take much legal action. He’s on Probation for 10 years and signed something saying that he will not stalk me or message me…\nPrior to this happening to me, he was already on the sex offender list for something he did to a minor. \nI got access to my records today and it says that it happened “two or more times” for a little over a year. This is FALSE information. This happened at least 100 times or more, over 4-5 years. \nI’m livid, I feel like I have not gotten the justice that I deserve. My whole life I have dealt with mental and physical health issues because of this happening. Is this a case that I can reopen?\nPlease no negative comments, again I am just looking for answers and direction.",

      "text": "Hello, R/LegalAdvice! I thought I’d come here and ask this since Google has not been providing any information after over half a month of persistent research.\n\nI am curious as to how the education system works in California in terms of the law. I know of a teacher that has committed various fire-able offenses including some criminal ones that could potentially land them in the hands of the law.\n\nThey are an elementary teacher but have a completely separate life on the Internet with aliases. I do have solid proof it is them, as well as many documents to show the Justice System etc. with their admission to cyber stalking many people via email, threats of a massive, reckless and false smear campaign on another individual, which their school most likely had no idea about. It is all attached to their name.\n\nThey have began to send countless messages to said people under anonymous aliases, but none of this started up until the threats directly from to their real name in writing were placed upon said person.\n\nHow would I go about this legally? This person is on the younger side, so they likely just are not in the right mindset or too hopped up in internet culture and viewpoints, but it is still very inappropriate for this person to be doing all of this as a teacher to elementary school students.\n\nIt doesn’t seem like a mindset to have a double life online constantly targeting, threatening and harassing countless people after a major gap (1+ years) of no contact from the person they’ve been threatening. (Not legal no contact, just no back and forth direct contact)\n\nI suppose I’m just curious as how to go about reporting this if it keeps happening. Would accept lawyering up if needed in advice, but would rather keep it minimal to save the money. They cannot lie in court or state anything that’s mentioned in their cryptic anonymity, because they know it is untrue and can’t make false and reckless claims as a professional educator. It is more for their personal gain, which is also admitted attached to their name.\n\n I’ve tried to look up countless school directories to find their name, but proved futile, looked into a full background report which also proved futile. The only thing I was able to find is their credentials record and reference number, but no place of work.\n\nWhat’s the proper way to stop the cyberstalking and countless threats to many people they’ve made while teaching 6-12 year olds?\n\nShould I report it to their local Police Division? Should I contact all potential counties I suspect they work at and send them an email with a simple inquiry on how to report a person that may or may not be employed there? I’m a bit stumped. I don’t want to go super legal and involve lawyers, like I said, unless it’s highly recommended, but I do believe this behavior should not be the act of a person who teaches young children for a living.\n\nAny advice helps, the location of the suspect is in California, however the behavior that’s been exhibited are mainly cyber crimes, which could mean federal, so I’m stuck on how to approach this after finding little to nothing on advice or who I need to contact.\n\nI also do have knowledge that cyber crimes are not taken as seriously, and I never have taken it seriously until now, but I do believe it gets different when a licensed educator is involved and breaching their terms of federal employment, to my understanding.\n\nIf you have any inquiries, comment and I’ll do my best to reply when I can.\n\nThank you Reddit, and thanks again for the potential advice in advance.\n\nUse location: California",

One night my sister called my dad and said that they all her husband, sisters and mother are fighting with her and are asking and forcefully removing her from the house . Then the matter got solved it was all the mistake of his sister but he stood there silently.. after some days her husband cleverly dropped her at our home and all of them blocked our numbers for 2 months my sister lived with us and after an informal meeting (panchayat) she was sent back after about 1 month of this his brother died of liver failure leaving behind his wife and 2 children 8 yr old & 4yr old ... On the day of his demise my sister got fainted due to shock and trauma she was rushed to hospital by us and my father paid all the bills the doctor suggested to take proper treatment but they got her discharged against medical advice\" LAMA\" provided by the doctors .After her discharge the next day she was forced to wash clothes with hands even if canopla is placed on her hand ..Now they planned to torture my sister mentally and physically to be mentioned that they slapped her in the room and when she reacts them the recorded all that in cctv they also snatched her phone so that she can't tell anybody .. on 24 th Jan my sister birthday they left her alone locked in the house she is a weak hearted person so her mental condition was not so good also but they still tortured her after she fainted i don't know the proper term so I am using fainted but it is more than that her limbs stopped responding and doctor used shocks to revive her so they admitted her in a local hospital at night where the doctor did nothing but gave sleeping injection, one of our relatives got the news the next day mentioned that we were not even informed about that so we rushed to the hospital where she was not even concious for about 9 hours .. My father after seeing there is not such doctor in the hospital took her to a good hospital.. they all again blocked all our phone no and not even asked about my sister health even once .. so we get her home ...\n\nWe thought that firstly we will give proper treatment to our sister and then see we should we do but then they called one of our relative and told that they will not take her back and will only give the goods back no alimony... Bcz they don't need a fast divorce as it is their plan as his brother died and now he will take care of his wife and children ...\n\nAlso they are saying do whatever you can if u wanna file a case then file it we are not afraid..\n\nWhat should we do ?? Everyday I am seeing my family crying... Feeling so powerless and useless.  \nIs justice in India a myth \nDo good people have to suffer everytime",

Father won a $250 contest for his neighborhood, when he was given the prize he was told there was a mistake and given a $100 card to sign for instead, then once activated and attempting to use it, it only had $15 on it. The landlady refuses to rectify the situation claiming and accusing my father of trying to steal from them and that the card he’s bringing back isn’t the one she gave him etc.. He thought it was a mistake at first but now without looking at the card he was given she is claiming it’s not the same one. Highly suspect but given this, it seems bad idea to leave a bad review or she may retaliate. \n\nWhat, if any, course of action can we take to seek justice for this undue stress and could this be grounds for “breach of contract” or anything?\n\nThanks in advanced from a concerned neighbor and son.",

I delivered a baby at a local hospital this past June and had a very traumatic medical experience. I recently found out the delivering doctor no longer has hospital privileges at this hospital or the other local hospital they once did. Their practice has closed suddenly as well. My records from the doctors office were transferred elsewhere. I never got a heads up. However, it seems they are still practicing somewhere else. I don't really know if I want to file any complaints. I really just want to know if the hospital could have removed this doctor due to my experience. I'd imagine I could request my medical records, but I don't think what I'm looking for would be there. Maybe I'm wrong? Is there a way to request info on why a doctor lost their admitting privileges soon after you were treated by them in the hospital? Would that be a FOIA request? Would I contact the medical board? I'm at a loss of where to start, thank you!",

I called 911 and the attacker said it was a fight so they believed him and did not arrest. I was advised that a criminal complaint at court might not go anywhere because the police didn’t charge. There were no witness besides my teenage daughter and no video of the attack. I feel so betrayed by the justice system and so shocked the police would not protect a victim of a crime. Is there anything I can do? I’ve been living a nightmare and was in extreme pain for 2 weeks my lips and mouth were so badly damaged and still not back to more as my ribs are still painful from being broken.",

      "text": "UPDATE #3\n\nThank you all so so so much for the guidance and support today. I don't know you, but I love you.\n\nI finally got in contact with a lawyer who specializes in dealing with dealership legal matters. Note: Couldn't find anyone to help me using the verbiage \"elder absue,\" \"vulnerable person financial exploitation,\" or \"vulnerable adult exploitation.\" Searching for \"contract lawyers\" yielded better results and \"dealership lawyers\" led me to the only viable option of like 30 places that I called in total today.\n\nThe lawyer said we could leave the car; it would be a breach of contract, but the dealership couldn't really claim any damages, so breaching the contract would have minimal consequences for my grandfather. So that's what we decided to do.\n\nWe got grandfather's POA updated and tried to freeze his credit, but unfortunately the dealership somehow submitted all his information and got it approved with a lender yesterday only a couple of hours after the purchase.\n\nAnother family member went back to talk to the dealership today after we left and they offered to lease the same new vehicle to grandfather (instead of a loan) with better terms. I will be asking our lawyer to advise on this. Not sure if we should take it, but we won't be able to get a better deal elsewhere, I fear.\n\nIn the coming days and weeks I intend to report this business to as many agencies that will listen to my story. My autism-given bulletproof sense of justice will not let me rest until something is done to correct this disgustingly predatory business practice. I know it probably happens everywhere, but if I can take this one down, I'll have done my part in trying to help.\n\nBest of luck to anyone navigating this horrible situation. I'll try to keep updating so that future people might be able to know how to better handle something like this happening to their loved one.\n\n\n———\n\nUPDATE #2\n\nWe were told that we shouldn’t leave the car because the dealership will call it in as abandoned and that even though there is a cancellation policy in the contract that was signed, in Arizona cancellation laws don’t apply? \n\nWe followed all the steps on the page of the contract titled “Limited Right to Cancel Purchase.”\n\nWe are trying to get POA switched to grandfathers child, but scared to leave the dealership. \n\nThere is now a salesperson from the dealership sitting outside our car (not the newly purchased car) looking at us and recording us. \n\n\n———\n\nUPDATE #1:\n\nWe went to the car dealership and per the contract my grandfather signed, we dropped off a written letter of cancellation of purchase, gave verbal cancellation of purchase, left the keys on the counter, and left the new car parked out front all within 24h of purchase. \n\nThe sales manager told us that the cancellation policy is something that doesn’t exist even though we have the page right here in the contract; he said we are only eligible for a lemon trade in?? We said we are leaving the car here and they said if we leave the car will be considered abandoned. \n\nSo we parked next to the new car and called the police. Police came out and said they can’t do much because it’s a civil case not a criminal case. \n\nWhat I need to know immediately is can we leave the car and leave the dealership? Grandfather has health conditions and we need to get him back home relatively soon.\n\nI tried to get connected to a lawyer but they all have 2 week down time. I just need to know what to do next so I don’t get us into a legal bind. Please help. Thank you all dearly. \n\n\n———\n\nArizona, USA\n\nTl;dr:\n\nGrandfather went to a car dealership today for a grocery store gift card promo and came home with an unplanned, new, 2025 car. They want him to come back into the car dealership tomorrow. I need to know what to say to get them to walk that back because grandfather is not fit or responsible enough to make a decision like that.\n\nOriginal Post: \n\nMy grandfather got a promo in the mail from the car dealership he leased his car from that said they were offering grocery store gift cards. \n\nToday he went to pick up the gift card and came back home with a brand new car. \n\nWe asked him how this happened and he is unable to tell us quite how he got from ‘grocery store gift card’ to ‘canceling his lease’ to ‘bringing a 2025 car home.’ \n\nHe’s not in the best health, shouldn’t be making big decisions, and isn’t the person in charge of his own finances. \n\nWhen we asked him how the car dealership checked his credit or verified he could make the payments, he said they didn’t need any of his information and that he just had to sign papers. Then they gave him his contract on a USB drive. He doesn’t have a computer or even a smartphone; he doesn’t know how to use a USB drive. \n\nThe car dealership wants him to come in tomorrow to pick up his paper contract. \n\nMe and my family members intend to take him back tomorrow to return the new car and reinstate his old leased car\n\nRelevant points: \n- His previous leased vehicle was almost at the end of his contract and he would have been able to buy it out \n- This new 2025 car now has a $400+ monthly payment for SEVEN years!\n- He didn’t even have access to any banking or personal info that would allow him to qualify for a purchase like this \n\nWhat do I need to know before going in tomorrow and making them fix this? What information or topics do I need to learn before tomorrow to go in there and get these fuckers to rollback this situation? The new car purchase AND the lease-end contract. \n\nFrom my research so far, this seems fairly in line with “elder financial abuse,” deceptive, predatory, and misleading. Not to mention the grocery store gift car lure. They think someone who needs a grocery store gift card can pay a $400+ loan? No way. Predatory as fuck.",

Recently it just keeps going through my mind and makes me feel very furious and it’s keeping me up at night.\n\nSo the abuser(which i’ll call joe) has always been very touchy towards everyone but he tries to do it in a “joking way”. We all brushed it off as joe’s kinda homophobic and his religon is very prohibitive of it and he’s quite dedicated to his religon. we all played a sport connected to school and we would travel far for some events. I was kinda “friends” with joe just because of mutuals, it was just because i had to be around him a lot. he’s a little different and validation hungry and always tryna act cool, mclovin type of guy. he’s extraverted and quite known but not taken that seriously. he was 17 and I was 16.\n\nwhile we were on a trip, at one point i went to the back of bus which seat extended across the whole back fitting 3 people. there wasn’t space and joe sat down on my like knee and started laying back on me. i kept pushing him off and telling him to fuck off but he wouldn’t. another friend was like hahaha joe what the fuck are you doing and then jokingly hopped on top of him while he was on me. and the other friend was like “joe what the fuck, why the fuck are you erect”. he walked off to the front of the bus and didn’t say a word. that shit made me sick to my stomach and i knew his intention for 100% certainty than. \n\nwhile at the hotel our rooms had 3 people, he wasn’t one of them but one of my roommates was close with him, they were like childhood friends. i was friends with the roomate though. a lot of us on the team smoked and we all smoked a lot that night and would go to diff rooms and sesh with different people on the trip. it was well known by the team we smoked a lot. that night i smoked a lot and i was knocked out after i went to bed and took ages to wake up and my roomates couldn’t wake me up. \n\nat somepoint during this morning joe was let into the room with a couple people. joe got into bed with me while i was unconscious and everyone told me who was there how he was touching up all over me. the covers were also over so who knows where he was touching. i had set my boundary for him to not touch me countless times. he did it because he knew i was knocked out because i was fucked up. 3 people witnessed it, i was completely unaware until i was told. there’s not a chance i’d let it happen if i was awake and he knows that. the thing is he’s in contact and still friends with the witnesses and i stopped talking to them. i’m not sure if they would testify or even take it seriously, i suspect they might still think he was joking or just defending him since they’re friends. he comes from wealth and is doing well.\n\nis there anyway i could get justice legally? we’re both over 18 now so i wonder if it would even effect him since he was a minor. what kind of evidence do i need? is this worth pursuing? is it a bad idea to contact him if i’m taking legal action?",

My daughter (17) was in a wreck over the weekend, when she got into the wreck, her phone automatically dialed 911. My daughter said that when she got out of her vehicle the other driver (19) saw her phone was calling 911 and took her phone out of her hand, hung up the call, and gave it back to her and then told her that they didn’t need to call anyone and nobody has to admit fault. I’m not sure what the girl was trying to do. This being my daughter’s first wreck she was kind of in shock and didn’t know what to do so she just took her phone back. She was not injured so there was no need for 911 but this just seems really shady and wrong that she did that. This was not reported to the responding officer at the scene, my daughter just told me of this last night. I’m not sure how to proceed or if there is even anything that can be even be done, is this something I can make a report with the police for it something I just need to let go?

      "title": "My minor daughter got fired after telling her boss about a 40 year old man who has and still is trying to pursue her. ",
      "text": "My daughter (17) got herself involved with a 40 year old man at work last year(she was 16). The things I found were vile. Letters begging for him to send her videos(sexual in nature) and why did she quit talking to him and he was gonna wait for hers he loved her. Gross behavior. Let’s face it, he groomed her and when I finally found out I made sure to let  her boss know and things got handled and he moved away afterwards, scared because he knew he was in trouble. There was a two week time span when she wisened upped and quit talking to him before I found out. Oddly enough since she was 16 it was considered “legal”. The most we could do was get a restraining order. We moved and she had to switch stores. Things have been a little rough for her. As it should that’s a lot to unwind even in therapy but she was finally getting to herself again. Out of the blue three weeks ago this asshat shows up again . He has messaged her from different numbers and everything else . Begging for her to talk to him. Her new boss knows him and when he asked for a job, she said she would give it to him. My daughter and I again went to the cops and AGAIN nothing happened . When we told her new  boss, she blamed her , and made her feel awful, even with the proof. I went to upper management and he was not brought back and things went back to normal, until today. My daughter got fired. This grown ass woman cornered her in her office and refused to let her leave until she signed the papers. She got fired for being late once from when she was in the hospital. Once for being at work but forgetting to clock in. She was there , just not on the clock. The other one was when my mom was running behind and was late picking  her up(they work for the same company) When I go to pick her up her boss is hiding from me( I until recently was a general manager) she knew she was in the wrong. Well, she brought the man who did this to my daughter back to the store. My daughter got fired so a 40 year old man, who likes children, could have a job. My mom is getting screwed to. They hid the schedule from her and then told her they didn’t have hours for her(she’s the assistant). Anyways, he’s on the schedule.  We have done every right thing in this situation. No one has protected my daughter, but me and my mom we believed a company would have her back. As any company should when it comes to minors . There was proof it was all there. That should have been enough but it wasn’t. My daughter will never trust anyone again. She deserves to know that speaking up was worth it. She was made out to be the bad person her and I’m angry. This man now works 4 mins from our house. That was his goal and this woman fell for it. Do I have case?  Can I take this to someone. I feel my daughter deserves Justice here. Every ADULT failed her.",

      "text": "Last week, I got a speeding ticket in Virginia for doing 70 in a 55, which turns out to be a 4-point violation. I’ve only been pulled over once before, in Maryland, a little over a year ago. The cop gave me a ticket for “Driving in excess of reasonable and prudent speed on the highway.” I took it to court, got probation before judgment (PBJ), and just had to pay a fine—no points on my license.\n\nNow, I’m wondering how the Virginia court might handle this. Apparently, PBJ isn’t a thing in Virginia, so I’m not sure how they’ll view it. It still shows up on my record even though I have 0 points. Any advice on how I should approach this?",

They wouldn't let us see the body and as of recently the death has been ruled criminal by the state police and an investigation is taking place.

This is not to say all prison guards are bad but just like with every profession there are always bad apples. We want justice my brother was a loudmouth but not a physical person. I get that someone running their mouth at another can make others mad but to the point of ending isn't a behavior that should ever take place in this kind of establishment or any other. We've contacted a lawyer but we're just worried his passing will get swept under the rug and hidden. We want justice!! \n\nUPDATE- my brother has a lot going on they still have yet to release more on the autopsy that was performed by 2 different people. \n\nWhat we know \n1. A shoelace was wrapped so tight around his neck it tore skin.\n\n2. The lawyer's office had a handwritten letter stating that he feared he would be ended on 12/22/24 due to a guard telling his roommate about him requesting Protective Custody. The letter was dated 10/30/24 and it stated that the guard told him he would be telling his roommate 12/22/24. My brother passed on this date. \n\n3. multiple pleas and requests have been publicly recorded where he requested protective Custody or was removed to a different cell.\n\n\nThese pleas weren't heard and no one cared to listen. \n\nUpdate \n\nCheck out this link: www.fltimes.com/tncms/asset/editorial/dd391604-c6d5-11ef-bb02-87f33f817926",

I also don’t really know where else to ask for help. \n\nI’ll try to keep this short and simple. Basically, back in September, about six weeks after my daughter left home and went to college, she called to tell me that she’d just returned home from the hospital, after being treated for assault and completing a rape kit. \n\nShe told me a horrific story of being roofied by her next-door neighbor and a friend of his (another student) in their (technically “off-campus”, although dedicated student housing) apartment near the UC campus in Cincinnati. She doesn’t remember everything, but she remembers quite a bit: she had one drink (the boys did not), felt weird within minutes and went to try to throw up and/or lay down, and lost control of her body, etc. You know where this is going. Long story short, both my daughter and her roommate were held hostage and assaulted in their own dorm room multiple times all night long. \n\nMy daughter went to the hospital, talked to the police, the school, and me right away. I still can’t believe how brave she is. The roommate didn’t tell anyone at first, had a panic attack in the middle of the night, called her family - who immediately came from a neighboring state to pick her up and bring her home. She may or may not return next semester, still being decided, I think. \n\nThe police did interview my daughter (I wasn’t present, but a University-appointed advocate was there). The school did get the Title IX involved”, but we really haven’t seen much happen with that. Everything feels like it’s at a standstill. \n\nMy daughter wants justice. She wants the boys to be punished; she wants the school to be punished; she wants to know they aren’t going to get away with it and that the school will try not to let it happen again. But so far it seems like they are? The boys are literally still in her same hall, hanging out and partying. They harass my daughter and her friends and she’s literally scared to leave her apartment for fear of running into them. The school advocate initially said she was on medical leave, had classes excused, and said she could have an emotional support kitten… Now none of that is happening and housing wants to take her kitten away? I know that’s at least against Fair Housing. I’ve tried reaching out to a few attorneys friends have suggested, but I can’t seem to get a call back. How do we make something -anything!- happen? We need help. Thanks for reading all this, if you did. \n\ntl;dr: My daughter and her roommate were roofied and assaulted. My daughter went to the police and the school, but she’s received no help from either and they’ve received no consequences. What can we do?",

      "title": "Seeking Urgent Advice: My Elderly Father, a Semi-Truck Driver, Was Arrested for a DWI in Texas. He is SOBER",
      "text": "Location: Texas\nHello everyone,\n\nI'm in desperate need of guidance and support. My 68-year-old father, truck driver, was pulled over in Texas and arrested for a DWI This is baffling to me because he doesn't drink or use drugs. He's well past retirement age but continues to work diligently. However, he does have some age-related challenges: his hearing isn't the best, and his balance isn't as steady as it once was. Which is why they think he failed his field sobriety. He told me on his one phone call that he could never even stand in balance on one leg and I already knew that.\n\nFrom what I've gathered, the officers didn't administer a breathalyzer test. Instead, they took him to jail and drew his blood. He's currently awaiting a court appearance scheduled for tomorrow morning. I know the blood test will show that he's sober, but he's also sick—he has a really bad fever. He's extremely distressed, and I'm feeling overwhelmed.\n\nI'm currently driving seven hours through the night to reach him and offer any assistance I can. I know he told me he is hungry, and they did not feed him and he does not feel good. My mother is also struggling with dementia, and im 23 years old, I'm trying to navigate this complex situation on my own. I have approximately $5,000 in savings and am prepared to use it to help my dad.\n\nI have several questions:\n\nLegal Representation: How do I find a reputable DWI attorney in Texas, preferably one experienced with cases involving older individuals or those with medical conditions that might affect balance or hearing?\nCosts: What are the typical costs associated with hiring a DWI attorney in Texas? Are there attorneys who offer payment plans or sliding scale fees?\nImmediate Steps: What should I do upon arriving at the police station? Is there anything specific I should say or avoid saying?\nMedical Documentation: Would it be beneficial to gather medical records related to my dad's hearing and balance issues to present in court?\nDriver's License: What are the implications for his commercial driver's license? How can we prevent its suspension?\nAny advice, resources, or shared experiences would be immensely appreciated. I'm feeling lost and terrified but determined to support my father through this ordeal.\n\nThank you in advance for your help\n\nUPDATE: I’m sorry I won’t be able to get back to every comment but I am in the ER with him now. He had a really bad blood infection in his leg. They denied him his meds, a breathalyzer and water. He came in super dehydrated and has possible kidney damage. He was septic and I could have lost him if he stayed in there another day or lost his knee in a few more hours. I am so mad right now. They tested his blood sugar and temp and they said his temp was over 100 and didn’t even get him help. That was in the field. I had the docs do a panel for alcohol and drugs, of course it came back 0%. If we can get out in the next few days we will do a follicle test. He is very very I’ll and not completely there. He can talk but sometimes says stuff that is off. I have an attorney now, please pray. I don’t know how this is all going to work but they should never treat people like the way they treated him. They offered him lunch after breakfast today he said no but asked for water. The officer said no because he said no to lunch. Thankfully a cook gave him a cup of water. That’s ALL HE HAD IN OVER 15 HRS WITH AN INFECTION! I am so so broke but I don’t care anymore, I want people who treat people like this to suffer! I am emotional, I have only had 2 hrs of sleep in over 28 hrs. The fountains didn’t even work. He is still stressed about his load and I can’t make him calm down.",

      "text": "Location: Georgia, US\n\nLong story but I’ll try to make it brief. We found out 3 years ago my brother had SA our daughter, 3 years old at the time. Obviously this has been a horrifying situation that has completely changed us, our world, and we’ve spent 3 years waiting on a trial. He has 8 charges against him, only 2 of which are child cruelty and wouldn’t land him on the sex offender registry. \n\nUnfortunately, our daughter (now almost 7) would have to testify. She has autism, ADHD, sensory processing disorder, and ODD, so yeah, she hasn’t shown that she’s going to be able to testify like many other kids would at her age. \n\nWe have pushed, and pushed, for alternative testimony but it seems the courts make no exceptions for her age, much less developmental difficulties. \n\nAfter not being able to get her into the mock trial earlier this summer, the DA informed us last week that they will be dropping the case. I feel so conflicted about this, and so does the rest of the family. I’ve not only had to face what has happened to my daughter, but I lost everyone I once called family. Everyone turned their back on me and I won’t even at least get to see an ounce of justice for my daughter. \n\nThe DA has tried to push plea deals but they’ve been resistant. Ultimately however, the judge has actually shot down the plea deals because of how shitty they were. \n\nTomorrow we go in for what I presume will be the last calendar call where we’ll likely watch them take a victory lap. \n\nI understand this is extremely hard for my 6 year old and part of me is ready to just move on. However, I also feel deeply disturbed that someone so horrendous will be free to walk about and won’t have any no contact restrictions with minors and especially us and my daughter. \n\nAre we completely powerless at this point and have to accept that all this waiting was for nothing? Could we get a restraining order against him?",

It’s not the first time either that a vehicle has been stolen at work and the company sucks with security and cameras. He called the police to make the report and he talked with his boss as well which he reached out to his family to keep a lookout if they see it. Our truck is very easy to spot due to a bright color and boss’s family actually told them they had spotted it at a gas station. Well when my husband called the police officer back they told him to wait for them and not touch or open the truck yet. Cops arrived and when they checked inside the thief was literally sleeping in the truck, and here is the issue that we’re having. The cop said that he’ll be getting a felony under a different charge but not for stealing the truck, and because my husband was there and found it before the stolen vehicle report was finalized they said they needed more proof that he did stole it. Like seriously? The truck wasn’t where it was and messed up the ignition and even crashed it when we saw scratches and dents on the front and they said since they can’t prove he stole it he’d not getting a charge for theft. Now we’re wondering on what to do if we can do anything else legally to fight for better justice on a crime that is extremely obvious???",

      "text": "Location: Suffolk County Massachusetts\n\nMy parents returned from a trip to Florida to find a crew in the final stages of a project on their property. They had cut down two trees, one was a huge hardwood at least 100 years old. They also pulled up railroad ties used to terrace a garden full of different shrubs and perennials, and tore up the garden itself. \n\nTheir neighbor, who didn’t discuss any of this with them, was clearing the way for a pool. He was well aware of the property line because his fence was on it. He actually had to take the fence down to clear the way for the heavy equipment required for the job. My parents also had the property line staked by a surveyor a while back as part of the process for an addition to their house and are 100% certain it’s their property. \n\nMy parents are in their late 70s and my primary concern is their well being. They’ve had a couple of brief conversations with the neighbor but my dad is having trouble communicating because he’s beside himself. \n\nMy primary goal is to lower their stress levels. Ideally the neighbor would compensate them for the damages and not engage with them again. I also wonder about the mental stability of a person capable of such a legal and personal violation and want to avoid any further interaction between them. I plan to handle it from here. \n\nI know a law suit, even if it’s handled entirely by me, doesn’t exactly align with my goal, but our whole family, especially my dad, won’t be able to sleep without some justice. Any advice would be greatly appreciated.",

      "text": "Edit: thank you all for the responses and kind words as well. I know a lot of comments are deleted due to not fitting the subs rules, but I truly appreciate them. So if you see this, know that your words are helping us through a really bad day ❤️\n\nAround noon today, our neighbor’s husky got out, got into our dogs’ pen while we had them out to go bathroom, and crunched the neck of our youngest dog (a 3 year old shih tzu mix). This happened within a 3 minute span and we have video of the incident.\n\nThese neighbors have 2 big dogs (the husky and a lab) and they both have gotten into our yard multiple times in the past. Even the neighbors themselves have come into our yard multiple times, like once just sitting out there petting cats for some reason… Anyways, this has been a frequent issue that we’ve talked to them about (I’ve even had to drag the one dog back to their house before since no one there seemed to notice at all) but to this point there wasn’t any serious issues, the worst it got previously was the escaped lab jumping up on my pregnant wife - but it didn’t cause any injuries. We have video/screenshots of them being in our yard too.\n\nThe video of the incident shows the dog circling our dog pen for a minute as you can hear the neighbors yelling at the dog (they don’t come over at all to get the dog), before the dog leaps our fence and almost instantly bites down on our dog’s neck. It then went for our other dog twice, but backed off each time when our dog snapped at it. Eventually you see one of the neighbors come to our yard, grab their dog (and audibly gasp at our dog’s dead body), then return to their house. \n\nNone of them said anything to us. When my wife went out to bring our dogs back in, that’s when she saw our dog lying there dead. She called the cops and an officer eventually arrived and talked to us and then the neighbors. He also called the dog warden over to our house. They told us the neighbors wanted registration and vaccination records for our deceased dog, not sure if anyone can explain why but I’d appreciate any clarification on that because we felt pretty disrespected tbh lol\n\nWe’ve tried to be neighborly to them since they’ve moved in, we’ve been lenient with these issues and the fact they’re cussing and screaming at each other/their dogs at freaking 3am… all for this to happen. We’re incredibly upset and want some justice here but we never have dealt with something like this before and don’t know what to do next. I’m sorry if this is a messy post, I’m of course emotional, but will absolutely answer any questions or add any context that’s needed. I appreciate any help!",

      "text": "I got a phone call from my brother. He told me that our father had passed away. He was contacted by our dads girlfriend. She told him that she came home from work that morning and found him deceased on the bathroom floor. She suspected a drug overdose or a heart attack. \n\nMy brother was the only point of contact. I wasn't contacted by anyone but my brother. He was never asked to come to the funeral home or what we wanted to do with the body. He was told that our fathers brother had claimed himself as \"next of kin\" to the coroner. \n\nA few days later my brother was informed that our father had been cremated and his girlfriend had his remains at her home. \n\nMy brother contacted dads girlfriend to see if he can have our fathers '65 Chevy Pickup truck since that was the only thing he owned in his name. And a project they worked on together. The girlfriend told him she would get back to him when everything settled down. \n\nMy brother was in contact with dad's brother, his wife, and the girlfriend regularly to see when would be a good time to come and get the truck. Both of them kept giving him the run-around and never a straight answer. my brother made another call to the girlfriend and was informed that \"she was tired of looking at it\" so she had our dads brother send his step-son to come and pick it up. So my fathers step-nephew?\n\n\nMy brother contacted the step-nephew and told him that he can come and get the truck from him. step-nephew responded saying that \"your dad told me years ago if anything ever happened to him that I am to keep that truck. I already have it transferred into my name. Your dad told me you are not responsible enough And he would never leave you something Like that\" And some more hurtful and disrespectful words. \n\nI was informed about this situation. I reached out to his girlfriend by phone and told her I would like to retrieve my fathers remains and talk to her about my father. She agreed to meet with me. She ended up not being able to meet that day and we talked on the phone instead. \n\nShe told me that we can meet next weekend and that I can take some of his remains to share with my brother and sister, that my father has a bag of photos of my children and family that she would like me to take and that I can have the blanket that is on his bed. \n\nAfter I got off the phone with the girlfriend I sent a text message to the step-nephew and told him I would like to arrange a time and place to meet and take the truck. He responded by telling me “hey, check this out I don't know what makes you guys think that you're entitled to that truck and I don't know how are you guys got my fucking number but you need to lose it. (He sent my brother a drunk text saying how much he loved him and to reach out if he ever needed anything is how he got the number) That truck is in my name. It was left to me as a gift. Your dad did not want nothing like that to go to your brother. He talked about it to me many times so tell your emo brother to get the fuck out of peoples ears and if he calls my mom again, me and him are gonna have a fucking problem.\nYou guys gave up on your dad because he was an addict and now he fucking overdose and you think you're entitled to shit instead of you being there and helping him through all this bullshit no, my family was there for him”\n\n The step-nephew then sent me a photo of the trucks vehicle registration to prove to me that he had the truck transferred into his name.\n\nI sent a report of fraudulent registration through the DMV website stating that my father passed away and there's no possible way that he could have signed over the pink slip and gave the step-nephew the truck as a gift nearly 5 weeks after his death. \n\nI asked my brother how he would have done any of that without a death certificate or a pink slip. He said that he was told \"the pink slip was left in the glove box\". \n\nMy father has been an auto mechanic for well over 30 years. There is not a scenario on earth where he would have ever left a pink slip in the glove box.\n\nNext day the girlfriend called me to tell me that she did not want to give me the blanket off of my dads bed because her dogs sleep on it every night and it would make them depressed if she took it away from them. She told me that instead I could have the Eagles Jersey in the closet that she previously told me the step-nephew had claimed. \n\nI contacted County Vital Records department to see if my fathers death certificate was available. I was informed that it was available and that nobody has requested a copy of the record. \n\nI contacted the County Sheriff Coroner. I was informed that she handled my fathers case. She said that her report shows that she asked both the girlfriend and dads brother if our dad had children and both of them said \"NO\". She said that her database also does not show any relatives. She told me that there were issues with this case because on our dads only filed legal document, which is his drivers license, that his last name was spelled incorrectly. She told me that I could contact the Civil Courts or make a Report with the City Police Department. \n\nI called the police department. I explained my situation with not being named as next of kin and also that the truck was taken and \"gifted\" to his step-nephew after his death and was informed that I needed to follow up with my DMV report and then the DMV would take legal action if necessary and I should contact Civil Courts as well.\n\nI contacted the DMV Investigations Department. They informed me that they are extremely back logged and it would be well into January before my case was even assigned to anyone. They told me that I need to come up with any and all documentation that I possibly can to prove that the truck should belong to me or my brother and it would be difficult, and nearly impossible without a will. \n\nI have had very little contact with my father in the last 15 years because of his drug addiction. He met my baby son 14 years ago and I told him that whenever he's ready to get clean, let me know and we can move forward, but i could not be an enabler or introduce my child to a relationship that was unstable. \n\nMy brother is 9 years younger than I am and was too little to understand what living with a drug addict was like so he decided to restore and keep a relationship with him since he was about 10 years old. \n\nI do not know if there is anything I can do legally. The local attorney wants $800 for just a consult. Other than my bother wanting something meaningful that came from my dad, I don't even know what kind of justice I am looking for. I just don't think they should get away with pretending we didn't exist.\n\nWhen my dad was sober, he was a wonderful father. The first 14 years of my life he was my best friend. I am angry at him for dying without trying to get better first. But I do not believe I was raised to be okay with being lied to, stolen from and completely forgotten. \n\nDo I have a case here? Or are my feelings just hurt?",

This person has recently become incarcerated long term.\n\nClearly there is no income to garnish unless they receive social security. I’m not sure about that. They do own a (mortgaged) home that likely would be in the $300k area current market value. I’m assuming the first step is to file a lien, which we’ve asked our attorney to do, but I’m not sure our attorney would know how best to proceed in actually collecting. She’s a great attorney, and is with a firm I’ve used multiple times for various reasons, but I do know this was her first time in this particular type of suit.\n\nWhat can we do? Should we hire a PI to ensure we can discover all of the defendant’s assets? Can we petition to force the sale of the assets to collect the judgment? We believe they have been secretly liquidating assets in preparation for their inevitable loss. Can we petition to assume ownership of their assets and have them removed? All advice is appreciated!\n\nRelevant information:\nJudgment awarded in Arkansas\nRespondent incarcerated in Texas with pending charges in Arkansas.\nCurrent sentence is ten years with approximate one year time served.\nProperties include one residence in Arkansas, potentially one vacant lot in Arkansas and another in Missouri.\nOther respondent is the spouse of the incarcerated party but has no criminal charges.\n\n\nEdited to add:\n\nI’m not sure why I’m getting downvoted on all of my replies. My wife was horrifically wronged by people and this is some semblance of justice where criminal courts have failed due to technicalities that amount to their own negligence. I think she is entirely justified and I support her 100%. I’m here seeking advice on behalf of a victim.",

My 11 year old frequently walks the dog by leaving through the back slider, walking behind the houses, up and around to the parking lot, and then back in either through the front door or back down through the slider. I’ve had problems with a neighbor before who seems to think that the area behind his unit is his own private property, and today he approached my 11 year old who was by himself and told him not to walk the dog past his unit anymore.\n\nI spoke to him to remind him that this is common property and he’s not allowed to do that, and he insisted that this is an inconvenience and he will continue to tell him to stop. I told him to not speak to my child and he said he will continue to do so, every time, which makes me extremely uneasy. If he continues to bother my child and tell him that he can’t walk the dog on common property, is that grounds to get a no harassment order? For reference the dog never relieves himself anywhere near this guy’s unit, makes any noise, or does any kind of damage. It’s literally just walking past his doors.",

      "text": "When my son was killed in an auto/ pedestrian accident, litigation was not even on my radar. Some months later after the DA \"declined to prosecute\" the driver, I felt the need to reach out and see what other legal recourse we could pursue. I reached out to my neighbors, one of who happened to be a personal injury attorney. This woman was well known in the neighborhood for being an advocate for public schools and seemed to have a good reputation. Not wanting to \"shop around\", we hired her to represent us. \n\nA year later, we settled for 52k and the money was to be split three ways, as is customary in these cases: 1/3 to myself, 1/3 to my son's father and 1/3 to the attorney. Except when it came time to pay, she offered us a partial payment until we could be sure there were no claims on the funds. I was told the funds would be held in an IOLTA account (We recently found out they weren't). I was told that there was a probate case filed (We recently found out there wasn't). After some months of back and forth, she sent me 1K via Venmo told us that probate would take 120 days, then ghosted us. Our last contact was in January, when she said \"Their was a claimant, the funds are gone\" and that we \"Should be happy with what we got.\" \n\nWe immediately started seeking recourse to get our funds back and no one wants to help us. We contacted the police department who said they'd love to help, but because she sent us a partial payment, the DA won't look at it. We contacted several malpractice attorneys, none of whom will help us because our damages are too menial ($15k)even though we are happy to pay their hourly rate just to get this done. We filed with the bar and they are taking forever. In the meantime, I found another victim in the neighborhood who was in a vulnerable position who hired this attorney and also got screwed over/ ghosted. She is going to file a bar complaint as well. \n\nAt this point, getting any money back is secondary to holding this woman accountable, but not sure what else we can do. Putting out bad reviews, even if they are the gospel, would potentially open us up to libel, right? Small claims court has come up, but since we are going up against an attorney (even if she is an awful one) means we would likely need to be represented-would anyone even take our case? \n\nIt's so incredibly frustrating to get taken advantage of, to find someone else who has been taken advantage of and for literally no one to take an interest in our case (or in seeking justice). \n\nI live in Austin, TX, which is a small/ big town. the attorney is now out of private practice and works for a local government entity in a legal capacity. Is it wrong to warn her employer about her past pattern of behavior-fraud, theft, etc? Not even sure where else to turn at this point.",

      "title": "I hired an immigration lawyer, paid $5,000, and after 6 months USCIS has no record of my case. What legal actions can I take?",
      "text": "Location: California\n\nHi everyone, I really need legal advice because I’m beyond frustrated and angry right now.\n\nI’m a U.S. citizen and my fiancée is from another country. We decided to apply for a K-1 visa and I hired an immigration attorney because I wanted the process done right — yeah, big mistake in hindsight.\n\nThe lawyer had decent reviews and seemed legit. I spoke with him, sent all the evidence and documents he requested to complete the I-129F. After that, He forwarded me to someone named Scott, who he claimed was an immigration specialist handling my case. It was clear Scott worked with him at the same law firm. I went along with it and sent Scott everything again — documents, photos, info — the whole package.\n\nI paid nearly $5,000 total. On January 31, they told me the file was submitted to USCIS.\n\nSince then, I’ve been constantly checking in. I kept asking if anything came back — NOA1, receipt number, tracking — anything. All I got was “nothing has arrived yet,” over and over. But everyone who’s gone through this knows: within 2–4 weeks MAX, you’re supposed to get NOA1 with a receipt number and proof that USCIS received your file.\n\nNow it’s almost six months. I couldn’t take it anymore, so two days ago I met with scott in person and demanded a tracking number or any proof that my petition was even submitted. He kept dodging and saying “nothing has come back yet,” then started getting defensive and aggressive. He threatened to withdraw from my case if I kept “accusing” him, and repeated:\n“This is how we process things.”\n\nHe said the only thing he can send me is a few emails he sent to USCIS. But that means nothing — USCIS doesn’t accept I-129F filings by email. It has to be mailed with a check or payment form. So that just raised more red flags.\n\nYesterday I called USCIS directly and gave them both mine and my fiancée’s info — full names, SSN, address, phone number.\nThey told me We have no record of any case under those names or details.\nNothing. Zero.\nSix months gone waiting for an approval that was never coming — because our petition was never even submitted.\n\nI’m furious, and I feel scammed. I want to take legal action and get my money back — maybe even compensation for lost time. But I’m also confused who’s legally responsible.\nWas it the lawyer I hired, or this “immigration specialist” he passed me off to?\n\nIf anyone has legal experience, has gone through something similar, or knows how to report this properly, please help me out.\nI’m seriously lost right now and just want justice.\n\nThanks in advance.",

      "title": "My landlord committed sexual battery against me and no one is willing to help me.",
      "text": "I live in Seminole, FL in an unlicensed illegal group home that my mother who is my guardian forced me to live in.\n\nLast year over the course of several months my landlord would brush his fingers up my arm and make these disgusting kissy faces at me while saying sexually suggestive things. I told him not to do it every single time and he didn't stop until I absolutely blew upat him.\n\nI filed a police report last year because he runs a second group home thst is licensed and insured for autistic people and he brought a young female client to our housr and took her into his bedroom alone with him. The sheriff who came said that no law was brokdn, but at the time I mentioned his sexual battery and said I did not want to press charges at the time because i figured i could protect myself whereas the autistic girl could not.\n\nI changed my mind recently because he has been feeding us low quality food, using our foodstamps to buy food for his other business and even defrauding a food bank by using our id's to get free food which he uses at his other business. He also illegally evicted my bedt friend. I think he is a scum bag who needs to be brought to justice for everything.\n\nI spoke to the sheriff dept about pressing charges and the deputy whose name and badge numbers i  took down argued with me about the definition of battery, but when i threatened to do the exact same thing my landlord did to me to the deputy he said he would arrest me for battery. Because of this bullshit I reported them to internal affairs and even the fbi. No one has reached out to me about this snd the corporal who showed up when I asked for the deputies' supervisor told me I was \"deputy hopping\" because I tried to speak to different deputies about this. He told me I could only go through the original deputy who responded to my complaint last year even though he had the police report and I have made multiple attempts to get ahold of her but she has not called me back.\n\nEven my \"mother\" (although i wil never consider her to be that dver again) who has this guardianship over me is taking my landlords side and telling me i have no choice but to live in the same home as the man who committed sexual battery against me, which is against the law because his rental agency found out he was running a business out of his home and gave him 7 days to remedy the situation, but the only \"remedy\" he put in place was instructing one of my roommates to lie and say we were just his roommates, not his clients, we never signed on to the lease however so i dont think that's going to go well for him.\n\nBecause this group home is unlicensed he does not have the regulated minimum fire suppression system and ive never even seen a fire extinguisher. There was a fire in the air conditioning system recently and 4 fire trucks came out. I also have pictures of candles that he leaves burning throughout the house unattended and some were in sn enclosed cabinet.\n\nI know I need a lawyer snd I have tried so hard to find one. I tried the largest pro bono attny in florida and they said they dont take cases like this slyhough i suspect it's because i didnt mdntion that his other home is insured so they didnt think they could make money off the case.\n\nI tried a lawyer I used to rent an apartment from but he hasnt called me back yet and i dont think he practices this kind of law\n\nI tried free legal aid services in florida, but they said i make too much money. I can't afford the people they recommend because I've been out of work for weeks due to the rnental illness i have to deal with, ehich brings me to my final point. I think my mother who is my supervisor is going to try to get me fired because of this, but i know that would be illegal to fire me over since they hired me knowing i was disabled. I did try to quit my job a couple weeks ago, but my boss (my mom's boss) messaged me and I told her I wanted to return and i was sorry for trying to quit and I have a screenshot of her saying she was happy to have me back, but then my brother who works there was refusing to cooperate with me because my \"mother\" defamed me and accused me and my roommste of using drugs to my siblings. So they put me on a leave of absence until june 2nd when I will have a meeting with the boss to see how we can proceed.\n\nI think that about covers it\n\nI have screenshots of conversations, pictures of the candles, and all the deputies' names and badge numbers, it should be the easiest case in the world to win, but no one is willing to help\n\nLocation: Seminole, FL",

I was thinking nothing about it but the recently I came across a news report where the victims mother was crying and asking Justice for her son and this defendant has no value for human life and I am pretty sure if he gets away with this he will definitely do something similar soon and I am afraid that will be on me if I didn't do what is necessary. But he is a gang member with the very strong connections so I am afraid of retaliation so I would like to know how anonymous can I be while being a witness and even if my name and everything comes can I stop the media from circulating the witness testimony if it goes as far as that\n\nThe thing is that I had a self-defense case and the attacker in my case behaved or acted exactly like this person whom I am talking about. And I feel like I have I got a chance but this victim never got. When this person was telling about his case and what victim did to protect himself, I really felt in his place .

      "text": "The seizure occurred in Florida.\n\nI was pulled over for \"following too closely\" and upon discovering that I hadn't transferred the title into my name yet, the officer decided to check to make sure the VIN on the title matched the vehicle VIN. I opened up my door and low and behold, the manufacturer sticker with the VIN was completely scratched off. Long story short, we plugged an OBD code reader in and the VIN came up as a different number than on the title. The dash VIN did match the title. I was told the sheriff's office would be towing my vehicle until they could determine if it was ever reported stolen and i would need to get my things. My sister had to come pick me up, after the cop handed me a tow receipt and dipped out, leaving me on the side of the road. Now the detective is calling it contraband under statute 319.33.\n\nRegarding 319.33, my research leads me to 932.701-932.706 which they call the FL Contraband Forfeiture Act. Anyone familiar with how this usually plays out? I was advised to file a police report with the police department that has jurisdiction over where I exchanged the vehicle as well. I have done that.\n\nAm I going to get my truck or original vehicle back? Are they preparing to charge me with some kind of criminal charges? They said they knew I hadn't known about the mismatched VINs, but the contraband forfeiture act says they are only able to seize things if the owner of the property has been arrested. Do I need to file a petition for the adversarial preliminary hearing?\n\nI work 45 min from my home and have only been able to make it to work once in the past 7 days. The cheapest uber or lyft is $120 for a ride to work, so I really need to sort this out.",

      "title": "Dad died from hospice care mistake",
      "text": "My dad was diagnosed with Parkinsons, MS and Lewy body dementia about 5 years ago. It has been a struggle and very hard to watch him go down hill. When it got real bad, to the point that he could not stand enough for my mother and I to move him, we made a hard decision. We all decided in-home end of life care was needed. \n\nMy mom hired a hospice company. The first two weeks went fine, besides them refusing to wash his hair. The beginning of the third week, he ended up needing a catheter. So the nurse tried and couldn't get it in, so she called another nurse. When this new nurse showed she unfortunately ended up forcing the catheter and he wouldn't stop bleeding. So my mom called for an ambulance. The hospice nurses didn't want him to go, saying it wouldn't be covered. But my mom went over their heads and had him taken in. It was so bad the ER wouldn't touch him, just slowed the bleeding down. They recommended a specialist, a Urologist to be specific. When we finally got him in, the Doctor said that the hospice nurse had essentially created a new path to his bladder. And only he would be able to replace it from then on. There was severe trauma and my dad suffered needlessly. We also had to deal with him bleeding every time he peed and him getting an infection. My mom made the right call and told the nurse's supervisors and got a new hospice company to help take care of dad. It was like night and day. We honestly can't thank those ladies enough for how they helped my mom and dad through it all. In the end he died from sepsis from the initial trauma to his urethra and bladder.  He suffered worse than he needed to and was always asking us to pull out his catheter. Every antibiotic he tried didn't work and he just went down hill fast. It also worsened his Lewy body dementia in the end, and his body whithered away. \n\nAfter  his funeral, we collected as much information as we could. Got statements from the nurses, the ER, the Urologist, the nurse who pulled his catheter out when he died and from the coroner. It took us a month longer than all of the others, to get the documents from the first hospice company. And it was sent by their administrator. When we got the papers yesterday, they didn't mention the trauma, the nurse or the visit in general. The said it happened at the ER. Completely leaving out the entire day of them needing two different nurses to try to get the catheter in. My mom even has voicemails from the nurse who injured him asking if he was ok and that she was sorry. Many messages and calls on her phone that she saved. We have at least a dozen of eye witness accounts, photos of the injury and all the blood as well as the infection. We really don't want this happening to anyone else and we want justice for my dad.  My mom is going to sue them, but how would we go about it? Is there more evidence we would need? And do we even have a chance?",

We have lived in my grandmothers house for 11 years(2013), and 4 years ago (2020)my grandmother was placed in a nursing home for her safety. Me and my father continued living here. I turned 18 in late 2021 and after beginning to work I took on the utilities and the wifi and the household essentials like cleaning products, hygiene products, and groceries. For the year of 2023 I claimed him on my taxes as a dependent because based on what i was providing our situation fit the guidelines. the garbage is insanely behind i recently found out and other than that the mortgage comes out of my grandmothers retirement fund, and those are the only bills. I have receipts for everything. \nWe have been living pretty peacefully until his girlfriend came around more often and would get angry at me and accuse me of stealing. she would enter my room to confront me about things i allegedly said to my father or ways i disrespected him, and we had a falling out about it. We made up, and i thought all was well. \nMy birthday recently passed and we celebrated and had fun, and then later i found out he went and filed for my eviction the very next morning. Complete shock. I want to reiterate this isn't his house ultimately, I have receipts for my contributions, and he's a dependent on my taxes. The police officer came to serve me today and my father beat me to the door and told the officer i wasn't here. i overheard once the officer was already leaving. I pressed my dad and asked what it was about and he was evasive and said it had something to do with power of attorney of my grandma (which he does not have).\n I felt uneasy about the situation, so i called the general sessions court and asked if there were any legal document in my name that hadn't been delivered yet. They told me it had been filed on the 15th and when court was. I asked what it was for and they said \"Reclaiming property\" so i asked \"so like an eviction?\" and she said yes. how is this looking ultimately? does he have grounds to evict me? isn't it obstruction of justice to lie to the officer about me being on the premises while he tried to serve papers? what should i do? i feel bombarded by this situation am not sure where to start or what rights i have.",

He blocked me as well but ended up unblocking me to try to settle after he received a phone call from the Sergeant and realized I wasn't bluffing. He still tried to hustle us to the bitter end, saying he would \"do us a favor\" with $200 but that was \"all he had.\" KBB showed us a $1000-$1300 difference in value between a standard 2006 and 2011 impala, so we let him know we could not go that low and would stick with our initial ask of $400 or a full return, or that we'd pursue a value closer to $1k in small claims. At this point he acquiesced, and we got our $400. I'm sure I got lucky by getting an officer who immediately saw the injustice and encouraged him to do the right thing, but I just want to put this here since basically all of you told me to give up. If someone in the future is in my situation, I would want them to know that they can try to stand up for themselves, and justice may yet prevail.!<\n\n---\n\nORIGINAL POST:\n\nLocation: North Dakota\n\nI was at work, so I don't know the exact details of the exchange, and the only evidence we have is a screenshot of the listing title (including one pic of car) and a text from the seller admitting it was a \"miss type\" (sic) and that he was selling the car for his brother and he didn't even look at the title. He basically asserted it's our fault for taking the listing at face value and blocked her and deleted the listing. I only got this info after calling & texting him from my phone, and I only have that screenshot because my wife shared the listing with me before it was removed.\n\nCar is in our possession and we need to register and insure it ASAP but we are assuming this makes our case much weaker, as though we are accepting the outcome even though we now know the truth, which we aren't. We told the seller we would accept the car if he refunded $400 (she paid $3500) to get it closer to its true value, or we would happily return it. He sent me a phone number, presumably his brother's, and told me to deal with him... but we bought it from him, so I don't really want to muddy the waters with other parties.\n\n**Anyway, is this fraud? If it is, is it worth our time to go to small claims or file a police report or anything along those lines, or is this just a hard lesson learned?**\n\nSide note, we actually have a mutual friend with the seller, and called him to ask about this guy, and our mutual friend said he knows him from the \"car community\" and that he'd hang out with him but never do business with him, so it sounds like he has a bit of a reputation for swindling people.",

      "text": "Hello, I'm writing this on behalf of my father in law, in California.\nIn 2018 my ex cheated on me. She moved out and got together with her affair partner. We have 3 children, oldest 28m and 23f and are no contact, the youngest is 12m, who we share 50/50 custody. \nIn 2020 she got pregnant with her now 4 year old by her affair partner. She also has an active restraining order on me. \n3 weeks ago she called stating that our youngest forgot his soccer uniform and she was going to stop by to pick it it up. A few minutes later he started messaging his older sister, (who still lives with me) to let her know that their mom was on their way and she was lying, he has his uniform with him. \nA few minutes later, I get a knock on my door. Instead of my son, I see my ex and she's asking to see our daughter. (For context we have 2 doors, the main door and a metal mesh door that we always keep locked).\nMy daughter was around the corner, out of site, but could hear everything. I tell her that our daughter doesn't wanna see her and to give her time. She was arguing and was so addiment that my daughter came out to confront her. \nThen my ex pulled out her 4 year old that she had with her affair partner. My ex started stating that her 4 year old wants to meet her sister and to let her in. She let her 4 year old try to open up our metal door. My daughter was flustered and told her mom to back off and not to push her any further. \nEx then turned to me and said that she will be sending divorce papers. \nAbout 2 weeks after that, I get a knock on the door and I see my ex's worker. She gave me papers saying it was for the divorce, but as I read through them, they were for child support for both our 12 year old and her 4 year old affair partners child. \nI did not sign anything, but there's a new court date in November. \nOn the forms it states that I did not help her at all or contributed anything for the children,(we share 50/50 of our son) and that she's single and is jobless. I don't know if her affair partner left her, but she owns her own cleaning business and I don't fully believe that she is completely out of work. \nI'm going to talk to a lawyer in the next few days, but any advice on what I should say or bring up? Can I be legally heald accountable for child support even though I had 50/50 custody? Can she ask for child support from me for her affair partners child?",

      "text": "Location: Southern Utah \nOn June 8th my cat with kidney disease was taken from in front of my family’s house by a neighbor, was driven an hour away to a “retired vets” office and put down. He was microchipped and they failed to check and was cremated with other animals and disposed of. After searching for him for a week and giving pictures to our neighbors, our neighbor sent this to my mother; “Bonnie, I’d swear this was the Tabby that I got over at Candace’s house last week that was in such bad shape. I thought it must have been from Lonnie’s since I hadn’t ever seen a tabby around. Well now you be at peace that he’s over the rainbow and wasn’t alone while passing”. I talked to the women and she works in a group that spays and released strays in the area. They drove him an hour away to a retired vet (she refused to tell me who) and because he had kidney disease they put him down. My cat has had KD for a year and with medicine and special diet he has been living comfortably and it just wasn’t simply his time or their choice. That cat meant a lot to me, I’ve had him for 15 years; I had his mother as a child. I’ve been very emotionally distraught and to add they put him down on my late father’s birthday, it’s been two months and I haven’t done anything because I’ve felt so emotionally clouded. In Utah pets are considered property, also failure to check the microchip and confirming ownership is negligence from the vet but if he’s actually retired I don’t know if that matters but it’s sketchy he’s still operating.  I should have made a police report when it happened but was planning on perusing that tomorrow. Have I waited too long and will I get any justice out of this? I don’t really have money to sue, I’m a college student, what are my options?",

      "text": "Hi everyone this is my first time posting on this subreddit but I’m seeking legal advice on my auntie’s behalf. She  (66 Black F) was trying to take her granddaughter out for her graduation dinner ( it was her choice) when she got there she asked for a table and said she was waiting on three people. \n\nHostess was about to give them a table but then the manager stopped her. My aunt then asked if we could have a table because she’s handicapped and needed to sit. The manager told her that they could sit when their party gets there. (they were waiting on the graduation girl to get there).\n\nThey then asked if they could wait at the bar and get a drink while they waited and the manager then told them “if you sit at the bar you have to stay at the bar” and being overall rude. Mind you the place was not at all packed and there were several seat available. \n\nShe then proceeded to ask for the manager to where the woman said “I am the manager.” She then said to her that she was going to write a review and the manager said if she wrote a review then they would ask her to leave. They then proceeded to call the cops and three police officers came and escorted her out.\n\nThey eventually went to another location and even we’re allowed to go to the bar and grab a drink. To where the waiter at that chill’s said they treated her her the exact same way at that same location. I just want justice for my aunt and how she was treated. I’m more thank happy to answer any questions and take any advice.\n\nLocation: Michigan \n\nEdit: I wanna make it clear my aunt did say that they’re was a table of five people but they we’re waiting on three people other people. And that they had been their a day before and was told they can only sit a party of six and kindly left and came back with five. Also they turned away another black woman was on her way out telling her it would be an hour wait but then proceeded to let another couple that was white right in. I also wanna say the manager was a woman and that the only other person with her was my uncle as a witness and they were as nice as they could be to them. Also I meant to say they told her if you go to the bar you have to stay at the bar.",

      "text": "Hello,\n\nI never thought I’d be in this situation, but here I am — feeling taken advantage of, disrespected, and honestly heartbroken over how Airbnb has handled my case. \n\nI booked what looked like a peaceful, cozy stay. The photos were beautiful, but the reality was the opposite. From the moment I arrived, I noticed how how filthy the outside looked, my driver even commented that this place is one of the unsafest areas. But I already payed and I tried to be patient. I told myself maybe it’ll be okay.\n\nBut things only got worse:\n\t•\tThe power went out for an entire day, and I was left without proper communication or support.\n\t•\tA fan broke during my stay — which almost hit my mom and I reported it right away\n\t•\tHer assistant gave me STAINED comforters which I reported \n\t•\tHer assistant was supposed to come and clean the apartment or aid to me for any needs but he never showed up \n\nAnyways we left and then I got the message from Airbnb saying that the host is requesting money for the broken fan which I NEVER BROKE. And then she blamed ME for the stained comforter. I said I didn’t break the fan but Airbnb still ruled against me saying it broke during my stay. They sided with me with the comforter and said I didn’t stain them. So they admit that she lied but still continued to blame me for the fan?? I appealed and they didn’t care. What’s worse is that they took off my negative review I gave her saying that it goes against policy but when she gave me a bad review they said they won’t take this out because it doesn’t go against policy. She literally put that I stained her comforter on her negative review which even Airbnb admits that didn’t happen. What’s worse is that she is a SUPERHOST - I can’t believe this. I do not trust superhost at Airbnb at all anymore. \n\nI’ve escalated to Airbnb’s executive team and asked for all communication to come through me. I live in Texas, and I’m seriously considering small claims court or arbitration — not just to get justice for myself, but because no guest should be treated this way.\n\nI don’t care about revenge. I care about fairness. I don’t want anyone else to go through this. If you’ve been in a similar situation, or have any advice — whether it’s legal, emotional, or practical — please share. I’m open to filing with the BBB, state agencies, or whatever it takes to be heard.\n\nLocation: Texas\nBut airbnb was out of country",

      "title": "(IL) Boss Owes Me $30,000 in Unpaid Wages",
      "text": "Location: Illinois. Boss's location: ??? \n\nA close family member hired me about a year ago to work for them remotely. Flash forward to now, I haven’t been paid since February, and I’m currently behind on my pay by about $30,000 (and climbing!). This is a regular occurrence in my workplace. Other employees sometimes miss work because they haven’t paid their electricity bill because they haven’t been paid. My family member/boss responds to these situations by asking them how much money they “really need” and then sending them just that much. I have no idea how my boss has gotten away with this for so long. If there have been previous lawsuits, I haven’t heard about them.\n\nHere are the things I know y’all will recommend that I’ve already considered:\n\n* “Just quit!” I’m actively looking for other jobs. In the meantime, I think it’s better to have what basically amounts to an unpaid internship on my resume than (another) gap. I’ve been really lucky in that I have a partner with an income that we can both live off of.\n* “Make sure you document everything.” I download my timesheet every week or so. I also have records of conversations with other employees who haven’t been paid, and at least one record of my boss apologizing for being so behind on my pay. The only truly unfortunate thing is that I never signed a formal contract. I just have an email from my boss with the hourly rate we agreed on, and my timesheets, which also have my hourly rate and amount earned. I hope that’s enough.\n\nHere’s my current plan: I’ll compile and organize every bit of evidence I can and bring it to a free consultation with an employment lawyer. When I get a new job (or quit because I can’t stand it anymore), I’ll give my boss a deadline (2 weeks - a month) to pay me. If they don’t, I’ll start the lawsuit for real. I have a bunch of questions: \n\n* What are the flaws in my current plan?\n\n* Should I sue them sooner? One of the reasons I was holding off was that I wanted an amicable relationship with the person who I would most likely use as a reference, so that I wouldn’t be impeded in my job search. However, another high ranking employee recently offered to recommend me to potential future employers, so that’s not an obstacle anymore.\n*  How can I find a good lawyer? I’ve never done anything like this before. I’ve seen some firms that say they won’t charge you unless you win something. Are those offers legit?\n* Should I give my boss a warning? I haven’t threatened to sue yet. I’m not sure if I should give them a heads up (they are family, after all) or if it’s better (tactically? legally?) to just spring it on them. There’s a chance that threatening a lawsuit would be enough to scare them into paying me. However, part of me wants to sue my boss to get justice for the other employees who aren’t in a position to sue.\n* I’m not sure if my boss has an LLC. Right now, I’m 80% that they do not. It looks like they’ve previously filed as an LLC in Wyoming, but their current status (as of the end of last year) is Inactive - Administratively Dissolved (Tax). If there is an active LLC out there, how can I find it without my boss getting suspicious? I’ve searched the databases in three different states (Wyoming, the state where they currently reside, and the last state they lived in), and the information above is all I could find. Sorry to be vague–I don’t want to accidentally dox myself. I should add, however, that my family member/boss does not and has never lived in Illinois. I labeled the post IL because I live in Illinois. Anyway, how will the existence or lack of an LLC impact the case?\n* Can I/Should I try to get my coworkers involved? Most of them live overseas. I don’t think any of them live in the same state as I do. I’m assuming that complicates things. I would also assume that most of them don’t feel comfortable suing their current employer, but there are a few former employees I could reach out to.\n\nThank you in advance for all your (informal and not legally binding) legal counsel!\n\nTLDR: I want to sue a family member for unpaid wages, but I’m not sure what steps to take.",

      "text": "Location: Virginia, USA  \nSorry if this isn't the right forum for this. My county recently enacted a full cell phone ban in its schools, which I am not personally that upset by but others (obviously) are. My concern lies with the fact that the **official school board Instagram account** of the county created a social media post describing it, but **disabled comments only on that post**, while all other posts allow public interaction (this was also by far the most shared and liked post on the account, with 200 likes and 200+ shares). Would it be unconstitutional? My reasoning for this is as follows:\n\n* The account is an **explicitly government-run platform used for official communications**, thus functioning as a **designated public forum** under 1A\n* **Selective disabling of comments** on a single post is literally **viewpoint discrimination**, which is unconstitutional.\n* Although the county may have a **significant interest** in preventing harmful speech (which I assume there would be in a wholly open comment section), a **blanket comment ban** is **not narrowly tailored**\n* **Less restrictive alternatives** exist, such as **comment moderation, filtering, or selective removal** \n* Instagram serves as a **primary communication channel for students**, especially since the post released mere hours after the school board meeting, with the next meeting being a month away",

      "title": "My family is harassing me from abroad. What are my options?",
      "text": "**Location:** Alberta, Canada\n\nHello,\n\nSo around 2 months ago, I successfully 'ran away' from home/my family (I am a 22 year old woman), and I have returned to Canada. I am in Alberta specifically. I've been able to slowly restart my life from scratch here. I've made a few friends, found work, and found a good place to live. \n\nFor starters, I am a Canadian citizen from birth, but have not lived in the country for around 16 years. My family and I moved to the Middle East when I was just 6 years old for my dad’s work. We'd all been living there since. Everyone else in my family are also Canadian citizens.\n\nI'll try to keep this short but the main reason I ran away is because my family is abusive and had plans to marry me off once I graduated university/turned 22. I of course never wanted that, and my family is the type who would without a doubt forcibly marry me off if it came to that. On top of that, they are essentially religious extremists, and I do not agree with the religion and ideology they follow at all. I'd given up years ago on trying to reason with them, which is why I just quietly packed up my things and got the hell out of there the second I could. I had planned this escape from my family since I was 16, and they had no idea. \n\nWhen I did run away, I emailed everyone (from an old Gmail account w/ a VPN on) in my family a long goodbye letter essentially telling them what I did. I kept it pretty vague for the most part, I just told them I wasn't going to live according to their rules and standards and that no matter what, I was never coming home.\n\nOnce I landed in Canada, I made a new email account and opened up a new Canadian phone number. However, around just a week of me being here, I started getting calls and texts from my sister. I have zero clue on how she found me. She was just begging me to talk to her and let her know if I was alive. I didn't respond and I blocked her. But seeing her messages, and knowing that she knew my number made me so stressed out. I actually went to my SIM provider and changed my phone number again a few days later. But AGAIN, she found it. I was still so confused, I thought maybe she was getting it through my Apple ID, but my phone number was never even linked to it. Then, one of the friends I made here texted me and said \"hey, do you know this person?\" and sent me a screenshot of my sister texting THEM. I have no idea how she's finding all these phone numbers, but all I know is that it's making me stressed out and that she's bothering others in my life here too who have nothing to do with this. \n\nTo be honest, I eventually caved and replied to her email. I was feeling a bit lonely and I missed her a bit. Looking back I shouldn't have done that. Surprisingly when I did reply she was very nice and even apologised for causing me stress. Something very strange though is that she said this to me: that she and my family KNOW exactly where I am, but they have no intention of coming after me in Canada. Truth be told, I don’t fully believe her. The fact that they know where I am freaks me the hell out. I don’t care if she says “they won’t do anything”. I just don’t fully believe her.\n\nAgain, I don't know HOW they’re going about doing this. I even asked her upfront “how did you guys find my information and how do you know where I am” and she said she won’t tell me unless I tell her “how I pulled off my escape plan” What?? Why the hell does she need to know that? I kept asking persistently and she wouldn’t tell me how they got the information. This set me off and now I'm very angry with her. My guess is that they used some shady tactics and she doesn’t want to admit to it. Truth be told even if I just blocked her right now she’d just make a new number or email to reach out again. It’s exhausting. \n\nI would personally consider all of this to be a form of stalking and harassment. For around 2 weeks now we were kinda chatting on and off, just about life, but randomly she sort of turned back into emotionally manipulating and guilting me again a few days ago. And she’s been doing it like crazy. I have nothing but resentment towards my family so her emotional manipulation never even works on me. I think I'm done with her for good now. I honestly regret ever responding to her. Although me and her had a good relationship growing up, I just don’t know if I can trust her anymore. Most likely my parents are just using her as a pawn to try and guilt me into coming back or something. \n\nI have made it extremely clear I want nothing to do with my family anymore. I'm so sick and tired of them. I had even written in my letter to them that if they tried to come after me I'd call the police on them. I'm just getting worried since I recently got a new job, and I wonder if somehow they're going to find out and start contacting my new coworkers and manager. Since the first time this has happened, I have documented and screenshotted everything. So far they haven't sent me anything too threatening, but it's just a bunch of manipulation and guilt tripping. I have a strong feeling that the threats from them are gonna come pretty soon though. \n\nI am so tired of them. Even though I'm making great progress out here by myself, the mere reminder of their existence sets me back every time. It's so hard to pretend like they don't exist anymore when you keep getting texts and missed calls from unknown numbers trying to guilt trip you into coming back or telling you are the most selfish person to exist. I honestly don’t even care about them anymore so for the most part their manipulation never even works on me lol, it’s just so tiring dealing with this. \n\nSo my question is, is there ANYTHING I can legally do aside from blocking their multiple accounts and numbers repeatedly? Can I take any real action against them? Can I go to the police? Even though we're all Canadian, I feel like my options are quite limited since all of my family physically lives in the Middle East, and I'm physically here. What can I do to get them to just stop? Or at least scare them off a little bit. I want them to realize that I’m not scared of them anymore and even though they're my family, I have absolutely zero qualms with getting them in any legal trouble if it ever comes to that.",

He was just another kid in my class that I'd talk to on occasion. My friends were more-so his friends but even then, our group wasn't highly involved with him. I only ever chatted a bit in class. I'd say he was an acquaintance. At some point in middle-school he moved to a different city in Indiana. Years went by and I was in high-school (i think somewhere along the line I learned he moved but I hadn't even noticed till then). \n\n  One day, I downloaded tinder and talked to a couple people but it only lasted like 2-3 days. I tried swiping around again and saw his name and swiped right. I said its been awhile, cracked on him for having Tinder plus, and just caught up with him for a night. No flirting, just civil talking, like talking to a coworker in a way. We took the conversation to messages, in my mind because tinder is moreso for dating and didn't wanna have the wrong impression on our conversation. Id say we talked all that first day, into the second, then fizzled out on the 3rd day.\n\n   I havent talked to him since. I haven't had the same iPhone im android now and I just didn't feel the need to continue the relationship it wasn't that big and I got lost in my own business.  Pretty sure when we texted that time, it was at the time of the george floyd protests.\n Fast forward years later. Im with the love of my life. I'm engaged, moved away and living my best life. All of a sudden, I get a call from the police department's detective. The guy is a major suspect in a ongoing homocide case. Turns out, he claimed he was at his girlfriends house at the time of the murder. And that the person who was his girlfriend is me (and I guess at my old house but he never even knew where In the city i had lived). Woke up from a nap to hear that. Apparently I have to go back into town soon and also I had to give my statement.\nAny advice for me? This whole situation is crazy. I don't even know the guy...",

I’m currently involved in a potential lawsuit against one school (School A), and I want to start a separate one against a second school (School B), but for entirely different reasons.\n\n# School A:\n\n* My parents and I initially started this case together for my sake, but they’ve taken over. They're claiming damages on their own behalf, saying what happened affected them even more than me, which I don’t fully agree with and are asking for double what i am asking for. \n* I’ve lost trust in the lawyer handling this. It’s been over a year and they *still* haven’t even filed a statement of claim. There’ve also been some obvious mistakes on their part that make me feel like they're not taking it seriously.\n* My parents are still backing this lawyer, but I want out or at least some control which my parents wont let me\n\n# School B:\n\n* This school caused me much more serious harm, including trauma that led me to contemplate suicide and be diagnosed with depression. I was assaulted and bullied here, but also they did nothing to stop the rumours on what i went through at school A. \n* I want to sue them too, but my parents are completely against it mostly because they like the school and think me suing two schools will make me \"suspicious\" and problematic and we wont win either cases. I have suffient proof of negligence from both schools and i feel i need some form of justice from the things I went through. \n* I don’t have a good relationship with my parents, and I’d be pursuing this second case entirely on my own, with a different lawyer.\n\n# Question:\n\n1. Am I legally allowed to sue both schools at the same time with two different lawyers? \n\nI’m an adult, and I just want to make sure I have some control over what happens in my own legal matters. Any advice or insight would be super appreciated.\n\n  \nLocation: Ontario",

This is a case of definite wage theft, but there’s more. My boyfriend has been threatened by a line lead for reporting him and when he reported it a 3rd time he was mocked just like each time before and retaliated against. There is an older woman who reported sexual harassment on a man previously, she still had to work with him when he poked her inappropriately with a broom handle. She reported this and nothing was done so she quit and is now facing eviction. She is ready to come forward, we have a call recorded of her entire raw emotional side (one party consent state), and screenshots of a young female former coworker saying she quit due to sexual harassment, and hostility from one of the same bosses my boyfriend has been retaliated against by (we know of dates and locations including near cameras this man gets in his face) we also have a voice audio of a higher up the same one who has ignored sexual assault reports and my boyfriends harrasment reports, admitting to wage theft on my boyfriend and his entire department by saying only one QC gets paid for it. At this job they switch there position daily and have people line up to be chosen by line leads. These people do not receive pay for the job done that day but there title in the computer. I have an entire drop box folder filled with evidence this has been ongoing and evidence my boyfriend was QC (tons of paperwork he signed and dated) also we are from now on dating each day he works a position he can’t legally (like machine OP due to osha safety regulations). I believe this is an employee wide wage theft of every department and the daily rotation is an attempt to leave less of a trail. We cannot afford a lawyer, we didn’t even know it was company wide or about the poor woman facing homelessness due to the same retaliation my boyfriend faced until we started gathering our evidence for the EEOC. Now we have discovered a much much larger problem with many laws involved, we need a contingency lawyer and im hoping to open an investigation so every employee gets justice. Is this realistic? With all of our proof? Im willing to share my folder of evidence with a way better claim of events and more detail with anyone who ask but it will not be downloadable and it will expire for privacy concerns.

I had to transfer departments at my job, have been having nightmares and panic attacks daily, and have genuinely blocked most of the details out of my mind because my mental state has been so fragile since this happened. \n\nThe person who assaulted me was arrested about a week ago, and pled not guilty at the arraignment. I was just subpoenaed to testify, and genuinely don't think I can be in the same room as this person. Does anyone have any advice for staying calm on the stand? I want to be able to survive my testimony and any cross-examination so that I can actually get the justice I've been waiting for. I don't want to be too emotional or get too worked up, but I just don't know how to do that when he's going to be right there. Any advice on how to navigate this would be seriously appreciated, I'm a wreck right now.",

      "text": "Location: OHIO, USA.\n\nThis is an extremely odd situation and Honestly I’m not totally sure if this is even something considered to be reportable. About a year ago I had a NP do a physical for me, he was somebody my parents knew and it was done at his home and not at any actual office. Following this physical he told me I had a heart condition and would frequently ask me to see him so he could listen and monitor it. After some time of this he began sending me incredibly creepy messages about enjoying finding the condition and listening to it which made me incredibly uncomfortable so I entirely cut contact with him and told my parents about what had happened but that was all. I got another physical done at an actual doctors office for school and they said they couldn’t find anything wrong with my heart and more then likely I did not have the condition he had claimed I had.\nAfter this recent realization and reflecting on the entire situation, I’m considering making a report to the nursing board so that it can be investigated. I honestly just want them to ensure this was something unintended and that he didn’t have malicious intent. I don’t want some huge legal trial or justice for myself, I just want to make sure this does not have to happen again to somebody. If I were to report him and he were to somehow find out it was me, could I end up potentially facing legal repercussions for it?",

      "title": "A young NYC doctor went shopping on September 10, 2001. She was never seen again. Years later, courts ruled she died on 9/11, but no one knows how or where.",
      "text": "# Summary\n\n* Sneha Anne Philip, a 31-year-old physician, vanished in Lower Manhattan the night before the 9/11 attacks.\n* Her last confirmed sighting was at a department store across from the Twin Towers around 7:18 p.m on Sept 10.\n* No trace of her - not a body, not even a shoe - has ever been found.\n* Investigators and her family clashed over who she was: a troubled young woman, or a hero lost in one of history’s darkest moments.\n* In 2008, after years of legal battles, a court ruled she likely died in the attacks.\n* She remains the only 9/11 victim officially declared dead with no direct evidence placing her at Ground Zero.\n\n---\n\n# Who was Sneha Anne Philip?\n\nSneha Anne Philip was a second-year internal medicine resident living in Battery Park City with her husband, Ron Lieberman, an emergency room doctor. Born in Kerala, India and raised in upstate New York, she was artistic, intelligent, independent, and driven. Her family described her as warm and idealistic, and she loved painting, animals and her work.\n\nBehind the surface, however, Sneha’s life in 2001 was complicated. She had been fired from one hospital and suspended from another for missed shifts and failing to attend a required counseling program. She was also facing a misdemeanor charge for allegedly filing a false police report after accusing a colleague of groping her - an incident for which she spent a night in jail and refused a plea deal.\n\nHer marriage, while loving, was under strain due to her increasing alcohol use and habit of staying out overnight. Police later alleged she frequented lesbian bars and had multiple affairs with women, including an explosive claim (which her brother denies) that she had an affair with his girlfriend. Her family says these claims were speculative, unverified, and rooted in character attacks, not evidence.\n\n---\n\n# The Day Before the Attacks\n\nOn the morning of Monday, September 10, 2001, Sneha and Ron attended a court hearing related to the misdemeanor charge. Afterwards, Ron went to work, and Sneha remained at home. Between 2-4 p.m,  she chatted online with her mother, saying she planned to visit the World Trade Center mall soon.\n\nLater that evening, she was captured on security footage shopping at Century 21, a department store located just steps from the Twin Towers. She bought clothing, shoes, and lingerie using Ron’s credit card. That footage, timestamped at 7:18 p.m, is the **last confirmed sighting** of her.\n\nA sales clerk claimed she was shopping with another woman, but when Ron reviewed the footage, Sneha appeared alone.\n\nRon returned home around midnight to find her absent. This wasn’t out of the ordinary - she sometimes stayed with her cousin or friends. However, at 4:00 a.m., a landline call was made from their apartment to Ron’s cell. He didn’t recall answering it. The call has never been explained.\n\n---\n\n# September 11, 2001\n\nRon left early for work at Jacobi Medical Center in the Bronx. At 8:46 a.m, the first plane hit the North Tower.\n\nRon frantically called home throughout the day. That evening, he made his way downtown - in an ambulance, then on foot - to reach their apartment near Ground Zero. The building was sealed and powerless. He couldn’t enter until the following morning.\n\nInside, he found only cat pawprints in the layer of dust. None of the shopping bags Sneha purchased the night before were there. It appeared she had not returned.\n\n---\n\n# The Investigation\n\nInitially, Sneha was presumed to be one of the thousands lost in the towers. Her family distributed flyers, visited hospitals, and searched. But as time passed, and no direct evidence emerged placing her at the World Trade Center on 9/11, police started examining other possibilities.\n\nThe NYPD uncovered her recent job loss, legal troubles, and lifestyle. They floated theories: Sneha was murdered the night of September 10; she ran away to start a new life; she overdosed or died by suicide. Her family rejected all of this and maintained she was caught in the chaos of the attacks.\n\nA key clue emerged: at **8:43 a.m.** on September 11 - just three minutes before the first plane struck - a woman resembling Sneha was seen on lobby camera entering 225 Rector Place (where Sneha and Ron's apartment was located). She waited briefly by the elevator, then walked out. The woman matched Sneha’s height and build but wasn’t carrying the shopping bags she had purchased. Detective Richard Stark believed it was her. Ron wasn’t sure.\n\nRon and a private investigator spent weeks retracing her steps, reviewing footage, and questioning employees at local bars and stores. They found no evidence of foul play, suicide, or that she was living under a new identity. Her passport, most credit cards and ID were left behind. Only the AmEx card she used on Sept 10 was missing - and it was never used again.\n\nAdding to the confusion, Sneha’s brother told the media she had called him from the towers during the attack, saying “I have to help this person.” That quote circulated widely - until he later admitted he made it up to attract attention to her case.\n\n---\n\n# The Legal Battle\n\nIn 2004, the NYC Medical Examiner removed Sneha from the list of 9/11 victims, citing a lack of proof she was at Ground Zero. A surrogate court agreed, declaring her date of death as September 10, 2004 - three years after her disappearance.\n\nHer family appealed. In 2008, the New York State Supreme Court’s Appellate Division reversed the ruling in a 3-2 decision. Justice David B. Saxe wrote that although there was no direct evidence, the circumstantial case overwhelmingly supported that she died in the attacks:\n\n*“Only the rankest speculation leads to any other conclusion.”*\n\nWith that, Sneha Anne Philip was officially declared a 9/11 victim - the 2,751st name on the list.\n\n---\n\n# Lingering Questions\n\nStill, mystery surrounds her fate:\n\n* Why weren’t her shopping bags found at home?\n* If the woman in the lobby video was her, where did she go next?\n* Could she have died elsewhere, and her body never found - possibly destroyed by the towers’ collapse if she was nearby?\n\nSneha’s family submitted photos and descriptions of her jewelry - including a gold minnu pendant, diamond earrings, and wedding rings - in case they match any of the 1,300+ recovered items from Ground Zero. At one point, they received a hopeful letter from the city. It turned out to be a form response.\n\nTo this day, **no remains, personal effects, or confirmed sightings have ever surfaced.**\n\n---\n\n# Where the Case Stands Today\n\nSneha’s name is inscribed on the 9/11 Memorial at the South Pool, Panel S-66. Her case has been covered in *Unsolved Mysteries*, ABC’s *Missing* and numerous true crime podcasts.\n\nAdvanced DNA testing continues on the thousands of unidentified human remains recovered from Ground Zero. Her family still hopes one day, even a fragment of her or her jewelry might be identified.\n\nRon Lieberman has since remarried - with her parents’ blessing - and remains close to Sneha’s family. Her childhood bedroom in Poughkeepsie remains untouched.\n\nHer father once said: *“She cannot just disappear into the air… There should be something.”*\n\n---\n\n# Discussion Questions\n\n* Do you believe Sneha Philip was a 9/11 victim? Or was her disappearance unrelated?\n* Was the NYPD wrong to dig into her personal life, or were they justified?\n* What does her case tell us about how women - especially those who defy norms - are treated by media and law enforcement?\n\n---\n\n# Sources and Further Reading\n\n**New York Magazine (2006):**  \n“Last Seen on September 10th” - a definitive longform profile of Sneha’s disappearance.  \n🔗 [nymag.com/news/features/17336](http://nymag.com/news/features/17336)\n\n**Appellate Division Ruling (2008):**  \nFull text of the decision reinstating her as a 9/11 victim.  \n🔗 [law.justia.com/.../2008-00630.html](http://law.justia.com/.../2008-00630.html)\n\n**9/11 Memorial & Museum:**  \nOfficial memorial page for Sneha Anne Philip.  \n🔗 [911memorial.org/visit/memorial/names-911-memorial](http://911memorial.org/visit/memorial/names-911-memorial)\n\n**Voices Center for Resilience:**  \nFamily-submitted tribute and memorial entry.  \n🔗 [voicescenter.org/living-memorial/victim/dr-sneha-anne-philip](https://voicescenter.org/living-memorial/victim/dr-sneha-anne-philip)\n\n**ABC7NY “Missing” Episode:**  \nIn-depth special on Sneha’s case hosted by Kristin Thorne.  \n🔗 [abc7ny.com/.../12209285](https://abc7ny.com/dr-sneha-anne-philip-doctor-missing-on-911-september-11th-episode/12209285/)\n\n**Unsolved Mysteries (2002):**  \nFeatured in Season 12, Episode 3.  \n🔗 [imdb.com/title/tt1489808](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1489808/)\n\n**Crime Junkie:**  \nEpisode: “MISSING: Sneha Philip”  \n🔗 [crimejunkiepodcast.com/missing-sneha-philip](http://crimejunkiepodcast.com/missing-sneha-philip)\n\n**Missing on 9/11 (NBC/Dateline):**  \nFull investigative podcast on Sneha's disappearance.  \n🔗 [open.spotify.com/show/1FVuNkhhGMtFNmhJgUT5pM](https://open.spotify.com/show/1FVuNkhhGMtFNmhJgUT5pM)\n(I highly recommend this podcast)\n\n**Trace Evidence Podcast:**  \nDetailed exploration of her background and final days.  \n🔗 [trace-evidence.com/sneha-philip](http://trace-evidence.com/sneha-philip)\n\n**Into the Dark (2025):**  \n“The Doctor Who Vanished the Day Before 9/11”  \n🔗 [podcasts.apple.com/...](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/116-the-doctor-who-vanished-the-day-before-9-11/id1662304327?i=1000704548337)\n\nShe has a Wikipedia page too but I'm not sure on this sub's policies for Wiki.\n\n---\n\nThis is a case that I have been obsessed with for years, ever since I first discovered it.

It is something that I have seen in this very community when someone highlights the cases of elderly individuals. It was actually some of this feedback which made me realize the need for a piece like this one. I once had a post reported by a reader because my write up on a missing 86 year old man with dementia was “not a mystery” even though his body was not (and still has not) been recovered. One commenter called the write up “low effort” and another said that there is “no mystery” when an old person goes missing, and a third said that his case was “not good content.”  I think it is imperative that we remember as we read about real people’s stories that missing people are **NOT** content. They are real people who are missing and whether or not the circumstances surrounding their disappearances and final days are mysterious or mundane, their cases deserve exposure and everyone deserves to be laid to rest. \n\nIt goes without saying that I know most readers are nothing but compassionate and respectful to the people in these stories.

Leo and his wife of 55 years, Virginia, were part of a pay-your-own way service group called Maranatha Volunteers International, a Christian group that builds homes, churches, and schools. In between two different jobs the group stopped at Tabacon Hot Springs resort for lunch. Leo was last seen sitting on a bench while his wife waded nearby, but within 20 minutes he was gone. Someone drove 10 miles down the road looking for him within minutes of his disappearance but no trace of Leo was ever found, which was especially weird as food and souvenir shops line parts of the road.\n\nTheories in the case abound. Some think Leo got lost and perished in the volcanic landscape, some think he was hit by a car and flew down the hill into the jungle, while others think he was picked up by someone in a vehicle who did him harm or gave him a ride to another area where he perished from either foul play or misadventure. Leo Widicker is described as a white male, 86 years old in 2001, who was 5’6” and 145 lbs. Leo has blue eyes and is mostly bald. His remaining hair is reportedly blondish- gray. He wears hearing aids and glasses and also has a pacemaker. When last seen he was wearing a white baseball cap, jeans, black shoes, a red and blue plaid shirt, a blue jacket and a name tag. If you have any information on the disappearance of Leo please contact United States Embassy San Jose, Costa Rica Office at 011-506-220-3939. His wife, Virginia, passed away in 2023.

His brother reported him missing after not hearing from his brother for months. Delaney may have gone to Mason county, near the Olympic National forest as he liked to frequent the area, specifically Shelton or Hoodsport. Delaney is legally blind, and suffers from type 2 diabetes. He can reportedly see well enough to live independently but he cannot drive. Because of his diabetes he always travels with a small red and white cooler with a lid, food, protein powder, herbal supplements, vitamins and his medication usually inside. He also carries a black leather backpack with books inside, and a small blue duffle bag sometimes with dry food or extra medication. Delaney is described as a white male, with brown eyes, and graying brown hair. His left eye is partially sewn shut and he usually wears a mustache. He is 5’10” and 220 lbs. Mason County police are investigating Delaney's disappearance, they can be contacted at 360-427-9670 ext. 313 Sources [https://charleyproject.org/case/donald-richard-delaney](https://charleyproject.org/case/donald-richard-delaney)\n\n**Rose E. Eaton,** age 73, was last seen on July 25th 1994 in Chimacum, an unincorporated area in Jefferson Co. Washington state. Rose was in her son’s car waiting for him to drive her to the dentist when her son noticed that several goats had gotten loose. He told his mom to wait in the car but when he got back 10 minutes later, his mother was gone. Her purse was also missing but the family’s German Shepherd was still in the vehicle. The man looked for his mother for a few minutes but couldn’t find her and he found that the door to their home was still locked. He promptly called the police. Tracking dogs traced Rose’s scent down the dirt road for about ⅓ of a mile to the junction of the main paved road (Beaver Valley Road) when the trail abruptly stopped, leading investigators to think Rose may have entered a motor vehicle at that location. No other trace of her has ever been found. Rose is described as a white female with gray hair and blue eyes. She is 5’9” and 160 lbs. At the time she lived with her son and had been diagnosed with dementia several years earlier but was reportedly physically in good health. She was last seen wearing a long sky blue coat with buttons down the front, a long light blue dress, a tan purse with little to no money inside, and blue rubber soled orthopedic shoes size 8.5 and a ring with a ruby and some small diamonds. Rose has previously fractured her upper left arm. She has a small scar on the back of her neck and a scar on her abdomen. She is a non-smoker and non-drinker. She does not drive. Foul play is not suspected in this case but it has not been totally ruled out by law enforcement due to the scent trail found by search dogs.

The 69 year old was reportedly last seen walking down highway 12 away from the ranch he lived at in Clarkston, Washington. He was upset at the idea of moving into a nursing home and threatened to leave the area. It is unknown if this conversation had happened on that day or previously and who he was talking to about this potential move remains unknown. Jerry left behind all of his belongings, money, cell phone, and clothing. He is known to hitchhike between the towns of Clarkston and Pomeroy which are about 30 miles apart. The area Jerry was last seen in is a very rural area with few people near the border with Idaho. Jerry is described as a white male, 5' 7\"-5’8” and 125-130 lbs. with brown gray hair, brown eyes, and a gray beard. He was wearing a dark colored coat and blue jeans when he was last seen. He had a broken leg at the time of his disappearance. He may have had a stroke before he disappeared and was showing possible signs of dementia.

However, within a week police began to speculate that Walter Dunson had actually died or disappeared fifteen years earlier. Walter is described as a thin black male, 97 years old at the time of last contact. He was about 5’8” and weighed 150 lbs.

He may also have a lottery card in his possession. He wears dentures and reading glasses. In his composite he has some facial hair but in real photos he is clean shaven. Some agencies give Dunson's date of birth as July 2, 1899 or July 7, 1900. If alive he would be 124 years old today.

According to the Ohio State ME’s office, “on 07/08/1986, the remains of a 50-99 year old black male were discovered in an abandoned apartment building on Republic Street in Cincinnati, OH. This individual measured 68\" in height and was wearing a tan long sleeved pullover shirt, a v-neck tan sweater, brown trousers, a brown belt, a tan sweater, white socks with green stripes, brown leather shoes, and a blue baseball cap.” According to Namus the building entrance was barricaded from the inside as if someone was living in the building and the man had been dead for several weeks. The man’s height, age range, and even clothing seems to match with Walter Dunson. Is it possible that Walter, who had been homeless in the past, was again living on the streets or had wandered from son’s home only to pass away while staying in this abandoned building? I have submitted Walter Dunson as a match to this man via both the Hamilton County Coroner's office and Namus. Even if this individual is not Dunson, he still deserves to have his name back.

She was wearing a blue nightgown and green rubber gardening clogs. She has been diagnosed with dementia and has limited speech abilities. She may be confused and not know where she lives or how to get home. In the past she has wandered into strangers’ houses. One report says that she had entered Haije has gray hair dyed a dark red color and blue eyes. She is white and 5’6” tall and weighs between 150-165 lbs. Her last name is pronounced hay-gee and in most publications her name is spelled “Sharron.” According to Pierce County Sheriff's office, the search for Haije was started very soon after she went missing and was exhaustive. Police do not believe Haije is in the area and have reason to believe she entered a car near where she was last seen. Please call 253-798-7530 if you have any information on this case.

The 71 year old was active in the community and well liked. He worked at the Warm Spring forest products mill in Warm Springs but may have been last seen last seen in Madras, Oregon fifteen miles from Warm Springs. He was last seen at either Bi-Mart in Madras or at the Warm Springs Tribal Credit Enterprise in Warm Springs, Oregon on March 16, 2022, sources differ. He had left home to run errands and never made it back. Days later, his car was found stuck in a snow bank 20 miles west of his home. Inside were groceries he had purchased, dog food, and the hat he wore daily. Although Lewis or Louie as he was known loved to go on walks, he did not walk without his wife or his dog Thor, both of whom were at home on the day Louie vanished. Furthermore, he was not known to hike or walk in the dark even though he was last seen eaving the store at 6 pm when it was already dusky outside. The search for Louie was suspended after two weeks but his family are still trying to find him and have a facebook page. Louie is described as a Native American man of Yakama, Umatilla, and Nez Perce descent. He was 71 years old in 2022, weighting 210 pounds, and standing about 6' tall. He was last seen wearing a gray Adidas sweatshirt with three black stripes, new blue jeans and boots. He has a tattoo of an L on his left hand, a bump on his neck at the front and center, a bump on the bottom of his foot, and scars or spots on his legs.

The 78 year old was residing at the Golden Lion Motel on Tacoma Way in Lakewood, Washington. The establishment has long been a hotbed of criminal activity and violence since at least the 1990s. On average the police responded to incidents at the 24-room hotel over 100 times per year. November 22nd 2003 was one of those times. On that day witnesses called the police after hearing “screaming and fighting” in Dong’s room. When the authorities arrived, they found a giant pool of blood on the floor as well as Dong’s prescription eyeglasses, but Dong was nowhere to be found. Tests determined that the blood belonged to Dong. One week before Dong’s disappearance he was granted a temporary domestic violence protection order from a Paul C. Jung, who might be Dong’s adult son. In June of 2003, someone named Hae Sung Jung, got a restraining order against Dong. Hae might be the estranged wife of Dong. There are reports that Dong was having “marital issues'' at the time of his disappearance. Very little information is available in the case. Dong is described as an Asian male, with brown eyes and thinning gray hair. He is 5’6'' and weighs 135 lbs. Dong wears prescription eyeglasses but they were left behind when he vanished. If you have any information regarding the disappearance of Dong Jung please call Pierce County Crime Stoppers 253-591-5959.

On the 28th of February Richard left his hotel room to get gas for his car at about 5 pm and disappeared. Two months later, Richard’s vehicle was found abandoned on a seldom used logging road in Vadar, Washington 80 miles south of Tacoma. A newspaper from Feb. 28th and a note saying \\`\\`Will pick up car tonight or tomorrow\" were found either inside the car or near it. It is believed that Lawrence got lost while attempting to get home to Portland when he parked his car and left the vehicle. Two locals reported seeing a man matching Lawrence’s description walking down the logging road, the day after Lawrence was last seen. They reported that the man didn’t seem to be in distress. Local law enforcement thinks it is possible that he was picked up by someone on the road. Lawrence had gotten confused while driving twice in the recent past, once two weeks before his disappearance in Portland and once the day before in Tacoma. He was reportedly upset knowing he might have been in the beginning stages of dementia or another health issue.\n\nLawrence is described as a black male, with thinning brown hair and brown eyes. He weighed 125 lbs. and stood at only 5’ tall. He was last seen wearing a black rim glasses, with a prescription lens in the right lens; the left lens was plain glass as well as a black fur type knee length coat, black Russian style hat, white shirt with tie and black dress shoes size, 5. He had suffered a heart attack a year before his disappearance, and wore a pacemaker. He was reportedly depressed about his physical condition.

Mann was last seen at 10 am on September 15th leaving his home in his 2007 Ford Focus. Later searches indicated that fishing gear disappeared with Mann and it is speculated he left his home to go fishing. Mann was then seen 3 hours later north of his home buying gas and the clerk reported that he seemed confused or disoriented. Two days later on September 17th, Mann called his daughter on two separate occasions but the reception was so poor no one knew what he was saying. Soon after the phone was turned off and the “pings” came from the Quilcene, Washington area. Later that same day, Mann’s car was found abandoned in the next county over near a Tunnel Creek Trail about 50 miles from his home and ten miles from the town of Quilcene. The car was badly damaged presumably from the rough terrain. Tragically, no trace of Cecil Mann was ever found. Mann did not have any mental health concerns at the time of his disappearance and had never shown signs of dementia, however, he was new to the Port Orchard area and wasn’t yet familiar with the area. At the time of his disappearance he was recovering from a bout with prostate cancer.\n\nMann is described as a white male who is balding with some gray hair. He has blue eyes and wears bifocals with wire frames. He weighed only 135 lbs. and stood at 5’8”. He was last seen wearing a tan or green windbreaker jacket, blue jeans, gray sneakers and a watch.

Estelle was 83 years old and has been diagnosed with Alzheimer's. She left home with her dog, a gray or tan Pitbull named Jay, to check the mail and never returned. It is unknown if Jay was ever found. Searches on foot, horseback, and ATV started right away but no sign was ever found of Estelle Abbott. Estelle is described as a white female with blonde hair and blue eyes. She's about 5’ 7” in height, 150 lbs. and she was last seen wearing a red sweater and blue jeans. In the past Estelle has lived in Spokane, Washington and Sonoma, California and her loved ones are worried she may have tried to travel there.

Right before going missing Larry had a surgery on his neck and some sources claim he was in a neck brace. Unable to work, Riegel was collecting disability and had lost his pilot license due to his injury. The last contact anyone had with Larry took place on Christmas day, 2009. He contacted several relatives and friends including a call to his mother to thank her for some clothes she bought him for the holiday. He was supposed to join his family in Yakima for a belated Christmas dinner on Dec. 26, 2009, but he never showed up or called. Riegel’s family described him as a “chatty Cathy” who talked to just about anyone and had daily phone contact with his friends and family. He is also reportedly an alcoholic who liked to visit bars near his home.\n\nRiegel lived with his girlfriend, Ladena Mann before he went missing. Mann claimed that the couple argued on Christmas day and Riegel left the home presumably to go see his tenants, who lived in nearby Union Gap. Mann also claimed that Riegel assaulted her either on Christmas day or on January 4th before disappearing. When Mann tried to report this assault weeks later, she was unable because she had no injuries or proof of violence. Mann used Riegel’s money and EBT card after he disappeared as well as applied for her own EBT card claiming she still lived with Larry. Mann was charged with welfare fraud and perjury, but charges were dropped when she paid back the money and entered a diversion program. In one media interview she claimed that Larry is still alive and that he has “contacted several people” since going missing. She called some of Larry's former coworkers and his boss to share this information. She thinks Larry is residing in Idaho or Montana and has accused his family of knowing where he is. Ladena Mann is a person of interest in Larry’s disappearance as the last known person to have spoken to him.\n\nRiegel’s family is offering $25,000 for information in the homicide investigation that leads to his remains. They have billboards all over the Yakima valley asking for information. Larry’s mother, aged in her 90s, still drives around rural areas searching for his body.\n\nRiegel is described as a white male with gray hair, a gray mustache, and hazel eyes. He is 6’2'' and weighs 200 lbs. He has surgical scars on his left knee and a prominent vertical scar on his neck from recent surgery to fix four broken vertebrae. He often wears eyeglasses and he has a limp in his left leg. He is also an alcoholic who frequented neighborhood bars. He has lived in Yakima his whole life.He may wear a neck brace. The Yakima Police Department (509-576-6573) is investigating.\n\nThe last time I wrote about this case, most articles mentioned that Riegel’s last phone call took place at approximately 5:30 pm on Christmas day. It is believed that the call was made to Riegel’s tenants who rented a farm from him in Union Gap, a town on the Yakama reservation. His tenants owed him $3000 in back rent. However, this is no longer reported in the most recent articles. I am not sure how important this is but I wanted to mention it nonetheless.

Adams. Donnie had a heart problem and had been prescribed nitroglycerin as a result. Right before his disappearance, he told his daughter that he (and the ethics committee) “was getting into something that’s going to make everybody mad.” He even went so far to tell her that he would be “making enemies” and that she and the community would hear about his findings soon enough. He had been investigating rumors of corruption in the tribal council and the housing authority before he went missing, but other committee members refused to elaborate on the matter.\n\nDonnie’s truck was found Oct. 30, 1994, in the foothills of Mount Adams by volunteer searchers, but searchers found no trace of Sampson. His nitroglycerin, lunch, clothing and three rifles were found in his truck. A fourth rifle he left home with disappeared with him. Donnie’s children say tribal police have done little to investigate the disappearance, which they believe is a result of foul play. For example, his children were never interviewed and his truck was found by volunteers, not official search and rescue. Tribal authorities believe that the elderly Sampson simply got lost while hunting. There are no photos or description of Donnie Sampson available. Tribal police are investigating.

His disappearance was featured on an episode of *Disappeared*. He'd recently reunited with and rather quickly married his long-lost love after having been apart for more than 50 years. Bob was in the process of preparing his house for her to move from Missouri to California. As she was packing her things halfway across the country, tragedy struck: Bob abruptly vanished. His disappearance and probable death were most likely at the hands of someone he knew and trusted. Bob was quite wealthy at the time he went missing, which lends some credence to this theory. He had previously been involved with a woman who allegedly owed him more than $80,000; in addition Bob's own children and other family members were said to be very unhappy with Bob's new and sudden marriage and a heated \"family meeting\" regarding Bob's estate and assets supposedly occurred just prior to his disappearance. Bob is described as a Caucasian male with gray hair and blue/gray eyes. Harrod keeps his hair very short and he is bald on the top. His nickname is Bob. He is supposed to wear eyeglasses, but they were left behind. He is 5’11” and weights 140-170 lbs. He has last seen wearing white shorts, a white v-neck undershirt, white knee socks, a white belt, a white hat, white Reebok sneakers, a plain gold wedding band on his left ring finger and possibly a Masonic ring with a red stone and a Masonic symbol on his right ring finger.

He was last seen in his car crossing the bridge on Warner Rd in Staples, MN between 12 and 1 pm that day. He had been doing errands and was expected home by 2 pm. The next day, his car was later found stuck in the mud off Country Road 32 in a town about ten miles from his home. Groceries and medicine he had bought for his wife the day before were found in the car. The area was so muddy it was determined that Peter couldn’t have gone very far. Despite extensive searching, no trace of Peter was ever found. At the time of his disappearance, Peter was in good mental health and he did not have Dementia or Alzheimer's disease. He had, however, had a hip replacement and walked with a cane as a result. Peter is a native of Switzerland and was in the US on a green card. When he disappeared he was only carrying $30, his driver's license, and his green card. He had been married for 50 years and had 11 children (8 who were still living), 13 foster children, and 23 grandchildren.

Eva was visiting to decorate the grave with a pumpkin and to visit the graves of several family members who were buried there. She normally visited about three times a year. She always parked in the same spot, about 40 feet from her brother’s grave. A local called the police when he noticed the car had been there all day. It is a pretty rural area with police claiming that one afternoon during the investigation only three vehicles drove by on the road. When contacted, Eva’s son Guy went to search for his mother and he realized that her car was parked in a different spot than she normally parked in but her keys were on the ground where she normally parked. Her purse was on the front seat and a few dollars were found hidden inside. She normally carried her cash in a bank envelope but no envelopes were found in the car. Police used searchers and a helicopter to search for Eva but nothing was ever found. Police believe foul play is involved and believe her disappearance might be connected to the murder of a 88 year old woman three months earlier and two other women who disappeared in the several years beforehand. Her son Guy and other family members are still searching for Eva. Eva is described as a white female who was 4’10” and weighed 98 lbs. She has thinning brown hair with some gray and blue eyes.

      "text": "Valérie Leblanc was an 18 years old college student in her second year at Cégep Gabrielle-Roy, where she was studying human sciences. Known for her quirky personality, creativity and kindness, Valérie was really close to her family. She worked as an entertainer at children's parties where she often played the role of a secret agent. Her love for hats was well-known and a photo of her in a tartan fedora became a symbol of her memory after her death. [Image of Valérie, the \"important witness\" and a map of the area.](https://ibb.co/1MYxR0M)\n\nIn 2011 on August 23, Valérie was brutally murdered in the middle of the day near her college in Gatineau (Québec, Canada). It was only the second day of the school term, so students had shorter classes and a lot of free time. For a while now, Valérie had wanted to break up with her boyfriend Adrien. She decided to do so during lunch that day. Together, they went into the woods behind the campus, which was a popular hang out spot for students during breaks. After an “uncomfortable, but ordinary breakup”, Valérie and Adrien returned to school and were both seen separately around campus by friends. Around this time, she called her father to ask for a ride home because she was distraught by her breakup. As he was tired from a recent trip, he said that he’d come pick her up after a nap.\n\nAt some point between 11:50 AM and 1:00 PM, Valérie returned to the woods behind the campus. The exact time and reason she went back is unknown, but this would be the last time anyone saw her alive. Some sources mention that she went back with a female friend, while others mention that she was alone.\n\nShortly after 1:00 PM, a group of four students later discovered Valérie’s body in the woods. They initially saw smoke and, upon investigating, found her mutilated body partially on fire. In shock, they convinced themselves it was a staged scene for the new recruits in the police program at the college. Believing it to be a mannequin, they spent nearly 45 minutes near the body, unknowingly contaminating the crime scene. It wasn’t until much later that one of them reconsidered the weirdness of the situation. They finally called the police at 3:55 PM, many hours after they first discovered the crime scene.\n\nThe news of Valérie’s murder shocked the community. It was Gatineau’s first homicide of 2011 and the brutality of the crime left everyone on edge, especially since it was so close to multiple schools and popular hiking trails. The police were tight-lipped about the investigation, only revealing that Valérie had died from head trauma and had been brutally attacked. They did not disclose whether the crime was sexually motivated, what the murder weapon was, or how the body was burned. Even years later, these details remain confidential.\n\nThe police released a sketch of an “important witness,” described as a tall, heavyset young man with a “sloppy” appearance and an unhealthy complexion. He was seen near the crime scene at the presumed time of the attack. Despite the portrait being widely circulated, this person never came forward and their identity remains unknown. In the year following the murder, the police received around 1500 tips from the public, showing that people took their request for more information at heart. \n\nValérie’s ex-boyfriend Adrien and the four students who found her body were cleared of any involvement. Other potential suspects were considered, but none were officially named. However, all leads eventually went cold. As the investigation dragged on with no significant breakthroughs, frustration grew among Valérie’s family. They felt ignored by the police and began to lose hope that the case would ever be solved. Still continuing to push for answers, they hope that the case will one day be transferred to the provincial police (SQ) and bring new results to the investigation. Sadly, some family members passed away without seeing justice. Despite the passage of time, they remain determined to keep Valérie’s memory alive and to find the truth about what happened to her.\n\n**NOTES**\n\n* I gave Adrian a fake name as he was a minor at the time and was never a suspect.\n* The education system is different in Québec. High school lasts 5 years and students graduate when they are 16-17 years old. They enter college (called Cégeps) and follow a general program for two years, or a specialized program for three. That’s why a lot of the people involved were minors and not named.\n* I made a [longer write-up in 2022](https://www.reddit.com/r/UnresolvedMysteries/comments/wvv454/today_marks_the_11th_anniversary_of_the_death_of/) about this case if you are interested.\n\n**SOURCES**\n\n* [| Gatineau | Valérie Leblanc Murdered on August 23, 2011 - MDIQ (meurtresetdisparitions.com)](https://meurtresetdisparitions.com/en/2020/10/03/gatineau-valerie-leblanc-murdered-on-august-23-2011/)\n* [Police release description of witness in Leblanc murder | CTV News](https://ottawa.ctvnews.ca/police-release-description-of-witness-in-leblanc-murder-1.691454)\n* [Police pursue new lead in Valerie Leblanc murder case | CTV News](https://ottawa.ctvnews.ca/police-pursue-new-lead-in-valerie-leblanc-murder-case-1.732971)\n* [Renewed call for information 10 years after Valerie Leblanc's murder | CTV News](https://ottawa.ctvnews.ca/renewed-call-for-information-10-years-after-valerie-leblanc-s-murder-1.5557867)",

The investigation into their deaths unearthed potential links to organized crime, a connection to another murder, and a pig, whose miraculous survival resulted in the discovery of a crime scene.",
      "text": "On the night of October 27, 1945, 54-year-old widow Martha Brandenburg, was peacefully sleeping in her rural Sulphur, Indiana home when a sudden, frantic knock startled her awake. Opening the door, Martha found her 15-year-old neighbor, Lucy Berkley. Lucy informed Martha that her barn was on fire. \n\nAround 10:45pm, Lucy and her boyfriend, Harley Walton, were returning from a date when they spotted the blaze from the road. While Lucy rushed to inform Martha of the situation, Harley tried in vain to extinguish the fire, before seeking help from a neighbor. Unfortunately, the flames spread rapidly, engulfing the entire structure within minutes.\n\nAs Martha stood by helplessly watching her uninsured barn succumb to the flames, her thoughts turned to her animals. Fortunately, her three cows had been left to graze in the pasture that evening. However, Martha was suddenly struck with a pang of dread; her beloved pet pig, a 75-pound crippled sow she had rescued from certain euthanasia, was locked inside a stall within the barn.\n\nWhen Martha expressed her sadness over the loss of her pig to Lucy, Lucy reassured her that the animal was safe, having spotted the sow on her way to inform Martha about the fire. As Martha surveyed the field, she was astonished to find her pig peacefully sleeping in the grass, unharmed. Puzzled by how the sow, with its very limited mobility, could have possibly escaped on its own, Martha simply accepted it as a fortunate miracle.\n\nThe following morning, however, as the shock of the previous night began to fade, Martha’s thoughts again returned to the pig. A chilling scenario suddenly ran through her mind; perhaps a “tramp” had sought shelter in the barn and inadvertently released the sow, before falling victim to the fire themself. Martha began sifting through the barn's remains, searching for anything to suggest someone had been inside. She unearthed an umbrella frame, alarm clock, a pair of scissors, a tin can filled with metal buttons, tweezers, and several charred pieces of clothing; none of which she recognized as hers. \n\nMartha traveled to the nearby English, Indiana police station to present the items she had recovered from her barn to Sheriff Levell. Levell accompanied Martha back to her property and upon his own investigation, unearthed a pair of earrings and the remnants of a woman's handbag in the debris where the barn once stood. \n\nMeanwhile, sixty miles away, just outside of Rockport, Indiana, police were grappling with a perplexing mystery of their own. That afternoon, local farmer John Spaetti had stumbled upon a patch of freshly disturbed earth in one of his expansive fields. As he inspected the area closely, he noticed a distinctive rake mark pattern on the loose dirt. John immediately suspected that loot from a recent bank robbery might be concealed beneath the disturbed soil. \n\nOn the night of October 18th, an unknown number of individuals forcibly entered Richland, Indiana’s Lake State Bank, located just under 15 miles from John’s farm, with the intent of plundering the bank's safety deposit boxes. The perpetrators successfully absconded with an undisclosed quantity of jewelry and cash from the boxes. The robbery remained undetected until the following morning, as the thieves had also stolen the bank's alarm system.\n\nAfter notifying the Sheriff of his discovery, John enlisted the help of a neighbor and the pair began to dig. However, when they unearthed a woman's shoe instead of the expected stolen money, they ceased their efforts and awaited the arrival of police. With law enforcement present, the digging resumed. Approximately one and a half feet below the surface, the men made a horrifying discovery; the bodies of two individuals, a man and a young woman, interred in the dirt.\n\nThe body of the man, who appeared to be “middle-aged,” was discovered positioned atop the younger woman's body. He was fully clothed, dressed in a gray business suit over an olive green dress shirt. The young woman was described as a “young teen.” She had brunette hair, weighed 110 lbs, and was wearing a sweater and matching skirt. Hidden within the young woman's bra, police found $3,200 in cash tightly wrapped in an envelope. No identification was found on either individual, however a matchbook from the “121 Club,” a betting parlor for horse racing located in Jeffersonville, Indiana, was recovered from the man’s pocket. \n\nAn autopsy revealed that the man had been subjected to a brutal beating before being fatally shot; twice in the abdomen, once in the head, and once in the heart, with a .38 caliber pistol. The woman's injuries were much more severe. Her face had been horrifically disfigured with an instrument “resembling a screwdriver.” A rope was found so tightly secured around her neck, it had “cut deeply into her flesh”, and her body bore numerous bruises, cuts, and defensive wounds. She too had been executed with two gunshot wounds to the head, one of which went through her right eye, with a .38 caliber pistol.\n\nAfter taking their fingerprints, it wasn’t long before the pair were identified as 34-year-old George Tyson, a father and husband from East St. Louis, Illinois, and 18-year-old Ethel Mae Sparks, a waitress from the same area. As fate would have it, George was a wanted man. \n\nThree months prior, on July 16th, 27-year-old Union ironworker Joe Callahan was seated in his vehicle outside “Dolly's Tavern,” a local dive bar in Madison, Illinois. He was accompanied by several friends, including 22-year-old Kathryn Morrison, a waitress at the establishment. \n\nAccording to Kathryn and the other witnesses present, two men approached the vehicle and engaged in a heated argument with Joe. After one assailant struck Joe in the head, he exited the vehicle and a brief physical altercation ensued. When Joe returned to the car, one of the assailants produced a firearm and shot Joe before fleeing the scene. Despite sustaining severe injuries, Joe miraculously survived. \n\nBoth Joe and Kathryn quickly identified the gunman as George Tyson, a former Union ironworker who was known to frequent the bar where Kathryn worked. George, however, managed to evade capture, and remained at large. \n\nOne week later, however, a tragic turn of events unfolded within the same establishment. As Kathryn sat at one of the tavern’s booths that evening, an unknown individual silently cut the screen of a nearby window and inserted the barrel of a 12-gauge shotgun. A single shot rang out, striking Kathryn and fatally wounding her. George was immediately identified as a prime suspect in the shooting. \n\nDuring witness interviews, detectives learned Kathryn was seated at the booth with another woman; Ethel Sparks, the rumored mistress of George Tyson. Ethel was subsequently interviewed but denied being present at the time of the shooting, or having a relationship with George. She was released, however one week later, Ethel left town. \n\nFollowing the identification of George and Ethel, detectives focused their investigation on the matchbook discovered in George's pocket. This led them to Jeffersonville, Indiana, where authorities uncovered evidence that George and Ethel had rented an apartment together under the assumed names of Mr. and Mrs. George Harris.\n\nAccording to local residents, the couple were reclusive, spending most of the day indoors and venturing out only at night. Neighbors told detectives they had last spotted the pair on October 27th, when they were seen entering a vehicle with three unidentified men in “fancy suits.” They reported that the five individuals departed in the morning, returned briefly that evening, and were observed leaving the residence again with some of their belongings in hand.\n\nUpon learning of the discovery of the pair’s bodies, Sheriff Levell contacted the investigating department to inform them about the items recovered from Martha's barn. Law enforcement presented these items to several employees of local Jeffersonville establishments as well as neighbors of George and Ethels. Multiple individuals positively identified the earrings as belonging to Ethel. Furthermore, Martha was presented with the piece of rope found around Ethel's neck, and confirmed it matched the type of rope she stored in her barn. \n\nPolice now possessed enough information for a plausible timeline of events; They theorized that on October 27th, the three men in suits forcibly abducted the couple from their Jeffersonville apartment and transported them to Sulphur. At this location, the pair were tortured and ultimately murdered within Martha's barn. The assailants then set fire to the barn in an attempt to destroy evidence. George and Ethel’s bodies were then transported to Rockport, and buried on John's farm.\n\nAs the investigation progressed, Allecy Tyson, George's wife, came forward to claim the remains of her deceased husband and lay claim to the money discovered in Ethel's bra. Allecy asserted that these funds originated from the recent sale of the couple's house. However, it was later revealed that the house, described as \"shabby and rundown,\" had sold for a mere $600 due to a substantial mortgage. During her interview with law enforcement, Allecy stated that she had last seen George the day prior to the shooting of Joe Callahan. She also denied any knowledge of his relationship with Ethel. Following the police interview, she departed town with their eight-year-old son. \n\nEthel Sparks' parents traveled from their Arkansas hometown of Stuttgart, to claim the remains of their deceased daughter. They explained that Ethel had left a year prior in search of employment opportunities in East St. Louis, however, they hadn’t spoken to her in several months. They claimed to have no knowledge of George and Ethel’s alleged relationship. The Sparks family also asserted their claim to the recovered funds, suggesting the money was most likely their daughter's life savings.\n\nFurther investigation into Ethel's life revealed her association with several known criminal figures. Upon moving to East St. Louis, she secured employment as a waitress at an illicit casino operated by the wife of gangster Art Newman. During her tenure there, Ethel witnessed a shooting involving a man named Patrick Hogan, a prominent figure in the gambling underworld. Bizarrely, Patrick’s body was never found, and he was never seen again. Law enforcement also discovered that following the shooting, Ethel had taken residence in an apartment situated above the \"Paddock Bar,\" owned by notorious gang boss, Frank \"Buster\" Wortman. Unfortunately, any potential connection between Ethel's relationships with these criminal figures and her subsequent murder, could not be proven. \n\nEthel Mae Sparks was laid to rest in Stuttgart, Arkansas’ Lone Tree Cemetery. George Rosby Tyson was buried in Williamson Cemetery located in Montgomery County, Georgia. \n\nRegrettably, despite an investigation spanning several years, the case was never solved. \n\n**Sources**\n\n[Clippings/Case Map](https://imgur.com/a/pEHJLWB)\n\n[Find a Grave: Ethel](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/142701871/ethel_mae-sparks)\n\n[Find a Grave: George](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/29947291/george-rosby-tyson)\n\n[Frank “Buster” Wortman wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_Wortman)",

The 67-year-old was facing extradition to Germany to face prosecution on a murder charge. Dempsey had been stationed in Ludwigsburg from 1977 to 1978 with the U.S. Army. He was 20 years old on June 11, 1978 when Bärbel Gansau, 35, was found naked and dead in her apartment in Ludwigsburg, Germany. She had been stabbed 37 times. Her apartment had been ransacked as well. Her purse was emptied, and various clothing and objects had been taken.\n\nThe case remained unsolved. It was reopened in 2020 due to advances in technology.\n\nAn FBI agent took a print from the window frame and put it into the American database, where a match for Dempsey was found. Dempsey’s DNA was also matched to a semen sample from Gansau’s bedsheets. He was charged and arrested in February 2024. Germany sought to extradite him from the U.S. to prosecute him. As the case unfolded, the evidence against him seemed weaker. Dempsey’s DNA was not the only sample found at the scene.\n\nIn January, a federal court judge released Dempsey from custody after 11 months due to insufficient evidence. On Friday, Judge Miroslav Lovric refused the extradition of Dempsey and dismissed the case against him, Federal Public Defender Lisa Peebles told [Syracuse.com](http://Syracuse.com) | The Post Standard. Lovric said German authorities should have continued the investigation after they found a match to Dempsey’s DNA to ensure they had the correct suspect.\n\nBlood and saliva found on the woman’s underwear did not match his DNA, Peebles said. There was also DNA found under her fingernails, indicating a struggle with her attacker, that did not match Dempsey. Other unmatched fingerprint traces were also found, according to documents filed in federal court. In a letter to the judge requesting Dempsey’s release, Peebles wrote that information found in the 1978 German investigative files \"undermine any suggestion that \\[Dempsey\\] was responsible for the murder.\"\n\nNeighbors of Gansau’s told police at the time that she often had men over to her apartment, many of whom were American soldiers like Dempsey. DNA from other men was found under her fingernails, on her underwear and a bloody pillow case, Peebles wrote. Peebles wrote Dempsey’s fingerprint and semen sample only prove that he was inside Gansau’s apartment at an unknown time. No witnesses placed him near Gansau the night of her murder, she wrote. He also lived on a secure Army base and would likely have been seen covered in the victim’s blood returning that night, Peebles wrote.\n\nUltimately, the judge agreed. He said it was far more probable that the murder was committed by the unknown male whose DNA is under her nails and on her underwear.\n\n“This case was a rush to judgment by the German authorities,” Lovric said in court. “Germany essentially stopped investigating.”",

      "text": "I’m drawn to a particular kind of unsolved mystery, not just violent or unexplained, but stories that feel *genuinely eerie*, like something out of a gothic novel. Cases where the details are grounded in reality, yet there's an unmistakable air of something uncanny, even spectral.\n\nHere are a few that haunt me:\n\n* [Hinterkaifeck Murders (Germany, 1922)](https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/502044/chilling-story-hinterkaifeck-killings-germanys-most-famous-unsolved-crime)**:** A family of six was brutally murdered on their remote farm. In the days leading up to it, they reported hearing footsteps in the attic and seeing footprints in the snow that led to the house but never away. The killer was never identified. \n* [Villisca Axe Murders (Iowa, 1912)](https://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/a-village-of-murderers-110161492/)**:** Eight people, including six children, were slaughtered in their sleep. The killer hung sheets over mirrors, covered the victims’ faces, and lingered in the house afterwards. It was a scene that felt ritualistic and deeply unsettling.\n* [Axeman of New Orleans (1918–1919):](https://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/axeman-new-orleans-preyed-italian-immigrants-180968037/) A serial attacker who used axes found at the victims' homes. His victims spanned race and background, and he famously claimed in a letter that he would spare anyone playing jazz. It feels like something out of Southern Gothic folklore.\n* [Room 1046 (Kansas City, 1935)](https://allthatsinteresting.com/room-1046)**:** A man using the alias Roland T. Owen checked into a hotel with strange behaviour and was later found mortally wounded. Cryptic phone calls, shadowy visitors, and total confusion about his identity make it feel like a locked-room ghost story.\n* [Yuba County Five (California, 1978)](https://www.abc10.com/article/news/local/families-plead-for-answers-mystery-yuba-county-five/103-6322d75e-a8dc-4153-91b4-72f5bb5dea09)**:** Five men disappeared in a remote area. Their car was found in good condition, but their bodies were discovered miles away under bizarre circumstances. One was never found. The case feels dreamlike and inexplicably wrong.\n* [Sodder Children Disappearance (West Virginia, 1945):](https://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/what-happened-sodder-children-siblings-who-went-up-in-smoke-west-virginia-house-fire-172429802/) Five children vanished after a house fire. No remains were ever found, and strange sightings were reported for years. The family believed they were kidnapped. The tragedy hangs heavy with unanswered questions.\n\nSo, what are the unsolved cases that give *you* that ghost story feeling? Not paranormal in a conspiracy-theory way, but stories so eerie they feel like they belong in another world. I’d love to hear what haunts you.",

      "text": "Very rarely do I ever even consider this as a possibility when it comes to the answer for a missing persons case. The only case I’ve personally leaned towards it being an intentional disappearance is the case of Ray Gricar. And I believe specifically this very well could be a witness protection situation. \n\nYou would think that if a district attorney goes missing, the feds would relentlessly pursue for answers and the whereabouts of said district attorney. But yet despite his status, to me at least, it seemed like investigators just sort of accepted he was missing and probably dead rather quickly. It’s also a case that seems like it would receive a national spotlight, so I’d be curious to know if this made big news back in 2005. Because if it didn’t, that would lead me to believe it was intentionally suppressed to some level, as you wouldn’t want his picture circulated nation-wide (IF this is a witness protection situation). \n\nAlso, when police found his abandoned vehicle, and brought in sniffer dogs, police noted that the behavior of the sniffer dogs indicated he possibly could have gotten into another vehicle. So in my opinion, it seems like this was a designated pick-up spot. And you have Gricar intentionally destroying his work laptop. They also discovered that shortly before his disappearance, phrases such as “how to wreck a hard drive”, “how to fry a hard drive”, and “water damage to a notebook computer” were found to have been searched on the family computer. \n\nWhether this was a case of witness protection, or Gricar disappearing on his own accord, this is really the only case where I heavily lean towards the answer being; the disappearance was intentional.\n\nBut do any of you have any other cases where you suspect the missing person voluntarily left? \n\nhttps://www.oxygen.com/dateline-secrets-uncovered/crime-news/ray-gricar-found-update-disappearance-brother-missing?amp",

If you have any international cases you would like me to cover, comment[ on my account's pinned suggestion thread](https://www.reddit.com/user/moondog151/comments/1g7vgdl/for_my_international_readers_or_anyone_interested/).)\n\nOn January 21, 2008, a security guard went to [The Yuanlin Finance and Economics Building](https://imgur.com/3q09Z9x) in Yuanlin, located in Taiwan's Changhua County, to begin his shift. It didn't take long for him to notice a pair of women's shoes had been hazardly discarded outside the stairwell on the first floor. He then entered the elevator and saw [a red coat and a pair of shoes left on the floor](https://imgur.com/QUiEZov).\n\nHe spoke to the building's manager, who still had a peculiar incident on his mind that he immediately recalled when informed of this. On the night of January 20, he was still awake when a woman rushed through the doors with a young girl in tow. While primarily an office space, the 16-storey building had numerous residential units, but he didn't recognize either of the two as being one of the residents.\n\nConsidering this, along with the fact that the officers were nearby, he stopped the woman to ask what her business was. In a hurry, she abruptly pushed past him and said they were simply there to meet a friend. They rushed straight for the elevator once he was out of their way.\n\nHe had no recollection of them leaving, and hearing the security guard discover their clothing did little to quell his fears. So, the manager and the security guard decided to review the building's CCTV footage.\n\nOnce [the two entered the elevator](https://imgur.com/lma2VOT), she pressed the button to take them to the 11th floor, the last floor of the building. [She then slid off her red coat and neatly placed it on the elevator floor. She then removed what was likely her daughter's coat as well. She then slipped off her shoes and hurriedly left once the elevator door opened](https://imgur.com/0k7tiNE).\n\nThe hallway cameras then captured the [two running down the hallway and toward the stairwell](https://imgur.com/0jdOiyH), which was the only way to access the building's rooftop. That was the last time they came into view of the building's cameras.\n\nTheir behaviour, heading to the roof and the fact that they removed their shoes, led him to fear the worst. In many East Asian countries, people often take their shoes off before committing suicide to avoid tracking dirt into the afterlife. And suicide is exactly what the building manager feared the two might have done.\n\n[The police were called and shown the footage themselves](https://imgur.com/O8PLOKg). Based on what they saw, they agreed with the manager. Officers walked around the building's exterior, but they couldn't find the bodies or even a trace of them. The balconies for the apartments and offices did not extend further beyond the roof, which made it impossible for the two to be caught on something. That meant if their bodies weren't on the ground, then they didn't jump.\n\nNow, thinking they took their lives some other way, [the police made their way to the rooftop and still found nothing](https://imgur.com/tCMhHzm). So they must've left, one would think, but that seemed to be covered as well. Literally, every single exit and entrance to the entire building was covered by a CCTV camera pointed directly at it. And none of the footage from any of them showed the two leaving. Just to be safe, the police reviewed the footage from adjacent stores and residents, but the two didn't show up on any of them.\n\nThey also couldn't have jumped across to an adjacent building as the two neighbouring buildings were less than a quarter of its height so any such jump would've been fatal.\n\nEven though every exit was covered by the cameras, the police decided to double-check them anyway. The parking garage showed that none of the cars moved from when they entered to the time the police arrived so somehow being stowed away in someone else's car was ruled out.\n\nThe final potential exit was the back door on the second level of the basement. Said door did lead into an adjacent building but it was a locked, unused security door, covered in dust and with no signs of being disturbed. Just to be thorough the police had it opened anyway. The door led to an abandoned billiard hall but there were no signs of anyone occupying it recently.\n\nThe basement also had a few manhole covers but they were too heavy to be lifted alone.\n\nThe only logical explanation remaining was that they never left. The police began their search on the rooftop. [They searched every corner of the entire rooftop](https://imgur.com/oXYaTAC) several times, [opened the transformer box](https://imgur.com/2UZJ6Bs), the fire ventilation vents, the communications tower, [the water tank](https://imgur.com/Sm5vq2S) and the pipes.\n\nNext, the police worked their way through the apartment and even went [door to door ](https://imgur.com/cUHL4C0)so they could [question all the residents](https://imgur.com/yBl6RQL). Unfortunately, none of them had anything noteworthy to say. In fact, they were all asleep, so they didn't even hear the two, let alone see any of them. Without a search warrant or anything pointing to a crime, the police couldn't enter any of the apartments, either.\n\nWith that, the police were left with a puzzling mystery. Rather than a suicide, it seemed to be a missing persons case, one where the disappearance seemed impossible, and worst of all. They didn't even know the names of the two people they were looking for.\n\nSo the police [had the local news broadcast the CCTV footage](https://imgur.com/AOdm67r) in hopes someone would recognize the woman and child and come forward.\n\nOn January 28, a security guard who worked at the building for a long time noticed an out-of-place moped in the building's parking lot. Since he worked there for many years, he was familiar with which cars the residents drove and how they parked. The scooter was parked right at the entrance which was very inconvenient as most of the residents were elderly. The moped had also been there unattended for several days and the keys were still inside.\n\nAnnoyed by the parking job that he saw as \"inconsiderate\" he called the police. Still remembering the bizarre disappearance from only two days prior, the police were quick to arrive. There, officers ran the moped's license plate which was registered to a 37-year-old woman named Liu Huijun. As it turned out, She was reported missing to the police in her hometown of Shetou over 8 kilometres away. The report was filed on January 20.\n\nAs if the police needed any further confirmation, Huijun's husband saw the news reporting on the incident and came forward to identify the woman in the footage [as his wife and the child their 4-year-old daughter](https://imgur.com/9x0lKOI).\n\nHuijun's family was not a well-off one. After Huijun graduated from high school junior high, she went to Taipei to study hairdressing. Huijun was described as beautiful and had many suitors, but her mother decided to order her back to their home village as she had arranged a marriage [with her daughter and a well-off land owner](https://imgur.com/hzeNUZB). Together, the couple had three children.\n\nConsidering it was sudden and arranged, her unexpected marriage was not a happy one. It wasn't particularly stable either. While Huijun had to give up her dream and studies to stay at home and care for the kids, her husband did nothing. He'd always leave under the guise of work only to instead go out drinking and rack up a debt. He was also abusive toward her and the two even got divorced once.\n\nBeing in the rural countryside, their home village was highly conservative in nature and thus would look down on a divorce. The marriage was also arranged by Huijun's mother so both sides felt pressured to remarry. Her husband even swore to stop drinking. Ultimately, the two did remarry and had their last child together, the one who went missing along with her mother.\n\nThat being said, nothing wound up changing and her husband's drinking problem grew even worse, he drank heavily every night since their second marriage. All of it began taking a toll and many said that Huijun's mental state started to deteriorate rapidly.\n\nOn January 19, 2008, the two had another argument. The next day on January 20, the argument resumed until around 2:00-3:00 p.m. when Huijun took their youngest daughter, bordered the moped and drove off. It would only take three minutes for Huijun to drive to her mother's house and that's where she often went when things got bad so she could vent to her mother. He assumed that she'd calm down and return shortly.\n\nHowever, they never did. So he went to his mother-in-law's house and was told that Huijun never showed up. He then went around the village visiting all of her friend's houses and was also told that she never arrived. He then tried calling her but her cellphone was turned off. After getting no response from her, he made a quick trip to his local police station to report her and their daughter missing.\n\nThe local police issued a missing person notice and conducted a small local search consisting of visiting her friend's and relatives' homes to look for her. The only lead they had came from Huijun's eldest daughter. She told the police that Huijun told her and her mother that she was going to a friend's house for a few days and would be back soon.\n\nThe police had assumed she must've gotten lost as opposed to driving 8 kilometres away to Yuanlin. Their initial investigation amounted to nothing.\n\nIdentifying the two only made the case stranger. There was little evidence Huijun had ever been to Yuanlin and even so, she had no history with the building. She didn't own an apartment there, no office space and nobody she knew worked or lived there. It seemed completely random that she'd find herself there. And yet she clearly singled it out.\n\nIn the ensuing days, weeks, months and even years, the police would occasionally return to question the residents further and search the building once more. But they couldn't justify doing so forever, eventually, the police had to accept that the case was likely never to be unsolved.\n\nIn 2013, the police returned once more. The Elisa Lam case was a worldwide news story and when the news hit Taiwan, many found themselves reminded of Huijun's disappearance. Many local newspapers even took to calling it \"Taiwan's Elisa Lam\" Among those taken in by the story were the very officers who investigated Huijun's disappearance.\n\nFeeling inspired by how Elisa's body was found, the police went to the building to unlock and search the building's water tank for a second time in case they missed her. They had hoped that even after 5 years, their remains might still be present. None of the residents found themselves complaining about the water though so it wasn't too surprising when the police failed to find their remains.\n\nIn fact, no one in the ensuing 5 years complained about any foul odours that could potentially be attributed to the two bodies decomposing.\n\nThey decided to carry on though, the police searched all the building's water pipes as well but didn't find any trace of the two.\n\nSince the investigation was already reopened. The police decided to check Huijun's financial records, bank cards, health insurance cards and credit cards to see if any of them had been used. Also, since her daughter would've been 9 by 2013, they tried to see if any new students with her information had been enrolled in any schools. When the police were finally done chasing after all those records, the answer would end up being no. None of Huijun's cards saw any use since her disappearance.\n\nThe last time the police reopened the investigation was in 2021. The police wanted to compare the DNA of Huijun's relatives to an unidentified corpse that had been found. The only information about the body in question was that the DNA ruled out it being Huijun.\n\nThe four prevailing theories now go as follows.\n\n1). Huijun did in fact know one of the residents. Perhaps she was having an affair. She would've gone into his apartment, something would've occurred behind closed doors which would have resulted in her and her daughter being murdered. The hypothetical killer then would've likely dismembered their remains over the course of many days and little by little removed them from the building to avoid suspicion.\n\n(I've done a write-up on Rurika Tojo. It would likely go down similar to that case)\n\nThis theory in particular is deemed as unlikely since nobody lived on the 11th floor where she was last seen and Huijun was considered an introvert who never went out to meet people. That also wouldn't explain her behaviour nor answer why she brought her daughter with her.\n\n2): The two did meet their end within the building and somehow their bodies have never been found. Perhaps they are in a mummified and preserved state to explain why the residents weren't overcome by the foul stench of decomposition. This incident did happen during winter after all.\n\nThis theory also has it's problems since the scent from the mummification process would likely still be noticed since some decomposition is required.\n\n3): She somehow did find a way out of the building and ran away with her daughter to start a new life away from her abusive husband. Her actions at the building were simply to mislead everyone into thinking she took her own life. While plausible, it wouldn't explain why she didn't try escaping with her eldest daughter too.\n\n4): She somehow did find a way out of the building but only to commit suicide and take her daughter with her somewhere else. Her actions in the building itself were simply to confuse the police and make sure nobody would know where to actually look for their bodies.\n\nIn late December 2023, Huijun's now 50-year-old husband was repairing a tower on the roof of his home when he suddenly slipped and fell. The impact on the ground caused severe head trauma and resulted in his death. His death led to the case being discussed in the Taiwanese media once more and there were talks of the investigation being reopened for another time. Sadly, nothing seems to have come from this.\n\nNot long after his death, a court declared Huijun and her daughter dead in absentia.\n\n***Sources***\n\n[***https://archive.ph/x3u0s***](https://archive.ph/x3u0s)\n\n[***https://archive.ph/Cd83e***](https://archive.ph/Cd83e)\n\n[***https://archive.ph/ruNRW***](https://archive.ph/ruNRW)\n\n[***https://archive.ph/3WNtY***](https://archive.ph/3WNtY)\n\n[***https://archive.ph/TdsiG***](https://archive.ph/TdsiG)\n\n[***https://archive.ph/NHqaR***](https://archive.ph/NHqaR)\n\n[***https://archive.ph/PMKcf***](https://archive.ph/PMKcf)\n\n[***https://archive.ph/uj3PF***](https://archive.ph/uj3PF)\n\n[***https://archive.ph/wpnQ3***](https://archive.ph/wpnQ3)\n\n[***https://archive.ph/NoG6v***](https://archive.ph/NoG6v)\n\n[***https://archive.ph/t1kLj***](https://archive.ph/t1kLj)\n\n[***https://archive.ph/IVjZn***](https://archive.ph/IVjZn)\n\n[***https://archive.ph/K0D0L***](https://archive.ph/K0D0L)\n\n[***https://archive.ph/bGDqO***](https://archive.ph/bGDqO)\n\n[***https://archive.ph/Pbh3x***](https://archive.ph/Pbh3x)",

      "text": "**Discovery**\n\nOn Friday September 11th 1987 at about 10 am, three men fishing in the Lewis River in Woodland, Washington made a gruesome and unexpected discovery.  Floating in some debris and stuck near some rocks, they discovered the headless and legless torso of a young woman. The torso was found in a shallow part of the Lewis River near the S. Pekin Road boat launch, about ¾ of a mile south of the Lewis River Bridge, where Interstate 5 crosses the river. Woodland is a small town which in 1987 had fewer than 2500 residents. It is located about 30 miles north of downtown Portland, Oregon. The torso was a shocking discovery for the small town and police were notified promptly. By Saturday September, 12th, scuba divers from nearby Portland, Oregon were brought in to find additional body parts in the river but none were found. A sniffer dog likewise, found no other remains. Officers at the scene reported to the local paper that the torso belonged to a “dark skinned, unidentified, homicide victim” who was “possibly Hispanic.” That same day the body was transported to an Oregon medical examiner for autopsy.  \n\nThe medical examiner determined that the woman had brown skin and was about 19 to 25 years old, probably closer to 19. He believed she had been in the water for either several days or up to a week. In life she would have been about 5 ft 3 in tall and weighed about 110 lbs. She had no scars or tattoos.  She was also partially clothed. In his report he noted that the woman was most likely Hispanic but could have been Native American, or even a light skinned black woman but without a head and in the infancy of DNA testing, her race could not be determined for sure. Her cause of death was unknown but the medical examiner ruled the death a homicide. \n\nOn Sunday the 13th, a transient man in Portland, Oregon discovered the upper portion of a thigh floating near the east bank of the Willamette river, about 30 miles south of the torso, near downtown Portland. Almost immediately, the medical examiner connected the thigh to the Woodland victim as both body parts showed signs of dismemberment and had the same dark skin tone. On the 14th, the victim’s other leg was found nearby. Interestingly, both legs were found between the Steele and Burnside Bridges, two roadways which abut Interstate 5. On Wednesday the 16th of September, investigators in Cowlitz county announced that the autopsy had revealed that the murder victim was two months pregnant and had given birth at least once in the past.  They also announced that scuba divers in Portland had not turned up any additional remains and the woman’s head remained missing. Strangely, the body did not match any local missing persons’ cases and the mystery deepened.\n\nDespite Woodland’s low crime rate, not one but two serial killers were active in the general area. In the absence of other leads law enforcement contacted both the Molalla Forest task force in Clackamas County, Oregon and the Green River task force in King County, Washington as both unknown killers were leaving their victims, all young women, in the greater Portland area. Unfortunately neither task force had any leads on the woman's possible identity and investigators were back to square one. \n\nOn September 24th, 1987 ten days later after the discovery of the second leg, a fisherman standing on the bank of the Cowlitz River just south of the Tennant Way Bridge in Kelso, Washington noticed what he thought was a stuffed animal. On closer examination it was actually the badly decomposed body of a baby girl. She was found floating near a log less than half of a mile from where the Cowlitz flows into the Columbia River. The fisherman promptly hopped into his truck and drove to the police station. After arriving at the scene police believed it was possible that the child had floated downstream, but the fisherman who found the body reported that debris was sometimes pushed upstream by the tidal Columbia, a view the police eventually adopted. Searches in the area uncovered no additional evidence. A local medical examiner determined the girl to be 18 to 24 months old. She was 31 inches long and weighed 25 pounds. She was found wearing a cotton diaper with pink safety pins on the outside, plastic pants, a black or red shirt with black, blue, and white stripes, and pink terry cloth shorts. She was badly decomposed and the autopsy revealed that she had been in the water for about three to four weeks. Although one report states she had been in the water three weeks to three months.  She had died from one massive blow to the head, her tiny skull fractured behind her right ear. Like the woman found 10 days earlier, this victim was also determined to be Hispanic or possibly of Native American descent. The baby was found only 19 miles away from the woman's torso. Like other police departments before them, Kelso police had no luck identifying the child. In 1987 Woodland, Kelso, and Portland were all cities with a majority white populations. This fact made the discovery of the bodies even puzzling. Due to the similarities between the woman and child and their discovery only 10 days apart, police surmised that the two cases were related and believed it was possible that they were mother and daughter. Sergeant Wayne Nelson of the Kelso Police department stated “It would be very unusual to have two Hispanic murder victims found in Cowlitz County Waters”... “that are not linked.” He also called both unidentified decedents “victims of violent homicides.” Fingerprints were taken for the child and the woman but no matches were found and samples were sent to a laboratory in Texas, but the samples were delicate so the lab was unable to confirm that the two bodies were related. Detective Thompson of the Kelso police asked for the public's help and pleaded to the local newspaper “we need the public to tell us about women and children not seen in the last four to six weeks.” Despite dozens of leads since the woman was found, none helped the police get any closer to identifying the woman and child. \n\nA bulletin was issued to police in all west coast states to check for files of missing mothers and toddler daughters, but the search came up empty. October 9th a man fishing in the Cowlitz River discovered a blood-stained bed sheet which he quickly turned over to the police. The sheet contained blood, human hair, and animal hair and was submitted for testing to see if it could be matched to the unidentified woman and toddler who had been found in September. A week later it was determined that the blood did not belong to a human but rather a deer. At this point no new evidence had surfaced and within several months publicity had fizzled. All in all two victims were found in three separate rivers which don’t flow into each other. However, the locations of the remains were all close to Interstate 5 a freeway which travels north-south through Washington, Oregon, and California.\n\nThroughout the late 1980s and 1990s sporadic efforts were made to identify the pair including missing posters translated and sent to Mexico. Police hoped that if the woman was an immigrant perhaps family in her country of origin were missing her. Nearby Indian reservations were also sent posters but again nothing panned out. Articles in the nearest Spanish language newspaper, a periodical in Sunnyside, Washington, likewise produced no leads. In the early 2000s a memo was sent to the RCMP. Although DNA technology was much better than it had been in the 1980s, local police lacked the funding to exhume and DNA test the remains, especially since the samples they had were degraded from initial testing. \n\nIn 2003 the Seattle Post Intelligencer newspaper ran a story on the unidentified remains from Washington state. Included was a retouched photo and a police sketch of the baby. The article also mentioned the pregnant woman recovered from the Lewis River in 1987, revealing that the woman was wearing a sheer pink two piece teddy nightgown made of nylon, blue-green Hanes brand underwear, two silver bangle bracelets, and had toenails and fingernails which were neatly painted red. It was this article that allowed two separate families in three separate countries to begin to unravel a decades long mystery. \n\n**Identification**\n\nTo fully understand this story and its context it is necessary to go back to 1874. After a period of turmoil, both internal and external, the newly united Kingdom of Fiji was annexed by the British empire. Fiji was ripe for exploitation. Not only did the island have sandalwood trees, but the climate was right for both cotton and sugar cultivation. But with cultivation comes the need for labor and British India filled that void. Beginning in 1879 Indian indentured servants began arriving in Fiji. Over the next thirty seven years, 61,000 indentured Indian servants were transported to the islands that make up Fiji. After ten years of service, they were free to move back to India on the empire’s dime or stay in Fiji as “free immigrants.” The vast majority chose to stay. The workers were mostly from rural villages but came from all over the sub continent which resulted in a new language, culture, and identity slowly developing. The ethnic group came to be known as Indo-Fijian. By about the year 1900 skilled workers from India began to migrate to Fiji by their own free will, growing the Indian population yet again. In 1920 indentured servanthood was officially outlawed but by 1940, the Indian population of Fiji had eclipsed that of the native Fijians, a trend which continued until nearly 1990. Even today Indo- Fijians make up a large percent of the people living in Fiji. \n\nRaj Mati was one of a set of twins born to an Indo Fijian family near Bavevu, in central Viti Levu, Fiji in 1963. Sadly Raj’s twin died at six weeks old but Raj survived and became the youngest of her eleven siblings. The family lived in a metal shack near their 10 acre farm. Known to her family members as “Lalli'' which means little daughter in Hindi, Raj was a companion to her mother and best friends with her brother Biren Prasad. Even though her father died when she was a young child and the family lived in poverty, everyone remembered the family as happy and well adjusted. When Raj was a teenager she attended a newly constructed high school on Viti Levu. Here she had the opportunity to learn to read and write as well as speak English. In accordance with tradition, in 1983, a family friend of some of Raj’s brothers, Ashok Kumar Narain, asked to marry Raj. Ashok was from the same village as Raj and was friends with some of her brothers before he had the opportunity to move to America where he worked as a tailor. Seeing this as a positive opportunity for their sister, Raj’s family accepted the engagement. Both Biren and Jai, another of Raj’s brothers, remembered Ashok as a “normal guy” and considered the pair a good match. The timeline is not perfectly clear but it appears that Ashok had returned to his native Fiji after living in America for a while and planned on returning to America after his marriage to Raj. A huge ceremony was arranged on the family’s farm and Raj was married to Ashok.   Within 24 hours Jai Prasad, Raj’s brother, was married to his wife, Caroline. Nine months later sometime in 1984, Raj and Ashok prepared to leave Fiji and begin their new life in America. She was 21 years old, Ashok was about 27. The family packed their things and boarded a bus to Fiji’s international airport to see the couple off. It was a five hour bus ride. At the airport, Raj cried knowing that she may never see her family again. Raj was not only the first of her family to immigrate to a new country, she was the first to ever leave the island of Viti Levu. Her brother Biren encouraged Ashok to comfort a crying Raj but to no avail. \n\nRaj and Ashok boarded their plane and moved to Eugene, Oregon, a town more than 110 miles south of Portland, Oregon. (It looks like Ashok had also lived in King Co. Washington at some point in time.) Raj kept in touch with her brothers via letters and sent audio tapes to her illiterate mother. Phone calls were expensive so letters were the best way to stay in touch. According to Jai, Raj sounded lonely. The couple rented a cheap apartment in downtown Eugene, Oregon. **Picture here**.

Raj was troubled by the cold weather and bought her first jacket, a gray puffy parka. She sounded lonely, Jai reflected years later. Raj talked about watching television and tending to her husband but seemed to do little else. In another letter she thanked her brother Biren for sending her money so she and Ashok could buy a car, a 1980 Toyota Tercel. She never revealed any problems in her marriage. On June 29th, 1986 Raj gave birth to her first child, a daughter named Kamnee. She and her family were overjoyed and treasured the small wallet sized photo of the girl which was tucked into Raj’s letter. But sometime in 1987, Raj’s letters stopped. At first the family was not concerned, thinking that motherhood was probably taking up much of her time and energy but eventually they began to worry. \n\nBy 2004, Jai had not heard from his sister in over 15 years. Now living in Sydney, Australia Jai asked his children to help him use the internet so he could search for his sister, but he found no trace of Raj or his niece, Kamnee. He called the FBI to report her missing but the agency suggested he hire a private investigator instead. This may have been because Jai reported that his sister lived in Eugene, California rather than Eugene, Oregon. Either way this did not deter Jai and he continued on his quest. In 2003, the Seattle Post Intelligencer released an article on the unidentified persons in Washington state. Included was a sketch of a baby found in a river in 1987. From the moment he first saw the sketch in April, 2006 Jai Prasad knew it was Kamnee. Furthermore, his woman’s description caught his eye, he knew that silver bangles and painted nails were both something that Raj would have worn. Jai called Kelso police department to report his suspicion. Police were skeptical of the lead as other tips about the child’s identity had led nowhere. Unable to take no as an answer Jai Prasad flew to the United States to give his DNA to investigators. \n\nIn April, 2006 the same month Jai found the article about Baby Jane Doe, a Robert Narayan of Woodland, California called the Kelso police with a similar story. After seeing the 2003 article he called the Kelso police to report that he believed the baby found in the river was his niece, Kamnee. Moreover, Robert reported that he had not seen or heard from his brother Ashok since 1988. He could find no trace of his sister in law or his niece either. He, like Jai, had been looking for his brother for years.\n\nIn September, 2006 the body of the two Jane Does found in the fall of 1987 were exhumed and compared to Jai’s DNA. A small group of mourners joined Jai by the graveside and held a small memorial. Jai didn’t need DNA, he knew the bones belonged to his sister and niece. He provided flowers and burial clothes for the pair. Two months later, a match was revealed but Raj’s family did not share this news publicly at the request of police, as they hoped to locate Ashok before the news broke publicly. In September, 2007 the two Jane Does were publicly revealed to be a match and were finally identified as Raj Mati Narain, age 24, and her daughter Kamnee Koushal Narain aged 14 months. The next month in October, Jai was permitted to bring the bodies back to Fiji so a ceremony could be held and their bodies laid to rest among friends and family\\*\\*.\\*\\* Over 500 mourners attended the services.\n\nWith both mother and daughter identified, an investigation into their deaths could finally begin in earnest. Both Kamnee and Raj died in early September 1987, on approximately the 5th or 7th of that month, before being dumped in three separate rivers about 140 miles north of their home in Eugene, Oregon. The first order of business was to speak to Ashok Narain but police quickly hit a brick wall. Ashok disappeared sometime in 1987 or 1988, reports differ, not only in the date of his disappearance but also in basic details. Chief Criminal Deputy Charlie Rosenzweig, who was a one of the men who retrieved Kamnee’s body from the river in 1987, told the Seattle Post Intelligencer that deputies were able to track Ashok in the Eugene area through early 1988, possibly into the spring before Ashok vanished from the area for unknown reasons. Rosenzweig gathered this information through interviews with coworkers, although it should be noted that this information relies on 20 year old memories. Robert Narayan first reported that his brother vanished in April, 1988 and listed the date of last contact as April 1st, 1988. It is unknown if this is a solid date or an estimate. Articles over the next few months of 2007 report that  Ashok disappeared from Eugene in “early 1988.” Some modern articles as well as Namus report that Ashok disappeared at the same time as his family in the fall of 1987. Police in Washington state reported that they contacted every single Ashok Kumar Narain living in Washington, Oregon, and California but none of these men are the correct Ashok. Articles seeking information about the whereabouts of Ashok have been disseminated in South Asian newspapers and communities in Canada on the off chance that Ashok escaped to an area with a large Indian or Indo-Fijian community but no solid leads have emerged. Police have also admitted that it is possible that Ashok was also murdered and his body has simply not been found. \n\n In 2011 Jai Prasad told the Longview Chronicle newspaper that Fijian immigration authorities told him that a man named Ashok Kumar Narain entered the country on May 12th, 1988 but they have no record of this man leaving Fiji. It is unclear if this is the same Ashok Narain who was married to Raj. To give an example of how common this name is, I found five men named Ashok Narain died in Fiji in 2023 alone. None had the correct birth date as the Ashok Narain who is wanted for questioning in this case. According to the article in the Longview Chronicle, there are several possible explanations for this. First it is possible that this is a different man altogether. A second is that this was Ashok and he is hiding in Fiji either under his own name or with a new identity. The third theory is that Ashok returned to Fiji but then left under a new name or identity.  Some amateur sleuths have doubted that this man is the correct Ashok because Fiji is a small place both in size and in population making it an unlikely place to disappear unless he is living under a false identity. Over the years, Raj and Kamnee’s has been featured over the years in Fijian media yet no one has come forth with any promising tips or leads. \n\nOne newspaper article says that US investigators went to Fiji after learning this and were unable to locate Ashok but this tidbit is not mentioned elsewhere and the article which mentioned this is no longer available online, so please take this information with a grain of salt. Fiji does have an extradition treaty with the US but because Ashok has not been charged with any crimes, he would be under no obligation to speak with investigators or return to the States. \n\nWhatever the case, Ashok Kumar Narain has not been heard from in decades. The Kelso police department is keeping an open mind and has not named Ashok as a suspect in his family’s murder. Interestingly enough, Ashok’s vehicle disappeared with him leading some to speculate that Ashok perished inside the vehicle whether from suicide, misadventure, or foul play. Police are still looking for this vehicle, a white 1980 Toyota Tercel with Oregon license plate KUV762. The registration would have expired in 1993. Investigators believe that finding the car could be the key to cracking this case and would like to process it as a possible crime scene.\n\nIn the years since identification media attention has slowed to a trickle. Jai sometimes gives interviews to the press and tries to keep his sister and nieces’ stories in the spotlight. Jai filmed Raj and Kamnee’s funeral and posted it on Youtube hoping to bring awareness to the murders. He even shared his email address so tips about his brother in law’s whereabouts could be shared. Jai has started an educational scholarship for girls in rural Fiji. He hopes that with education and opportunity women and Fiji will not end up like his sister and will be able to support their families independently. He has also donated money to girls’ orphanages in Fiji for the same reason.  Sadly there have been no updates on the case of Raj Mati and Kamnee Koushal since the early 2010s and Ashok remains a missing person. \n\n**Theories**\n\nTheories abound in this case and because Ashok is long term missing it is hard to determine if he is the victim, a witness, or the perpetrator of this crime. One theory is that Ashok and his family were all killed by an unknown party and dumped in different rivers to stymie their identifications and that sadly Ashok has not been found. Some have even brought up the idea that this was a hate crime by someone who did not like immigrants. According to the 1990 census, Eugene was 3% Asian but had essentially no south Asian or Fijian community at the time.\n\nThe second and most common theory is that Ashok killed his family and then fled the area, perhaps going back to Fiji or going to Canada as there is a larger South Asian diaspora there. It is possible that Ashok was a run of the mill family annihilator or abuser who decided who no longer wanted the burden of a wife or children. If this is the case he may have taken his own life after the murders perhaps by driving his car into the water or like mentioned above he may have fled the area. \n\nA third possibility is that this was an honor killing. An honor killing is a specific type of crime where a person, usually a woman or girl, is killed by a male family member for disgracing the family’s “honor” due to real or perceived transgressions. Most commonly these so called transgressions are the result of women eschewing standard social, sexual, or marriage norms within their communities. According to the Encyclopedia Britannica, honor killings happen all around the world but are most common in India and Pakistan. Because the Narain family were south Asian ethnically and because Raj was pregnant some believe that this crime could have been an honor killing, perhaps the result of Ashok either not wanting another child, or believing Raj’s unborn child was not his. This theory is not without criticism, however. Despite the family’s ethnic background there are no records of honor killings happening in Fiji. One opinion piece in the Fijian media even calls this notion “a dirty stereotype” about Indo Fijians borne out of ignorance with no basis in fact. Although there is one scholarly article regarding the normalization of minor domestic violence in Fiji, experts claim there are no reports of honor killings in the country or that it is exceedingly rare. Some information on this is linked below.\n\nA fourth but unlikely possibility is that Ashok was not involved at all but due to being an immigrant or not trusting the police Ashok fled the area after his family was murdered perhaps even fearing for his own life. \n\nAshok has been ruled out as 10 different John Does on Namus, but I submitted Ashok as a match for a handful of other unidentified descendants. The most compelling matches are Mount Rainier John Doe 1987, and Multnomah Co. John Doe May, 1988, who was found near the spots where Raj’s legs were discovered.\n\nMt Rainier John Doe, 1987 was a short man of unknown race whose body was discovered September 26th or 27th, 1987. According to [NPSHistory.com](http://NPSHistory.com) “An unidentified body was discovered approximately 30' over highway embankment.” “Location: HWY 123, 1/4 mile South of Tunnel. Park staff who are investigating the incident estimate victim had been dead for 4-5 days. One .45 caliber shell casing was found along the highway in the vicinity of the body.” Namus and the Doe Network report that this man was dead about two weeks at the time of discovery and his manner and cause of death are reported as “unknown.” This man was 20-30 years old with short, straight black hair that was 7” long. He was wearing a short-sleeved red/black plaid shirt, NIXIT jeans (size 27 long), black Splash shorts, white Hanes underwear (size 28), black leather belt with a silver buckle, one white sock with blue and yellow stripes, one gray sock with red and blue stripes, black boots (size 6D) with the words \"1574 All Man-Made Materials, Made in Taiwan ROC.\" He was 5’5” to 5’9” in height and weighed 120-140 lbs in life. His fingerprints are available in AFIS and dental X-rays were taken. The victim had 32 teeth in virgin condition meaning he may have never been to a dentist in his life. This bit of information seems consistent with Ashok as someone raised and rural Fiji in the 1950s and 60s may not have had access to a dentist. According to the Doe Network the FBI is working with the medical examiner to locate the remains to see if bones could be used for DNA testing but at this time DNA is not available for this decedent.  I submitted this John Doe as a possible match to Ashok and law enforcement replied that they would look into it.\n\nThe second John Doe who has similarities to Ashok is Multnomah Co. John Doe May, 26th, 1988. The decedent’s body was found floating in the Willamette River between the Morrison and Hawthorne bridges in Portland, Oregon, very very close to where Raj's legs were discovered. He was of unknown race and between 15-40 years old. He had straight black hair, was 5’4” in height, about 150-170s lbs in life and had died in 1987 or 1988. His cause of death is unknown, but like Kamnee, this man had a skull fracture in the left temporal area. According to the Doe Network, it was a “wedge-shaped to slightly oval fracture measuring 1 3/4 x 1 inches in greatest dimension. The anterior margin is sharp and slightly depressed.” He was wearing Levi blue jeans, Fruit of the Loom brief-style underwear (size 34-36), long sleeved thermal underwear shirt, olive drab colored waist-length jacket, Western-style tooled leather belt (measures 41 inches), waffle soled ankle high hiking boots with leather laces (\"MADE IN SWITZERLAND\") and the inside is marked in felt pen \"M61/2-2\" (probable US size men's 7-8). He was carrying a bic lighter in the left front jeans pocket and Benson and Hedges cigarettes in the right shirt pocket. His dentals are available for comparison. I also submitted this John Doe as a possible match to Ashok Narain, but sadly, the two men cannot be scientifically compared as they have separate identifiers on file. They also replied via email that many people have suggested this as a match.\n\nAshok Kumar Narain has been missing since the late 1980s, last being seen or heard from in 1987 or early 1988 perhaps as late as May, 12th 1988. He is wanted for questioning regarding the deaths of his pregnant wife Raj and his daughter Kamnee. Ashok is described as a South Asian male who was about 31 years old when he was last seen. He has black hair and brown eyes. He stands between 5’2” and 5’7” in height and weighs about 135-185 lbs. He wore a mustache in the 1980s and has thick hair. He is a Fijian citizen. It is unclear what his immigration status was in the United States. He may have returned to Fiji in 1988 or he may have fled to another part of North America, or he may still be in the local area in Oregon or in Northern California. In 1987 Ashok drove a white Toyota Tercel which is a sedan sized car, with the license plate KUV762. The license plate would have expired in 1993. His last name is sometimes spelled Narayan or Naraiin. If you have any information on the whereabouts of Ashok or his car or have any additional information on the homicides of Raj or Kamnee, please call one of the following two numbers. Sadly the murders of Raj and Kamnee are still unsolved and Raj’s head is still missing. \n\nKelso Police Department- (360) 577-3092\n\nEugene Police Department- (541)

      "text": "Asha Degree, a nine year old girl from Shelby, North Carolina, was last seen in her bedroom in the middle of the night on Valentine's Day of 2000. Asha and her family were awake following a power outage in the neighborhood, and was seen supposedly asleep in the room she shared with her brother. Her brother reported hearing the bedframe squeaking shortly after, but assumed she was tossing and turning in her sleep. At 6:30 AM, when the children were woken up for school, Asha's mother noticed she wasn't in her bed, prompting a massive police investigation. Through the course of their investigation, law enforcement determined that a couple of passing motorists spotted Asha getting into a green 1970s model Lincoln Mark IV or Ford Thunderbird that had rusted wheel wells at around 4:00 that morning. It is unknown why she left the house that night. Some of her belongings were later found in her backpack by a construction worker doing work off a highway, though until now, the contents had not been publicized.\n\n\n\n* *Authorities believe Asha Degree was the victim of a homicide*\n* *Additional search warrants were executed in Vale and Charlotte*\n* *\\[The\\] Dedmons in Cleveland County were subject to search warrant because of familial DNA found in hair strand on Asha’s undershirt, which came back to their daughter*\n\n\n\n*Later on, the affidavit stated that “a construction crew working in the area” of Highway 18 in Burke County “located the evidence double bagged in black garbage bags and turned it over to the Cleveland County Sheriff’s Office” and noted that some items were “identified as belonging to Asha Degree and other items not belonging to Asha Degree.”*\n\n*The affidavit noted that the items were sent for analysis and that genealogical data narrowed the samples down to two individuals–one, belonging to Russell Bradley Underhill, and another belonging to a family member of Roy and Connie Dedmon, who were listed as the property owners of the addresses on Cherryville Road and Hawthorne Lane, and owners of North Brook Rest Home.*\n\n*“Laboratory analysis of collected DNA samples indicated the likelihood that the hair stem sample of Asha Degree’s undershirt is a person genetically identical to the DNA standard collected from AnnaLee Victoria Dedmon Ramirez,” the affidavit said, noting that Ramirez is the daughter of Roy and Connie Dedmon.*\n\n*The search warrant for one of the other properties Dedmon owned indicated that, several years ago, a family member “saw Roy Lee Dedmon digging a chest-deep hole on the property”, and that investigators observed a 6-8 inch dent in the ground “where it was obvious that the ground had been disturbed.”* \n\n\n\n[https://www.wnct.com/on-your-side/crime-tracker/cold-case-files/cold-case-files-the-disappearance-of-asha-degree/](https://www.wnct.com/on-your-side/crime-tracker/cold-case-files/cold-case-files-the-disappearance-of-asha-degree/)\n\n[https://www.qcnews.com/news/u-s/north-carolina/cleveland-county/search-warrants-now-public-record-in-asha-degree-investigation/](https://www.qcnews.com/news/u-s/north-carolina/cleveland-county/search-warrants-now-public-record-in-asha-degree-investigation/)\n\n[https://www.shelbystar.com/story/news/crime/2024/09/16/search-warrants-reveal-details-of-asha-degree-case/75248375007/](https://www.shelbystar.com/story/news/crime/2024/09/16/search-warrants-reveal-details-of-asha-degree-case/75248375007/)",

      "title": "'Peaches' Doe and Her Daughter Identified",
      "text": "On June 28th, 1997, a hiker on a trek through Long Island's Hempstead Lake State Park discovered a Rubbermaid container in the woods, unfortunately containing the dismembered remains of a young woman, dead only days. The woman, nicknamed 'Peaches' for her distinctive tattoo, was missing her arms, head, and legs below the knee, some of which were ultimately found fourteen years later at Jones Beach State Park, when authorities embarked on a search for victims of a possible serial killer. This serial killer, later identified as Rex Heuermann, was arrested in 2023 following a DNA match to Heuermann's wife, whose hair was left at the crime scene. During the 2011 search, the remains of an unidentified toddler were discovered near what was found of 'Peaches'. DNA testing ultimately determined that the little girl was Peaches' daughter.  \n\nToday, Peaches and her daughter were finally identified: Tanya Denise Jackson and Tatiana Marie Dykes. Born in Alabama, Tanya Jackson, only twenty-six years old, was last known to be living in Brooklyn, New York City, at the time of her disappearance. Tanya was an army veteran and single mother to a two-year-old daughter, Tatiana Marie. Neither Tanya nor her daughter was ever reported missing, due to familial estrangement from both her family and that of her daughter's father.\n\n\\-\n\n[https://abc7.com/post/gilgo-beach-murders-nassau-county-police-reveal-id-victim-peaches-toddler-tanya-tatiana/16230830/](https://abc7.com/post/gilgo-beach-murders-nassau-county-police-reveal-id-victim-peaches-toddler-tanya-tatiana/16230830/)\n\n[https://dnasolves.com/articles/nassau-county-peaches-1997-tanya-jackson/](https://dnasolves.com/articles/nassau-county-peaches-1997-tanya-jackson/)\n\n[https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-14639703/gilgo-beach-victim-peaches-identified-serial-killer-case-update.html](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-14639703/gilgo-beach-victim-peaches-identified-serial-killer-case-update.html) (I hate using the Daily Mail as a source, but they unfortunately have the most info here)\n\n[https://www.doenetwork.org/cases/1323ufny.html](https://www.doenetwork.org/cases/1323ufny.html)",

      "text": "ETA: Here is the video without any commentary. It appears that this isn't the raw video but the enhanced/stabilised version. **TRIGGER WARNING: This video contains content some viewers might find distressing.**  [view it here](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/blX_asJQjSw)\n\n  \nETA 2: Some redditors are saying this is not an unsolved mystery. Of course, we all know that, but I thought it might be of use for others to read an update on a case which has been heavily featured in true crime since 2017.\n\n\n\n**Background of the case:**\n\nOn February 13, 2017, best friends Liberty German and Abigail Williams disappeared after being dropped off at the Delphi Historic Trails. On February 14, 2017, their bodies were discovered across the creek from the Monon High Bridge in Delphi, Indiana, USA.\n\nOver the years, police released sketches of a potential suspect, as well as audio and a still photo from Liberty’s phone. Liberty had captured a male on the Monon High Bridge saying “Guys” and “down the hill”.\n\nThe case went unsolved until October 28, 2022, when Richard Allen was arrested. The trial began on October 18, 2024 and on November 11, 2024, Richard Allen was convicted on all counts. He was sentenced to 65 years for the murder of Liberty German and 65 years for the murder of Abigail Williams, with the terms to be served consecutively, resulting in a total of 130 years in prison.\n\nThis week, the full, 43-second video taken by Liberty just before she and Abigail were murdered has been released on a website called Justice for Rick Allen by supporters who have aligned themselves with Allen’s defense team. Although the video was played in court, this is the first time this it has been released to the public. \n\n**From Fox59:**\n\n*In the video, we see Williams walking along the bridge with a man walking closely behind her. At this point, Williams can be heard saying something to German referencing the man walking behind her.*\n\n*She then appears to hurry off of the bridge and walks in front of German, who is pointing her phone toward the ground. Both girls appear to be sniffling, but that could be due to the cold weather.*\n\n*At another point in the video, it appears that Williams says something to the effect of “don’t leave me” as the man gets closer to them. The video captures German’s voice as she discusses a potential route to walk off of the usual bridge path.*\n\n*Then, a man’s voice can be heard saying the words “Guys, down the hill.” German can be heard replying “Hi” after man says “guys,” but before he says “down the hill.” It sounds as if the man may have said, “Hey” before “Guys, down the hill,” but it is again not definitive.*\n\n**TRIGGER WARNING: This video contains content some viewers might find distressing.** \n\nVideo can be seen here:\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G6JDuHFqd24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G6JDuHFqd24)\n\nSources:\n\n[https://fox59.com/delphi-trial/delphi-murders-full-bridge-guy-video-leaks-on-richard-allen-innocence-website/](https://fox59.com/delphi-trial/delphi-murders-full-bridge-guy-video-leaks-on-richard-allen-innocence-website/)\n\n[https://www.courttv.com/title/delphi-murders-defense-team-releases-bridge-guy-video/](https://www.courttv.com/title/delphi-murders-defense-team-releases-bridge-guy-video/)",

      "title": "\"Idk what to do. I caused this\" New Asha Degree warrants: Text messages revealed, possible admission of fault",
      "text": "*The anniversary of Asha Degree's disappearance is a somber reminder of the unresolved mystery surrounding her case. Asha was just 9 years old when she vanished from her home in Shelby, North Carolina, on February 14, 2000. Despite numerous leads and extensive investigations over the years, her whereabouts remain unknown, leaving her family and the community in continued uncertainty. Each anniversary brings renewed hope for answers, but also the painful sting of loss for those who have been searching for over two decades.*\n\n *In honor of the 25th anniversary of Asha Degree’s disappearance, the FBI released a new video aimed at renewing public interest and urging fresh leads in the case. The video features law enforcement officials discussing their ongoing efforts to solve the mystery and bring closure to Asha's family. Investigators emphasize the importance of any information, no matter how small, that could help uncover the truth behind Asha's vanishing.*\n\n*The release of the video marks a renewed push to solve the case and draws attention to the continued search for Asha. A push that seems to have been successful, as new events and details concerning Asha's disappearance have been released to the public, most of which center around one local family.*\n\n\n [Link](https://www.wbtv.com/2025/02/18/new-asha-degree-warrants-text-messages-revealed-possible-admission-fault-more/)\n\n\nBy Cassidy Johncox and Brandy Beard\nPublished: Feb. 18, 2025 \n\nCHARLOTTE, N.C. (WBTV) - Law enforcement believe a Cleveland County man and two of his daughters may have interfered with the investigation into the February 2000 disappearance of Asha Degree, according to recent search warrants.\n\nMore than 25 years ago, then 9-year-old Asha Degree went missing from her home in Shelby, North Carolina. Law enforcement -- local, state, and federal -- have continued to investigate Degree’s case in the decades since.\n\nIn September 2024, the sheriff’s office and FBI carried out several search warrants due to a believed connection between Degree’s disappearance and a Cleveland County family. The initial search warrants named members of the Dedmon family, including: Roy Dedmon, his wife Connie Dedmon, and their three daughters AnnaLee Dedmon Ramirez, Lizzie Dedmon Foster, and Sarah Dedmon Caple.\n\nIn September 2024, authorities said for the first time that they believe Degree was killed. Investigators believe the Dedmon daughters may have played a role in Degree’s possible homicide.\n\nThe family has maintained that they are in no way connected to Degree’s disappearance.\n\nHere’s a look at what the latest search warrants say.\n\n**Man says he heard girl admit fault**\n\nLizzie Foster, then known as Lizzie Dedmon, was 16 years old when Degree went missing in 2000. Sarah Dedmon Caple, known then as Sarah Dedmon, was 15 years old in 2000.\n\nThe week after law enforcement searched the Dedmon’s properties in September 2024, a man went to the sheriff’s office for an interview with investigators. He said that he occasionally went to bars and house parties with the three Dedmon girls in the mid-2000s.\n\nThe man told officers that one time, he was at a house party with Foster and Dedmon Caple. The man said he saw Foster was visibly upset and intoxicated.\n\nHe said that at one point, Foster said, “I killed Asha Degree.”\n\nThe man reported that Dedmon Caple then became stern and told Foster to “shut the [f***] up.”\n\nThe man told investigators that Dedmon Caple’s behavior “caught him off guard” that night, since he had normally seen her be calm and nice.\n\nLater, the man told investigators that he was confident in his memory, and that he was “100% positive of those moments.”\n\nThe man was later given a polygraph test based on the information provided, officials said in the search warrants. Although polygraph results are not admissible in the state of North Carolina, the man was said to have passed.\n\n\n**Probable cause for felony obstruction of justice**\n\nIn the search warrants from Feb. 13, investigators with the Cleveland County Sheriff’s Office say they believe there is evidence to indicate that Foster, Dedmon Caple, and Roy Dedmon engaged in obstruction of justice in connection with Degree’s disappearance.\n\nIt did not appear that the two women or their father had been arrested or charged with any such crime as of Feb. 18.\n\n\nSearch warrants made public in September 2024 showed that investigators think Roy Dedmon’s daughters were responsible for or involved in Degree’s disappearance in 2000. Because the girls were ages 16 years old and younger at that time, investigators believe “adult assistance” from parents Roy and Connie Dedmon “would have been necessary in the execution and/or concealment of the crime,” the sheriff’s office says.\n\nRoy and Connie Dedmon were identified as suspects in Degree’s case in 2024.\n\nMonths after Degree went missing, her backpack was discovered in Burke County -- more than 30 miles from where she was last reportedly seen. The girl’s belongings were “wrapped in two sealed black plastic garbage bags” and were found along Highway 18 near Morganton, court documents read in 2024.\n\nTwo of the items in the backpack “returned evidentiary results,” linking DNA to AnnaLee Dedmon Ramirez and a man named Russell Underhill. Dedmon Ramirez was 13 years old when Degree went missing in 2000.\n\n\n**Daughter texts: ‘The theory is I did it’**\n\nThree search warrants were executed by the Cleveland County Sheriff’s Office on Thursday, Feb. 13. Authorities seized cellphones from Lizzie Foster, Sarah Dedmon Caple, and Roy Dedmon.\n\nBefore seizing the phones last week, law enforcement got a search warrant for Foster’s iCloud account in October 2024. They reviewed “several iMessages,” and included conversations “of interest” in the February search warrants.\n\nThe details in the search warrants focus particularly on Foster’s conversations with Dedmon Caple, sister Dedmon Ramirez, and Foster’s ex-husband.\n\n\nIn a message to her sister Dedmon Caple sent on Sept. 12, 2024, Foster said she spoke to the family lawyer and said, “The theory is I did it. Accident. Covered it up.”\n\nHere are some text conversations laid out in the search warrants that investigators thought were noteworthy. Note: The texts are written below as provided in the search warrants, including spelling errors.\n\n**Sept. 10, 2024**\n\nDedmon Caple to Foster: They think it’s our shirt. It’s not her shirt\n\nDedmon Caple to Foster: Her mom said it wasn’t hers\n\nDedmon Caple to Foster: I don’t remember that shirt. I’m scared though. Dad is probably going to be a huge suspect\n\n**Sept. 11, 2024**\n\nAnnaLee Dedmon Ramirez (sister) to Foster: Lizzie, you don’t need to be talking to anyone. I’m at the lawyers office [now]\n\nDedmon Ramirez to Foster: They advise we should all not talk to them\n\nDedmon Ramirez to Foster: Without representation\n\n**Sept. 11, 2024**\n\n\nFoster to ex-husband: This is going to get nothing but worse.\n\nFoster to ex-husband: I’m talking to my Dr. at 5 to get something for my nerves\n\nFoster to ex-husband: I’m just so worried. So so worried.\n\nFoster to ex-husband: I mean, it’s a nightmare that’s going to keep getting worse. I can see nothing good happening anytime soon. And I’m an optimist.\n\nEx-husband to Foster: Ohhh no. I hate [it] for y’all\n\nFoster to ex-husband: There is no way this is going to be okay\n\n**Sept. 12, 2024**\n\nFoster to Dedmon Caple: I just talked to David Teddy [family’s lawyer]\n\nFoster to Dedmon Caple: The theory is I did it\n\nFoster to Dedmon Caple: Accident. Covered it up\n\nDedmon Caple to Foster: No\n\nDedmon Caple to Foster: Why would it be you\n\nFoster to Dedmon Caple: That’s what he said\n\n**Sept. 12, 2024**\n\nFoster to ex-husband: I feel so horrible\n\nFoster to ex-husband: So so horrible\n\nFoster to ex-husband: Idk what to do. I caused this\n\nEx-husband to Foster: No you didn’t!\n\n**Sept. 12, 2024**\n\nFoster to Dedmon Caple: Hey\n\nFoster to Dedmon Caple: Is everybody mad at me?\n\nDedmon Caple to Foster: Nobody is lozzie!\n\nDedmon Caple to Foster: This is NOT YOUR FAULT\n\n**Sept. 29, 2024**\n\nFoster to Dedmon Caple: I’m just so anxious about like, what’s going on behind the scenes\n\nFoster to Dedmon Caple: Like what are they doing now?\n\nFoster to Dedmon Caple: What’s going to happen to me since I wouldn’t talk to them? [Foster was referencing when she was approached by law enforcement on Sept. 28, 2024, law enforcement say.]\n\nFoster to Dedmon Caple: I’m afraid it’s going to get worse. Well, he told me it’s going to\n\nDedmon Caple to Foster: I know girl I’m a disaster \n\nDedmon Caple to Foster: I think if they come at you again you just go and be compliant\n\nDedmon Caple to Foster: That’s what I’m planning on doing\n\nFoster to Dedmon Caple: I think so too\n\nFoster to Dedmon Caple: Honestly\n\nFoster to Dedmon Caple: I mean, I wanna do what dad says\n\nFoster to Dedmon Caple: But damn\n\nDedmon Caple to Foster: And maybe we should have let you do what you originally wanted to do\n\nFoster to Dedmon Caple: Idk\n\nFoster to Dedmon Caple: I really don’t know\n\nDedmon Caple to Foster: Right. You don’t want something we do or say impact him but we also can’t be living like this either\n\nDedmon Caple to Foster: I mean I told him I’m not gonna do that\n\nFoster to Dedmon Caple: Right\n\nFoster to Dedmon Caple: Oh you did?\n\nFoster to Dedmon Caple: What did he say?\n\nDedmon Caple to Foster: It’s not like worth our mental health\n\nFoster to Dedmon Caple: Right\n\nDedmon Caple to Foster: He was just like I will call Teddy we can go get a polygraph with the honest people\n\nFoster to Dedmon Caple: Ohhhhhhh\n\nFoster to Dedmon Caple: Okay\n\nDedmon Caple to Foster: I really just don’t have it in me to go through what you have been through\n\nFoster to Dedmon Caple: It’s been hell\n\nDedmon Caple to Foster: Just hearing about your situation has made me a disaster\n\nDedmon Caple to Foster: HEARING ABOUT IT\n\nFoster to Dedmon Caple: Oh I’m sorry\n\nDedmon Caple to Foster: I just can’t even imagine going through that\n\nFoster to Dedmon Caple: But yall have dealt with other stuff that I haven’t\n\n\n**The car connection**\n\nAuthorities believe Degree was pulled into a 1970s-era green vehicle on the night she went missing.\n\nIn 2016, the FBI said they were looking for a 1970s-era green Ford Thunderbird or Lincoln Mark IV. At least one older green vehicle -- an AMC Rambler -- was seized from a property belonging to Roy Dedmon in September 2024.\n\nInvestigators say the seized vehicle has “very similar features” to the vehicle wanted in connection with Degree’s disappearance.\n\n\nThe AMC Rambler was said to be driven by Sarah Dedmon Caple around the time when Degree went missing.\n\n\n**Family denies involvement in case**\n\nInvestigators think Dedmon and his family are in some way connected with, or responsible for, Degree’s believed death. But Dedmon and his family deny having any knowledge of what happened to Degree, according to their lawyer.\n\nThe attorney for Roy Dedmon held a press conference on Sept. 13, 2024, amid news of the search warrants carried out at Roy Dedmon’s property in Cleveland County.\n\n\nThe attorney confirmed that the property searched that week belonged to Roy Dedmon. However, the attorney said that Roy Dedmon denies any involvement in or knowledge of Degree’s disappearance.\n\nSearch warrant documents did say that Roy Dedmon did not appear to have any ties with Degree or her family.\n\nRoy Dedmon’s attorney asked the community to not jump to any conclusions once the search warrants were released. The attorney asked the community to “let law enforcement do their job,” and to avoid spreading any rumors.\n\nThat request was made after the sheriff’s office even asked the community to not spread false information amid the investigation. Some online posts had falsely claimed that a body had been found amid the FBI raid.\n\n\nNo human remains were found during police raids in 2024 in Cleveland County.\n\nRoy Dedmon’s attorney alluded to Underhill in his press conference, saying that he may be the one who knows what happened to Degree. The attorney said the search would “sadly link” a person to Degree’s disappearance who is “no longer living.”\n\nUnderhill died in 2004.\n\nLaw enforcement reportedly questioned Roy Dedmon, who maintained that he doesn’t know what happened. Roy Dedmon’s attorney also said every member of Dedmon’s family had been interviewed, as well.\n\n\nThey all denied knowing anything about Degree’s disappearance, the attorney said.\n\nRoy Dedmon’s attorney said the connection between the Dedmons and Degree’s disappearance is “tenuous, at best.”\n\nThere have been no known arrests made in connection with Degree’s case. It does not appear that anyone in the Dedmon family has been arrested or charged with any crimes, as of this writing.",

      "text": "(Thanks to [Prestigious-Lake6870](https://www.reddit.com/user/Prestigious-Lake6870/) for suggesting this case via [this post](https://www.reddit.com/user/moondog151/comments/1g7vgdl/for_my_international_readers_or_anyone_interested/) asking for case suggestions from my international readers since I focus on international cases.)\n\n[Silja Andrea Trindler](https://imgur.com/WK8uLmd) was born on April 16, 1982, in Affoltern Am Albis, Switzerland. Her upbringing was a rather tragic one. And when she lived in a small Swiss village of only 600 people named Rifferswil, near Zurich.\n\nShe lived in Rifferswil with her younger brother, and it was there that she had been sexually assaulted by a neighbour when she was between the ages of 6 and 8. Her parents aided in covering it up so it wouldn't lead to a scandal. She had even been committed to a psychiatric hospital around the age of 16-17.\n\nBecause of this, she grew up to be reserved, and she constantly seemed sad and never found herself in a relationship. As she grew into her teenage years, she grew to resent her parents, who stood by their decision and kept demanding that she remain silent about her abuse back in Rifferswil. Her household was no stranger to fierce arguments.\n\nOn July 24, 2000, her family decided to go on a vacation and arrived at a campsite in Carcans. Carcans was a small beachside commune on the coast of France's Gironde department. Their vacation was due to last 5 days with Silja and her family set to return to Switzerland on August 5. They had vacationed here two times before, but Silja didn't want to go this time. It was said that the vacation was \"Organized against her will.\"\n\nSilja stayed with her family in a tent on the campsite, one she shared with her parents and 13-year-old brother. She didn't enjoy France much on her own and couldn't speak with the other campers. While Silja was from Switzerland, she was specifically from the German region and only spoke German, so she couldn't communicate with any of the local campers or the ones who learned French before arriving.\n\nHowever, a different reason caused Silja's enjoyment of their vacation to evaporate. On August 3, 2000, two days before they were scheduled to return to Switzerland, she was on a bike ride with her father and said, \"I'm happy to be with you because I feel spied on.\" The family then went to the beach, where Silja finally made some temporary friends.\n\nWhen she returned to the tent that afternoon, she angrily threw a water bottle full of sand to the ground and screamed. When her father asked what was wrong, Silja replied, \"You know what’s wrong with me!!!\"\n\nOn the morning of August 4, after going to the beach early in the morning, she refused to speak with her father upon her return and told him to leave her alone. After lunch, she stayed in the tent alone and cried. Afterward, she went to the beach and spent the afternoon with some students from Paris. The students said that Silja was acting off and would cry to herself, but they couldn't understand the issue due to the language barrier. Later at the beach, she also complained that \"people are looking at me like I'm crazy .\"\n\nThen, in the evening, she insisted on taking down the tent and having the entire family move back to Switzerland a full day early. While at the campsite, she confided in her brother that she saw two young Frenchmen in their twenties who had been shooting \"suggestive glances\" her way.\n\nAt 6:00 p.m., she was seen by the campsite's caretaker alongside the caretaker's brother. According to her, she went through the family's tent to find the keys to the bicycle locker. When she couldn't find them, she opted to leave the campsite on foot.\n\nAt 7:15 p.m., A couple of tourists from Germany saw her on the dune line separating Carcans from Lake Hourtin. According to them, they saw her writing in the sand with a piece of wood. They also described her as looking \"dreamy\". This took place over 2 kilometres from the campsite.  She never returned to the campsite.\n\nAt midnight on August 5, Silja's parents alerted the campsite's night watchman of her disappearance, but the local police didn't hear the report until 2:00 a.m. They did patrols around the area, but finding any trace of Silja, especially among all the other tourists, proved difficult. Lifeguards dived into the oceans, firefighters searched together with the police with search dogs, and even a helicopter was called in for a brief period in which Silja was just a missing person.\n\nThe helicopter flew over the ocean as Silja's parents told them about her history with chronic depression and the fact that she had been on antidepressants, and they feared that she had committed suicide by jumping into the ocean.\n\nAfter two hours, the police found a pair of red Adidas sneakers with the laces tied and pointing toward the ocean. The sneakers were found at the foot of the dune. Inside one of them was a ring. The ring and the sneakers belonged to Silja. The police also found A three-quarters-empty bottle of mineral water resting in front of the footwear.\n\nMeanwhile, Silja's father found [four pine cones arranged in a circle on the beach, surrounding a seagull feather stuck in the sand](https://imgur.com/nsqK35g). What connection if any, this has to the case is unknown, but he felt it worth mentioning as Silja liked seagulls.\n\nAt 1:30 p.m., a Dutch tourist, on the first day of his vacation, was walking along [the beach](https://imgur.com/DgDO2eT) when they suddenly found a dead body in the middle of the dunes of Carcans-Plage. The body was that of a young woman lying on her back.\n\n[She was partially buried in the sand (An SFW recreation of the crime scene](https://imgur.com/4RGMYSw)) wearing a black polo shirt, a brown skirt and a red swimsuit top. Meanwhile, her swimming trunks had been placed over her face. The body belonged to Silja Trindler. [She was found two kilometres away from the campsite](https://imgur.com/6s45PJU).\n\nThe police arrived and searched and scoured the beach for additional evidence. Only a few meters away, the police found \"Bob Marley\" They also saw just the letters \"HE\" as the wind had disrupted the rest of the message. The handwriting was recognized as Silja's, and the police thought they spelled out \"HELP\". Silja's mother instead said it likely was meant to say \"HEXE,\" the German word for witch. This is likely [what the German tourist saw her writing.](https://imgur.com/7lV7Tsb)\n\nThe case was obviously a murder, but the autopsy revealed a truly horrific cause of death. The coroner labelled the cause of death as suffocation. Presence had been applied to her neck, and a large quantity of sand was found in her airways. Breathing would've been rendered impossible. Meanwhile, no other injuries were found on her, which led the medical examiner to conclude that Silja had her face forced against the sand until it caused her to suffocate.\n\nEven though Silja had sustained zero superficial injuries, the same likely wasn't true of her killer. Silja had fiercely defended herself and fragments of skin were discovered under her nails. DNA was taken from the skin samples which gave them a partial sample belonging to a man.\n\nThere were also signs that Silja had sex recently, but the coroner believed it to be consensual because of the lack of violence, marks or lesions. Sperm was found in the sand, and police took a partial sample from the sperm as well, but it was degraded from being mixed in with the sand.\n\nHer time of death was anywhere between the late night of August 4 and the early morning of August 5. There were also signs that her body had been moved post-mortem. Likely to be buried before the killer changed his mind.\n\nCarcans had a local population of just 2,415, so taking DNA from the local adult male population would make solving the case relatively easy. But as mentioned it was camping season and Silja's family weren't the only ones in attendance. Many tourists, both foreign nationals and from other parts of France, found themselves at Carcans at the time of the murder; many of them may have already returned home.\n\nThe case became their number one priority and they got to work almost immideately. The police identified over 40,000 tourists staying in Carcans at the time increasing the suspect pool dramatically. Most of the tourists hailed from Germany, the Netherlands, Belgium, Switzerland, the United Kingdom and other parts of France itself. That being said, most of them didn't recognize Silja when shown a picture of her.\n\nThe German tourists who last saw her also told police another thing. They saw a young man carrying a bag over his shoulder appear out of the forest a few meters lower than Silja in elevation. The man was said to have climbed the dune and, upon reaching the summit, turned towards Silja, who was crouching at the time. He stared at her for a long time. According to the witnesses,  \"From the look he gave her, it was as if he were seeing her for the first time,\"\n\nOther witnesses talked about a peeping tom who stalked the campground's toilets and who would open other people's tents in the middle of the night. Both were ruled out. Another aspect that made solving the case difficult was the fact that Silja had a remarkably similar lookalike also vacationing in Carcans. Many people would report seeing Silja before and even after the murder because they mistook her for Silja.\n\nThat being said, they weren't too forthcoming. They felt as if the French police were \"mistreating\" them for \"pressing them with intimate questions\"\n\nNext, fifty gendarmes from the Bordeaux Research Section combed not just Carcans, but the entire region Carcans was situated and even the surrounding regions. As the police had feared, many of the tourist in the area had already left, so tracking them down and obtaining their DNA would be a very tall order.\n\nNext, the police read through Silja's to see if she wrote about any potential suspects. The diary was mostly a write-off with nothing of note. Well, not entirely. She mentioned that she was a fan of reggae which would explain Bob Marley's name written on the sand.\n\nThere was a Reggae Sun Ska concert planned in the nearby community of Montalivet. The concert was cancelled and while the police did follow up on the concert, there was no evidence that Silja was ever in Montalivet.\n\nThe police also looked into all the campers who were still present, tracked down as many hitchhikers near the beach and campsite as they could find and interviewed the regulars at the nearest bar to the beach. The local sex offenders were also rounded up and compelled to give up DNA samples. Within the first month of the investigation alone, 5,000 DNA tests were conducted, but none were a match.\n\nIn March 2001, another witness, a firefighter, came forward. He was vacationing in Carcabs at the beginning of August 2000. He left sometime between August 5-August 6 and hadn't heard of the murder at the time, which is why he didn't come forward. He only came forward now as a result of the flyers and notices that police had put up.\n\nAt 7:00 p.m. on August 4, he saw what he described as \"a slender, athletic young man, wearing a T-shirt and Bermuda shorts with vertical blue and yellow stripes.\" The man, he said, was of Creole or West Indian descent. He was between the ages of 20-25 and had dyed blonde hair. Silja seemed sad as he took her by the arm and left for the beach. On May 3, [a composite sketch was made of this man](https://imgur.com/yAJkoXj) and distributed to all police and gendarmerie stations in South West France. As well as local shopkeepers.\n\nOn December 3, 2001, the police in Aveyron were operating a checkpoint when one man refused to cooperate. His refusal was so strong that he actually exited his vehicle and attacked the officers. The man was placed under arrest and identified as a 23-year-old Moroccan national. The Moroccan resembled the man in the sketch, so his DNA was taken and compared to the samples found underneath Silja's fingernails. The results were not a match.\n\nThe owner of a surfing equipment store and a cook from a hotel in Carcans also bore a resemblance to the man in the sketch. The man was questioned, but he had a very solid alibi. Their next suspect, though, came to the police's attention right as he committed a separate murder himself.\n\nOn December 4, 2001, a 10-year-old boy from Morocco named Larbi Fanousse failed to return home from school in the north of Bordeaux. He went missing until December 19, when his body was found behind a garbage bin. Larbi had been naked, covered with planks, cardboard and household waste. The cause of death was asphyxiation.\n\nThe police arrested Alain Diaz, who had a history of sex crimes against minors. Alain was known to frequent Carcans when he went on vacation, so the police decided to test his DNA against the sample found on Silja's fingernails. It turned out not to be a match. Alain would later get a life sentence for the murder of Larbi.\n\nIn the ensuing years, the police would constantly re-enter the DNA sample into FNAEG (France's DNA Database) in case it matched any new additions, but would always come up empty. Next, because a large population of the suspect pool were likely foreign tourists, the samples were also sent to 40 other countries to be checked against their databases. They, too, turned up no matches.\n\nIt seems the killer never claimed another victim, or at least didn't leave any DNA behind at the crime scene. This notion would be tested when an eerily similar murder occurred almost exactly 3 years to the day. It was so similar that the police in Carcans were certain that he had struck again.\n\nOn August 6, 2003, on the island of Saint-Martin-de-Ré in the Charente-Maritime department, a 16-year-old girl named Audrey Texier had been helping her father, an oyster farmer, sell oysters at the local market. At 1:00 p.m., she left the market so she could go home and have lunch with her mother. She never returned.\n\nAudrey's mother grew worried when she didn't return and set out to look for her. Not long after, she found her daughter's half-naked body lying on the beach. She had been raped and asphyxiated with a cloth stuffed in her mouth.\n\nBoth Audrey and Silja were teenage girls, they went missing after leaving their families, both were murdered in small resort towns, both had been suffocated, and both were raped (or Silja had consensual sex if the medical examiner had a way to tell). Their bodies were both found on beaches, both had some clothing removed, and both died basically on the same day. The similarities were plain to see. Saint-Martin-de-Ré was also located only 160 kilometres from Carcans.\n\nAnother unfortunate similarity it bore to Silja's case was how it seemed to be well on its way to going unsolved.\n\nA witness was living only 150 meters away from where Audrey's body was found, but they hadn't heard anything. Dozens of police officers combed the surrounding area and Audrey's route for any evidence, a composite sketch was made based on three witnesses which prompted several hundred calls, none of them panning out, 100 DNA samples and Saint-Martin-de-Ré's local population of just 2,309 ballooned to 150,000, mostly tourist who could come and go as they pleased.\n\nThe case remained unsolved until 24-year-old seasonal worker Frédéric Ramette was arrested on December 27. Frédéric was one of the suspects initially looked into back in August, but nothing implicated him, so he was let go. But after the police found an unidentified fingerprint that had been overlooked and muddied, the investigation was reopened. This led police back to Frédéric only this time with enough evidence to compel a DNA sample from him. The sample matched the DNA left behind when Audrey was raped.\n\nWhen the police in Carcans heard of Frédéric's arrest, they dispatched some of their own officers to Saint-Martin-de-Ré to compare his DNA to that found under Silja's nails. And the result was...not a match. The case wasn't even a copycat killing. It wasn't even a copycat, all the similarities to Silja's case were merely coincidence. Frédéric was handed down a sentence of 30 years imprisonment. With that, Silja's case went cold once again.\n\nIn 2011, the \"Creole\" man in the composite sketch was finally identified. He was a surfing enthusiast from the overseas department of Réunion who had decided to spend his 2000 holiday in Mainland France. The man was ruled out. His DNA also was not a match.\n\nIn January 2012, the police reopened the case. This time, they dispatched a team of investigators to the Swiss village of Rifferswil so they could question those who personally knew Silja. Her friends, classmates, teachers and other relatives who did not accompany them across the border to France. This was only made possible because of the assistance of the Swiss police who joined in with the questioning. Between 2001-2015, Silja's family would refuse to speak to French investigators in any capacity.\n\nIt was here that the police learned of Silja's sexual assault for the first time, the one her parents covered up. One source even said her mother \"Imposed a code of silence on her daughter\". Eventually, her family did identify the rapist as a local pharmacist. While the French police couldn't arrest him for that crime, as it happened in Switzerland, they could still take his DNA. It wasn't a match.\n\nAccording to the locals, Silja's mother was the mistress of the guru of a local sect, one of multiple mistresses in fact and she was a loyal member. There were also many rumours (although I don't know how truthful they are) that Silja's father engaged in many acts of incest. Her father and the sect leader were never serious suspects, but to put an end to the rumours, the police compelled them to surrender their DNA regardless. The samples were not a match.\n\nThe police then went to Germany and the Netherlands to speak to some young tourists who had been in Carcans during August 2000. In fact, the local police themselves invited the French police over. Their DNA also didn't match the sample they had on hand.\n\n[In 2014, the police put out a public appeal asking for more witnesses to come forward. ](https://imgur.com/1Cy9mmf)They received no response.\n\nOn a hunch, the police also compared the DNA against two serial killers, Francis Heaulme and Michel Fourniret. The DNA cleared them of this murder in particular.\n\nIn 2017, the police revisited the evidence and managed to extract a complete sample from the sperm. They also decided to do familial DNA testing to find someone related to the killer. The samples still didn't match. Over 985 people were identified as persons of interest, with over 70 singled out for a more rigorous investigation, but all of them were later cleared as well.\n\nWhen all was said and done, throughout the case's entire life span, 20,000 were questioned and 5,700 DNA tests were carried out. But no arrests of any kind.\n\nIn April 2023, the investigation was transferred to the Nanterre cold case unit but as of yet, they've made no new breakthroughs.\n\n***Sources***\n\n[***https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affaire\\_Silja\\_Trindler***](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affaire_Silja_Trindler)\n\n[***https://www.rtl.fr/actu/justice-faits-divers/cold-case-en-gironde-qui-etait-silja-trindler-morte-etouffee-dans-le-sable-7900252213***](https://www.rtl.fr/actu/justice-faits-divers/cold-case-en-gironde-qui-etait-silja-trindler-morte-etouffee-dans-le-sable-7900252213)\n\n[***https://archive.ph/aQiKC***](https://archive.ph/aQiKC)\n\n[***https://archive.ph/JwAj9***](https://archive.ph/JwAj9)\n\n[***https://archive.ph/nmeSW***](https://archive.ph/nmeSW)\n\n[***https://www.parismatch.com/actu/faits-divers/sur-une-plage-de-gironde-le-corps-sans-vie-de-silja-trindler-lenquete-rouverte-apres-23-ans-223926***](https://www.parismatch.com/actu/faits-divers/sur-une-plage-de-gironde-le-corps-sans-vie-de-silja-trindler-lenquete-rouverte-apres-23-ans-223926)\n\n[***https://www.closermag.fr/vecu/faits-divers/silja-trindler-coup-de-theatre-dans-l-enquete-sur-la-mort-de-la-jeune-suisse-il-y-a-23-ans-1709919#item=1***](https://www.closermag.fr/vecu/faits-divers/silja-trindler-coup-de-theatre-dans-l-enquete-sur-la-mort-de-la-jeune-suisse-il-y-a-23-ans-1709919#item=1)\n\n[***https://www.elle.fr/Societe/News/Meurtre-dans-les-dunes-de-Carcans-1-5-Silja-avait-18-ans-4185215***](https://www.elle.fr/Societe/News/Meurtre-dans-les-dunes-de-Carcans-1-5-Silja-avait-18-ans-4185215)\n\n[***https://www.elle.fr/Societe/News/Meurtre-dans-les-dunes-de-Carcans-2-5-Un-mode-operatoire-d-une-cruaute-absolue-4186126***](https://www.elle.fr/Societe/News/Meurtre-dans-les-dunes-de-Carcans-2-5-Un-mode-operatoire-d-une-cruaute-absolue-4186126) ***(The remaining three parts of this report were paywalled and I couldn't find a way around them)***\n\n[***https://www.sudouest.fr/gironde/carcans/tv7-enquete-l-affaire-silja-trindler-l-enigme-de-carcans-plage-14768169.php?csnt=195e4bc630d***](https://www.sudouest.fr/gironde/carcans/tv7-enquete-l-affaire-silja-trindler-l-enigme-de-carcans-plage-14768169.php?csnt=195e4bc630d)\n\n[***https://www.closermag.fr/vecu/faits-divers/cold-case.-qui-a-tue-silja-cette-jeune-campeuse-etouffee-dans-le-sable-des-dunes-de-gironde-1708309#item=1***](https://www.closermag.fr/vecu/faits-divers/cold-case.-qui-a-tue-silja-cette-jeune-campeuse-etouffee-dans-le-sable-des-dunes-de-gironde-1708309#item=1) \n\n[***https://france3-regions.francetvinfo.fr/nouvelle-aquitaine/gironde/elle-ete-tuee-carcans-plage-en-aout-2000-les-gendarmes-relancent-un-appel-temoin-457973.html***](https://france3-regions.francetvinfo.fr/nouvelle-aquitaine/gironde/elle-ete-tuee-carcans-plage-en-aout-2000-les-gendarmes-relancent-un-appel-temoin-457973.html)\n\n[***https://www.letemps.ch/societe/une-nouvelle-piste-laffaire-meurtre-dune-jeune-suissesse-france***](https://www.letemps.ch/societe/une-nouvelle-piste-laffaire-meurtre-dune-jeune-suissesse-france)\n\n[***https://www.20minutes.fr/bordeaux/49958-20050408-bordeaux-carcans-analyses-d-adn-en-serie***](https://www.20minutes.fr/bordeaux/49958-20050408-bordeaux-carcans-analyses-d-adn-en-serie)\n\n[***https://www.ladepeche.fr/article/2014/04/22/1868033-meurtre-de-la-plage-de-carcans-l-enquete-relancee.html***](https://www.ladepeche.fr/article/2014/04/22/1868033-meurtre-de-la-plage-de-carcans-l-enquete-relancee.html)\n\n[***https://www.faitsdivers.org/39713-Une-campeuse-de-18-ans-retrouvee-morte-etranglee-sur-une-plage-l-enquete-relancee-23-ans-apres.html***](https://www.faitsdivers.org/39713-Une-campeuse-de-18-ans-retrouvee-morte-etranglee-sur-une-plage-l-enquete-relancee-23-ans-apres.html)",

      "text": "TLDR; On April 13, 1994, while walking home from school, two young boys searching for recyclables discovered the body of a newborn baby girl in a trash can at Temple Park in Franklin, Indiana. An autopsy revealed the baby's cause of death as multiple stab wounds. Her death was ruled a homicide. \n\nOfficers investigating the case nicknamed the unidentified baby as \"Baby Hope.” With help from the community, donations were collected to provide a proper funeral and headstone for her. Unfortunately, despite a years long investigation, the case went cold and Baby Hope has remained unidentified until today. \n\nJust hours ago, Indiana State Police announced they have finally identified Baby Hope, and her parents. Unfortunately, Hope’s mother, Cheryl Larson, passed away in 2018. Her father has been identified as Paul Richard Shepherd. Paul is cooperating with police and claims to have had no knowledge of the pregnancy. \n\nAlso questioned was Richard Larson, Cheryl’s ex-husband. At the time of Hope’s death, Cheryl and Richard were married and living with one another near the park where Hope’s body was found. No further information about Richard has been released. \n\nNo arrests have been made, however this is an ongoing investigation. \n\nFull Update Article from The Indianapolis Star:\n\n“After more than 31 years, police have finally identified the parents of a newborn baby girl found stabbed to death in a Johnson County trash can.\n\nThe breakthrough brings \"a degree of closure for our community,\" Franklin Police Department Chief Kirby Cochran said on July 14, but questions remain.\n\nAt about 5 p.m. on April 13, 1994, two boys were rifling through a garbage can looking for recyclables in Franklin's Temple Park where they made a horrific discovery. Among the refuse was the body of a newborn baby girl. She had been stabbed to death.\n\nPolice in the town of just shy of 15,000 people at that time were unable to identify the girl or her family members. She was dubbed Baby Hope, and the community pooled funds for a proper burial and headstone. About 150 attended her funeral.\n\nHope never strayed far from the community's mind: to this day, fresh flowers decorate her grave. Investigators pursued hundreds of leads across the country, but the case went cold. Baby Hope's case was officially reopened in 2019 after a technique called genetic genealogy proved successful in cracking long-term unsolved cases.\n\nThe process involves using public DNA databases to find close family members of an unknown person. Investigators, who had a sample of Hope's DNA, worked with the Indiana State Crime Lab and forensic company Parabon NanoLabs to find Hope's relatives.\n\nHope's biological mother was identified as Cheryl Dawn Larson. In 1994, she lived near Temple Park with her then-husband, Richard Noel Larson. She would have been either 30 or 31 years old at the time of Hope's birth. Richard Larson was not the baby's biological father and police would not provide more information about him.\n\nCheryl Larson died in 2018, and investigators are \"unable to obtain further information to determine her level of involvement\" with Hope's homicide, investigations commander Lt. Chris Tennell said. Though Cheryl Larson was unable to be interviewed, detectives spoke with her friends and neighbors from that time.\n\nThat led to the identity of the baby's biological father, Paul Richard Shepherd.\n\nIn a written statement, Shepherd said that he was \"completely unaware\" of the pregnancy.\n\n\"The very thought that a child fathered by him was subjected to such evil is one he cannot escape from,\" Shepherd wrote. He asked for privacy as he processes the revelation.\n\nPolice said Shepherd has cooperated with the investigation. Given the opportunity to name the little girl, he chose the name Hope Shepherd to honor the officers' commitment to getting justice in the case.\n\nCharges will not be filed against anyone at this time, but the case isn't closed, Cochran said.\n\nNo suspect has officially been named in Hope's killing. Cochran asked members of the community to come forward with any information that they may have in light of the recent breakthrough.\n\n\"The DNA process that we use today is magnificent, but in this case, it's only a partial answer because we still have open questions,\" Coroner Michael Pruitt said. \"And DNA is not going to answer those questions for us, necessarily. It's the public.\"\n\nWith the identification of Hope, no other unidentified person cases remain in the county.”\n\n**Sources**\n\n[Indianapolis Star Article](https://www.indystar.com/story/news/crime/2025/07/14/franklin-county-hope-doe-identified-after-more-than-three-decades/85190972007/)\n\n[Fox59 Article](https://fox59.com/indiana-news/franklin-police-to-give-update-on-baby-hope-case/)\n\n[Full Video of Press Conference](https://www.youtube.com/live/yT5lOg2FNtc?si=7pc9Ns5Q-jc1p4_6)",

Apparently the freezer was left in the home after it was sold and the people who purchased the freezer found the body parts when they picked it up. DNA testing was performed and authorities determined they belonged to Amanda, who was the daughter of the previous owner of the home. According to police, no missing person's report was ever filed and it appears no one was ever looking for Amanda. \n\nI think it's pretty clear that Amanda was killed by someone close to her, whether that be her parents/guardian or another family member who had access to the home.

At the time of her disappearance, it was suspected that she may have been in a romantic relationship with an older man. \n\nIn December 2024, the police issued a renewed appeal to locate Sheila, sharing a photograph of her from the time of her disappearance on their website and social media platforms. It appears the police had recently discovered the photo and decided to share in the hope that someone would be able to recognize Sheila. The photo can be viewed on the websites cited in the \"Sources\" section below.\n\nWithin hours of the appeal, members of the public provided crucial information that enabled officers to solve one of the force's longest-running missing person cases.\n\nNo further information about why Sheila vanished is available at this time.\n\n**Sources**\n\n* [https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cwyxm7wrk8mo](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cwyxm7wrk8mo)\n* [https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-14241289/missing-woman-case-vanished-alive.html](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-14241289/missing-woman-case-vanished-alive.html)",

      "title": "Catherine Hoggle is reindicted for murder of her two children, 3 year od Sarah and two year old Jacob",
      "text": "[Catherine Hoggle reindicted on murder charges of missing children; bond review hearing scheduled](https://www.fox5dc.com/news/montgomery-county-mother-catherine-hoggle-reindicted-murder-charges-missing-children)  \n\nIn this very very sad case, Catherine Hoggle, mother of three young children, was diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia and was involuntarily committed to a psychiatric hospital in 2013. She was released to a group home and eventually went back to living with her children and their father, Troy Turner, in Montgomery County, Maryland. Catherine was in a day program, was on medication, and was not supposed to be alone with the children.  [Edited to add: This last part was decided by the family, not part of a discharge plan from the treatment center or physicians.]\n\nOn Sept. 7, 2014, Catherine was at her parents' house with the children and told them she was going to get some pizza. She took 2-year-old Jacob with her. She came back two hours later without any pizza, saying she left Jacob with friends. They believed her. The parents took her and Sarah home.  \n\nTroy worked a late shift. Coming home, he checked Jacob's crib, which was empty. But he thought Jacob had climbed out to sleep with his older brother, as sometimes happened. The next morning, Catherine and Sarah were gone along with Jacob. As Troy was calling 911, Catherine returned, saying she had taken both kids to a day care center in Germantown, MD. He believed her. Later, when it was time to pick up the kids, Catherine couldn't remember the name of the center or where it was. They drove around and around fruitlessly. Troy was going to the police, but on the way, Catherine asked him to stop at Chik-Fil-A. She then ran out the back door of the restaurant. She disappeared for four days, and when police found her, she could not account for the children's whereabouts. She was charged with misdemeanor child neglect but deemed not mentally competent to be tried. She was committed to a maximum security psychiatric hospital and has been institutionalized ever since. Sarah and Jacob have never been found.  \n\nThree years later, in 2017, Catherine was indicted on two counts of murder. Hospital psychiatrists deemed her incompetent to stand trial. A second opinion was sought in 2022, with the doctor agreeing that Catherine was not mentally competent to stand trial. Under Maryland law, with Catherine having been deemed incompetent for 5 years, the murder charges had to be dropped. She was ordered to remain hospitalized because she is a danger to herself and others.  \n\nSome in the family believe she is feigning mental illness. All she will say about the children is that they are safe. Troy Turner believes she murdered them.  \n\nOn July 23, 2025, Catherine was discharged from the hospital, though her attorney says she is still under civil confinement. Once they learned of this, the prosecutors moved quickly to indict her and take her into custody. She was scheduled for a bond hearing today, Aug. 4. So far there is no information about new evidence, and it seems the prosecutors took advantage of the opportunity once the hospital discharged her.  \n\nFrom local WTOP News:  \n\"Police ask anyone with information is to visit the Crime Solvers of Montgomery County website and click on the “www.p3tips.com” link at the top of the page or call 1-866-411-8477.

      "title": "Is the disappearance of Cindy Song connected to the chilling crimes of PA serial killer Hugo Selenski?",
      "text": "On a crisp Halloween night in 2001, and Penn State student Cindy Song (Hyun Jung) was ready and dressed for a night of fun. She celebrated with friends at a college bar in downtown State College, Pennsylvania and returned to her apartment in the early morning hours on Nov 1. But by the time the sun rose, Cindy was gone. She had vanished without a trace and with no signs of a struggle. Investigators quickly ruled out that Cindy disappeared of her own accord and speculated that she had voluntarily left her apartment in the early morning hours for a quick jaunt to a nearby 24-hour grocery store, but had met with foul play before she could return.\n\nIt was not until the crimes of Pennsylvania serial killer Hugo Selenski were uncovered that hinted a possible connection to Cindy’s case.\n\nHugo Marcus Selenski grew up in Dallas, PA. Despite his adolescence being riddled by petty crimes and substance abuse, he was attractive and well-liked and had fathered three children before age 20. His first major crime was a bank robbery, which landed him 7 years in prison. After release, he continued a life of crime with another criminal he met while in jail-Paul Weakley-as well as a childhood friend, Patrick Russin. Together, the trio would rob drug dealers of money and drugs. After being collared for a home invasion, Hugo’s partners in crime quickly turned on him, revealing to investigators that Hugo was responsible for the murders of a missing couple-pharmacist Michael Kerkowski and his girlfriend, Tammy Lynn Fassett.\n\nWhile family and friends reported the couple missing and were very concerned for their welfare, authorities assumed they had absconded. Kerkowski had been facing a 40-year jail sentence for selling prescription medications illegally, insurance fraud, and reckless endangerment of another person.\n\nIn 2003, on a property belonging to Hugo’s girlfriend at the time, detectives found the bodies of the missing couple as well as the bodies of two men. In addition, they found a body they were not able to identify (even to this day) as well as bone fragments from a burn pit that belonged to as many as 12 victims.\n\nAfter being charged with murder, Hugo successfully escaped the maximum-security prison using bedsheets to scale down the building and a mattress to cover the razor fence. He was apprehended after three days on the run. He remains in prison serving a life sentence.\n\n**Connection to Cindy Song**\n\nPaul Weakley also told investigators that Hugo and Michael Kerkowski had picked up Cindy Song in State College and held her at Kerkowski’s house, assaulting her until she died. Weakley was not present during the alleged abduction, but stated Hugo had told him about it. He said that Cindy’s body would be found on Kerkowski’s property. However, Cindy’s body was never found. Police did find evidence that Weakley had searches related to Cindy’s disappearance on his computer. All the other information Weakley gave to investigators was true, but is it possible that Weakley lied about Cindy to for his own advantage? Was he searching for evidence the alleged abduction was true? Or did he have something to do with her disappearance himself?\n\nPolice in Cindy’s case still believe there are avenues to pursue, and the cold case team are actively following up on her case.\n\n[Selenski gets up to 65 years in Saylorsburg home invasion](https://www.poconorecord.com/story/news/crime/2009/09/22/selenski-gets-up-to-65/51858926007/)\n\n[The Unsolved — Cindy Song vanishes from State College | wnep.com](https://www.wnep.com/article/news/investigations/action-16/the-unsolved/the-unsolved-cindy-song-vanishes-from-state-college-penn-state-university-park-disappearance-missing-hugo-selenski-paul-weakley/523-fd76eb42-d14f-4be3-9692-831a2e144151)\n\nLewis, E.

      "title": "Katie Janness, Bowie, and the Questions That Remain - 4 years later",
      "text": "Today marks four years since Katie Janness and her beloved dog Bowie were brutally murdered in Piedmont Park in the early morning hours of July 28th, 2021. Their case remains unsolved. Please share to keep their memory, and the fight for justice, alive.\n\nIf you have any information regarding this case, tips can be submitted anonymously in the following ways:\n\n- Call the CSGA tip line at (404) -577-8477\n- Visit www.stopcrimeatl.org\n- Use the P3 app\n- Text CSGA to 738477\n\nA summary of the case: **(TW: graphic content and animal cruelty)**\n\nKatherine (Katie) Janness was a 40-year-old bartender, singer-songwriter, poet, and a beloved wife and friend. Known for her creative spirit and gentle nature, those who knew her described her as truly one of a kind. At the time of her death, she had been with her partner, Emma Clark, for seven years. The couple lived and worked in Midtown Atlanta, where they shared their lives with two pit bulls; Katie’s 14-year-old dog, Tori, and Emma’s 3-year-old, Bowie. Though each dog had a technical “owner,” Katie and Emma cared for them equally, building a loving, shared home centered around music, community, and companionship.\n\n**Murder of Katie and Bowie**\n\nOn the night of Tuesday, July 27, 2021, around 11:00 PM, Katie took Bowie for a walk through her Midtown Atlanta neighborhood, a routine she often followed especially after working late shifts. Although Katie had the night off, her partner of seven years, Emma Clark, was working at Henry’s Tavern, located nearby. At approximately 11:35 PM, Katie and Bowie stopped by Henry’s to say hello to Emma. During their brief conversation, the two agreed that Katie would return later to walk Emma home after her shift. Emma said she’d text Katie once she was done and it would be likely within the hour. Katie then left the tavern and resumed her walk with Bowie, heading toward Piedmont Park, a regular and familiar stop on their nightly route, just a few blocks away.\n\nAround 12:20am, Emma finished her shift and texted Katie that she was done. After texts and calls to Katie went unanswered, Emma assumed her phone had died and decided to just walk the few blocks home to their apartment. After arriving home and finding neither Katie nor Bowie there and calls/texts still going unanswered, Emma used the \"find my iPhone\" feature to check Katies location. Emma could see it was pinging inside Piedmont Park, but not moving. Concerned, Emma decided to ride her bike the short distance over to the park to see if Katie had maybe dropped her phone on accident.\n\nA little after 1am, Emma arrived on her bicycle at the entrance of Piedmont Park at Charles Allen Drive and 10th Street, still tracking Katie’s phone, which now appeared close. As she entered the park, she noticed a dark figure lying in the street about 50 feet ahead. As she moved closer, she realized it was their dog, Bowie. The park was dimly lit, but it was clear he had been severely injured or killed. Panic set in as Emma began scanning the area for Katie. Off to the right, under a tree and some distance ahead of her just off the road, she spotted what looked like someone lying on the ground. As she approached, she recognized it was Katie, and nothing could have prepared her for what she saw. Katie had been brutally attacked. She had been stabbed more than 50 times, mutilated, and nearly disemboweled. Emma checked for a pulse, but it was clear Katie was already gone. Fearing for her own life, she ran back toward the park entrance while calling 911.\n\n[Here is the link to the 911 call](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0TRtfxCVfQ) **(trigger warning : distressing)**\n\nAPD does not know the exact time Katie and Bowie died but have put it between a very narrow: 12:20am to 1am.\n\n**Here is a quick timeline of the more important details in this case:**\n\n* **11:00 PM** \\- Katie takes Bowie for a nightly walk in Midtown. \n* **11:35 PM** \\- Katie stops by Henry’s Tavern, where Emma is working. Agree that Katie will return when Emma is done with her shift, Emma says within an hour, they will walk home together. \n* **12:09 AM** \\- Katie and Bowie are seen on surveillance footage at the rainbow crosswalk on 10th Street and Piedmont Ave, headed towards Piedmont Park. Last known siting of them alive. \n* **12:20ish am** \\- Emma finishes her shift and texts Katie but gets no reply, decides to walk home. \n* **12:30- 12:45 AM** – Emma arrives home and Katie and Bowie are not there. Emma uses Find My iPhone to see where Katie’s phone is. It’s pinging inside Piedmont Park and not moving. Emma decides to hop her bike to go find Katie. \n* **1am (or a little after)** \\- Emma arrives at Piedmont Park and finds Katie and Bowie brutally murdered \n* **1:10am**\\- Emma calls 911\n\n**What we know about the crime:**\n\nKatie was declared dead at the scene, as well as her dog Bowie. The FBI were called in immediately to help, which is uncommon for murders in the city. An extensive search operation unfolded with help from the FBI and other state partners. Law enforcement combed through Piedmont Park, carefully inspecting the grounds for any potential evidence. Dive teams searched the small lake within the park, I assume in hopes to uncover a weapon or signs that the perpetrator may have attempted to wash up after the attack. Police also canvassed the surrounding neighborhoods, seeking out clues and reviewing surveillance footage that might shed light on the crime. We know they cut down part of the tree Katie was found near and was taken into evidence.\n\n**APD alongside the FBI and other state partners, held a press conference a few days after Katies murder. We learned that the FBI was brought in immediately, within the first few hours, due to the unique and highly unusual nature of this crime.**\n\n**APD Chief quoted *\"This crime was so unique that I felt that we needed to collaborate with as many resources as we possibly can.\"***\n\n[APD chief at first presser regarding Katie Janness murder, speaks on the unique nature of this crime therefore bringing in FBI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9P6dtr_Ak1M)\n\n4 months later in November of 2021, Atlanta PD would release Katies autopsy report, and it gives the public an understanding just how uniquely brutal this crime was. Katies pants were pulled down around her knees. Her phone was on the ground near her body, her expensive headphones were found on her, one still in her right ear at the time of autopsy. She had $5 in her pocket. Investigators have ruled out robbery as a motive.\n\nKaties autopsy findings:\n\n* **Suffered more than 50 stab wounds**, primarily to her face, chest, and torso \n* The **letters** **“F\" \"A\" \"T” was carved into her torso**, indicating possible intent to deface or send a message \n* **At least 15 stab wounds to her head** **including both eyes** reflecting extreme violence \n* **Significant mutilation observed** to her breasts and upper torso (a specific tattoo particularly) \n*  **Blunt-force trauma to her head, neck, and extremities**, separate from stab wounds \n* Cause of death: **sharp-force injuries; manner: homicide**  \n* **Members of both the APD and FBI are present for the autopsy** \n\n[Katie Janness Autopsy Report](https://static.fox5atlanta.com/www.fox5atlanta.com/content/uploads/2021/11/Katie-Janness-Autopsy.pdf) **(Extreme Trigger warning)**\n\n**Suspects**\n\nAPD has released no suspects at this time. There are many theories on what kind of individual committed this heinous crime in online communities. The most popular theory I see on here is that it was likely either a mentally ill person having a psychotic break or a homeless person on drugs. Some people think it could've been Emma, as police haven't publicly ruled her out as a suspect even after her pleas for them to do so. \n\n**I don’t believe Emma had any part in this crime. If anything, she’s another victim in all of this.**\n\nhttps://www.fox5atlanta.com/news/piedmont-park-murder-a-familiarity-between-victim-and-killer-investigators-say\n\n\nEdit: to add, Atlanta is the most surveilled city in the US and one of the most surveilled cities in the world. Atlanta PD prides themselves on this. \n\nReference on data surveillance in Atlanta: \nhttps://mappingatlanta.org/2025/06/09/city-of-cameras/\n\n[APD suggests familiarity between victim and killer])\n\nThere has also been hints at the suspect staying in the park after the crime to watch the victim be found. Fulton County's District Attorney Fani T. Willis would state to the Washington Post:\n\n*\"It's a very frightening crime... strange. Most people commit a murder and want to get the hell away because they don't want to be caught.\"*\n\n**APD Update: 6/16/25**\n\n**Relying on DNA to solve this case**\n\nThe link to most recent update [https://www.atlantapd.org/Home/Components/News/News/1219/71](https://www.atlantapd.org/Home/Components/News/News/1219/71)\n\nOther links on this crime:\n\n[https://people.com/crime/atlanta-woman-stabbed-50-times-and-had-the-letters-f-a-t-carved-into-chest/](https://people.com/crime/atlanta-woman-stabbed-50-times-and-had-the-letters-f-a-t-carved-into-chest/)\n\n[https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/brutal-killing-of-a-woman-and-her-dog-in-an-atlanta-park-reignites-the-debate-over-citys-growing-crime-problem/2021/09/13/eae59cb2-0740-11ec-a266-7c7fe02fa374\\_story.html](https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/brutal-killing-of-a-woman-and-her-dog-in-an-atlanta-park-reignites-the-debate-over-citys-growing-crime-problem/2021/09/13/eae59cb2-0740-11ec-a266-7c7fe02fa374_story.html)\n\n[https://www.wsbtv.com/news/local/atlanta/atlanta-police-seek-answers-nearly-4-years-after-woman-dog-stabbed-death-piedmont-park/JV4ODQNLVFFN7L5J3QSLXP47JM/](https://www.wsbtv.com/news/local/atlanta/atlanta-police-seek-answers-nearly-4-years-after-woman-dog-stabbed-death-piedmont-park/JV4ODQNLVFFN7L5J3QSLXP47JM/)",

      "title": "Dec. 2019, 4-year-old Hayden Manis spends Christmas Eve with his extended family. Sept. 2024, they find out he has been missing for almost 5 years. What happened to Hayden Manis?",
      "text": "The last time his grandfather saw 4-year-old Hayden Ian Lee Manis was Christmas Eve 2019. The occasion was a family gathering at his great-grandmother's house in Muncie, IN, where he was described happily running around and opening presents. Hayden was there with his father, Dustin Manis. The two would never attend another family event.  \n\nHayden, born May 15, 2015, had already had a life of upheaval which was belied by his bright eyes and big smile. At just one year old, he was removed from his parents' custody because drug tests showed they were using cocaine. The same year, Dustin was discovered in a motel room with Hayden, with heroin openly in the room. The Department of Child Services in Indiana removed Hayden, placing him in the custody of Dustin's father Gary Manis. The two became close, and “Paw Paw” said Hayden was a “good kid” who never gave him any trouble.  Hayden liked best to shadow Paw Paw, whatever he was doing. But these happy times were about to end. After a year and a half, in 2018, Dustin completed his court-ordered probation and drug treatment and petitioned the court for custody of his so (Hayden's mother, Terri Williams, was allegedly in prison for drug charges). Gary Manis pleaded for them not to take Hayden away, to no avail. The court ruled in Dustin's favor, and DCS did not object. Hayden was then not quite three years old.    \n\nDuring 2018 and 2019, the extended family saw Hayden and Dustin fairly often, though the visits became less frequent over time. Dustin's mother Leanna died in May 2019. (She and his father were not together.) If she and Dustin were close, her death would have been a blow. Perhaps it affected some of the subsequent events, including his ongoing addiction struggles. It is alleged that Dustin and Gary had a fight, which may explain why visits tapered off. After Christmas 2019, they stopped. Hayden's aunt Chloe posted on Facebook in 2024 that Dustin thought they were trying to get Hayden away from him, and that was why he stopped in person contact.  \n\nFamily members describe Dustin as gentle and good with kids. However, the fact remained that he had a history of addiction. The lack of contact was worrisome for his relatives. Texts were exchanged with his aunts, who frequently invited and even urged him to come with Hayden to family events. Dustin would respond that he would try, but the two never came. Dustin moved out of Muncie in 2021, and stopped responding to the texts. His last message, on May 18, 2023, read “Hey aunt barb, I promise on everything all is well. i promise u [I]ve just been having a lot going on try to work on my family that I am making and what not I appreciate u reaching out and checking but i'm just doing what I promised my mom id do when she was on here deathbed and that was look out for what make me happy and doing what ever it may be to keep my self happy I'm doing good and I'm doing right and I'm work in on making the family I've always wanted.” - [Katie Hawkinson, *The Independent*, 2/11/25](https://www.the-independent.com/news/world/americas/crime/hayden-manis-indiana-disappearance-case-b2694396.html)  \nAt one point, Dustin was living in Eaton, IN. He also lived with his girlfriend in a house in Muncie owned by her father. Hayden should have been with him, but neighbors have said they saw two girls, but they never saw a boy child outside the house.  \n\nIn September 2024, Dustin's two great-grandmothers happened to meet in a store in Muncie. During the course of their conversation, it came out that one great-grandmother had been told by Dustin that Hayden had been taken again by DCS in 2022. This contradicted the messages from Dustin that everything was fine, and Hayden was fine. Concerned, the Manis family contacted the state as well as the police. DCS said there was no record of Hayden having been removed since he had been released to Dustin in 2018. Thus began a police investigation into Hayden's whereabouts.  \n\nWhen law enforcement found Dustin Manis in September 2024, Hayden was not with him. Dustin claimed that Hayden had been taken away by DCS and given to his mother in 2022. This proved to be untrue. In fact, once the investigation began, Hayden's mother posted on Facebook pleading for anyone who knew anything about his whereabouts to come forward. Though the linked articles show a photo of Hayden's Head Start graduation (June 2018), there was no record of him having been enrolled in any school. He would have been 8 or 9 by this time.  Police began to suspect that Hayden was dead, and Dustin was their prime suspect in whatever may have happened to him.    \n\nIn November 2024, Dustin was pulled over for a traffic stop. To explain his nervousness, he mentioned that he had recently been questioned by police about the whereabouts of his son. Police found heroin, meth, and a syringe on him. Dustin was arrested and was charged on Dec. 4. His grandmother put up $30,000 bond. A few days after his release, on Dec. 15, Dustin died of an overdose. The coroner's report described the cause of death as acute mixed drug intoxication. The last person who was known to be with Hayden can no longer speak to what happened to him.  \n\nPolice searched  houses where Dustin was known to have lived, including with the use of cadaver dogs. This includes a house where Dustin lived with a girlfriend, Crystal Hall, and her daughters. Her father owned the house; father and daughter have been interviewed  but deny any knowledge of Hayden. They moved out of state in 2021. Police are continuing the search for Hayden and went public with the story in February 2025. They believe Hayden went missing in 2020. There were reports that a witness saw him in January, which is listed as his date of disappearance on NamUs and The Charley Project. Muncie Crime Stoppers posted a $1,000 reward for information leading directly to the discovery of Hayden. To this day, Hayden remains missing. His family are coming to believe that he is no longer alive. But they continue to search, wanting to know what happened to him. As for law enforcement, the Delaware County prosecutor stated: “There are very few days I come to this office and I don’t think about Hayden Manis...This case is on my mind, and it’s on the investigators’ minds on a daily basis. We’re not going to stop until we get to an answer. We need to know the truth.” -  [Katie Hawkinson, *The Independent*, 2/11/25](https://www.the-independent.com/news/world/americas/crime/hayden-manis-indiana-disappearance-case-b2694396.html)   \n\nTheories  \n\nA person connected to the Manis family made a lurid post on Facebook about what happened to Hayden – abuse and murder that happened during the time he lived in Muncie with his girlfriend. She alleged that Dustin confessed this to law enforcement. None of this has been corroborated. She posted it on social media and police asked her to take it down.  County prosecutor Hoffman appeared on Nancy Grace's show (February 2025) and agreed that there is a report that Hayden was abused, murdered, and his body dumped. It has not been verified. Hoffman did say there are haunting aspects to the case.  \n\nSome people theorize that Hayden was trafficked. I have not read any solid theories about this.  \n\nTo me, it seems most likely that Hayden met with an accident while in Dustin's care. There are so many ways this could have happened. There was a pond near one of the houses where Dustin lived, to give one possibility. Hayden could have wandered away while not being watched. He could have had a fall. Dustin was struggling with addiction and was not a person who should have been responsible for a child. Given Dustin's personality as described by his family, I think it was a case of neglect or carelessness rather than anything more sinister. I can't quite reconcile “gentle and good with kids” with  “child abuser and murderer.” Furthermore, reports say that the girlfriend had daughters also living in the house. It doesn't add up for me. However, if Hayden really did die or disappear from Dustin's care in 2020, his texts to family read oddly. In the last contact, he refers twice to making a family.  \n\nMany have criticized Dustin's family for not realizing that Hayden was missing. I don't think this is fair. It should be remembered that Covid lockdown occurred about 4 months after they last saw Hayden. Nothing was normal for in-person contact for the rest of that year. The family did continue to reach out – one aunt says there was an invitation every month.  Then the following year, Dustin moved out of town. The bigger question for me is why Hayden's mother wasn't seeing him. She lived in the area and when the investigation began, she made a plea for information on social media.  \n\nHowever it happened, it is so sad that this little boy with the big smile almost certainly came to a tragic end. Still, though the timeline is old, the investigation is new. Perhaps someone will come forward with vital information so Hayden can have justice and Hayden's loved ones can have peace.  \n\nAnyone with information about Hayden Manis can contact the Delaware County sheriff's department's investigative division at 765-747-7881. Crime stoppers can  be called at 765-286-4050.  \n\nSources  \n\n[WTHR - 13 Investigates: Family, police just discovered Muncie boy has been missing 5 years, fear he is dead](https://www.wthr.com/article/news/investigations/13-investigates/hayden-manis-missing-boy-son-family-delaware-county-muncie-indiana-prosecutor-eric-hoffman-lost-dead-child-gary-dustin-heroin-drugs-addiction-overdose/531-f0e7e0df-866d-4f16-adf9-4b1f437aa660)  \n[Reward offered for Muncie boy missing since 2019](https://www.wthr.com/article/news/crime/reward-offered-muncie-boy-missing-5-years-hayden-manis-dustin-delaware-county-sheriff-police-lost-dead-child-gary-indiana/531-9e0e66ee-6827-42ca-b60b-dbc3ac5f494e)  \n[Where is Hayden?

      "text": "[Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/UnresolvedMysteries/comments/1auptkj/lori_paige_a_twelve_year_old_missing_for_eight/) is a great write-up about Lori's case.\n\nLori was a 12-year-old African American girl from Tallahassee, Florida. At the time of her disappearance, she was a student at Griffin Middle School and described as a studious girl who was \"afraid of making bad grades\". She went missing on June 2nd, 2023. According to some sources, she had a history of running away from home but would always return on her own after a short time. She was never seen again after her June 2023 disappearance.\n\nToday, 04/11/2025, the Tallahassee Police Department revealed that Lori has been found deceased. They did not give any details on the location of her remains or what led to her discovery. Her father, Andrew Wiley, was arrested and charged with her murder. He was the one to initially report her missing and who had her mother removed from his property shortly before Lori disappeared, allegedly because of an argument. He stated that Lori left with a backpack. According to police, there have been inconsistencies in his story about Lori's disappearance, and his phone revealed \"questionable\" internet searches.\n\nEdit: I apologize, I just added another news link I forgot to include when I first posted this update.

      "text": "This happened in my hometown of Tinley Park, IL in a Lane Bryant (women’s clothing store). In 2008, a horrible tragedy happened in a women’s clothing store where 5 women were taken hostage in the back of the store killed in a seemingly botched robbery where the perpetrator was never found. I remember being terrified the entire weekend that this happened because the gunman was at large. It’s unbelievable that no one has come forward. There was a 6th survivor who’s identity is unknown for privacy. She narrowly avoided the perpetrator’s gunshot and played dead. She was able to give a description. \n\nThere was also a fast police response after a 911 call was made while the perpetrator was in the store. There is an audio recording of this call that can be found online, and the perpetrators voice can be heard in the background. By the time police arrived, he had fled and has remained at large to this day. Charlie Minn is making a documentary about the incident. \n\nAfter the incident, cameras were installed all over the shopping mall as I noticed when frequenting the area. It’s interesting to me that there were not any cctv cameras that caught anything on film aside from the perpetrators car, which is unconfirmed.\n\nTo this day, there is minimal information about the crime available online. \n\nObviously, there are people that know the killer that have not come forward. \n\nTo me; the crime is seemingly random, and I doubt that the killer was from the area. The mall is so close to the highway, allowing people to get away quickly. \n\nLink: https://wgntv.com/news/south-suburbs/anger-fuels-me-filmmaker-begins-shooting-for-lane-bryant-murders-documentary/",

      "title": "Tyler Davis left his wife and friend at their hotel for a walk at 3 am and never came back. What happened to Tyler?",
      "text": "The Strange Disappearance of Tyler Davis  \n\n**EDITED** - After submitting this write-up, I listened to the 2 episodes done by True Crime Garage in April 2019. They did a lengthy interview with Brittany that clears up some questions, and gives more background and detail. I am adding this to the write-up. The bolded parts are from Brittany's comments.  \n\nBrittany Davis, mother of a 20-month-old, was turning 23, and she planned to celebrate. She and her husband Tyler (29) were booked for a night at a hotel, with Tyler's parents watching the baby. Tyler and Brittany had met while working together in 2013. They got married and became parents four years later in 2017.  They lived in the town of Wilmington, Ohio, about 60 miles from Columbus. The weekend of February 23, 2019 they had booked a hotel stay at the Hilton Hotel at Easton Town Center in Columbus. The hotel is part of a complex of stores, restaurants, and bars, so there would be plenty to do on their getaway. **In order to be able to take off both Saturday and Sunday, Tyler had worked 10-12 hour shifts for the previous six days. He got home around 3 a.m. on the 23rd, and the couple got to bed about 5:30-6 a.m. This wasn't completely unusual for them, because both had night jobs and got home at 2:30 or 3. But Brittany says the 6 long days had left Tyler exhausted.**\n\nOn Saturday the 23rd they met Tyler's parents for lunch before handing off their son to be cared for by his grandparents overnight. Tyler and Brittany checked into the hotel about 5 p.m., where they relaxed for a few hours. About 7 p.m. they were joined by a longtime friend of Tyler's. (Most sources have not named him, so I will refer to him as a friend.)  **A couple of Brittany's friends were also supposed to join them, but didn't show.** The three left the hotel at about 9 pm to sample what Easton Town Center had to offer in the way of nightlife. They had drinks at Bar Louie and Adobe Gilas, leaving the latter around midnight. They then moved on to The Dollhouse, a local strip club, and were there till closing time around 2 a.m. **Brittany was leaving the ladies' room when closing time came, and she overheard Tyler arguing with the door man about having to wait for his wife.**  \n\nTyler fell asleep in the Uber on the way back to their hotel, and when they arrived, he was confused as to where they were. **Brittany said he is hard to wake up, especially if he's been drinking. She described him as \"pissed off\" and \"grumpy.\"**  He argued that this wasn't their hotel, and the Uber driver was getting impatient. When he finally he got out of the car, he took off walking away. It was now around 3:20 a.m.  \n\nBrittany said she would follow him, but Tyler's friend offered to do it. Brittany went up to their room to recharge her phone. She came back downstairs at about 3:30 am, but neither Tyler nor the friend were in sight. Tyler didn't pick up when she called his cell phone, but he called back at 3:37 saying he was just taking a walk around the block and would be back soon. Shortly after this, the friend came back to the hotel alone, saying Tyler was just blowing off steam and would be back soon. Brittany kept trying to call Tyler, but never got through to him until he called her at 4:10 a.m. He said he was walking in the woods and could see the hotel. He would be back in five minutes. He called again a minute later, but the call was only a few seconds of silence before being dropped. When Brittany called back, it went straight to voicemail. That 4:10 call is the last time she ever talked to Tyler.  \n\n**The friend said he was going to go home, saying Tyler would be back in a few minutes and not to worry. He said this was \"a hard place to get lost in.\" They argued, but he did leave shortly after that last call.** Brittany started calling around to friends about what she should do. **She tried looking in the direction where Tyler had headed, but stopped short when she got to where there were no lights.** Brittany called hospitals and the police station, in case Tyler had been picked up. A friend who lived locally went out with her in the early morning to drive around  looking for Tyler.  She thought he might have passed out or fallen asleep on a bench outside. **They searched throughout the hotel.** But they didn't find Tyler. \n\n> “Brittany has maintained that Tyler was not an outdoorsman, and that to him, the “woods” could have meant “two trees right beside each other.”  She was also concerned that he still sounded “so confused.” - [Unsolved Cbus: The strange case of Tyler Davis, who vanished on a walk in 2019\n> ](https://614now.com/2024/hot-topics/unsolved-columbus-the-strange-case-of-tyler-davis-who-mysteriously-vanished-on-a-walk-in-2019)  \n\nFinally, Brittany knew something was seriously wrong, and she called Tyler's parents at 9:30 on the 24th.  She called the police about 11:00. At first, the police were dismissive. Brittany says one told her that her husband is a grown man and has the right to leave her if he wants. Someone told her that they wouldn't be able to begin a search for 48 to 72 hours. An officer asked, “Do you know how many missing people there are in Columbus?” She countered, “Do you know how many husbands I have? Do you know how many fathers my son has?”  \n\n**Brittany and her friends didn't want to wait for 48 hours. One friend started combing the woods from mid-afternoon till dark. Brittany went out with friends late on Sunday night into the early hours of Monday. They noticed that there was a hotel on the other side of the Easton Center, that looked exactly like the Hilton but smaller. So it was possible Tyler was seeing the wrong hotel, which expands the possible search area.**  \n\nThe police search began on the Tuesday, using dogs, divers, and helicopters in the search. **They told Brittany they had searched the pond behind Costco. A dog hit near one of the ponds, so it was fully dragged and then later searched again.** After two weeks, there was no sign of Tyler. In October 2019 police released the results of surveillance video near the Hilton, and tracking from Tyler's phone. Video showed the group arriving at 3:18 and  Tyler walking away diagonally through the condominium complex on the Easton site. His phone tracks him to the Abbott Labs parking lot at Stelzer Road and Morse Crossing at 3:53 a.m. before losing contact. There was also a voice recording of Tyler using his phone, apparently asking for directions to the hotel.  Beyond this, there has been no new evidence and no contact.  (See the video [here](https://abc6onyourside.com/news/local/new-plea-for-help-in-search-for-man-missing-from-easton-area-for-more-than-200-days) ).\n\nBrittany passed a polygraph; the friend declined to take one, and has retained a lawyer. **The friend did help in the aftermath of the disappearance.**   \n\nIn March, in hopes of generating more leads, Brittany started the Facebook group Bring Tyler Davis Home. She appeared in the April 23, 2019 episode of True Crime Garage, an Ohio-based podcast with a large audience. Social media grabbed onto the case, but it has not brought out any results. Instead, Brittany has been subjected to having her personal details known, being criticized on a personal level as well as for her role in the disappearance. Tyler's friend also had his information leaked.  In a 2019 interview, the head of the investigating unit cited the social media frenzy as part reason that the department had released little information about the investigation.  \n\nOn December 21, 2021, Tyler Davis was declared presumed deceased by the Clinton County Court. “Lauren Raizk, the attorney representing Tyler Davis wife, Brittany Davis, shared the current “statute for a presumption of death proceeding pursuant” with the News Journal. They indicate a missing person is declared legally deceased after missing for five years, or 'when the person has disappeared and been continuously absent from the person’s place of last domicile without being heard from and was at the beginning of the person’s absence exposed to a specific peril of death, even though the absence has continued for less than a five-year period.' “ - [Wilmington *News Journal,* December 21, 2021](https://www.wnewsj.com/2021/12/21/clinton-county-man-missing-nearly-3-years-declared-deceased-by-court/)   \n\nIn considering this case I'm struck by the tight timeline. With the surveillance footage showing that the group got back to the Hilton at 3:18 am, it all happened in less than an hour. We have this timeline:  \n\n3:18: Party dropped off at the Hilton. Tyler is confused, decides to go for a walk.    \n3:30: Brittany returns to the hotel lobby and doesn't find Tyler or the friend.  Starts calling Tyler.    \n3:37: Tyler calls Brittany, apologizes, says he's going for a walk around the block and will be back soon.  \n3:40 (approx): Friend returns alone, says Tyler is blowing off steam.  \n3:53: Tyler's phone stops recording his position. Last ping is near Abbott Labs site, one and a half miles from the hotel.  \n4:10: Tyler calls Brittany, saying he's walking through woods and can see the hotel, will be back in five minutes.  \n4:11: Tyler calls again, but there is four seconds of silence before the call is dropped.  \n4:12: Brittany calls back, but the call goes straight to voicemail.  \n4:30: Friend leaves the Hilton to go home.  \n\nMy best guess is that Tyler walked into a pond or other body of water. The wetland adjacent to the Abbott property seems a likely place.  It's been searched multiple times, but it sounds like a hard place to find anything. The blog [Murder and Malice](https://murderandmalice.com/2021/01/19/ill-be-right-there-the-disappearance-of-tyler-davis/) describes it as waist-high water with thick vegetation. On the map, it looks sizable. The blog post has screen grabs from the surveillance video showing the relative positions where Tyler was walking, the parking lot, and the wetlands.  If Tyler was this close, he might have stumbled into the swampy area in the dark. It's not a stretch to assume that he was drunk and tired after a long night. Brittany has described him as sounding confused on the phone. It's also possible he had a medical episode and ended up underwater. I somewhat doubt foul play, as it would have to opportunistic, and it's hard to see a motive unless someone followed him from the hotel to rob him. Accident seems much more likely.  \n\n[Here](https://imgur.com/a/fhMf2Eg) is a screenshot from the TV clip shown in October, showing the path per the phone data. [Here](https://imgur.com/a/eUjoepm) I have tried to recreate that path on a larger screenshot including the hotel and what looks to be the wetland or swampy area that was mentioned. It is a mile diagonally from the 3:53 ping to the hotel, so it's doubtful IMO taht Tyler was looking at the Hilton when he said he could see the hotel. He must have mistaken another building for the Hilton, and made for it. And that's when he disappeared/had an accident.  \n\nI definitely do not think Tyler left “to start a new life” or in any way on purpose. His calls show that he was trying to get back to the hotel. It's hard to believe and sad to think about him being so close and yet so far, with most likely tragic consequences.  \n\nI am curious about why the friend came back alone, leaving Tyler to his own devices. It does seem like Tyler wasn't all there. I guess it's possible, even likely, that Tyler shook him off, told him to leave, and he complied.  \n\nThe family has not given up hope, but after almost six years and little information, it is hard. **Brittany spoke of how it affects her son as well as herself.

      "title": "\"Mommy is in the Trees\": Who Killed Diana Robertson and what really happened to Mike Reimer? Puyallup Washington, December 12 1985",
      "text": "Edit: I had to add in Diana’s cause of death because I didn’t when originally wrote this. \n\nDiana Robertson was 21 and Mike Reimer was 36 year old couple living in Puyallup, Washington. They had a two year old daughter named Crystal and had been together for about four years (since Diana was 17). By trade, Mike was a roofer, but in the slower, colder months he had fur traps in the woods that he'd check almost daily.\n\nOn December 12, 1985, Diana, Mike and Crystal set out for the Nisqually River (which is between Interstate 5 and Elbe Washington) where they'd cut down a Christmas tree and Mike could check on his traps. This was just supposed to be day trip. The couple and their daughter did not arrive home that night, so Diana's mom Louise was worried--Diana would never not call her if something was going on. Lloyd Reimer, Mike's dad, would eventually report the couple missing. According to the Lost and Found Blog: *Later that night (technically Friday morning) from 12:30 am to 6:30 am Louise and Mike's best friend Steve Tew drove around the roads by the Nisqually River searching for them.* Nothing was found that night.\n\nMeanwhile, earlier on the day of the 12th, a little girl was found outside a Kmart in Spanaway, Washington. No one saw Crystal being dropped off at the store. This was 30 miles from where the family was going, the girl was Crystal Robertson. Molly Koch, the assistant manager of the Kmart, would tell Unsolved Mysteries that Crystal wasn't crying, but seemed stunned. Molly tried calling for the parents on the store's intercom and then walked Crystal back to the toy department to see if her parents were there, but to no avail. Because her parents weren't easily located, Crystal was turned over to foster care.\n\nThree days later, a nurse at a local medical center saw a picture of Crystal on the local news and recalled her coming in with a foster parent for minor bruises. Because of this, Crystal would be reunited with her grandmother. When questioned about her parents whereabouts, all Crystal could say was that \"mommy is in the trees.\" Because Crystal was only two, this was all she could say about what happened, she couldn't even say who had dropped her off at the Kmart. There was still no sign of Mike and Diana. Lloyd Reimer would say that Mike knew all about how to survive long periods in the wilderness.\n\nOn February 18, 1986, a couple let their dog out to run around. When the dog ran up a logging road and the couple followed it, they found a decomposing body next to a pickup truck. This discovery was made on the Washington 7, three miles south of Elbe and Alder Lake, Washington, a mile off the highway in a heavily forested area. Diana would be positively identified as the body by the truck. She'd also been tied with tube socks and stabbed 17 times. Diana's death was ruled a homicide. Police continued to search the area to look for Mike, but he wasn't found. Lloyd Reimer, Mike's dad, would say that Mike usually didn't place traps at that location.\n\nAt that moment, there began to be some concern that Mike had done something to Diana. The couple had a stormy relationship, there had been several times in which Mike had been cited for domestic violence and he'd even slashed the tires on Diana's car. Because the police were involved in an incident in which Mike kicked down the door at Diana's apartment and threw her to the ground, there was to be a court order would be in place starting January 22, in which Mike was supposed to have no contact with Diana. But because the couple vanished before that date, obviously the order wasn't put in place.\n\nA clue would lead police in the direction that Mike had done something to Diana was a note found in the cab of the pickup truck. The note read: \"I love you Diana.\" While Diana's mom has said that the writing looked like Mike's--police and FBI handwriting analysis couldn't conclusively say. And because Mike hadn't been found at that point, he was the prime suspect.\n\nThat would change in 2011, when a man named Phil Reynolds and his neighbor in Mineral Washington was out looking for the Reynold's property stakes when they found a skull. The skull turned out to belong to Mike Reimer, and was actually found a few hundred yards from where Diana had been found. Reynolds would say that the skull was under some bushes and was actually pretty clean, but it had a big hole in the side of it and there was no upper jaw. Because of the damage to the skull, it was unclear what actually killed Mike, so police can't officially clear him as a suspect in the case.\n\nThe current detective on the case, Det. Beall, told the Washed Away podcast that on the morning of the disappearance, while the couple and Crystal set out for their day at 7am, Mike apparently showed up at his dad's house with Crystal at around 8am--but without Diana. Lloyd Reimer offered them breakfast, but Mike declined, saying they had to leave. Det. Beall said that shortly after that, Crystal showed up at the Kmart, all alone. According to the Lost and Found Blog, a Salvation Army bell ringer noticed what appeared to be Mike's truck between 4 and 5pm, but after coming back from a break it was gone. It turned out Crystal was actually found at the Kmart later in the day. If this is true, it just leads to more questions.\n\nDet. Beall would also state on the podcast that there is some DNA found on the ligature found on Diana, but because of a backlog at the lab they still can't rule Mike in or out. Because of the tube sock found on Diana's body, this case has been linked to several others in the area.\n\n[https://lostnfoundblogs.com/f/diana-robertson-mike-riemer-terror-in-the-trees?blogcategory=Missing+Persons](https://lostnfoundblogs.com/f/diana-robertson-mike-riemer-terror-in-the-trees?blogcategory=Missing+Persons)\n\n[https://unsolvedmysteries.fandom.com/wiki/Diana\\_Robertson](https://unsolvedmysteries.fandom.com/wiki/Diana_Robertson)\n\n[https://www.theolympian.com/news/local/crime/article25296325.html](https://www.theolympian.com/news/local/crime/article25296325.html)\n\n[https://truecrimearticles.wordpress.com/2018/01/23/the-unsolved-case-of-the-1985-tube-sock-killings/](https://truecrimearticles.wordpress.com/2018/01/23/the-unsolved-case-of-the-1985-tube-sock-killings/)\n\n[https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/skull-discovery-revives-washington-murder-mystery/](https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/skull-discovery-revives-washington-murder-mystery/)",

      "title": "The Bizarre Case of Noah Donohoe",
      "text": "*This is a long one, apologies in advance and apologies if I missed anything. There is a LOT that can be said about this case.*\n\nBy all accounts, 14 year old Noah Donohoe was a normal, bright young boy living his life in Belfast, Northern Ireland. He excelled in math and science at school, and he had even received awards in the latter category. He was also musically inclined as he played the cello and as can be expected of any teenage boy, he also enjoyed playing soccer with his friends. The principal of Noah's school even referred to him as a \"perfect gentleman” with “the heart of a lion”.\n\nAll that to say, the events of June 21st, 2020 could not have been more unexpected. Sometime in the early evening of that day, young Noah grabbed his backpack filled with a few books and his laptop, and took off on his bicycle to meet some friends to work on a project for school. Tragically, he would never make it. \n\nThankfully there is a fair amount of CCTV footage that can at least give us some insights into what happened to him on that journey. \n\nThe Timeline: \n\n5:45 PM: Noah leaves his home with his backpack and on his bike to meet his friends at Cavehill Country Park, only a couple miles from his school. Here he plans to work with his friends on the aforementioned school project. \n\n5:50 PM: Noah is riding down Royal Avenue, a street running through the busy downtown of Belfast, by the time he gets to the end of Royal Avenue he is without his backpack. No witnesses ever came forward claiming to see when Noah was separated from his backpack, and no CCTV footage of this event has been found either.\n\n6 PM: Noah is seen crashing off his bike, a bus driver comes over to help but Noah rides off before he can get there. A few minutes later, Noah is seen about 3 miles from his destination on Northwood Road (an area he was unfamiliar with), however he now is without his helmet or clothing. His hoodie, helmet, and shoes would later be found scattered nearby by local residents. His underwear, t-shirt, and shorts have never been recovered. Sometime after, Noah is seen naked riding his bike by two witnesses into a cul-de-sac. \n\n6:03 PM: Noah is seen walking naked alongside a house, in the direction of a storm drain. \n\nAs far as we know, that is all the footage we have of Noah Donohoe on that fateful journey.\n\nAround 9:30 PM that night, worried about her son's failure to return home, Noah's mother reports him missing. She intitially became concerned when Noah failed to call her around 6:30 PM, when he should have been arriving at the park to meet his friends. \n\nAbout a day after Noah was last seen, a local woman reports that Noah's bicycle is laying at the bottom of her driveway. This woman lived in the cul-de-sac where Noah was seen walking naked. Naturally, the police immediately searched around her home, including in a nearby storm drain but were unable to locate Noah or any evidence of his presence, outside of the bicycle. \n\nNot long after, search-and-rescue- squads were brought in to search the area around Northwood Road, where the aforementioned items of clothing were found. It was during this search that Noah's phone would be found in a local park he passed on his way to Northwood Road. \n\nA few days after Noah went missing, the local police Superintendent held a press conference in which he laid out the police's initial theory of what happened to Noah. They theorised that when Noah fell of his bike, he hit his head hard enough to cause a brain injury and disorientation, leading to him undressing and wandering off. Noah's family and their supporters were and still are skeptical of this theory. \n\nThat same day, the police received what appeared to be a rather big break in the case. A local criminal and drug addict was caught trying to pawn Noah's laptop. The owner of the shop called the police on Daryl Paul when he realized the laptop belonged to the missing boy. Police would later receive an anonymous tip that Paul had also tried to sell the laptop at a party the previous night. Naturally, the police apprehended Paul and brought him in for questioning. When he was arrested, he was also found to be in possession of Noah's backpack and books. During questioning, Paul claimed to have found the backpack leaned against a building at the bottom of Roayl Avenue, the area in which police believed Noah had separated from his backpack in some way. Paul would later be sentenced to 3 months in prison for stealing the backpack, however he was ruled out as a suspect in Noah's disappearance asCCTV shows Paul in a different part of the city during the time the boy went missing. \n\nAs could be expected for such a high profile and controversial case, social media went wild. There were allegations of this being a hate crime due to Noah's race and religion (we'll cover this possibility more later). Plus there were the usual cases of people making false claims of their involvement in order to gain some semblance of attention. \n\n6 days after his disappearance, everyone's worst fears were sadly confirmed when police announced they had discovered 14 year old Noah Donohoe's body in a narrow storm drain behind Northwood Road (the road where he was last seen on CCTV). The case would only become more contentious and controversial from here.\n\nThe Investigation: \n\nAn autopsy would later determine that Noah had died by drowning, having crawled into the unlocked storm drain and potentially becoming stuck. The police believe Noah had been in the storm drain the entire 6 days he was missing. As far as we know, no drugs or alcohol were found in his system. His family and others disagree with the authorities conclusion on this case, pointing to the relative lack of decomposition in such a wet environment. In August of that year, the coroner would tell an inquest that there was \"no evidence\" of there being any other party involved in Noah's death. \n\nNoah's recovered phone would eventually become a controversial topic in this case. For one, a photo of a hand was found on the phone seemingly after it had been abandoned by Noah, claimed to around 6:50 PM that day. Granted this could have simply been someone who stumbled across the phone and picked it up, accidentally taking a picture of their hand, but some of the more conspiracy minded folks have claimed it shows signs of an involved third party. Of interest to many were the seemingly unusual google searches and social media activity on the boys phone on the day, leading up to his disappearance. He had seemingly been messaging an account he believed to be run by Jordan Peterson (the often controversial psychologist). Noah seemed to have a very strong interest in Jordan Paterson's work, being an avid reader of his and listener to his podcast. He also had been researching a number of religious topics such as \"Sodom and Gomorrah\" and had been seeking out advice on how to ward off Satan. These could just be the searches of a bored teen boy, though some have claimed they point to Noah suffering a mental health crisis on the day he went missing. \n\nNoah's family has taken severe disagreement with the authorities conclusions on this case. To be clear, some of these claims are hard to verify and things can get muddy in cases like this but they are worth mentioning. For example, I was unable to find much detail on the autopsy outside of the cause of death. Though presumably, any mentions of wounds or abrasions would have been made public. The family claims there was no way Noah would have even known the storm drain existed. They claim it would have been impossible for Noah to climb the 950 meters through the storm drain due to \"obstructions and chambers\". For their part, the authorities have never said whether they believe Noah climbed through the drain complex or was washed down there after his death by the water. They did acknowledge that the complex is an \"extremely challenging, pitch-black environment\". The family also claims there was only water damage to Noah's hands and feet, an potentially odd occurrence if he were laying in water for six days. They also claim four witnesses heard screams in the area on the night of Noah's disappearance. Finally, the family claims the autopsy found no evidence of a serious brain injury to Noah. \n\nTheories: \nThere are certainly no shortage of theories in this case, from rumors of needle-wielding homeless drug addicts to an unsubstantiated jailhouse confession by a Loyalist Paramilitary group. However, we'll stick to some of the more mainstream theories.\n\nTheory 1: Head injury, leading to accidental drowning. \n\nMight as well start with the official explanation. While the family claims there was no evidence of a severe head injury in the autopsy, concussions are often microscopic in nature and can be nearly impossible to diagnose outside of neurological testing. So it doesn't seem too hard to believe Noah fell off his bike, suffered a concussion, became confused and disoriented, undressed, and in his disoriented state he wandered around before finding his way into the storm drain, becoming stuck, and tragically drowning. \n\nTheory 2: Mentall illness or psychotic break.\n\nThis theory is very similar to the \"head injury\" theory, with the only difference being that Noah was suffering from a rapidly onset mental illness or going through a psychotic break, leading to the odd events captured on CCTV and ultimately his death. Evidence for this can potentially be found in his over-infatuation with Jordan Peterson (not specifically because of who Peterson is, but in the obsession he held with him) and his somewhat peculiar heavy research regarding religious beliefs and texts on the day of his death. Obviously suddenly abandoning one's plans and removing your clothing before climbing into a storm drain are also potential signs of a serious mental break. Of potential note is that Noah actually was caught on CCTV sneaking out of his home at 3:30 AM on the morning of the day of his disappearance, he returned approximately half an hour later without the headphones and flip flops he left with and soaking wet from the rain. (Thanks to Oreos_oreos for pointing that last detail out that I missed) \n\nTheory 3: Foul Play. \n\nAs is the case with many disappearances and strange deaths, foul play is a popular theory. That being said, there isn't much everidence pointing in that direction. Throughout his journey, we never see Noah interact with anyone, though it's possible he did so off camera. The authorities have directly said there is no evidence of foul play. However, there are a few things worth mentioning. Noah was a mixed-race catholic boy who was riding through a largely white and Protestant area of the city, certainly a hate crime can not be totally ruled out. In fact, just a few weeks before Noah's disappearance a 15 year old boy had been attacked in the area in what was claimed to be a religiously-motivated attack. Maybe Noah stumbled across a group of individuals who harassed him and chased or forced him into the storm drain where he became stuck. Or maybe someone robbed him of his backpack and he sped off, in his panic crashing his bike and suffering the head injury that ultimately lead to his demise. Certainly these ideas are mostly speculative, but it's difficult to definitively rule them out. \n\nTheory 4: Suicide.\n\nWhile the family claims Noah was happy and not suicidal, a psychiatrist who examined witness statements, medical records, forensic reports, and CCTV has come forward in her investigation to say she believes Noah died by suicide as a result of \"low mood\" and \"struggling with his sexuality\". There is obviously a lot to unpack here so let's start with why the psychiatrist believes this. Essentially she comes to the conclusion that Noah could not reconcile the possibility of himself being gay with his perception of Jordan Peterson's beliefs and values. He had been looking up religious topics on the day of his death, possibly reflecting his inner struggle between his sexuality and his religious beliefs. Now, it's important to note that the only evidence of Noah struggling with his sexuality come in a series of vague text messages to friends in which he says he is \"in denial\" and \"coming out\". His family, friends, and teachers all claim to have seen no signs of him struggling with his sexuality. Not to mention, why climb into a storm drain to drown yourself if you're going to commit suicide? Certainly it's understood that those who are suicidal often do things we don't understand, but personally this feels like a stretch.\n\nIn the end, it'll be difficult to ever know what exactly happened to Noah Donohoe on that summer evening. What we do know for sure, is that a bright and talented young boy tragically lost his life that day. \n\nSources:\nhttps://www.vice.com/en/article/he-was-seen-cycling-naked-through-a-housing-estate-and-then-he-vanished/ \n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/northernireland/comments/14opgt6/noah_donohoes_mum_rejects_suicide_report_which/",

      "title": "Derran Conway Rogers disappeared over 50 years ago, and there is little information online about his case.  This is what I learned after spending hours interviewing his brother and sister over the last year.  ",
      "text": "**“Few Details Are Available In His Case”**\n\nI first became interested in the disappearance of [Derran Conway Rogers](https://imgur.com/a/derran-conway-rogers-E5BcmYt) several years ago when I was looking up local missing persons cases.  Last year, on a forum, I came across a fellow participant who claimed to know Derran’s youngest brother Shaun.  Before I knew it I was on the phone with Shaun for the first of many hours; eventually I connected with Derran's sister Leila as well.  With each conversation I learned more about Derran and how he came to be one of the many missing persons on Charley Project whose story ended with the sad phrase “Few details are available in his case.”  And along the way we discovered that one of those few details is almost certainly wrong.\n\nI have taken nearly a dozen pages of notes over the last year and will be happy to try to answer any reader follow-up questions.  For any content creators out there - Shaun would love to see coverage of Derran's case and I will gladly put interested parties in touch with him.  Time may be running out to find the truth, but no matter what Derran deserves to be remembered and his story told. With that, let's dive into the tragic story of the disappearance of Derran Conway Rogers.\n\n**Derran**\n\nDerran Conway Rogers was born August 30, 1959, the oldest son of Wayburn Sr. and Dessie Mae Rogers. Though he was born with a heart murmur and partial blindness in his left eye everyone remembers him as a healthy, active child.  He was soon joined by younger siblings Bret, Wayburn Jr., Leila, and Shaun.  The Rogers were close in every sense – the family of seven packed into a small ranch-stye home where the four boys shared a bedroom outfitted with two sets of bunk beds.  They made their home in Modesto, then a small city in California’s Central Valley, where they were surrounded by numerous aunts and uncles who regularly visited the Rogers home for their famous poker nights.  It was by all accounts a happy childhood.\n\nThe first time I spoke to Shaun I asked him if Derran really stood 6'0; this would be extremely tall for a 13-year-old.  He laughed and told me the height was probably right, even texting me photographic proof: at his middle school graduation Derran [does indeed tower over other family members. ](https://imgur.com/a/derran-conway-rogers-middle-school-graduation-7CfeDvL)\n\n**Disappearance**\n\nLeila, Derran’s then 11-year-old-sister, remembers her brother coming into the kitchen already fully dressed the day he vanished – unusual as the children typically ate breakfast in their pajamas and none of the other children were even awake yet. He told his mother he was headed to school early to hang out with his friends before the first bell rang.  Nine-year-old Shaun, Derran’s youngest sibling, recalls first being surprised at Derran’s absence that morning, then the absence of Derran’s friends at the bus stop adjacent to the family home.  While the high school boys did not take the school bus they met there every day prior to traveling to Downey High School on foot.  \n\nDerran’s parents were almost immediately alarmed when he did not come home at the end of the school day - though the Rogers children enjoyed the freedom typical of the era they were expected to go directly home after school to do their chores.  As their worry grew Wayburn Sr. and Bret (the second oldest of the Rogers children) drove around looking for him until 11:00 that night, concern mounting as the hours passed and friend after friend said they hadn’t seen Derran.\n\nLeila and Shaun are certain it was at most a day or two before police were called but they believe it may have been as early as that night.  Leila does not recall any specifics other than police being at the family home, but Shaun has a vivid memory of officers sitting at the kitchen table with his parents soon after Derran vanished.  He recalls the officers telling them that Derran had run away to San Francisco (about 90 miles away from Modesto), and Wayburn Sr. growing angry and pounding the table with his fist while yelling at them that his son wouldn’t be in San Francisco.  The police remained unconvinced, and whether they pursued any other theories is unknown.\n\n**Runaway?**\n\nLeila recalls a classmate of Derran’s reported that she had been hanging out with him outside the perimeter of Downey High School the morning he disappeared.  They were smoking cigarettes when two men she described only as “older” drove up and greeted Derran.  Before he got into their vehicle – described as a Ford Mustang painted in gray primer - he told the classmate that he was going to “the city” (in Modesto, even today, this is universally understood to mean San Francisco) and asked her to “cover” for him with the school that morning.  The classmate reported this encounter to school administrators in the days after Derran’s disappearance; they in turn relayed her account to Dessie Mae and Wayburn Sr.\n\nDerran had also been caught “huffing” a substance – possibly gasoline - in the family garage the day before his disappearance.  This wasn’t the first time Derran had been caught huffing, and he had also been caught several times in recent months with alcohol and marijuana. The straightlaced Wayburn Sr. - who never so much as drank alcohol himself - tolerated (but never liked) Derran growing his hair long and wearing bell bottoms, but he drew a firm line at substance use.  Both Leila and Shaun recall hearing Derran and Wayburn Sr. yelling back and forth in the garage for some time the night before Derran vanished; after they stopped Leila recalls her father walking back into the house and telling her mother “I think I hurt him.”  Derran did not appear at the dinner table with the rest of the family that night, and neither sibling remembers seeing him again before their bedtime.\n\n**Sightings**\n\nWith the Modesto Police Department unwilling to help it fell on loved ones to look for Derran. Classmates reported seeing Derran around town, and the family often dropped everything to go to the areas of the reported sightings - each time leaving feeling as though they were chasing a ghost. Both Leila and Shaun remember their father and older brothers driving around Modesto night after night looking for Derran in the months following his disappearance. Once Wayburn Sr. even kicked down the front door of the home of one of Derran's friends after hearing frequent tips and rumors associated with the location - only to find a frightened group of teens and no sign of Derran.  Shaun remembers his father all but interrogating every friend of Derran he encountered in town; despite this aggressive questioning he never turned up new information.\n\nAs time passed Leila believes that both of her parents eventually came to believe Derran had run away.  Maybe due to the account of Derran willingly leaving for San Francisco, or because of the frequent sightings that never led to anything. Maybe because any alternative was too awful to think about. \n\n**Life Goes On**\n\nAs the months turned into years and the family begrudgingly accepted the police theory that Derran had run away, they began settling into a “new normal”. Eventually they moved to a new house with a swimming pool in nearby Ceres, CA.\n\nLeila believes that as the years passed and Derran didn’t get back in touch their mother began to believe that something terrible had happened.  Though the family had moved and changed their phone number (they were required to do so due to relocating to a new city), they were still geographically close to their old home, and still in contact with the relatives and even most of the friends Derran would have known to contact in their absence.  In the decades that followed tragedy continued to strike the Rogers family – Derran’s brother Wayburn Jr. died of colon cancer in 1997 at only 35 years old, then Bret of liver disease in 2002 at only 41. \n\n**Case (Re)Opened**\n\nWhile Derran’s family had long fallen out of touch with the Modesto Police Department they always believed that there was an open missing person’s case, even if sat in the back of a filing cabinet and said he had run away.  That changed in 2005, all because Derran’s youngest brother Shaun stayed home sick from work and watched a television show where DNA was used to identify a Jane Doe. When the episode ended Shaun immediately called his parents and, after he explained the new technology, found they were both eager to submit a sample. \n\nExcited about the possibility of finally having answers and having difficulty navigating the Modesto Police Department’s phone tree, a few days later Shaun drove his parents to the Modesto Police Department to offer their DNA in person.  The drive from Wayburn Sr. and Dessie Mae’s home – now for many years in Manteca, about 20 miles north of Modesto – started out with hope and excitement none of them had felt for decades. \n\nThis hope was quickly dashed when no one could find a missing person’s report for Derran.  Search after search turned up no result. To this day no one in the Rogers family knows whether Derran’s case file was lost over the years, closed and eventually purged at some point, or never actually filed by the police to begin with.\n\nInvestigators now had 30 years of lost time to make up. There was nothing left to reliably dust for Derran’s fingerprints, but Wayburn Sr. and Dessie Mae were swabbed for DNA.  Police subpoenaed Derran’s social security number and found it had never been used.  Progress and updates quickly slowed and Wayburn Sr. grew so angry with the police one day that he threatened to go to the media and tell the world of their incompetence.  He backed down when investigators told him that doing so may compromise the integrity of their investigation.  Derran’s disappearance [made its first appearance in the Modesto Bee](https://imgur.com/a/first-ever-newspaper-mention-OhSH8o5) the following year, a short blurb in the “Crime Stoppers” section. \n\nDerran’s mom, Dessie Mae, died of cancer in 2008; his father Wayburn Sr. in 2011.  Shaun will never forget his father’s words as he entered hospice care shortly before his death: “It’s time I was with your mom and your three brothers again.”  It was unbearably sad to hear Wayburn Sr., for the first time, acknowledge that his firstborn son was probably dead.\n\n**Family Rumors**\n\nIn the years after his parent’s deaths several of Shaun's maternal relatives began sharing their suspicions of Wayburn Sr. One aunt told him that she and his grandmother knew Wayburn Sr. had something to do with Derran’s disappearance, telling him that his father “went overboard” and Derran was “in concrete” at the family home in Modesto.  Another aunt (by marriage) told Shaun that she too believed Wayburn Sr. had murdered Derran and concealed his body in concrete (Leila and Shaun recall extensive work being done on their backyard, including concrete, when they were children - Leila believes that the work was completed prior to Derran's disappearance, Shaun thinks it was after). Leila dismissed the rumors outright; Shaun was skeptical but did report his relative’s suspicions to police.  Only one of the relatives agreed to speak to authorities; after one interview in 2013 she refused all follow-up requests.\n\nThough the fight Wayburn Sr. and Derran had the night before he vanished ended on a seemingly ominous note in light of what happened, Leila and Shaun agree: the Rogers home was not a violent one, and any physical discipline they received was mild and typical of the era. Leila is also certain she saw Derran leave the house in good health the morning after his fight with Wayburn Sr. Then there were the lengths Wayburn Sr. went to finding Derran that first year - driving endless hours every night and chasing down every reported sighting and literally kicking down doors.  If he were guilty and the police were going to ignore the case anyway why stage an endless charade of looking for his son?\n\nPerhaps more troubling to the siblings: if Wayburn Sr. killed Derran there was little chance Dessie Mae did not know.  They lived in a small home; Wayburn Sr. went to work every day like clockwork for his 7am to 3pm shift (including, they believe, the day Derran vanished), and any late-night attempt to conceal the body of his 6’0 tall son was unlikely to escape Dessie Mae’s notice.  Why had she seemed perfectly normal that morning if she knew her son was dead?  \n\n**Recent Search**\n\nIn 2021 police used ground-penetrating radar to search the Modesto home; they found nothing anomalous in any of the areas they searched.  In the years following Derran’s disappearance subsequent homeowners had added hundreds of square feet to the living area; Shaun believes that the concrete poured in the 1970’s now sits under part of these additions. The homeowners had granted police permission to use the ground penetrating radar but balked at more invasive searches.\n\n**Our Discovery: Derran Conway Rogers Disappeared in April 1974, Not February 1973**\n\nDerran was a student at Downey High School when he disappeared.  When I first began looking into the case I wondered why he, at 13 years old, was already midway through his freshman year of high school.  Derran’s birthday is at the end of August, meaning if the date of disappearance were correct, he would have *completed* his freshman year before turning 14.  His siblings quickly confirmed he didn’t skip a grade.\n\nWe noticed that Derran did not appear in the 1973 Downey High School yearbook, which is available in full online.  A strange omission, but Derran wouldn’t have been the first student to skip picture day.  But then Shaun found something that changed the entire timeline: Derran *did* appear in the 1974 yearbook, which covered the school year that began in Fall 1973, as a freshman. Since underclassmen school photos are typically taken at the beginning of the school year, I calculated the 1974 yearbook photo was likely taken no earlier than September 1973.  My suspicions were confirmed by a source at Modesto City Schools: **Downey High School has digitized attendance records from as far back as the 1950’s, and the last day Derran is recorded attending school there was Friday, April 19, 1974.**  No one is certain why the Modesto Police Department lists the wrong date of disappearance.\n\n**\"You Can't Mourn The Missing\"**\n\nBoth Leila and Shaun have come to terms with the knowledge that Derran almost certainly died long ago.  While Shaun remains hopeful they will one day learn what happened, the first time I spoke to Leila I thought: *this is a woman that has given up*.  Leila’s tone is mostly one of dejection, but her voice shakes with anger when she speaks of the way police have treated her family over the years, her rage palpable as she remembers her parents dying without answers.    \n\n“When you accepted that Derran was probably gone did that at least allow you the chance to mourn him?” I asked her one day. \n\nLeila paused for a moment before telling me, matter-of-factly, \"Honey, you can't mourn the missing.”\n\n**Theories and Conclusion**\n\nThroughout this write up I've talked a little about the obvious theories and I wanted to take a moment to discuss another possibility, however farfetched.  While I will be the first to admit that serial killer lore is not my favorite subject, I have wondered if there’s a small chance that Derran fell victim to serial killer Randy Kraft, AKA The Scorecard Killer.\n\nAside from the fact that Derran fit Kraft’s victim profile, the killer also owned a Ford Mustang in March of 1975. I’m not sure if he had acquired it by 1974, or if it was ever known to be painted in gray primer (by 1975 it was said to be a “distinctive black and white”). Two men were reported to be in the car Derran entered that morning; prosecutors strongly believed that at least some of Kraft’s crimes were committed with an accomplice. It is notable, however, that Kraft had no known victims outside of Southern California until 1980. \n\nIf you've made it this far, first let me apologize for my criminal overuse of commas.  And please share your theories! [NAMUS](https://namus.nij.ojp.gov/case/MP4614) shows 40 Doe exclusions; I won’t list them all, but they can be viewed by creating a free NAMUS account. A Websleuths user also posted a [screen grab of the rule outs here.](https://www.websleuths.com/forums/threads/ca-derran-conway-rogers-13-modesto-27-feb-1973.372342/post-18186201)  If you think that Derran shares similarities with a Doe that has not been ruled out, please post it here in the comments for feedback or contact the appropriate investigating agency to report the possible match.\n\nI'm here for any reader follow up questions, and I have Shaun standing by in case it relates to something we haven't gone over.  Again - Shaun would love to see further coverage of Derran's case and is eager to participate.  Thank you for taking the time to read Derran's story.",

      "title": "11-year-old Christopher Aaron Morris was found dead in a dishwasher on a military base in Texas - but the 'coverage' of the case is SERIOUSLY unsettling. ",
      "text": "EDIT: this post was reposted to various other subreddits without my explicit permission beforehand (except for the post on RBI which i did give permission for) and was also used in research for a Nexpo video. presumably as a result of this sudden surge of popularity a lot of the links are no longer available\n\nHey guys - bear with me, this is my first write up.\n\nChristopher Aaron Morris was born on the 3rd of March, 1989 in Del Rio, Texas. He moved into a house in the Sheppard Air Force Base in Wichita County, where he would live until his death at age 11. By all accounts, he was well liked by his peers at Tower Elementary School, although some uncorroborated statements on a blog post online (which we will get to later) say he was being harrassed by older students at some point.\n\nThe 25th of September was in the middle of fall break, so all the kids in the county were at home from school. In the morning, Christopher's family went out for their daily routines, leaving Christopher at home alone. At around midday, Christopher's father Carl returned to find Christopher missing. He alledgedly checked Christopher's bedroom where he found dishwacker racks placed haphazardly on his bed, prompting him to check the dishwasher. Inside, instead of the dishwasher racks, was the wet, naked and beaten body of Christopher. He had gone through a full cycle of the dishwasher, washing away any potential fingerprints or other forms of DNA that could have helped investigators determine what exactly happened to Christopher.\n\nFrom here, the case gets a little more dubious. Despite the surreal circumstances of the death, the case was never publically conclusively determined to be a murder. Details about the investigation are sparse, and those that are easily available are prone to sensationalism. The autopsy results were never made publically available, however word along the grapevine made it seem like the autospy results were ultimately unreliable anyways, attributing the cause of death solely to injuries sustained whilst inside the running dishwasher, a deliberation made after numerous delays and inconsistencies with pathologists. Alledgedly, the clothes Christopher was wearing that day were never recovered, alongside his bedsheets.\n\nThe family never appeared to be suspects; the father was busy instructing on the base before he came home. However, this is where even the most dubious of reliable information ends. From here, things get seriously weird.\n\nYou would expect the brutal and unusual death of a child would be highly covered news, however this is not the case. Christopher's death was brought to my attention by a reddit post a few years ago, which cited a single link as its source - a link to an ancient blogspot page called 'Penile Code Avengers.' The blogspot had virtually nothing to do with murders or true crime at all, instead being a feminist blog (hence the name). The blog post discusses child abuse cases in North Carolina, with an emphasis on the overrepresentation of child abuse deaths on military bases in the state; somewhat related to the death of Christopher?\n\nThe comments of the blog post seem to think so. The first comment begins the discussion, with the poster stating that the blog post reminded them of a 'young boy from the Sheppard Air Force Base' who was 'sexually assaulted, tortured, murdered and ran through the dishwasher.' The characterisation of his death as a sexual assault and torture case is definitely far away from any other publically available descriptions of the case, however sets the tone for the flood of unsettling comments to follow.\n\nDespite the unspecific nature of the blog post, virtually every single comment seemed to come from someone personally familiar with the Christopher Morris case. The first time I read these, there was something deeply offputting about them. It's a bit hard to describe, but the unusual, repetative phrasing, the inclusion of random specific details, the unnaturally emotional tone, the timestamping and the phone numbers and email addresses all scream 'WEIRD.' Maybe not necessarily weird in a vacuum, but given the context of the case being incredibly vague and the website being hardly related, it's definitely unusual.\n\nI'm not going to go through every comment but I implore you to read them for yourself. Mind you, since 2021, a few comments have seemingly been deleted (which is especially unusual considering how old they would have been), but were thankfully archived. \n\nThat is essentially where the details of the case ends; with a unrelated blog post full of eerie comments from a lot of people claiming to be personally familiar with Christopher and his family. Christopher's obituary was found in a September 30, 2000 issue of the Oklahoma newspaper Tulsa World (which I cannot link unfortunately), dispelling rumours that the death was a hoax, however the obituary was painfully non-descript and doesn't answer any questions beyond the existence of Christopher.\n\nOne would have to assume that, per the nature of the death on a military base, the military would have been adament in hiding the case from public eye. The news article from the Sheppard Senator echoes this sentinment, with the advice from the author very much along the lines of 'Don't worry about it too much.' But surely, with all of the activism from family and friends in the comments of the Penile Code Avenger, there would be more information out there?\n\nWho killed Christopher? Was it even a murder? Why has a death of this nature been scrubbed from the internet? Why are SO many people claiming to know the case personally, despite its minimal coverage? What is up with the unusual blogspot, and the deleted comments? \n\n[https://newspaperarchive.com/wichita-falls-sheppard-senator-oct-06-2000-p-1/](https://newspaperarchive.com/wichita-falls-sheppard-senator-oct-06-2000-p-1/)\n\nhttps://imgur.com/AsIL8aM (screenshot of above)\n\n[https://penilecodeavenger.blogspot.com/2005/05/child-abuse-deaths-on-military.html?m=1](https://penilecodeavenger.blogspot.com/2005/05/child-abuse-deaths-on-military.html?m=1)  \n[http://web.archive.org/web/20200118035433/https://penilecodeavenger.blogspot.com/2005/05/child-abuse-deaths-on-military.html?m=1](http://web.archive.org/web/20200118035433/https://penilecodeavenger.blogspot.com/2005/05/child-abuse-deaths-on-military.html?m=1)\n\n[https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/20453859/christopher-aaron-morris](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/20453859/christopher-aaron-morris)",

      "title": "What really happened out in the Aruban ocean to Max DeVries?",
      "text": "Hello everyone! This is my first write up so please bear with me. \n\nIn May of 2004, Yvonne DeVries took her fourteen year old son Max,  and her twelve year old daughter Dominique to Aruba for a much needed vacation after the loss of her husband and their father due to a heart attack only two years prior. The family landed in Aruba and headed to the La Cabana resort,excited  to spend some quality time together beside the beautiful blue ocean. Especially max, Who grew up going on sail boats and absolutely adored the water. \n\nA few days into their arrival at the resort, Max was playing a game of pool when a man in his thirties approached him(I’m not sure of the man’s full name, But based off of my research, His first name is David. So I’ll be referring to him as David Jr. for the rest of this write up.).The two began playing pool, Which initially gave Yvonne some pause. But as I’m sure a lot of you know, People on vacation tend to be friendlier, So she wrote it off as pure friendliness David Jr. went on to reveal to Max and his family that he was on vacation with his adoptive father, David Sr., To celebrate his adoption anniversary. Around this time is when David Sr. Joined the group and inquired on what the DeVries family had in store for the following day. Yvonne informed them that they planned on going parasailing.  David Sr. Asked if he and his son could join. Yvonne obliged. \n\nThe following day went by without incident, Everyone had fun parasailing and at one point, Max went jet-skiing with David Jr. At the end of the fun filled day, both families  parted ways with no plans to hang out again. \n\nThe next day, David Sr. Approached the DeVries family at the resort pool and asked Max if he was interested in going Jet-Skiing again. Yvonne initially said no. But after some insistence on David Sr’s part  and some pleading from her son, She acquiesced. \nA little while later, Max and David Sr. Rode off on a jet ski while Yvonne and Dominique watched, waving goodbye. That is the last time Max DeVries was ever seen. \n\nThe Jet Skis were only rented for forty five minutes. So when an hour passed without any sign of her son, Yvonne grew concerned. She headed back down to the beach to find that members of the Jet Ski rental company were already searching for them with binoculars. Panicking, Yvonne rushed back to the resort hotel to inform hotel staff that her son was missing and that the last time she saw him, he was jet skiing with a strange older man by the name of David, who was also staying at the resort.  \n\nManagement went to David Sr and Jr’s room and knocked on the door. They got no answer. Authorities were promptly notified and a search and rescue boat went out to try to find Max and David Sr. Yvonne immediately knew something was horribly wrong when she saw the boat heading back to shore with only one person (barring the search crew) on board. That person, Was David Sr.\n\nStrangely, during this ordeal, No one could find David Jr. either. That is Until he casually showed up on the beach as his Fathers rescue boat returned . Naturally, Yvonne questioned David Jr’s on his whereabouts though out the day. He claimed to have  been sleeping off some inebriation in his room and that he was asleep when hotel staff knocked on his door.\n\nWhen David Sr. Finally arrived to shore, He was covered in scratches all over his neck, arms, and face. When asked about what happened and the whereabouts of Max, David Sr. He claimed that He and Max had taken their jet ski’s out to a sand bar where they decided to get off to explore. According to David Sr. When they tried to head back, the Jet Ski’s wouldn’t turn on. Allegedly, This is when Max decided to tie the two Jet-Ski’s together so that they wouldn’t float away.  he claims to have then  heard a loud thump, and that when he looked over, Max was floating away on one of the dead Jet Ski’s. According to him, this is the last time he ever saw Max. \n\nDue to the scratches all over his body, David Sr. Was brought in for questioning by the Aruban police. While being interviewed, His story changed. At one point, He claimed that Max had let go of the jet Ski’s and started swimming to shore. Then, He  changed his story once more, stating that the last time he saw Max, He was calmly floating away on a jet Ski without showing any concern for his predicament. David Sr. Stated that he tried to call out to Max, but that Max wouldn’t respond to him despite being awake and alert. When asked about the scratches, David Sr. Stated that he obtained them when trying to climb back onto the Jet ski. \n\nUpon hearing all of this, Yvonne asked Aruban authorities to check under David Sr. Fingernails for DNA and to conduct a polygraph test. For reasons I personally can’t fathom, Aruban police declined both options and let David Sr. go. An extensive air and ocean search was conducted, But max was never found. The Aruban police put out a statement that Max DeVries was lost at sea and that he was victim of a tragic accident. Soon after, the search was terminated . Defeated, but left with no other choice, Yvonne and her Daughter,Dominique, returned home. \n\nStrangely, on the flight home, Both David Sr and David Jr were seated right behind Yvonne and Dominique. At the end of the flight, David Sr asked Yvonne if he could send Yvonne flowers on the anniversary of Max’s disappearance. This is the last time Yvonne saw either David’s. \n\nNow at home, Yvonne tried her hardest to gain media attention on her Sons disappearance. Unfortunately, Max’s case was overshadowed by the equally tragic disappearance of Natalee Holloway who also went missing while vacationing in Aruba a year later. \n\nA local Michigan police detective ended up hearing about Max’s disappearance and decided to take on the Max DeVries case. While researching Max’s case, The detective quickly came to the conclusion that something terrible had happened to Max on the day of his disappearance. He knew that whatever happened to Max was not the result of an accident. \n\nNoticing the inconsistencies in David Sr stories, the detective decided to run a background check on him. The background check revealed that David Sr. Had been arrested in 1981 for sexually abusing his adoptive son, David Jr, who was only fourteen at the time. The same age as Max at the time of his disappearance. This news naturally made the detective wonder why David Jr would be traveling with David Sr after such an egregious act. \nUpon then reading David Jr statements, The detective found that the man had told a major lie. He had told Aruban police that his father had never been arrested. An obvious lie seeing as he was personally a victim of his father’s crimes. \n\nThe detective was able to get the FBI to briefly investigate the Max DeVries case. Through out their investigation, They even brought in David Jr. for questioning. David Jr. denied any foul play and stood by the fact that Max was a victim of a tragic accident. The FBI offered David Jr. a polygraph test. He agreed to take the test the following day, but unsurprisingly, never returned to take the test. Unfortunately, the FBI was soon taken off the case to work on a “bigger” case. \n\nThe detective stated his belief that both David Sr. And Jr. were working together to target young boys. In the case of Max, He believes that David Jr was used to groom Max into a friendship. He also believe that when Max and David Sr. arrived at the sandbar,  David Jr met up with them, Then both David’s sexually abused  Max DeVries before murdering him and leaving his body in the ocean. Despite the obvious signs of foul play in Max’s case, it soon went cold once more. \n\nNo new information was discovered until April of 2016, When Yvonne got a Facebook message from a woman (who wants to remain anonymous publicly for safety reasons) who wanted to discuss Max.  The woman informed Yvonne that she dated David Jr. for a year. And that one day, while she, David Jr, and David Sr. Were relaxing in the living room, David Sr suddenly blurted out: “Hey, Has he ever mentioned anything about the fourteen year old boy who went missing in Aruba?”  She had absolutely no idea what David Sr was talking about. David Sr. Goes on to explain that David Jr, was “very close” to Max  and that his disappearance had “hurt him A lot”. \n\nLater, The woman asked David Jr. about what happened that day in Aruba. David Jr reacted by getting extremely angry and insisting that she never mention Max again. After this strange interaction, the woman started to pay attention to how both David’s behaved around her young son (from a previous relationship.) She started noticing that David Sr. Got way too close to her son and that the man Would often ask her son to sit on his lap. She broke up with David Jr soon after. Upon looking up “Missing boy in Aruba” She found Max’s story. This prompted her to reach out to Yvonne and explain what she knew. \n\nAround this time, Yvonne found out about another woman who had dated David Jr. and got into contact with her as well. This woman revealed that once, David Jr. revealed that the only good thing his father had ever done for him was: “Get him out of trouble in Aruba”. She also claimed that David Jr. would often say Max’s name in his sleep. When she eventually worked up the courage to confront him and ask him who Max was, He flew into a rage and held her at gun point before strangling and stabbing her. Thankfully, the woman was able to escape and survived. Shockingly, David Jr. only served two years of probation for this attempted murder. \n\nTo date, this is the last useful information that Yvonne was able to obtain abut her son. \n\nTwenty years later, Max DeVries has still never been found. Neither David Sr. Or David Jr have ever been charged in relation to his disappearance. \n\n*I’d like to once again apologize for the shoddiness of this write up. This is my first time doing this. But when I discovered Max’s case I felt a pull to do this write up. It breaks my heart that Max DeVries never got any justice. I think it’s obvious that David Sr. And David Jr. did something horrible to him on that day all those years ago. To me, the real mystery is how they were able to get away with it so easily. Does anyone else get the sense that they gave a lot of money to Aruban police to cover up the murder? Or maybe Aruban police didn’t have the necessary materials to conduct a proper search.\n\nBy the way, Max’s mother ,Yvonne DeVries, has a TikTok page where she tries her hardest to keep Max’s story alive It’s called: Max To The Millions. Please head over there if you use tik tok and show her some support. \nSOURCES: 1)Crime With Kourt (on TikTok) \n2)Https://www.maxtothemillions.com 3) https://www.wxyz.com/news/local-news/investigations/a-metro-detroit-teen-disappeared-in-aruba-in-2004-his-mom-is-still-fighting-for-answers",

      "title": "Former Football Coach Jon’al White Found Safe After More Than a Year Missing",
      "text": "Jon’al White, a Ruston, Louisiana native, made a name for himself as a standout defensive lineman for the Ruston High School Bearcats before continuing his football career at Jones County Junior College in Mississippi. He later transferred to Louisiana Tech University, where he recorded 88 total tackles, nine sacks, and multiple quarterback hurries. Following his playing days, White transitioned into coaching, serving as a defensive line coach at Lusher Charter School (now Willow School) in New Orleans.\n\nAt 32 years old, White disappeared on June 1, 2023, after boarding a Greyhound bus from Ruston, Louisiana, to Houston, Texas, in search of job opportunities. Without a phone, he relied on Facebook Messenger to stay in touch with his family. However, all communication abruptly stopped in mid-July 2023, leaving his loved ones in distress.\n\nIn the months that followed, few clues emerged. His bank account showed activity in Missouri City, Texas, but it was eventually overdrafted and closed, deepening the mystery. His mother, Regina White, and family described the experience as a nightmare, but despite the uncertainty, they remained relentless in their search. They launched a campaign called “PUSH” – Pray Until Something Happens and made multiple trips to Houston, determined to bring attention to his case.\n\nOn December 5, 2024, a breakthrough came when deputies from the Gonzales County Sheriff’s Office in Texas responded to reports of a man wandering along Texas Highway 304. When law enforcement arrived, White was unresponsive and unwilling to identify himself, prompting them to take him to the Gonzales County Jail for his safety.\n\nWhile White remained verbally unresponsive, officers searched his belongings and found his identification card. A quick online search of his name linked him to multiple missing persons reports, confirming his identity and ending the mystery of his whereabouts.\n\nThe next day, December 6, 2024, his family received the long-awaited news—Jon’al had been found alive. He was immediately taken to a hospital for medical care, where he is currently recovering. While his safe return has brought relief to his loved ones, many questions remain—where had he been, what had happened, and why did he vanish for over a year?\n\n**Sources:**\n\n1.

      "title": "Why did two bears separately fatally attack two campers in one night at Glacier National Park in 1967? Bizarrely, these were the only fatal bear attacks in the parks 57 year history.",
      "text": "I recently read the book “Night of the Grizzlies” by Jack Olsen, my favorite true crime writer, and really enjoyed it.  It tells the bizarre story of one night in 1967 when two separate bear attacks killed campers Julie Helgeson and Michele Koons inside Glacier National Park.  Why did a park with no fatal bear attacks in 57 years see its first two on the same night? \n\nBy 1967, Glacier National Park in Montana had nearly a million visitors every year.  The jagged peaks, glassy lakes, and ample hiking and camping kept visitors busy throughout the year.  After decades the bears in the area had become used to the presence of humans and the park was struggling to manage them.   Overflowing trash attracted the bears to campsites throughout the park, and staffing issues exaggerated the problems. \n\nThe night of Aug 12-13 there was a storm, with lightning throughout the area.  Unbothered, Julie Helgeson and her boyfriend, Roy Ducat, pitched their tent just a quarter mile from the popular Granite Park Chalet.  Around Midnight the pair sensed a bear close, but couldn’t react in time.  The bear attacked their tent, Roy was able to escape, but Julie was dragged 400 feet into the woods.  Rescuers found her alive, but she died shortly later.\n\nEight miles away at Trout Lake Michele Koons and four friends set up their campsite and enjoyed the evening.  In the early hours of the 13th, a bear began sniffing around their tents, before attacking Michele’s.  Michele tried to break free but the zipper of her tent jammed.  The bear dragged her screaming 300 feet into the woods.  Her friends had to climb trees to avoid the bear, and had to wait hours before getting help.\n\nRangers mobilized quickly and in the subsequent days killed many bears around the park.  The rangers identified one emaciated bear with glass in its mouth as Michele’s killer and a sow with blood on her paws as Julie’s.  Many were shocked to realize that multiple bears were responsible, but the distance and time between attacks proved that regardless.  \n\nSo why? Unfortunately, we don’t truly know.  Many believe that the lightning that night played a factor, but that isn’t uncommon in the park.  Rangers and campers alike acknowledged the increasing proximity between bears and humans in preceding years, and the trash situation was becoming more dire.  \n\nHowever, we need to look forward to get a clearer answer.  Between 1968 and 1998 there were eight more fatal bear attacks in the park.  Unfortunately, it seems that there being no attacks in the first 57 years of the parks history was the exception not the rule.  It still doesn’t explain both happening in a single night, but one may just have to call it a perfect storm of tragedy.  \n\nhttps://wikipedia.org/wiki/Night_of_the_Grizzlies\n\nhttps://www.montanapbs.org/programs/glacierparksnightofthegrizzlies/",

      "title": "In the Summer of 1964, the body of 13-year-old Flossie Mae Jackson was discovered in the bedroom of her Louisville, Kentucky home. Flossie had been raped, and her throat had been cut. Who killed Flossie?",
      "text": "Just after 12:30am on June 9, 1964, Louisville, Kentucky police were dispatched to the home of Mary and David Johnson. Upon their arrival they were directed to one of the home’s bedrooms belonging to the couple’s niece, 13-year-old Flossie Mae Jackson. \n\nFlossie was found nude, lying face down in a pool of blood on her bedroom floor. An autopsy determined Flossie’s throat had been cut from \"ear to ear.” Her official cause of death was listed as “exsanguination.” The examination also confirmed she had been raped.\n\nFlossie, a 7th-grade student at Russell Junior High School, lived with her Aunt Mary and Uncle David for reasons that were never disclosed publicly. Also residing in the home was Flossie's 4-year-old cousin, Sandra. Sandra was found peacefully sleeping in the adjacent bedroom, unharmed and seemingly unaware of the tragic events that had unfolded just feet away. \n\nAccording to David, he, Flossie, and Sandra had dinner and watched television until approximately 10:00pm. Sandra then fell asleep. Flossie completed a few chores in the kitchen before going to bed herself. After Flossie went to bed, David left to walk to a nearby family member’s house for a cigarette. He returned 30 minutes later, checked on the girls, and then departed once again. \n\nThis time, he walked to “Sandy’s Place,” a diner located approximately 1.5 miles away, to pick up his wife, Mary, who managed the establishment. David reportedly arrived at the diner just before midnight. After bidding farewell to the staff, Mary and David were given a ride home by a patron of the diner. They arrived at approximately 12:30pm, discovering Flossie’s body just minutes later. \n\nA search of the Johnson home revealed the assailant had gained entry through a side door. A single nail, used to secure the door shut, was found bent in the opposite direction, indicating someone had pushed it open from the outside. A trail of bloody footprints were found leading through the house, into David and Mary’s bedroom, and ultimately ending at a window located in the kitchen, where police believe the killer made his exit. \n\nThe murder weapon, a large butcher's knife, was discovered in a bucket of soapy water on the kitchen floor. Flossie’s clothing, found in a pile near her body, showed evidence it had been removed using the same knife. Outside, detectives located the killer's socks in the alley; wet from an apparent attempt to wash them in the bucket of water before fleeing from the home.\n\n Neighbors who were questioned reported hearing Flossie screaming inside the home just after midnight. Despite the shrieks, they explained that they chose to not intervene. Instead, they dismissed Flossie’s cries and returned to bed. \n\nSeveral members of Flossie’s family as well as a few known \"prowlers\" in the area were subjected to lie detector tests and interrogated extensively, but no arrests were ever made. \n\nFlossie Jackson was laid to rest in Louisville, Kentucky’s “Louisville Cemetery.” According to a recent comment left by Flossie's cousin, Sandra, on Flossie's Find a Grave memorial, she is still actively searching for the person responsible for Flossie's murder. \n\nSadly, for now, the murder of Flossie Mae Jackson remains unsolved.\n\n**Sources**\n\n(Just a warning; The second picture in the album below is a crime scene photo showing blood.

      "title": "Woman calls her work to say she will be late, but never arrives; Her car is found close to her home with traces of a cleaning product inside, and her phone GPS reveals odd trips to a nearby town- Where is Cristina Ase? (2024)",
      "text": "Hello everyone! As always, I'd like to thank you for all your comments and votes on my post about Kaysey Yoder- I hope that she will be found soon.\n\n  \nSorry for the late upload; It was supposed to be up yesterday, but the post got caught in the spam filter. \n\n\n\nToday I'd like to highlight another disappearance.\n\nBACKGROUND\n\nCristina Ase was 62 when she went missing from Vancouver, Washington, USA.\n\nShe was originally from Argentina, and that is where most of her family resides today. She was, however, very close with her co-workers, who saw themselves as her family in the US. Cristina imigrated to US in the mid 2000s, hoping to find better job opportunities. Despite being a biochemist in Argentina, Cristina's first job in the States was that of a cook at a nursing facility. She was then offered a job related to keeping medical records- she accepted, and managed to earn her RN and BSN. Later on, she managed to get a DMS degree. Cristina knew no English when she arrived in the US, but she managed to learn the language all by herself.\n\nCristina was married and didn't have any children.\n\nShe worked as a nursing director at assisted-living facility Rose Linn Care Center, in Clackamas County. Cristina has been employed there for at least five years.\n\nAt the time of her disappearance, there were no known issues in Cristina's personal life.\n\nAmy Schauer, One of Cristina's co-workers, said that she was the \"True epitome of a nurse- (Cristina) gave her whole life to helping others. She never put herself above anybody. She went out -- she took care of our residents like -- like it was a family member\".\n\nDISAPPEARANCE\n\nOn the 5th of March, Cristina called her boss at 7:30 AM to tell him that she will be late for work due to an alleged mammogram appointment (investigation after Cristina disappeared has revealed that she indeed have one scheduled that day, but it was supposed to happen at 4:30 PM). This might be related to Cristina's odd behavior before she went missing.\n\nOn the 25th of March, Cristina acted as usual. She was reportedly excited about participating in a staff training that was supposed to take place on the next day.\n\nCristina was last heard from on the 26th of March at 6:34 AM. She was last in contact with anyone when she sent a message to her co-worker saying that she will be late and that she'll come to work around 8:30 AM. She didn't give a reason as to why she'll come late. Her two other co-workers found it odd- Cristina would usually message all of them when she knew she'd be late.\n\nCristina's phone showed that she left her home at 6:34 AM and travelled southbound on Interstate 205 into Portland. At 6:47AM, Cristina took the Southeast Foster Road exit and drove a few blocks through residential neighborhoods. After that, her phone showed that she spent about three hours in Glenwood Park. Phone data showed that during that time Cristina was moving between the park and one or more homes close by. At around 10 AM, the phone moved to the intersection of Southeast Flavel and 92nd Avenue, where it pinged for about five minutes, and was then turned off.\n\nWhen informed about this odd trip during the investigation, Cristina's co-workers don't know why she would go there.\n\nHer co-workers found it suspicious that she didn't show up for her shift and contacted the authorities. Cristina always showed up to work and was very responsible- if she couldn't get to work on time, she'd always get in contact and inform her coworkers about it.\n\nShe was officially reported missing by her husband, who was allegedly shocked that she didn't show up for work. Her disappearance was considered suspicious from the start.\n\nCristina's co-workers found her car (a 2013 dark grey Toyota RAV4 with Washington plate AQT1726) parked outside her apartment complex on the next day, the 27th of March. Her lunchbag was found inside it, like she was just on her way to work. Investigation discovered powdery white residue of a cleaning product on the interior surfaces of the car. A roll of duct tape was also found inside, and the car's rearview mirror was askew.\n\nShortly after her disappearance, the investigators shared a plea to anyone who lived in a quarter mile radius of following locations to check any home security systems they had for any recordings of Cristina or her car between 4 p.m. Monday, March 25 and 5 p.m. Wednesday, March 27. The locations were:\n\n* 501 SE 123^(rd) Ave, Vancouver WA (Her home)\n* Glenwood Park – 8800 block of SE Claybourne Street, Portland OR\n* Flavel Street & SE 92^(nd) Ave, Portland OR\n\nDuring the course of the investigation, it came to light that Cristina mislead her boss and husband regarding her whereabouts about three times that year; Once, she left her home at 6:30 AM and texted her boss that she will be about 20 minutes late. It's unclear where she went on that days, but Southeast Foster exit is exactly 20 minutes away from her home. It's also likely that Cristina visited the area of Glenwood Park on the day before she disappeared.\n\nIt was noted by police that Cristina's co-workers and husband were cooperating from the start.\n\nCristina's husband told investigators that Cristina didn't seem to use their joint account after she went missing. Cristina had three credit cards, but it hasn't been shared if any of them were used after she disappeared.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nAccording to her husband, Cristina had her medical appointments at Kaiser Sunnyside Medical Center, which is about 3.3 miles (5 km) away from Glenwood Park.\n\nWhile foul play is suspected by police in Cristina's case, \"imminently dangerous medical emergency\" also a possibility according to the investigators, given the state of her car. It's unclear what exactly they mean.\n\nThere is a 2,500$ reward for information about Cristina Ase's whereabouts.\n\nCristina Ase was 62 when she went missing and would be 63 now. She's a Hispanic (Argentinian) woman, 5'8 (173 cm) and 151 pounds (69 kg). She had a black purse with white stitching, but her exact last outfit isn't known. She has greying brown hair and brown eyes. Her ears are pierced. Cristina is bilingual and speaks Spanish and English.\n\nIf you know anything about Cristina's whereabouts, contact the Vancouver Police Department at 360-693-3111.\n\nSOURCES:\n\n1.

      "title": "Murder of Katie Janness and Her Dog Bowie - APD update 6/16/25",
      "text": "I have posted about this case many times across different subs. In my opinion, the murder of Katie Janness and her dog, Bowie, is one of the most disturbing and terrifying unsolved murders in recent memory. The severity and personal nature of the attack, the narrow timeframe, and the little to no info released regarding suspects is terrifying.\n\nYesterday afternoon (6/16/25), while I was in the middle of doing another write-up on this case, I checked the Atlanta PD website—and they had just posted an update on Katie and Bowie’s case at 2 PM EST.\n\n**Here is my writeup of the case, followed by the most recent update from APD:**\n\nKatherine (Katie) Janness was a 40-year-old bartender, singer-songwriter, poet, and a beloved wife and friend. Known for her creative spirit and gentle nature, those who knew her described her as truly one of a kind. At the time of her death, she had been with her partner, Emma Clark, for seven years. The couple lived and worked in Midtown Atlanta, where they shared their lives with two pit bulls; Katie’s 14-year-old dog, Tori, and Emma’s 3-year-old, Bowie. Though each dog had a technical “owner,” Katie and Emma cared for them equally, building a loving, shared home centered around music, community, and companionship.\n\n**Murder of Katie and Bowie**\n\nOn the night of Tuesday, July 27, 2021, around 11:00 PM, Katie took Bowie for a walk through her Midtown Atlanta neighborhood, a routine she often followed especially after working late shifts. Although Katie had the night off, her partner of seven years, Emma Clark, was working at Henry’s Tavern, located nearby. At approximately 11:35 PM, Katie and Bowie stopped by Henry’s to say hello to Emma. During their brief conversation, the two agreed that Katie would return later to walk Emma home after her shift. Emma said she’d text Katie once she was done and it would be likely within the hour. Katie then left the tavern and resumed her walk with Bowie, heading toward Piedmont Park, a regular and familiar stop on their nightly route, just a few blocks away.\n\nAround 12:20am, Emma finished her shift and texted Katie that she was done. After texts and calls to Katie went unanswered, Emma assumed her phone had died and decided to just walk the few blocks home to their apartment. After arriving home and finding neither Katie nor Bowie there and calls/texts still going unanswered, Emma used the \"find my iPhone\" feature to check Katies location. Emma could see it was pinging inside Piedmont Park, but not moving. Concerned, Emma decided to walk the short distance over to the park to see if Katie had maybe dropped her phone on accident.\n\nA little after 1am, Emma arrived on her bicycle at the entrance of Piedmont Park at Charles Allen Drive and 10th Street, still tracking Katie’s phone, which now appeared close. As she entered the park, she noticed a dark figure lying in the street about 50 feet ahead. As she moved closer, she realized it was their dog, Bowie. The park was dimly lit, but it was clear he had been severely injured or killed. Panic set in as Emma began scanning the area for Katie. Off to the right, under a tree and some distance ahead of her just off the road, she spotted what looked like someone lying on the ground. As she approached, she recognized it was Katie, and nothing could have prepared her for what she saw. Katie had been brutally attacked. She had been stabbed more than 50 times, mutilated, and nearly disemboweled. Emma checked for a pulse, but it was clear Katie was already gone. Fearing for her own life, she ran back toward the park entrance while calling 911.\n\n[Here is the link to the 911 call](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0TRtfxCVfQ) **(trigger warning : distressing)**\n\nAPD does not know the exact time Katie and Bowie died but have put it between a very narrow: 12:20am to 1am.\n\n**Here is a quick timeline of the more important details in this case:**\n\n* **11:00 PM** \\- Katie takes Bowie for a nightly walk in Midtown. \n* **11:35 PM** \\- Katie stops by Henry’s Tavern, where Emma is working. Agree that Katie will return when Emma is done with her shift, Emma says within an hour, they will walk home together. \n* **12:09 AM** \\- Katie and Bowie are seen on surveillance footage at the rainbow crosswalk on 10th Street and Piedmont Ave, headed towards Piedmont Park. Last known siting of them alive. \n* **12:20ish am** \\- Emma finishes her shift and texts Katie but gets no reply, decides to walk home. \n* **12:30- 12:45 AM** – Emma arrives home and Katie and Bowie are not there. Emma uses Find My iPhone to see where Katie’s phone is. It’s pinging inside Piedmont Park and not moving. Emma decides to hop her bike to go find Katie. \n* **1am (or a little after)** \\- Emma arrives at Piedmont Park and finds Katie and Bowie brutally murdered \n* **1:10am**\\- Emma calls 911\n\n**What we know about the crime:**\n\nKatie was declared dead at the scene, as well as her dog Bowie. The FBI were called in immediately to help, which is uncommon for murders in the city. An extensive search operation unfolded with help from the FBI and other state partners. Law enforcement combed through Piedmont Park, carefully inspecting the grounds for any potential evidence. Dive teams searched the small lake within the park, I assume in hopes to uncover a weapon or signs that the perpetrator may have attempted to wash up after the attack. Police also canvassed the surrounding neighborhoods, seeking out clues and reviewing surveillance footage that might shed light on the crime. We know they cut down part of the tree Katie was found near and was taken into evidence.\n\nAPD alongside the FBI and other state partners, held a press conference a few days after Katies murder. We learned that the FBI was brought in immediately, within the first few hours, due to the unique and highly unusual nature of this crime.\n\nAPD Chief quoted *\"This crime was so unique that I felt that we needed to collaborate with as many resources as we possibly can.\"*\n\n[APD chief at first presser regarding Katie Janness murder, speaks on the unique nature of this crime therefore bringing in FBI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9P6dtr_Ak1M)\n\n4 months later in November of 2021, Atlanta PD would release Katies autopsy report, and it gives the public an understanding just how uniquely brutal this crime was. Katies pants were pulled down around her knees. Her phone was on the ground near her body, her expensive headphones were found on her, one still in her right ear at the time of autopsy. She had $5 in her pocket. Investigators have ruled out robbery as a motive.\n\nKaties autopsy findings:\n\n* **Suffered more than 50 stab wounds**, primarily to her face, chest, and torso \n* The **letters** **“F\" \"A\" \"T” was carved into her torso**, indicating possible intent to deface or send a message \n* **At least 15 stab wounds to her head** **including both eyes** reflecting extreme violence \n* **Significant mutilation observed** to her breasts and upper torso (a specific tattoo particularly) \n*  **Blunt-force trauma to her head, neck, and extremities**, separate from stab wounds \n* Cause of death: **sharp-force injuries; manner: homicide**  \n* **Members of both the APD and FBI are present for the autopsy** \n\n[Katie Janness Autopsy Report](https://static.fox5atlanta.com/www.fox5atlanta.com/content/uploads/2021/11/Katie-Janness-Autopsy.pdf) **(Extreme Trigger warning)**\n\n**Suspects** **(my opinion this is all speculation)**\n\nAPD has released no suspects at this time. There are many theories on what kind of individual committed this heinous crime in online communities. The most popular theory I see on here is that it was likely either a mentally ill person having a psychotic break or a homeless person on drugs. Some people think it could've been Emma, as police haven't publicly ruled her out as a suspect even after her pleas for them to do so.\n\nIn my opinion, and I very much could be wrong, I think it was someone who knew Katie in some way. I do not think it was Emma, the timeframe is impossible for her to have committed this crime. Bowie was Emmas dog, she would never hurt her dog.\n\nI believe this was likely done by a man who stalked Katie that night. I lean towards a hate crime, either a man from her or Emma’s past or in the community, though the exact nature of the connection I'm not sure. What’s certain is he came prepared to kill and did so with such hatred that it’s clear to me it’s personal in some capacity. The level of rage and brutality inflicted suggests a deep, personal fixation, not random violence. And for someone to commit such a heinous act, then leave the park undetected? That requires some sort of planning, familiarity with the area, and a chilling level of competence. Whoever did this knows how to move through the city- and Piedmont Park without drawing attention. \n\nNo similar attack has occurred in that park or even nationally since. If this were a random act by a homeless person or someone strung out, I’d feel we’d almost certainly know by now. It takes an immense amount of strength to do this in the short time frame he did. The overkill screams personal. In what capacity I'm not sure but this man hated Katie. The APD hint at the crime having familiarity: \n\nhttps://www.fox5atlanta.com/news/piedmont-park-murder-a-familiarity-between-victim-and-killer-investigators-say\n\n\nEdit: to add, Atlanta is the most surveilled city in the US and one of the most surveilled cities in the world. Atlanta PD prides themselves on this. Although cameras IN the park weren’t working, the thousands of other cameras placed AROUND the park and surrounding neighborhood were. This is why I think this was a somewhat planned attack or the killer came prepared to kill. Maybe he killed her in the park because he either knew the cameras weren’t working or knew what cameras to avoid inside the park and in the surrounding area outside the park. I think police have been tight lipped on details regarding a suspect pool because it’s almost impossible to avoid surveillance cameras in the city. They may even have him on surveillance but can’t identify him in the footage they have. (FBI is notorious for helping with the science of difficult cases and that includes intelligence and geo science)\n\nReference on date surveillance in Atlanta: \nhttps://mappingatlanta.org/2025/06/09/city-of-cameras/\n\n[APD suggests familiarity between victim and killer])\n\nThere has also been hints at the suspect staying in the park after the crime to watch the victim be found. Fulton County's District Attorney Fani T. Willis would state to the Washington Post:\n\n*\"It's a very frightening crime... strange. Most people commit a murder and want to get the hell away because they don't want to be caught.\"*\n\nHoping this case is resolved soon as the 4 year anniversary is approaching.\n\n**APD Update: 6/16/25**\n\n**Relying on DNA to solve this case**\n\nThe link to most recent update [https://www.atlantapd.org/Home/Components/News/News/1219/71](https://www.atlantapd.org/Home/Components/News/News/1219/71)\n\nOther links on this crime:\n\n[https://people.com/crime/atlanta-woman-stabbed-50-times-and-had-the-letters-f-a-t-carved-into-chest/](https://people.com/crime/atlanta-woman-stabbed-50-times-and-had-the-letters-f-a-t-carved-into-chest/)\n\n[https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/brutal-killing-of-a-woman-and-her-dog-in-an-atlanta-park-reignites-the-debate-over-citys-growing-crime-problem/2021/09/13/eae59cb2-0740-11ec-a266-7c7fe02fa374\\_story.html](https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/brutal-killing-of-a-woman-and-her-dog-in-an-atlanta-park-reignites-the-debate-over-citys-growing-crime-problem/2021/09/13/eae59cb2-0740-11ec-a266-7c7fe02fa374_story.html)\n\n[https://www.wsbtv.com/news/local/atlanta/atlanta-police-seek-answers-nearly-4-years-after-woman-dog-stabbed-death-piedmont-park/JV4ODQNLVFFN7L5J3QSLXP47JM/](https://www.wsbtv.com/news/local/atlanta/atlanta-police-seek-answers-nearly-4-years-after-woman-dog-stabbed-death-piedmont-park/JV4ODQNLVFFN7L5J3QSLXP47JM/)",

      "text": "Logan Schiendelman was 19 when he disappeared, and his case is honestly one of the weirdest unsolved mysteries I’ve come across.\n\nHe was living with his grandma in Tumwater, Washington, after dropping out of college and seemed like he was going through something personal at the time. Super introspective, quiet and sensitive. Maybe even a little lost in life.\n\nOn May 19, 2016, he told his grandma he'd had some kind of “epiphany”… and that was the last time anyone saw him. According to her, Logan was just really nervous, which he isn’t usually, kind of on a mission.\n\nThe very next day, his 1996 black Chrysler Sebring was found abandoned on the shoulder of I-5, oddly positioned with personal items still inside, including his wallet, phone, car keys, and perhaps most troubling, an EpiPen that he always kept on him due to his severe peanut allergy.\n\nThree different drivers called 911 to report sightings of a car drifting across three lanes of traffic at a slow speed. Followed by what witnessed described as a 6ft man get out of the vehicle on the passenger side and run towards the woods.\n\nInvestigators searched the surrounding area with cadaver and tracking dogs for 6 hours… but came up with nothing. Not a single clue or sign of Logan anywhere. \n\nDespite multiple searches and national media coverage, there have been no confirmed sightings of Logan since. Between the erratic driving, leaving his belongings behind and the strange final conversations, many theories have emerged as to what happened to Logan. Some suspect foul play was involved given the sudden nature of his disappearance.\n\nI personally think he suffered from a psychotic break, perhaps stemming from undiagnosed mental disorder. Given the fact that many mental conditions don't show visible signs until early adulthood, it's entirely possible that he experienced an episode for the first time and didn't know how to handle it.\n\nWhat do you think happened to Logan?\n\n  \nSources:\n\n* [https://www.oxygen.com/crime-news/what-happened-to-logan-schiendelman-dateline-podcast-recap](https://www.oxygen.com/crime-news/what-happened-to-logan-schiendelman-dateline-podcast-recap)\n* [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disappearance\\_of\\_Logan\\_Schiendelman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disappearance_of_Logan_Schiendelman) \n* [https://www.thenewstribune.com/news/local/crime/article80879472.html](https://www.thenewstribune.com/news/local/crime/article80879472.html)",

      "title": "In 1990 twin sisters, Dannette and Jeannette Millbrook, leave a gas station in downtown Augusta, Georgia and are never seen again",
      "text": "Dannette and Jeannette Millbrook were 15 years old, but were excited for their upcoming sweet 16’s, which was just two weeks away. So the morning of March 18th, 1990 started off like any other Sunday. The family attended church together that morning, then afterwards headed back home for lunch. Their mother, Mary Louise Sturgis, sent the twins to go pick up the family’s order at Church’s Chicken. The twins left and arrived back home shortly afterwards with the food, and the family had lunch together. The twins did inform their mother that a white van had followed them for a portion of their walk. \n\nAt lunch, the twins mentioned they needed bus fare for the upcoming school week. According to Shanta, their younger sister, their mother told them to ask their godfather for the bus fare. So after lunch, the twins left their home and walked to their godfathers house, which was only a short walk away. The twins were greeted by their godfather, and not only did he give them the bus fare, but he also gave them a few extra dollars to get some treats for their walk home. \n\nAccording to statements made by family members, during their walk back home from their godfathers house, Dannette and Jeannette had stopped at both a cousin’s house and their older sister’s house on the way back asking if somebody could accompany them back home. The family found this odd as the sisters knew the area very well, but more importantly, they had walked together alone countless times before. \n\nWhen the twins didn’t arrive home in a timely manner, their mother began calling around town asking if anyone had seen them. Their mother eventually called the nearby Pump-N-Shop gas station, as that was a location the family frequently visited. The gas station attendant the mother spoke to was familiar with the twin sisters and had seen them come in together earlier that day, at around 4:30 pm. The attendant could not remember which way the teens walked off, or if they had gotten into a vehicle after they left. When asked if the twins were acting strangely, the attendant said that they were acting completely normal and nothing seemed off. This was the last time they were seen. \n\nLater that night, their mother called the authorities to report the twins missing. However, the authorities told their mother that they had to wait a full 24 hours before filing a missing persons report. So as soon as it hit the 24 hour mark, their mother called back and filed a missing persons report. So instead of a search and investigation starting on the 18th, the day of the disappearance, authorities refused to help until well into the 19th. \n\nAn officer came out to their residence to collect information, and that was about it. To put it simply, the authorities didn’t seem to care. They did not partake in an in-depth search. They didn’t canvass the neighborhood. They didn’t even formally interview the last person that saw them (gas station attendant). They made it clear from the beginning that they viewed the girls as runaways even though there wasn’t any evidence to support that. In 1993, Richmond County authorities officially closed the case, categorizing it as a runaway case. Authorities told Louise Sturgis (mother) that since they would be 17 years old now, they couldn’t tell the girls to come back home anyways. \n\nIn 2013, the Richmond County sheriffs office was now under new leadership, and they quickly reopened the case. In 2017, Louise Sturgis, Shanta, and the eldest sister gave DNA samples to authorities. But despite the case being reopened and given more attention, the case is still cold.  \n\nThoughts: \n\nThis is easily one of the most frustrating cases to look into considering how inept the police were. Many experts and investigators downright categorize the police work as incompetent and/or having racial bias. It’s important to note that the Millbrook twins, who were African American, lived in a predominantly African American neighborhood and low income area. To this day, downtown Augusta basically has this same demographic. Despite the medical district and University being almost world-renowned and state of the art, the surrounding area has a substantial homeless population and abandoned houses stretching down multiple streets with a higher crime rate. These same problems existed during the 1990s as well. \n\nI wish I could give further details surrounding the case, but the police actually lost the case files on two separate occasions. The family was also notified by authorities at one point that the twins were found and returned to the family, which obviously did not occur. They were also told the twins were placed in the foster care system, which upon further investigation the authorities rescinded that assertion. \n\nIn 2013, under new leadership, the Richmond County sheriffs department did admit that the case was severely mishandled which is why they reopened it. The family believes had the police department taken the investigation seriously from day one, they could have found and retrieved the girls, or at the very minimum found out what happened and prosecuted those responsible. The family has always believed foul play occurred, and it’s insane to realize it took the police department 23 years to acknowledge foul play was a possibility and likely the result of what happened. \n\nNote: this is my first write up, so I hope I did a halfway decent job. I have read almost every other write up on this sub so I know how amazing the submissions are, especially with providing details. But recently, I actually drove past the exact location the twins were last seen at (it’s now a different gas station chain), and I wanted to bring a spotlight to this case. Despite the magnitude of a set of twins suddenly disappearing, this is not a well known case, so at minimum I wanted to bring some attention to it in this sub. \n\nhttps://unresolved.me/millbrook\n\nhttps://www.oxygen.com/the-disappearance-of-the-millbrook-twins\n\nhttps://crimejunkiepodcast.com/missing-millbrook-twins/\n\nhttps://www.wfxg.com/news/35-years-since-the-millbrook-twins-went-missing-family-still-looking-for-answers/article_5490666e-0464-11f0-a99f-fb6a75488013.html\n\nhttps://www.nbcnews.com/news/amp/rcna80952",

      "title": "A woman's body is found after a house fire; Her autopsy reveals that she had multiple plastic surgeries done in the past- Who was \"Anna\"? (2024)",
      "text": "Hello everyone! As always, I'd like to thank you for all your votes and comments under my last post about Harley Morris- I hope that he will be found soon. \n\n  \nMy yesterday's write-up got deleted due to the case I covered not being old enough to qualify. As an apology, I wrote this one- a short one, due to not having a lot to work with, but about an, in my opinion, very interesting Canadian Doe case.\n\n\n\nDISCOVERY\n\n  \nOn the 5th of February, a house fire broke out in Coquitlam, British Columbia, Canada. When it was put out, a victim was discovered- a woman who was only known as \"Anna\".\n\n  \nShe was a white woman, and about 40 to 60 years of age. She was 5'1\" (156 cm), 130 lb (59kg), had grey eyes and grey, long, straight hair. \n\n  \nThe most \"unusual\" part of Anna's case is the fact that she had quite a lot of plastic surgery done: She had silicone implants in her calfs, breasts and buttocks. Other than that, she had a circumferential scar around lower abdomen and back, which was likely caused by a plastic surgery known as \"tummy tuck\", which in Anna's case seemingly also involved her back. This surgery involves the removal of excess skin and fat to achieve a more \"toned\" look. \n\n\n\nThere's also speculation that she had some work done on her face, but I can't say for certain. The post-mortem photo of her head is available in the sources, so if anyone has more experience with facial plastic surgery, I'd like to hear your insight.\n\n  \nCONCLUSION\n\n  \nI know that this write-up is rather scant and lacking in details, but I'm afraid that there just isn't many sources for this case- it literally only has an entry in RCMP's database and that's it. It is a pretty new case, so I hope that this lack of info is due to RCMP hoping that she will be identified soon.\n\n  \nDespite that lack of details, what we do have is very curious and interesting. Anna had quite a lot of plastic surgery done- more than an average person who opts to have plastic surgery. Not to mention that what she did have was quite invasive and expensive- it wasn't just a filler or something like that, they were full-on surgeries. \n\n  \nIn discussions on this case, people have speculated that Anna might've been someone like a model, bodybuilder, aspiring actress or an exotic dancer- that she might've been in a profession that required her to look a certain way (though she wasn't necessarily working at the time of her death). I'd like to know when were these surgeries done- that would also tell us more about her life or potential reasons for modifying her body. \n\n  \nI wonder if Anna deliberately wanted to change her look so that nobody could recognize her- maybe she wanted to start a new life and cut herself off from her past? Especially given the fact that she died as a Jane Doe, meaning that despite living in a \"house\", nobody knew her name, or it was fake, not her neighbours, not the person she might've been renting from, nobody around. Anna might not even be her government name.\n\n  \nThe description of her discovery is also frustratingly vague- we only know that she was found \"in a house\". We don't know, however, if she was renting from someone, or if the house was abandoned, or anything more specific. There are many reasons as for why a house fire might break out, both in a house that was abandoned and a house someone was actively renting, so that doesn't narrow it down.\n\n  \nGiven that there is no info regarding any homicidal violence comitted, I feel like Jane's death was most likely a suicide or an accident- but then again, we can only speculate. \n\n  \nI believe that Anna will be identified soon. This case is very recent, and with both well-quality DNA samples and DNA technology, I think that it's a matter of \"when\", and not \"if\". Still, I'm sure that the investigators would happily recieve any clues about her identity.\n\n  \nIf you believe you have any info about Anna's identity, contact the Coquitlam RCMP at 604-945-1550 (case number 2024-2822) or contact Crime Stoppers anonymously at 1-800-222-TIPS(8477).\n\n  \nSOURCES:\n\n1.

      "title": "In March of 2020, just as the pandemic began, brothers Matthew and Philip Reagan were taking a cross country trip to California, when they were fatally shot on a desolate road in the Navajo Nation in northern Arizona. Who killed Matthew and Philip? ",
      "text": "[Matthew and Philip](https://imgur.com/a/YT5rNQe) were two brothers who grew up together in Cleveland, Ohio. In 2020, thirty-nine year old Matthew was raising his own children- five boys, ranging between the ages of 2-10, with his wife Faye, who was his high school sweetheart. The couple met in high school, and Faye stated that the connection was instant and intense, and they had continued to date throughout college, waiting to marry after Faye obtained her degree in nursing. Faye described their relationship as very loving and happy, and that the pair grew together both romantically and in life. Matthew was an easygoing, loving father who his sons adored, and was described as being a very romantic husband, often bringing his wife small gifts, just to show her he was thinking of her. \n\nAt his work as an HVAC technician, Matthew was known to be soft-spoken and analytical, with his manager saying he had “Jeopardy-like knowledge.” Matthew was loyal to his Catholic faith, and was in love with collecting watches, hiking, and riding his bike. His wife said that he loved blasting “terrible Irish music” in the car and at home, often dancing with his young sons. Faye said that Philip especially loved spending time with his younger brother, and the two would often be found out in the garage tinkering with cars. Whenever the family of seven would go out for family outings, Matthew would always invite Philip along.\n\nTwenty-nine year old Philip was an adoring uncle to his five nephews, and they called him “Uncle Phils.” He was described as being full of energy when he was around the boys and would often build igloos with them. He showered his nephews in candy and presents around Christmas time, and was known to tease them as if they were his younger brothers, with sarcasm and wit, making them laugh. Philip was known to be very loyal and helpful to those around him, and he had the tendency to always go out of his way for people, and always had a smile while doing so. Faye recalls her affection for her brother in law, and how she essentially watched him grow up, saying:\n\n> *“He was just a little boy, like our little boys, when I first met him. He always had a smile on his face and was really funny.”*\n\nPhilip was employed as a maintenance man at an apartment complex in Cleveland, but just before his death, he was planning a big move to California in order to begin a new job, and a new path in life. A friend of Philip’s had mentioned to him how an employment opening was available at the Montecito Sequoia Lodge, located in the Sequoia National Forest, and interested in living in a new location, Philip had flown out to California and applied for the position. Philip was soon offered the job after he flew back to Ohio. He decided that he would give the job a shot, and planned to work there for at least one year, and if he enjoyed it, he considered staying on as an employee for longer.  He was equally excited, and nervous, about this new journey.\n \nWhen Philip accepted his new position in California, that meant he needed to make a cross country move to relocate. Matthew, wanting to spend a bit more time with his younger brother, decided he would join him on the drive, as a form of brotherly bonding. Faye encouraged this decision, knowing how much Matthew was going to miss his younger brother while he was away. The two planned to visit popular tourist destinations along the way, and take in the sights that the journey had to offer, following along the famous Route 66.\n\nOn March 17, 2020, Philip had dinner with Matthew and Faye, and he was feeling very anxious about his move to California. He had never lived outside of Ohio before, and it had made him nervous. He said to Faye a handful of times that evening:\n\n> *“I’m jobless and I’m homeless, so, I have to go.”*\n\nPhilip was thankful for his brother joining him on his long drive, and the two spent the rest of the evening planning out their travel route. They wanted to drive Route 66, and specifically wanted to see Spider Rock in Canyon De Chelly, in the Navajo Nation, Arizona. This route would fatefully take them through Sawmill, Arizona, on their way to Spider Rock Campground.\n\nIn the early morning hours of March 20, the brothers set out for their trip in Philip’s black Ford Escape, with Faye and her sons seeing them off. The plan was that the brothers would go at their own pace out to California, visiting the landmarks along their way, and that Matthew would fly home the following Tuesday. What no one knew at the time was that due to COVID, Canyon De Chelly, and all the national parks within the Navajo Nation, were now closed, and no longer accepting visitors. A stay at home order had been issued in the area. While the Trump administration and the CDC told Americans that there was no limitations for travel at the time and that “people should go about their daily lives,” this didn’t account for what the Navajo Nation independently decided to do, which was to close their parks for the safety of their community. In fact, all federal parks in the nation were open to the public at this time, except the parks in the Navajo Nation, so Matthew and Philip may not have known that the parks were even closed before they set of on their trips, with their plans in mind. On the very same day that Matthew and Philip were leaving Ohio, the Navajo Nation issued a stay at home order for all residents. Faye mentioned she had a nervous feeling at the time, but wasn’t quite sure why- and ultimately brushed it off, waving as her husband and brother in law set out for their trip.\n\nOn the very first day of the drive, the brothers travelled for 16 long hours, ending the day in Shamrock, Texas. Matthew sent his wife a picture of him and Philip standing in front of a Conoco gas station, the garage that was made popular in the Disney film “Cars.” He was eager for Faye to show their boys, thinking they would be excited to see it since they liked the movie. Faye recalled noticing how tired Matthew had looked, knowing that instead of stopping in Oklahoma as they had planned, they pushed all the way through to Texas on the first leg of their trip. Faye told Matthew to get a good night’s sleep and that she loved him and would speak to him the next morning.\n\nThe next day they set out to cross the Texas-New Mexico State lines, where communication became spotty and sporadic between Matthew and Faye. It seems the brothers made one quick stop at The Blue Hole in Santa Rosa- a popular swimming destination. Philip  and Matthew were pushing to get to Spider Rock before sunset, and still had a ways to go. At 4:26pm EST, Faye would receive her final communication from her husband: a photo of a train passing through the southwestern landscape. As the evening wore on, that nagging, uncomfortable feeling returned to Faye. She hadn’t heard from her husband in hours, but assumed they may just be pushing through New Mexico, into Arizona. \n\nAround 6pm that evening, Matthew and Faye’s 6 year old son Patrick had attempted to Skype his father, but no one had answered. Faye found this unsettling because Matthew had always been good at staying in touch with her and the boys when he was away, and would never miss an opportunity to say goodnight to the children.  Two hours later, with still no word from Matthew, Faye’s worry began to intensify. Faye began to call around to hotels, campgrounds, and hospitals throughout northern Arizona to see if her husband and brother in law had checked in anywhere, but no one had seen them and there was no record of them staying anywhere. Faye tried to calm her nerves despite her anxiety growing. She later stated:\n\n> *“I was like, ‘Just wait a minute, they’re probably making that last push like they did the night before, and they’re probably just getting to wherever they’re staying, and then they’re gonna call you or they’re gonna Skype.”* \n\nOn the other side of the country, in Sawmill Arizona, a small town in norther Arizona with a population of 706 people in 2020, Matthew and Philip were reportedly last seen alive around 3pm that Saturday. At some point during their drive on Navajo Route 7, passing through Sawmill, their vehicle got stuck in the mud and snow in a ditch, about two miles away from the Sawmill Express Convenience store. They men began to walk in the direction of the store, in order to get help with pulling their car from the mud. The men hadn’t even made it half a mile into their walk, when they crossed paths with a killer, and were fatally shot.\n\nA woman who was driving by a short time later to collect firewood discovered their lifeless bodies, partially in the roadway, and had to drive further into town to get service in order to call the authorities. Navajo police were first to arrive on scene, noting each man had multiple gunshots wounds, which had been fired at close range. Later, the Apache County Sheriff’s office would arrive on scene, where this was deemed to be a homicide. The FBI would take over the investigation, as the men were not Native Americans, and the Navajo Nation is a sovereign nation- a news article describes the situation this way:\n\n> *“When crimes happen on the reservation, the race of the suspects and victims, and the severity of the crime, determine who has jurisdiction. The brothers were not Native Americans.”*\n\n \nAuthorities were able to identify the victims as Matthew and Phillip by running the license plate from the vehicle though the database, which returned back as registered to Philip. Due to the temperature dropping as night approached, and the fact that the sun was going down, police made the decision to halt the investigation for the night and resume the next morning to search for evidence around the crime scene. When daylight approached, officers were back on scene and noted that it appeared that the vehicle had slid on ice and into the ditch, where it had gotten stuck in the mud. Handprints on the car had all come back to Matthew and Philip, most likely due to them attempting to push the Ford Escape out of the mud and back onto the road. No other fingerprints had been found on the vehicle that had belonged to anyone else. They also noted that the vehicle had not been tampered with in any way, that the car was still locked, and no damage had been done to the vehicle other than from what had occurred when it slid into the ditch.\n\nWhen Sunday morning rolled around, Faye was beyond worried. She began to call her husband every hour, on the hour, receiving no answer or reply. When calling wasn’t enough, she drove to her father’s home, where the two decided she should contact authorities in Arizona. She headed back to her own home, and while she was preparing to run a quick errand, her doorbell rang.\n\n> *“I walked up the stairs into our living room and I could see the two policemen through the front door windows,” she said. “At that moment, I knew something was terribly wrong. I felt that way for the whole day. I answered the door and I talked to them. They were very kind.”*\n\nThe officers told her that she needed to call the Apache County Sheriff’s office in Arizona, and that her husband had been found deceased. Knowing that Philip wouldn’t have left Matthew, she asked if Philip had been found as well. They again urged her to call the authorities in Arizona. When she did, she learned about the murder of her husband and brother in law, something she never expected to hear. She stated that when they set out for their trip, her biggest worry had been COVID having reached the United States- she never expected her husband and brother in law would be harmed in any way. The police stayed at Faye’s home while this call unfolded, and sadly, her oldest son was by her side to hear the news about his father. When asked by police if they could get anyone for her, she recalls thinking to herself:\n\n> *“The police asked me who they could get for me I just couldn’t even think straight. The person you could get for me is the person you just told me isn’t available.”*\n\n \nAs this happened fairly recently, the investigation into Matthew and Philip Reagan’s murders are still on going and active, and there doesn’t seem to be any word about what has been uncovered so far. Robbery was considered as a possible motive for the deaths, but the motive itself has not officially been determined, and it has been said that nothing was taken from the car or the bodies of Philip or Matthew. It is believed that Matthew and Philip had taken the rural road because GPS had directed them that way instead of on a more populated road that may have taken longer, and that when their car got stuck in the mud, someone with ill intentions happened upon them. Faye stated that it wasn’t like her husband to take such desolate roads, however, and finds it strange that they were so far off the beaten path, with main highways being quite a far distance away. Authorities working on the case has stated that while the road is quite rural, and it is only paved for a part of the way before it turns into a dirt road, which is mostly used by locals, there have been instances where GPS had navigated other tourists down that road in order to lead them to Spider Rock.  \n\nWith limited leads, police turned to surveillance video that had been obtained from the convenience store in Sawmill. It showed that Matthew and Philip had passed through Sawmill at around 3 pm that day, which led them to determine the time of their deaths were between 3 and 6pm. The surveillance video showed that no altercations between the men and anyone else had occurred at the store, and it didn’t appear that anyone had been following them at the time. Police were able to identify and track down any individual who had visited the store leading up to the murder or shortly after, and speak to them. One individual they had spoken to had a criminal record, and they felt that he might have been a good candidate as a potential suspect of the shooting. This individual was thoroughly interviewed and in the end they determined that he had nothing to do with the murders and he was cleared as a suspect.\n\nFaye has had a difficult time accepting that her partner of 22 years is no longer with her, or her sons. She said that she sees Matthew whenever she looks at their children- she sees him in their spirit, in their cheek dimples, and in their bright red hair. She worries that their youngest son won’t remember his father at all, once he grows older, but she speaks to her children every single day about their father, reminding them of his deep love for his family. She described the pain of losing her husband, saying:\n\n> *“At home, he’s everywhere. But then very sadly, he’s not. And that’s very hard.\"*\n\n \nShe finds comfort in the fact that the two brothers were together in the moments of their deaths, and not alone. She wants her husband and brother in law to be remembered not for how they died, but for who they were in life and before this terrible tragedy unfolded, saying:\n\n \n> *“They both did so many things with their lives that impacted so many people around them in a positive way, that we don’t want the primary thing that they’re ever thought of or when you look for them and is this one single event. There’s so much more than how they were killed. They were people that had tons of family that loved them, they had friends. They had coworkers. They have a lot of people that missed them, but then they are also not able to continue with those relationships.”* \n\nTwenty one months after the death of her loved ones, Faye made her way to the desolate dirt road where her world changed forever. She wanted to see the place her husband spent his final moments, a chance to see through his eyes. She placed two wooden crosses at the side of the road- and she used this moment to teach her sons that healing was about forgiveness, and not allowing your heart to harden.\n\nThe FBI has put up a $10,000 reward for any information leading to a resolution in the deaths of Matthew and Phillip Reagan. anyone with information about this case is asked to call:\n\n·        FBI Phoenix: (623) 466-1999\n\n·        Navajo Department of Criminal Investigations in Window Rock, Arizona: (928) 871-7519\n\n·        Apache County Sheriff’s Office: (800) 352-1850\n \nThe FBI is working on the case and have vowed to not give up on it, saying to the Arizona Republic:\n\n \n *“We are confident someone knows who is responsible for the murders of Matthew and Philip Reagan. The FBI and our law enforcement partners have logged many hours of investigative work on this case. The FBI does not forget. No matter how much time has passed, we will continue to aggressively pursue this investigation. We are dedicated to protecting all of our communities and to pursuing justice for Matthew and Philip Reagan, their family, and friends.”*\n\n**Links** \n\n[FBI.gov](https://www.fbi.gov/wanted/seeking-info/matthew-and-philip-reagan)\n\n[Cleveland 19](https://www.cleveland19.com/2024/03/21/unsolved-ohio-brothers-murdered-miles-away-home-during-road-trip/)",

      "text": "In late 2007, Aaron Taylor was a transient living in the area of the former Paradise Valley Mall in Phoenix. He would usually sleep on a bench near a court yard next to a Subway and a Circle K off Cactus Road. \n\nIn the weeks before his death, he was being bullied by a group of young men that lived in a nearby apartment. These young men have not been identified but ranged in age from 17 to 21 years old. \n\nSome of these incidents included duct taping Aaron to benches or throwing him into a fountain.\n\nOn Christmas evening, Aaron was sleeping when these young men allegedly poured alcohol on him and set him on fire. Aaron burned to death and the young men allegedly ran off back to the apartment. \n\nPhoenix Fire and paramedics came but Aaron could not survive his horrific burn injuries and was pronounced dead.\n\n In an effort to save Aaron's life, the  fire department contaminated the crime seen by spraying the fire out, potentially removing or washing away forensic evidence that could have been used against the suspects.\n\nNo eye witnesses claimed to have seen the men setting Aaron on fire. They only could report the same group that previously bullied him were with him just before he was set on fire.\n\nAccording to Phoenix PD detectives, the young men's parents hired attorneys and told them not to cooperate with police. They were never charged and Aaron's murder remains a cold case to this day. \n\n  \nSources\n\n[https://silentwitness.org/cases/aaron-taylor-4326-east-cactus-road-phoenix/](https://silentwitness.org/cases/aaron-taylor-4326-east-cactus-road-phoenix/)\n\n  \n[https://www.azcentral.com/story/news/local/phoenix/2015/11/10/phoenix-cold-case-police-seek-killers-who-burned-homeless-man-alive/75484186/](https://www.azcentral.com/story/news/local/phoenix/2015/11/10/phoenix-cold-case-police-seek-killers-who-burned-homeless-man-alive/75484186/)\n\n[https://www.phoenixnewtimes.com/news/a-paradise-valley-homeless-man-who-burned-to-death-in-december-may-have-been-tortured-6432524](https://www.phoenixnewtimes.com/news/a-paradise-valley-homeless-man-who-burned-to-death-in-december-may-have-been-tortured-6432524)\n\n[https://crimejunkiepodcast.com/murdered-aaron-taylor/](https://crimejunkiepodcast.com/murdered-aaron-taylor/)",

      "title": "On October 31, 1953, 60-year-old Myrtle Morgan was chatting on the phone in her Chattanooga, Tennessee home when an unfamiliar sound caused the conversation to come to an abrupt halt; “Wait a minute, I heard a noise,” she told her friend, before vanishing from the line. Who murdered Myrtle Morgan?",
      "text": "As nightfall descended upon Chattanooga, Tennessee on October 31, 1953, 60-year-old Myrtle Morgan settled in for the evening at her modest Rossville Avenue home. Just after 7pm, she placed a call to a friend. However, the brief conversation was interrupted when Myrtle heard something.; *\"Wait a minute. I heard a noise. I think it’s Buster’s dirty-faced cat.”*\n\nBuster was the nickname given to Myrtle’s son-in-law, 21-year-old Price Stephens, who, along with Myrtle’s daughter, Norma, occupied two rooms on the second floor of the home. Myrtle also had a 21-year-old son, Jarvis, who no longer resided with Myrtle, but had recently returned to Chattanooga on military leave. To her knowledge, Norma and Jarvis had taken Price's younger sister, 9-year-old Betty Stephens, and Betty's 13-year-old friend, Carolyn, roller skating and were not due to arrive home until later that evening. Price was absent as well, having chosen to not go with the group, and instead eat dinner at a nearby diner with a neighbor. \n\nSetting down the receiver to investigate the disturbance, Myrtle vanished from the line. As the minutes ticked by, and when her friend's increasingly frantic yells into the receiver went unanswered, Myrtle’s friend instructed her daughter to listen for any sound from Myrtle's end while she sought a neighbor's phone to alert the authorities. But suddenly, the line at Myrtle's residence went dead.\n\nChattanooga Police received the call from Myrtle’s friend at approximately 7:22pm. She recounted the unsettling sequence of events, adding the only noise she heard after Myrtle stepped away was the sound of a creaking door before the ensuing silence. Fearing the worst, the friend requested a welfare check be conducted at once.\n\nAs a convergence of police vehicles descended upon Myrtle's residence, Price returned from his meal. After law enforcement explained the reason for their visit, Price and the neighbor attempted to breach the front door, only to find it secured from within by a sliding lock. Price ultimately gained access through an unlatched front window and stepped inside. \n\nWithin the dwelling, Price, accompanied by police, traveled down the hallway, entering the first door on the left, the living room, which also served as Myrtle's bedroom. There they found an overturned chair hinting that a struggle had occurred. Next to the chair, the telephone was found resting in its cradle, emitting a constant ring. Price answered, the anxious voice of Myrtle's friend on the other end demanding to know if she was safe. Price offered only his ignorance and the necessity to search the house before hanging up. The group proceeded further down the hallway, into the second door on the left, the kitchen. It was there they found Myrtle’s body. \n\nMyrtle lay face-up, her body concealed beneath a quilt, on the kitchen floor. Her dress and underclothing were “torn and in disarray,” however no evidence of sexual assault was found. Myrtle had a shattered nose, fractured facial and orbital bones, a broken jaw, and a fracture at the base of her skull that had caused a brain hemorrhage. An unusual injury was also found; a hole, approximately the size of a 32. caliber bullet, through Myrtle’s gums and upper jaw. The wound was initially believed to be a gunshot. The autopsy, however, would show no presence of an exit wound, and an x-ray showed no bullet lodged internally. \n\nIt was theorized that after a savage blow to the face with a “flat blunt instrument,” Myrtle had fallen, the impact of her head against the floor causing a fatal brain hemorrhage. It was never concluded what caused the strange hole in her gums/jaw, or what weapon was used to inflict the injuries. Her time of death was placed between 7:17 and 7:25pm. \n\nInvestigators surmised that Myrtle's killer likely entered after her family's departure through the unlocked front door, securing the sliding lock upon entry; the noise Myrtle had overheard. When she investigated, the assailant pursued her down the hallway, into the kitchen. After carrying out the attack on Myrtle, the killer escaped through a broken rear window. \n\nUnfortunately, the crime scene's integrity was severely compromised. Inexperienced officers struggled to contain the large Halloween crowds while awaiting senior personnel to arrive. Within thirty minutes of finding Myrtle's body, more than one hundred curious onlookers had shuffled through to get a glimpse at the carnage inside the home, obliterating possible evidence left behind by her killer. A ransacked dresser was found in the living/bedroom, however it was impossible to determine what, if anything, had been taken. \n\nAt the time of her death, Myrtle was married to George Morgan, though he no longer resided in the home. A veteran of WW1, George suffered a debilitating injury that necessitated long-term care. For more than a decade he lived as a patient at the Murfreesboro veterans hospital. Myrtle, not employed, subsisted on the modest disability payments her husband received from the military. \n\nFamily, friends, and neighbors of Myrtle’s were questioned by police, but unfortunately no one could provide any insight into a possible motive or suspect behind her violent slaying. Known prowlers were also interrogated, but no arrests were ever made.\n\nMyrtle was laid to rest in Chattanooga’s Greenwood Cemetery. Her husband, George, passed away in 1972. Both of her children, Norma and Jarvis, have also since passed. \n\nThe murder of Myrtle Morgan remains unsolved. \n\n\n**Sources**\n\n\n[Newspaper Articles/Death Certificate/Crime scene photo](https://imgur.com/a/zPEuVCm)\n\n[Find a Grave](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/198081338/myrtle-morgan)",

      "text": "For me, Jennifer Kesse's story has stuck on my mind and heart since… I'm not sure, I'd like to say around 2008-2009. Every now and then I get a little bit more lonely and check to see if there is anything new. For the past few years I've been reading different forums. Watched several videos and clips. Listened to podcast.\n\nBut what bothers me is the mixing of fact, fiction and speculation. A faction, some say. The last big \"faction\" I realized was that there were no more earthmoving at Mosaic at Millenia when Jennifer disappeared - unlike shown in several clips and pictures. Yes, there was a renovation - indoors. Not outdoors.\n\nWhat do we know for sure, as facts? Can we put the facts together?\n\nJennifer attended the University of Central Florida(UCF) in Orlando and graduated in 2003 with a degree in finance. At the time she disappeared, she was workin as a finance manager at Central Florida Investments Timeshare Company(CFI, parent Company of Westgate Resorts) in Ocoee. Ocoee is a suburb of Orlando, Florida. She was really good at her job. At 24 Jennifer was the youngest employee in the company to earn a promotion to management. And she had been promoted twice within a year.\n\nJennifer and her boyfriend Rob Allen had been together for a year. Jennifer lived in Orlando, Rob in Ft. Lauderdale, Florida. She had purchased a condo in south west Orlando, near the Millenia Mall, in Mosaic at Millenia with her own money in Nov 2005. At the time, there were renovations going on and workers had moved into vacant condos around the property. Apparently there was some conflict on several occasions about the quality of work being done in her home. Jennifer was fluent in Spanish, the workers may not have been fully aware of this. She knew when she walked by that sexual and harassing statements were being made.\n\n**UPDATE May 12th 2025: One of Jennifer's friends has said that Jennifer was not fluent in Spanish, although she knew some of it.**\n\n\"Whenever workers entered her apartment for painting and repairs, Jen was always on the phone with us,\" said Drew, her father. \"She'd stay on the phone in the doorway of her condo until they had left.\"\n\nJennifer was known to be very safety-conscious.\n\n**Timeline of this story:**\n\n**Thu Jan 19th 2006** Jennifer and Rob took a weekend trip to St. Croix in the Caribbean.\n\nJennifer suggested to her brother Logan that he and his friends could use her condo during that time. Logan invited two friends, Travis and Marlon/Marland(?). Matt Sullivan, Jennifer's ex-boyfriend, came to hung out They knew each other. When the weekend was over and they left, Travis accidentally left his cellphone at Jennifer's condo.\n\n**Sun Jan 22nd 2006** Jennifer and Rob returned from vacation, due to delays she spent that night at Rob's house. That evening they filled up Jennifer's car so that she doesn't have to refuel in the middle of the night.\n\n[Lovebirds](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa9e50048-a133-41e3-9a59-7e8ef8906fe9_1240x930.jpeg)\n\n**Mon Jan 23rd 2006** Early in the morning Jennifer left at Rob's Place.\n\nWe don't know the exact time. Police report said that Jennifer's car E-Pass indicated her car had gone through the toll(East/West Expressway tolls, source: police report) on 6:16AM going to work.\n\nOver the course of the day, Jenn was in touch with her parents Drew and Joyce Kesse, her brother Logan, her close friend Lauren and Rob. Logan let her know Travis left his work phone at Jennifer's condo. Jennifer said she would mail the phone from work Tuesday morning. Her mother Joyce said \"Jennifer shared every detail about the trip and she was on a cloud\".\n\n**6:16PM** She was seen leaving work around 6PM. E-Pass indicated her car had gone through the toll returning from work at 6:16pm.\n\n[Jennifer's home and parking space](https://oddstops.com/i/2024/02/13/20240213115708-Jennifer-Kesse-condo.webp)\n\n**UPDATE Feb 19th 2025:** [**In this interview,** ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7EJV3wbzx8&t=1965s)**Drew said: There was a knock on the door. Jennifer was on the phone with her very good friend and had just come home that night, probably around 6:30PM to 7PM. She was talking with a friend and a knock was on the door and, through that friend's testimony, she took a look out and it was the neighbor above her knocking on the door, and she said \"I'm not gonna answer\".**\n\n**-Was that neighbor above her interviewed by the police?**\n\n**-Yes, very shallow interview, so to say, not much.**\n\n**10:00PM** Later that evening, just before 10PM, Jennifer talked to Rob on the phone. She told him she was in bed. Both had a long day and both were tired. They had a minor disagreement as both of them were struggling with the long distance relationship.\n\nAs a side note, Jennifer's condo had poor reception and she had a cell phone and a landline.\n\n**On the night of Jan 23rd-24th**, across the street from her condo complex at a bar called \"Blue Martini\"(Mall at Millenia) 0,7 miles (1,1km) from Jennifer's condo, Jennifer's ex-boyfriend Matt Sullivan is drinking and clearly intoxicated. Matt did not live anywhere near there. He lived by the University of Central Florida (UCF), about 25 minutes away from Blue Martini. As we remember, Matt spent the weekend with Jennifer’s brother at Jennifer's condo. There's a chance he knew when she’d be coming home. AFAIK, Matt didn’t go into work the following day, Tuesday Jan 24th. According to Jennifer's family, when Jennifer broke up with him, he took it very hard. He did not want the relationship to end.\n\n**Jan 24th 2006 around 7:30-8AM** Jennifer would have likely been leaving for work at this time. Jennifer always contacted Rob before work and wake him up or at least text to Rob. “But when I woke up that day, there was nothing\", said Rob.\n\n**Jan 24th 2006 approx. 7:40AM** 2 witnesses said they saw dark Chevy Malibu driving erratically near the exit to Mosaic at Millenia/Conroy Road.\n\n**Jan 24th 2006 8:00-9:00AM** Rob tried to call her, but got her voicemail, which he thought was odd. Rob had a meeting 9AM and when it was over, he tried to call Jennifer again. His calls and texts to Jennifer went unanswered. Around lunchtime, he was worried.\n\n**That Tuesday morning** Jennifer had an important meeting at her job. She didn't show up. Her employer and co-workers became concerned because they knew it was very unlike her to miss work. They tried to contact her.\n\n**Around 11:00AM** her employer, who knew Jennifer's father, decided to call her parents.\n\nHer parents knew right away that something was wrong. Drew and Joyce tried to call their daughter, but their calls and texts also went unanswered.\n\n\"I called and I called and for the first time since Jenn was a teenager, it went straight to voicemail,\" Drew said. \"In that second, I knew something was wrong.\"\n\nThey called Jenn’s brother, Logan. Logan called his friend Travis and the four of them drove from Bradenton, Florida to Jennifer's condo in Orlando.\n\nOn the drive down, Drew called a building manager(I'm not sure about the time, some say \"around noon\", this is an important detail because of the Jennifer's car) at her condominium to check for her car. Her black 2004 Chevy Malibu was gone. They gave two managers permission to go inside her condo to check for anything unusual. The door had been locked and nothing was out of the ordinary for someone who had gotten ready for work that morning.\n\n[Jennifer's 2004 Chevy Malibu](https://jenniferkesse.com/jennifers-car.htm)\n\n**Jan 24th 2006 11:59AM** 1,2 miles (1.9km) from Jennifer's home, surveillance cameras at an apartment complex Huntington on the Green record a person parking her car, sat in the car for 32 seconds and then walked away. The direct video camera aiming at the walk route was on a time lapse and the tape rather poor quality.\n\n[POI](https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2015/01/23/24FB7C6300000578-2923537-image-m-29_1422024711569.jpg)\n\n[Mosaic at Millenia HotG](https://oddstops.com/i/2022/07/21/20220721154145-distance.webp)\n\nThe timestamps on the surveillance videos are 1 hour ahead of the actual time that this events were happening. However, when POI leaves Cam2(parking lot) and enters Cam3(pool), 20 seconds are missing. AFAIK, the \"blind spot\" is about 100ft(30m), thank you *Unconcluded.*\n\nThe Metropolitan Bureau of Investigation(MBI) agent Bill Moore's report says that Jennifer's car had not passed through the Eat/West tolls after she had returned home on the evening of Jan 23rd.\n\n**Jan 24th 2006 around noon**, Jennifer's co-worker named Johnny Campos arrived at work late, around noon. He seemed agitated. Despite being married, co-workers claimed that Campos openly expressed his desire for a relationship with Jennifer. She rejected his advances.\n\n**UPDATE Feb 19th 2025:** [**In this interview,** ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7EJV3wbzx8&t=1965s)**Drew said 'by 1 o'clock that afternoon we met police, first response from police was \"she had a fight with her BF, she'll be back\" '. Did they arrive at \\~1PM or \\~3PM?**\n\n**Jan 24th 2006 3:00PM** Logan and Travis arrive at Jennifer's condo at Mosaic at Millenia. Around that time, near Jennifer's parking spot, there was a white van. There were 2 maintenance workers sitting in the van. Logan tried to speak to them, but they weren't paying attention to him. Logan found another maintenance guy but same result.\n\nThe head maintenance guy Penisimani Mataele(\"Ben\") was called over. He was shading, rude and sketchy\n\n**Jan 24th 2006 3:15PM** Drew and Joyce arrive at Mosaic at Millenia.\n\n\\-Jennifer's luggage from her trip was still in the front hall, untouched.\n\n\\-There were no signs of struggle or forced entry.\n\n\\-Her purse, keys, cell phone, and iPod, which family members said she always kept with her, were missing.\n\n\\-Shower corners and walls were wet, there was still water in the corners behind her shower bottles.\n\n\\-Towel was wet.\n\n\\-Underwear and t-shirt she wore in the bed night before were on the bathroom floor.\n\n\\-Hair and makeup items on the bathroom sink.\n\n\\-Jennifer wore both eyeglasses and contacts.\n\n\\-Contacts were out of contact case and her eyeglasses was left behind - as if she had left for work.\n\n\\-Clothes laid out on her unmade bed - like she used to do when choosing her outfit for work.\n\nJennifer’s parents contacted the police, but they showed no concern for the missing female. Rob had informed the police that they had a minor disagreement the night before. That was enough proof for the police that Jennifer had run off. Due to the lack of interest from the Orlando PD, Jennifer’s family and friends began handing out their own flyers. Her parents began reaching out to local hospitals and spoke to as many people in their daughter’s condo complex as possible.\n\nDuring that afternoon, Jennifer's condo served as \"a base\" for her family and friends as they searched for her. So her apartment was never even processed for fingerprints due too many people. Drew Kesse told police that he was in contact with some family friends employed in international security and law enforcement in different jurisdictions and he was told the scene should be processed and known prints and samples could be eliminated from any unidentified.\n\n[Happier days](https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-560w,f_auto,q_auto:best/newscms/2020_04/3201446/kesse_family.jpeg)\n\n**Jan 24th 2006 5:00-7:00PM**, or maybe little later, OPD officially began an investigation into Jennifer’s disappearance.\n\n**Jan 26th 2006 around 8:10AM** Seeing Jennifer's car on the news, Larry Maynor, a tenant of a Huntington on the Green complex informs the police that it has sat abandoned in front of their apartment for several days. When investigators arrived they found Jennifer's black Chevy Malibu in a parking lot. The vehicle is photographed and taken for forensic examination. Police examine local surveillance footage and discover an unidentified person parking her car and walking away(remember: Jan 24th 2006 11.59PM). The FBI and the police determine the person's size between 5'3\"(160cm) and 5'5\"(165cm).\n\nThere were no signs of violence in Jennifer’s car. Detectives observed what appeared to have been someone havinh pushed across the front hood of the vehicle.\n\n[Hood](https://images.foxtv.com/static.fox13news.com/www.fox13news.com/content/uploads/2020/11/932/524/WTVT-Still-2020-11-13-16h14m07s782.jpg?ve=1&tl=1)\n\nHer belongings were missing, including Travis' cell phone. The DVD player from Rob was in the backseat.\n\nOrange County Sheriff's bloodhound named Bo took a sniff from the front passenger side of the car. The scent led straight to the front door of Jennifer's home. The trail bypassed the complex's only entrance and led to a stretch of fence separating the public sidewalk from its private ground. Once dog entered the grounds, it picked up the scent inside the fence and went directly to a stairwell leading to Jennifers 2nd floor condominium.\n\nJoyce Kesse said that back stairwell was to parking spot and front stairwell overlooking the water. The dog tracked back at the front stairwell. Those stairs would have been closest to her door.\n\nThe second bloodhound tracked around the corner to Park Central Mid Town Terrace Apartments and then lost the track. The distance between Jennifer's car to there is about 0,9 miles(1,5km)\n\nHer boyfriend and family were immediately ruled out as suspects. And police quickly focused on the many day laborers who were working at her condominium. Erin Helfert, property manager, informed that 3 of the workers spoke English and 4 only spoke Spanish. From what I've read over the years, I've got the impression that there were dozens of workers. But no, only 7? Police did not have a Spanish speaking officer at the time, so they only talk with who spoke English and advised they would schedule another day for the workers who only spoke Spanish. Erin Helfert advised that all of her workers were working the day of Jennifer's disappearance.\n\nThe police first interviewed Penisimani Mataele, aka \"Ben\", who resided at that time at 5709 Ridgeway Drive, Orlando, Florida. He stated he had been to Jennifer's condo one time with a work order. He had no knowledge of her disappearance or her location. He had not heard anyone working with him say anything about harassing her or wanting to harm her. He went to her apartment with another maintenance person named Virgilio Ramos. He admitted he had a criminal history but did nothing to harm anyone. He stated he worked Mon and Tue and had not seen her on either day.\n\nRamos was living and working Jennifer's condo complex.\n\nDespite there were only 7 people working there, LE did not questioned Ramos until 2008.\n\nThe first week of the investigation, a crimeline tip had come in saying person known as Ramos is involved in this. For some reason, the tip was not investigated.\n\n**Feb 2nd 2006** The police release the surveillance footage of a suspect walking away from Jennifer’s car in the parking lot.\n\n**May 17th 2007** OPD released surveillance video with the unidentified suspect who parked Jennifer's car\n\n[Poi walks by](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7pnHBqFOstY)\n\n**March 18 2009** Virgilio Ramos was interviewed by OPD while in prison. His adjudication date was Sep 11th 2008. He's a sex offender and the victim was a minor. The detective had a source who used to be a housekeeper in the complex. When the detective showed her that picture of POI, she said \"That looks like Ramos\".\n\nRamos was then asked about the pictures, the ones that the housekeeper said may have looked like him:\n\nDetective: Is there any reason why somebody would say that was you?\n\nRamos: No, *not really*.\n\nRamos did polygraph and passed.\n\nA woman who lived at Jennifer's complex, claimed that Ramos often approached her in the parking lot late at night when she returned from work and made her feel uncomfortable.\n\nAnother woman who moved into the complex just weeks after Jennifer disappeared, had a different opinion of Ramos. She remember him being fun and friendly. She says she never was suspicious of Ramos until one day nine months after Jennifer vanished, when Ramos suddenly disappeared and moved out of the complex in the middle of the night.\n\nAt first, she didn't reach out to police. She sat on it for a little bit. And it just ate away at her so she called the crime line and told them and they took her statement. No one ever followed up with her.\n\n**2016** Jennifer declared dead by State of Florida\n\n**Persons related, one way or another, to Jennifer's story:**\n\nMatt Sullivan, ex-boyfriend: Jennifer broke up with him and he took it very hard. He did not want the relationship to end. Was drinking near Jennifer's condo complex on the night of Jan 23rd-24th. Jennifer's brother, Logan, insists Matt didn't do anything to hurt his sister.\n\nPenisimani Mataele, aka \"Ben\": was head of maintenance at the Mosaic apartment complex while Jennifer was living there\n\nVirgilio Ramos: Was living and working Jennifer's condo complex at the time. A woman who lived at Jennifer's complex, claimed that Ramos often approached her in the parking lot late at night when she returned from work and made her feel uncomfortable. He's a sex offender and the victim was a minor. His adjudication date was Sep 11th 2008.\n\nJohnny A. Campos, co-worker: Apparently, despite being married Campos made multiple passes at her and grew upset when she turned him down every time. According to another co-worker, Francisco Javier Aragon aka Adam Frank, Campos was upset that she was in a relationship, and was annoyed to hear about a recent vacation she had taken with her boyfriend Rob. On the day of Jennifer's disappearance, Campos showed up late for work.\n\nFrancisco Javier Aragon, co-worker: Overheard a confrontation between Johnny Alberto Campos and Jennifer Kesse the morning of January 23rd, 2006. Aragon had been working for CFI for eight years before being fired for asking his bosses to investigate the alleged harassment perpetrated against him by his supervisor, Johnny Campos, since the day Jennifer Kesse disappeared. He believed it was because he knew specifics about them, and for what he told OPD and the FBI, which was corroborated by the polygraph he requested to take.\n\nOn or about the day after Jennifer’s disappearance, Campos asks Aragon to drive him to an impromptu meeting at the new Lake Eleanor Office. When the pair arrived, Campos told Aragon he would meet up with him in about 30 minutes in the cafeteria.\n\nAllegedly, during the drive Campos told Aragon wherever she (Jenn) was, “she was likely eaten up by alligators already.”\n\nAragon watched as the manager of the branch, Linday Hernandez met Campos at security and the pair headed to her office.\n\n**From 2012:**\n\nLinday Hernandez: a business partner of Pedro Benevides in more than one venture, and her husband Luis Hernandez is and was a former principal in several business interests including currently held properties.\n\nLuis Hernandez: under Federal criminal investigation in multiple states and a defendant in several civil actions resulting from those alleged activities. Linday Hernandez is not named individually in the ongoing federal or class action civil matters to date, however, companies which she has or had a principal interest in, are.\n\n**From 2015:**\n\nPedro Benevides: A central Florida businessman was sentenced yesterday to nine years in federal prison for bank fraud conspiracy and ordered to forfeit more than $44 million. This case was investigated by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) Homeland Security Investigations (HSI), the Internal Revenue Service - Criminal Investigation, the United States Secret Service and the St. Cloud IRS-USSS Federal Financial Crimes Task Force. From about 2005 through September 2008, Benevides obtained 20 commercial and residential loans and lines of credit from several federally-insured financial institutions totaling approximately $44,059,565.\n\n**November 2022: The Florida Department of Law Enforcement (FDLE) took over the case**.\n\nWhat to add?\n\n**UPDATE Jan 25th 2025:** In a statement to FOX 13, the **FDLE** said: \"As today marks the 19th anniversary of Jennifer Kesse’s disappearance, FDLE continues to actively investigate her case. Since FDLE took the lead in investigating Jennifer’s disappearance, we have conducted more than 50 interviews, reviewed tens of thousands of documents and pieces of evidence from the Orlando Police Department, and worked hundreds of hours not only re-examining the past investigation but also developing new avenues that need to be explored to help bring answers to Jennifer’s parents and loved ones. Agents also established a tip email address and traveled across the country to include Texas, Utah and California. Every day, we keep Jennifer and her family in our thoughts and prayers. We also encourage the public to help. Just one piece of information may help. We urge anyone with information about Jennifer Kesse’s disappearance to call our FDLE Orlando office at (407) 245-0888, or email [OROCColdCaseTips@fdle.state.fl.us](mailto:OROCColdCaseTips@fdle.state.fl.us).\"\n\nGuess who's been to Utah? Mataele?\n\nIn 2018 Kesse's parents filed suit against the Orlando Police Department to gain access to police records on the case. The lawsuit was settled in March 2019, allowing the family access to 16 000 pages of records.\n\nNow we know for sure:\n\n\\-there was more physical evidence in the car than has been reported\n\n\\-hair was found in the car, the origin could not be determined yet\n\n\\-previously collected DNA has been re-examined\n\n𝗨𝗣𝗗𝗔𝗧𝗘 𝗠𝗮𝘆 𝟮𝟭𝘀𝘁 𝟮𝟬𝟮𝟱:\n\nThe Florida Department of Law Enforcement does not consider Kesse’s case a cold one.\n\nDetective told Eyewitness News that they have persons of interest.\n\nThis news comes after FDLE said they have some persons of interest.\n\nWFTV asked FDLE: “Is it safe to say that you have narrowed down some persons of interest?”\n\n“I would say yes,” said the lead special agent.\n\nFDLE wouldn’t say who they are or how many they have.\n\nSpecial Agent Spears started looking into this case about 2 years ago. Since then, she has gone through thousands of pages of documents and has already talked to 45 people. She has ruled some people out that had been talked to in the beginning and has ruled now new people in. And evidence is being looked at again.\n\nWFTV asked: “Anything significant or you don’t know yet?”\n\n\"In order to protect the integrity of the case, I would like to just leave it at that we are re-evaluating some evidence to test new and re-test some of the stuff that has previously been tested,” Spears said.\n\n“The case is not cold in the eyes of FDLE,” Spears added.\n\n[NewsNation, others have a heart and a desire to do what's right](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MY9wjyWRGk0)\n\n(Sorry, I updated on Feb 19th 2025 and part of the writing disappeared)\n\n[Please Help Find Her](https://jenniferkesse.com/pictures-jennifer-kesse.htm)\n\n[Most Wanted](https://www.fbi.gov/wanted/vicap/missing-persons/jennifer-joyce-kesse)\n\n[People](https://people.com/jennifer-kesse-disappearance-missing-case-8774071)\n\n[1981 baby](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/D7A5wupXoAAOU_C?format=jpg&name=large)\n\n[Missing person Jennifer Joyce Kesse](https://namus.nij.ojp.gov/case/MP1342)\n\n[This is not just a story.

      "text": "**Wait, wasn't this already posted?**\n\nYes, but it got taken down, presumably since this wasn't officially confirmed by law enforcement. Now it has been.\n\n**Who is Asha Degree?**\n\nThis is one of the more infamous unsolved cases so I'm gonna be a bit brief about it: Asha Jaquilla Degree went missing at the age of nine from Shelby, North Carolina. In the early morning hours of February 14, 2000, for reasons unknown, she packed her bookbag, left her family home north of the city and began walking along nearby North Carolina Highway 18 despite heavy rain and wind. A witness claimed they saw Asha getting into a 1970s green car with a rusted rim. If you want a more detailed write-up, [check here.](https://charleyproject.org/case/asha-jaquilla-degree)\n\n**The Update**\n\nVery recently, there was a FBI raid of a property in Shelby that had a 1970s green car with a rusted rim, kicking off an avalanche of speculation this was related to Asha Degree. This speculation reached the level of even local news channels, and of course, once it hit the Internet, the speculation morphed into very bizarre rumors, like the property having multiple bodies buried there or the owner of the property had a deathbed confession or whatever. The Sheriff's office in Cleveland County finally commented on this:\n\n> [The search warrants executed this week by the Cleveland County Sheriff's Office, the FBI, and the SBI are related to the disappearance of Asha Degree,\" the release said. \"The search warrants were obtained based on physical evidence directly connected to Asha's disappearance. Multiple items of interest were taken from the sites and will be analyzed. It is important to dispel rumors circulating about the investigation. No human remains were recovered. Again, no human remains were found. This investigation is ongoing and official information will be released by the Cleveland County Sheriff’s Office when appropriate. Please do not spread rumors on social media out of respect for Asha's family and this investigation.](https://www.shelbystar.com/story/news/2024/09/13/cleveland-county-sheriffs-office-confirms-search-is-linked-to-asha-degree/75208793007/)\n\nThe owner of the property, Roy Lee Dedmon, is still alive and hasn't been arrested nor charged with anything relating to Asha. He has lawyered up and denies any involvement in the Asha Degree case. \n\n**Search Warrants released**\n\nhttps://www.wbtv.com/2024/09/16/cleveland-county-investigators-think-missing-girl-asha-degree-was-killed-warrants-reveal/\n\nThe cliffnotes:\n\n> The search warrants were requested after DNA samples linked Degree with woman AnnaLee Dedmon Ramirez, and a man named Russell Underhill, according to the documents.\n\n> According to the documents, a DNA sample of a hair stem taken from Degree’s undershirt appeared to match Dedmon Ramirez’s DNA.\n\n> Investigators now believe Degree is a “victim of homicide, with her body concealed,” authorities wrote in the search warrant application. Because of the Dedmon sisters’ ages at that time, investigators believe “adult assistance” from their father, Roy Dedmon, and their mother, Connie Dedmon, “would have been necessary in the execution and/or concealment of the crime.”\n\n> Several search warrants were carried out for the Dedmon parents, Dedmon Ramirez, and multiple properties associated with them.\n\n> Russell Underhill -- the man whose DNA may be a match with DNA found on Degree’s belongings -- lived in “at least two facilities” operated by Roy Dedmon at the time Degree disappeared. \n\n> Underhill died in 2004.\n\n> It was not entirely clear how Underhill was related to or connected with the Dedmons. Underhill “knew and associated with” Roy Dedmon, investigators found. Roy Dedmon was listed as Underhill’s emergency contact, according to medical records.\n\n> According to the released search warrants, investigators found that Roy Dedmon used to send one of his daughters to “transport patients in an unreliable vehicle to/from Broughton Hospital in Morganton,” around the time Degree disappeared. “Highway 18 is the most logical route to travel to and from Northbrook Rest Home and/or Brighton Hospital,” investigators said.\n\n> Roy Dedmon reportedly send his daughter who was 16-17 years old at the time, and not Dedmon Ramirez.",

      "text": "Jeffrey Klungness disappeared from his Bonney Lake, WA home at 14 years old in 1996 and today the Pierce County Sheriff's Office declared the case closed.\n\nKlungness's Mother Susan was killed at their Bonney Lake home in March 1996. Klungness's Dad was at work at the time and Jeffrey wasn't seen. In 2017 a fragment of a skull was found near Greenwater, WA (unincorporated area on the way to Mount Rainier) and in 2020 DNA analysis confirmed the fragment was related to Klungness's half-sister. In 2021 it was determined that the fragment belonged to Jeffrey.\n\nEarlier this month the Pierce County Medical Examiner ruled Klungness's death a homicide with the cause as multiple blunt force injuries, similar to his Mother's death nearly 30 years prior.\n\nThe Sheriff's Office says prosecutors now would have charged Martin Malcolm with Jeffrey's death but he died in 2022 in nearby Thurston County. Malcolm was believed to have played a role in Jeffrey's disappearance, reportedly having been seen at the Klungness home the day Susan was killed and spotted later driving her vehicle with Jeffrey in the passenger seat (he was convicted of taking a motor vehicle without permission, a Class C felony, in April 1996 per Washington State Patrol records.)\n\nPrior to all of this Malcolm served 12 years in prison for murder 2 and two assault 1 convictions in 1980 after stabbing his wife to death. The Klungness family met Malcolm through their church as a handy man according to the Sheriff's Office. The Sheriff's Office also notes that Susan felt Martin was overstaying his welcome and wasn't comfortable with his relationship with Jeffrey at the time.\n\nSources: [KING 5](https://www.king5.com/article/news/crime/1996-cold-case-resolved-dna-analysis/281-cc09e36c-635a-4e23-91a8-9c77bae76b3a), [Fox 13 Seattle] (https://www.fox13seattle.com/news/pierce-co-investigators-close-1996-cold-case), and [Pierce County Sheriff's Office](https://blog.piercecountywa.gov/pcsdblotter/2025/03/12/1996-jeffrey-klungness-cold-case-solved/)",

      "text": "59-year-old Ray Gricar was the district attorney of Centre County in Pennsylvania when he went missing 20 years ago today.\n\nOn that Friday, he worked for half the day then disappeared. His car was discovered in Lewisburg the next day with his cell phone inside. It should also be noted that cigarette ashes were found in the car and it smelled like cigarette smoke - Gricar reportedly “despised” cigarettes. However, there were not any obvious signs of foul play. Despite that, foul play is a possibility. \n\nOne theory suggests Gricar committed suicide. Another possibility is that he disappeared willingly. Alleged sightings of Gricar have been reported, notably in Texas in late 2005. A diner in a restaurant took a photo of man who she believed was Gricar. Missing person fliers of Gricar were circulated in Slovenia where he had relatives. Despite these leads, no sightings were confirmed and Gricar was declared legally dead in 2011. \n\nGricar’s laptop was found in the Susquehanna River in July 2005 with the hard drive missing (though it was eventually found in the river, too damaged to recover anything).  He also had ties to the Sandusky case of Penn State, having investigated allegations in 1998. \n\nWith April 15 marking 20 years since his disappearance, local news organizations have been revisiting the case. This article in particular is pretty thorough and goes more in-depth about the case. Being from the area, I have always been intrigued by this case and wonder what really happened fo Ray Gricar.  \n\nhttps://www.pennlive.com/crime/2025/04/ray-gricar-case-at-20-years-3-theories-in-search-of-solution.html?outputType=amp",

      "text": "Thanks to genetic genealogy, a suspect in the 1979 rape and murder of 31-year-old secretary Kathryn Donohue is behind bars. After the case went cold for decades, it was reexamined recently and Othram was able to find the killer’s DNA in the evidence. The DNA was submitted to the FBI and the FBI’s forsenic genealogy team was able to identify 82-year-old Rodger Zodas Brown of North Carolina (formerly of Maryland) as the source of the foreign DNA found at the crime scene. \n\nThe two articles linked below have conflicting information. One states Kathryn was found in a parking lot, but the other article states her body was found in her home. She had been out to dinner with coworkers and that was the last time she was seen alive. Apparently she lived in Arlington, Virginia but worked in Maryland. The suspect is awaiting transfer to jail in Prince George’s County, Maryland so I tend to think that she was indeed found in a parking lot in Maryland. \n\nIt is horrible that Brown had 46 years as a free man while Kathryn’s life was cut so short. At least there is justice at last for Kathryn’s living siblings.\n\nhttps://wjla.com/news/local/cold-case-suspect-arrest-prince-georges-county-police-department-1979-murder-police-malik-aziz-states-attorney-aisha-braveboy-special-agent-fbi-baltimore-maryland-cases\n\nhttps://dnasolves.com/articles/kathryn-donohue-maryland/",

      "title": "78 years ago to this day on January 15, 1947, Elizabeth Short, also known as the Black Dahlia, was murdered and her corpse dumped in a vacant lot in Los Angeles, CA. Still marked by LAPD as unsolved. Who killed her?",
      "text": "Elizabeth Short, known by the public and the media as the Black Dahlia, was a 22-year old woman from Boston, Massachusetts who was murdered by an unknown murderer.\n\n**Early Life**\n\nElizabeth's early life as a child was typical and normal as she was one of 5 daughters to Cleo Alvin Short and Phoebe May Sawyer. It wasn't until the Great Depression began did her life go downhill as her family lost all of their savings in 1929 due to the Stock Market Crash. Her dad abandoned the family by faking his suicide, which he did by abandoning his  car on the Charlestown Bridge. It got worse as Elizabeth developed bronchitis and severe Asthma. She would drop out of high school during her 10th grade year, where she was called by her peers as the \"Medford High's Deanna Durbin\" in reference to popular actress Deanna Durbin. She talked to her peers about going to Hollywood and starring in movies.\n\n**1942-1943**\n\nIn 1942, Elizabeth would move to Vallejo, Ca to live with her father upon her mother getting a letter from him apologizing for faking his death. Due to arguments between her and her dad, she moved out of his home and went to Santa Barbara, where she was arrested for underage drinking. This led to her moving to Florida, where she met Army Air Force pilot Major Matthew Gordon Jr. Elizabeth told friends she had accepted his proposal, but Major Gordon would die in the line of duty on August 10, 1945 while recovering from wounds he got while in India during WW2.\n\n**1947**\n\nElizabeth would spend the last 6 months of her life in Los Angeles, where she worked in various jobs like waitressing. When she could, she would rent rooms for $1 a day or sleep in movie theaters or crash in with other women when she had no money. She was at the point where she had to use candle wax to fix cavities in her teeth. Despite being described as an aspiring actress, she didn't have any official acting jobs or roles, though there were rumors of her being in a screening.\n\nWhile the  last few days of her life are subject to speculation, what we do know is that a man named Robert \"Red\" Manley dropped her off at the Biltmore Hotel in Downtown Los Angeles. Some accounts from staff report seeing her use a payphone.\n\n**Discovery of Short's body/murder**\n\nOn January 15, 1947, a mother walking her baby on the west side of South Norton Ave in Los Angeles discovered Short's bisected body split in two on a vacant lot. The mother initially thought it was a discarded mannequin due to how pale white Short's body was. The mother took her baby to a nearby home screaming and called police. Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD) discovered a cement sack containing watery blood, a foot print, and tire tracks near Short's body. It is important to note that Short's body was posed with her arms raised above her head in a 90  degree angle, while her upper torso and lower body was separated apart by 6 inches with a glasgow smile cut into her face.\n\n**Cause of Death**\n\nThe cause of death for Elizabeth Short was listed as cerebral hemorrhage due to blows on her face. She was implied to alive when she got a \"glasgow  smile\" cut into her face. The most shocking part was how her body was cut cleanly in half using a medical procedure  developed during WW2 called a hemicorporectomy.  A Hemicorporectomy is a surgery where the bone is cut cleanly between the second and third lumbar vertebrae. It is important to note that NONE of Short's internal organs were damaged when her body was found cut in half and described as \"surgical precision.\" Also, the killer didn't go through the bone when Short's body was cut in half. Frederick Newbarr, the man who did Short's autopsy, noted how Short suffered from extensive torture prior to her murder. LAPD and Newbarr said that only a person trained in surgery and with a medical background like a surgeon, so it wasn't your average run of the mill criminal or butcher. This led to the FBI investigating medical school students at University of Southern California (USC), but nothing came of it.\n\nShort was later buried in Mountain View Cemetery in Oakland, California.\n\n**Where was the location where  Short was Killed?**\n\nSince Short was only dumped at the vacant lot, it begs the question of where was Short murdered? Since Short was surgically cut in half and tortured for several hours, it had to be in a location where no one would be interrupting the murderer and where the murderer would have access to surgical instruments to cut Short in half, along with running water to wash off the body. He would definitely need his own personal car to transport the body, which eliminates a lot of suspects as 73% of people didn't own their own car due to the rationing of WW2. In the 2006 Hollywood Movie \"The Black Dahlia,\" the director's interpretation of where Short was murdered/dismembered in a small shack in the outskirts of Hollywood near the iconic Hollywood letter sign near a small stream of water with a bloody mattress\n\nNickname\n\nShort was nicknamed the Black Dahlia due to how she always wore black and had dark black hair. Though there are unconfirmed rumors that she got her nickname \"black dahlia\" from the 1946 crime movie \"The Blue Dahlia.\"\n\n**Who Killed Short?**  \nDespite help from the FBI, Elizabeth Short's killer was never found or charged.  Over 60 fake confessions from various people claiming to have killed Short were made. The fact that the LAPD had lost evidence over the years from the case, along with the LAPD corruption scandals like the Sleepy Lagoon Murders, didn't help. Various suspects have been named, ranging from gangster Bugsy Siegal to Hollywood director Orson Wells (due to a rumor that he allegedly had mannequins made for his film \"The Lady from Shanghai\" that allegedly had a glasgow smile cut on their faces similar to what was done on Short).\n\nElizabeth Short is still remembered and recognized to this very day by millions of people as she is immortalized in Hollywood movies (like the 2006 Hollywood Movie \"The Black Dahlia\"), death metal bands, TV specials, and even AAA video games like LA Noire, where they have DLC mission where you play a detective tasked to finding her murderer. \n\nWho do you think killed Elizabeth Short? Rest in Peace Elizabeth.\n\nSources:  \n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black\\_Dahlia#Investigation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Dahlia#Investigation)\n\n[https://www.theblackdahliainhollywood.com/?p=73](https://www.theblackdahliainhollywood.com/?p=73)",

      "title": "The Car in the House: The Disappearance of Brianna Maitland",
      "text": "In the early spring of 2004, 17 year old Brianna Maitland was working hard to move forward in life. She had a job at a local restaurant and was working towards getting her GED, she had even discussed plans of attending college in the near future. Tragically, her disappearance on March 19th 2004 would bring all of this to a halt.\n\nBackground: On October 18th 1986, Brianna Maitland was born to her parents Bruce and Kelly in Burlington Vermont. She spent her childhood growing up on a farm in East Franklin, Vermont with her parents and older brother. By all accounts, she had a normal and happy childhood. In her youth, she took a fair mount of martial arts training, specifically jiu-jitsu. It was on her 17th birthday that Brianna decided she wanted some independence in her life and decided to move away from her family home and go to live closer to her friends. However this change in lifestyle led to some issues with school, subsequently causing her to drop out of high school in February 2004, months before graduating. However being an ambitious woman, Brianna soon enrolled in a GED program to get her high school diploma. Also by this point, Brianna was living in Sheldon VT with a close friend of hers, a town about 20 miles from her job at the Black Lantern Inn in Montgomery VT.\n\nAbout three weeks before she were to disappear, Brianna attended a house party. It was at this party that she was attacked by a former friend, a girl by the name of Keallie Lacross. The attack was so violent that it left Brianna with a broken nose and a concussion. While the exact cause of the attack is unknown, it has been speculated that it was caused by Keallie's jealousy over Brianna's interactions with a boy at the party. Given the nature of her injuries, Brianna would choose to press charges against her former friend, however these charges would never proceed as Brianna would go missing just three weeks later. It is worth noting that Keallie herself was later cleared of any involvement in Brianna's disappearance, though it's not clear how thoroughly she was investigated.\n\nTimeline of Brianna's Disappearance:\n\nMarch 19th, 2004:\n\nSometime in the morning: Brianna Maitland takes her exam to receiver her GED.\n\nSometime around noon: Brianna and her mother celebrate her accomplishment by going out for lunch. Her mother would later describe her as being happy and looking forward to the future.\n\nThat afternoon: Brianna and her mother do some shopping and run some errands together. At one point while waiting in line at a store, something seemingly catches Brianna's eye outside the store and she excuses herself for a moment to go see to it. When her mother met up with her in the parking lot of the store a few minutes later, she is described as being agitated and unnerved. Worried but not wanting to pry, Brianna's mother does not ask her daughter what happened or who or what she saw outside the store.\n\nBetween 3:30 PM and 4 PM: Brianna's mother drops her off at the home Brianna is staying at, so that she may get ready for her shift at the Black Lantern Inn. Before leaving for work, Brianna leaves her roommate a note saying she will be home after work. Brianna then hops in her 1985 Oldsmobile Sedan, registered to her mother, and departs for work.\n\n11:20 PM: Brianna has completed her shift, clocks out, and leaves the restaurant. According to all who saw her leave, Brianna was alone in her vehicle as she drove off from the restaurant.\n\nMarch 20th, 2004:\n\nEarly morning: A Vermont state trooper discovers Brianna's vehicle backed into the side of a run down house on Route 118 in Richfield VT, about a mile and a half from the Black Lantern Inn. The wooden siding of the house had been broken and breached by the back end of the sedan. Amount the items found at the scene: two of Brianna's paychecks in the front seat of the car, loose change, an unused cigarette, and a water bottle were found on the outside of the car. Beleiving the vehicle had simply been left there by a drunk driver, the trooper had the car towed to a local vehicle garage.\n\nA variety of unfortunate circumstances led to it being a few days before Brianna Maitland would be reported missing. Her roommate saw the note she left on Friday night, left for a weekend away, and returned on Monday to find that Brianna was nowhere to be found. However, she assumed Brianna was simply staying with a friend or family, and so she wouldn't reach out to Brianna's mother until the following day. Maitland's mother herself didn't learn about the discovery of her daughters car until five days after it had been found.\n\nMarch 23rd 2004: Brianna's mother begins to call around to family and friends to see if they have heard from her daughter or know where she is. None of them had seen or spoken to Brianna since before her disappearance that Friday night. That day, Brianna's mother would file a missing persons report for her daughter with the Vermont State Police, still unaware her daughters car had been found in mysterious circumstances.\n\nMarch 25th, 2004: Brianna's parents gave a photo of their daughter to the Vermont State Police, in hopes it could help locate her. It was around this time that a state trooper showed the parents a picture of Briann'a car backed into the old house, and her parents immediately recognized it as hers.\n\nAlleged Witness Sightings:\n\nMarch 19/20th, 11:30 PM-12:30 AM: a man driving by the house Brianna's car was found in claimed to have possibly observed that the cars headlights were on. He also said he did not see anyone in the area of the vehicle or inside the vehicle.\n\nMarch 20th, 12:00 AM-12:30 AM: a man driving by the house claims to have seen a turn signal flashing on Brianna's vehicle. The witness statement makes no mention of seeing any people in the area.\n\nMarch 20th, approximately 4:00 AM: a former boyfriend of Brianna drives by the scene, he recognizes the car but doesn't recall seeing anyone in or around the vehicle and makes no mention of it during turned on in any visible way.\n\nMorning of March 20th: various motorists stopped to take pictures of the unusual scene of a car backed into the side of a house. One of the motorists reported that in addition to what the trooper found at the scene, there was also a bracelet or necklace next to the vehicle. No mentions of any people around the vehicle were brought up.\n\nThe Investigation: Initially authorities believed that Brianna may have simply been a runaway and were skeptical of any foul play being involved in her disappearance. As one would expect, the area in and around the house were combed by searchers and dogs, however nothing of evidentiary significance was found. The vehicle was also examined by the state crime lab after being left at a local garage for a few days and was later returned to the family. Upon return to the family, Brianna's father noticed that his daughters ATM card, contact lens cases, glasses, and headache medication were all still inside the car.\n\nEventually however, authorities would start to believe that foul play was in fact likely in this case. For example, the FBI would state they believe that the scene of Brianna's vehicle may have been staged to look like an accident. A few weeks following her disappearance, the state police received an anonymous tip that Brianna was alive and being held captive in a nearby house occupied by two known local drug dealers. The house was raided on April 15th 2004, and while lots of drug paraphernalia was found, no sign of Brianna was discovered. It was later revealed, upon interviews with Brianna's close friends, that Brianna was acquainted with the two aforementioned drug dealers and had even experimented with hard drugs in the past.\n\nLater that year, authorities would receive another anonymous tip pertaining to Brianna and the two drug dealers, claiming they had been responsible for her disappearance and murder. The graphic tip claimed the two drug dealers had murdered Maitland one week after her disappearance. The tip claimed that one of the dealers had murdered Brianna during an argument over some owed drug money, and that they later dismembered her body and disposed of it on a local pig farm. Authorities investigated the tip but were unable to verify any of the claims made in it.\n\nBrianna's parents also claimed to have received harassing phone calls after her disappearance in which it was claimed Brianna was \"tied to a tree in the woods\" and that her body was at the bottom of a lake. Nothing came of these alleged phone calls.\n\nLater Leads and Developments:\n\nIn 2006, security cameras showed a woman bearing a striking resemblance to Brianna inside an Atlantic City, NJ casino. However, this woman was never identified and nothing came of it.\n\nAuthorities also investigated and ruled out any connection to Maura Murray's similar disappearance in New Hampshire just about a month prior.\n\nIn 2012, authorities considered that Brianna could have been a victim of serial killer/rapist Israel Keyes, as he lived in and committed some of his crimes in Vermont, however they later ruled out the possibility of Brianna being a victim.\n\nIn 2016, investigatiors revealed they had discovered DNA samples inside Brianna's car, though the results of those samples testing were not released. Later that same year, the house Brianna's car was found in was destroyed in a fire.\n\nIn 2022, the state police announced they had a match for the aforementioned DNA sample found in Brianna's car. They did not release the name of the individual, however they did say that this individual was one of the people they had previously investigated regarding Brianna's disappearance and that they were being cooperative.\n\n\n\nThat's really where the case stands at today. Personally I believe this case definitely involved foul play, though I'm skeptical of the drug dealers story. There hasn't been a ton of information released publicly in terms of suspects, although this is still very much seen as an active case by the Vermont State Police. Hopefully someday Brianna will get justice, or at least her body will be found and returned to her family so they may have some peace.\n\nSources: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disappearance_of_Brianna_Maitland\n\nhttps://web.archive.org/web/20190809165946/https://audioboom.com/posts/5558742-brianna-maitland-ep1-bri-s-disappearance\n\nhttps://web.archive.org/web/20180202012616/http://www.cnn.com/2008/CRIME/12/09/grace.coldcase.maitland/index.html?eref=ib_us\n\nSince there aren't a ton of detailed articles out there on this case, I used this Wikipedia article as a starting point and then dove off into each of the individual sources I could access",

      "title": "Argentina is investigating a shocking murder case: the remains of Diego Fernandez, a 16-year-old who had been missing since 1984, have now been found in the home of his schoolmate Cristian Graf (56)",
      "text": "**The skeletal remains found next door to where singer Gustavo Cerati lived belong to 16-year-old Diego Fernández Lima. The court is trying to determine who murdered the young soccer player and why.**\n\nOn July 26, 1984, around two in the afternoon, 16-year-old Diego Fernández Lima said goodbye to his mother. “I'm going to a friend's house and then to school,” he said as he left home, according to his younger brother, Javier. They never saw him again. His parents began searching for him everywhere. Two days later, they went to the police station to report him missing, but they weren't taken seriously. They were told that he had probably run away with a girlfriend and would return soon. But he never returned.\n\nThe disappearance was solved by chance. In May 2025, workers repairing the dividing wall of a property, discovered human skeletal remains buried about 50 cm underground. The news gained notoriety since Argentine rock legend Gustavo Cerati, frontman of the band Soda Stereo, had lived in that house in the early 2000s.\n\nThe Argentine Forensic Anthropology Team team recovered bone fragments and textile remains, and discovered that the body had not been buried in that house, but on the edge of the neighboring property, that of the Graf family. They determined that the grave had been dug to a depth of only half a meter.\n\nThe objects found next to the body, such as the Casio watch with a calculator, the remains of a school uniform tie, and the label of a brand worn in the 1980s and 1990s, gave them the first clues. They identified the victim's profile: a man between 16 and 19 years old, 1.72 meters tall, who had been wounded in the back with a knife or other sharp object at the level of the fourth rib. The bones of his hip and upper limbs also bore marks made by another object of a different blade.\n\nThe mark found on the rib is an injury consistent with a wound. The other marks reveal that the victim's body, possibly lifeless, was manipulated. One hypothesis is that they attempted to dismember the body to more easily dispose of it, but they were unsuccessful.\n\nThe case took a turn thanks to a call from the victim's nephew. A blood sample was taken from the victim's mother and the genetic analysis was conclusive: the bones belonged to her son, Diego Fernandez Lima.\n\nDiego's father had died in an accident while searching for him. His mother, 87, has kept his room untouched for years in case he returned and refused to change the phone number in case he ever called home.\n\nThe main suspect is Diego's former classmate, Cristian Graf, now 56. Although they weren't close friends, they shared a common hobby: motorcycles. Diego had one he loved, and Cristian Graf would fix them. Graf no longer lives in the family home he shared with his parents and older sister, where the victim's body was found. However, the house still belongs to the family, and his elderly mother resides there.\n\nInvestigators suspect that Diego went to the Graf home of his own volition. They are trying to determine who the killer was and what the motive was.\n\nThe now suspect approached the workers in May when he learned of the discovery of the bones. He first suggested that it could be the body of a priest, since a church had previously been built there. He then ventured that the skeletal remains could be linked to a stable. Third, he suggested that they could have been dumped on the site.\n\nOn August 11, 2025, when confronted by a journalist asking directly if he was responsible for Diego’s death, Graf flinched and abruptly ended the conversation by closing the door, offering no explanation or denial. (Here is the video of Graf speaking to the journalist  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9WBTyIGmSM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9WBTyIGmSM) )\n\nCristian Graf has a wife and four children. On August 12, 2025, a reporter spoke to his son, who in a WhatsApp message expressed: \"*I don't have answers. I looked for them, but I don't have them. And I would also love to have them as a son and as a citizen.\"* \n\nOn August 13, 2025, Adrián Farias, a former classmate of both men, testified that he once suffered an attempted sexual assault by Diego Fernández in the school's bathroom. He stated: “I was in my second year of high school, and Diego had a way of making jokes. I went into the bathroom; I was alone, and he came and attacked me from behind. I managed to get him off me and escape. It was an attempted assault as he had his pants down. I didn't talk to anyone about it because back then, you couldn't confess things like that. I'm exposing what I experienced at the time, and whether it helps the case or not is beyond my control.\" Regarding Cristian Graf, Farías described him as a \"low-key, quiet\" person.

State Police announced the breakthrough today, also confirming that a deceased male discovered in 1992, missing his head, hands, and feet, has now been publicly identified as Tony.",
      "text": "Case Summary:\n\n“Tony Bledsoe vanished on March 16, 1992. The 24-year-old husband and father left his Arcadia, Indiana home in route to nearby Noblesville, Indiana. He was last seen driving his black and gray 1971 Oldsmobile Cutlass, with a vanity license plate reading “TJSTOY,” on Indiana 19 at around 10am. Tony left behind all of his personal belongings. He had a total of eight dollars in cash, and his car had only an eighth of a tank of gas. No trace of Tony, nor his car, have ever been found.”\n\nUpdate Article from Fox59 News:\n\n“ARCADIA, Ind. — More than 30 years later, the family of Tony Bledsoe is finally getting answers. On the morning of March 16, 1992, the 24-year-old father of three set out from his home in Arcadia on Indiana 19 with $8 in his pocket and an eighth of a tank of gas in his car… and disappeared.\n\n“My dad didn’t leave,” said Justin Robinson, son of Tony Bledsoe. “My dad didn’t just leave.”\n\nOn Tuesday, 33 years after his father vanished off the face of the Earth, Robinson is finally getting answers. And, perhaps, even justice. \nInvestigators announced that Thomas “Tommy” Anderson Jr. of Arcadia has been arrested in connection to the decades-old cold case revolving around Tony Bledsoe. Court records show Anderson is charged with one count of murder.\n\nAt a press conference, police revealed human remains were found in Putnam County on April 3, 1992. Court documents state the remains were found at a dump site on 900 West just north of U.S. 40. The remains consisted of a body without a head, hands or feet.\n\nThose remains were unidentified until 2018.\n\n“Those remains were identified as Tony Bledsoe,” said Sgt. John Perrine with Indiana State Police.\n\nThe investigation stretched on for years until just hours before Tuesday’s press conference when Anderson was taken into custody. But while Anderson is under arrest, officials say investigators are still looking for other potential suspects. \n\n“This arrest is not the conclusion of our investigation,” Perrine said.\n\nAnyone with information about this case is asked to come forward and reach out to Indiana State Police. Tipsters can remain anonymous.\n\nCourt documents reveal how investigators were led to Thomas Anderson decades after the disappearance of Tony Bledsoe. \n\nAccording to the documents, a tip given to investigators got the ball rolling in March 14, 2018 — almost 26 years to the day after Bledsoe vanished. The tipster allegedly told police that Anderson once told a story about witnessing Andy Emmert murder Tony Bledsoe. Details of the murder included the dismemberment of Bledsoe’s body by cutting off his head, hands and feet and placing the body parts in a bucket full of concrete. \n\nCourt documents reveal one of Anderson’s family members testified in front of an investigative grand jury in the fall of 2024. The family member told the grand jury a similar story, that Anderson once confessed to killing Tony Bledsoe with Andy Emmert. This account also included details about how Anderson and Emmert dismembered the body by cutting off Bledsoe’s hands, feet and head.\n\nInvestigators confronted Anderson about the allegations. According to the court documents, Anderson spoke to police on three separate occasions and confessed to playing a part in the murder of Tony Bledsoe. \n\nAnderson claimed the murder stemmed from a car theft racket that Anderson and Emmert were part of. Bledsoe allegedly threatened to go to the cops at one point after being sold a stolen car radio. \n\nAnderson allegedly was with Bledsoe when the pair arrived at Emmert’s house on State Road 19 in Noblesville on March 19, 1992. This is where Anderson accused Emmert of shooting Bledsoe in the head with a shotgun. \nAnderson recalled witnessing Emmert stab Bledsoe multiple times with a knife after the shooting. Anderson also allegedly joined in, telling investigators he struck Bledsoe with a baseball bat.\n\nAccording to the court documents, Anderson described the knife in detail that Emmert used to stab Bledsoe. Investigators said a search of Emmert’s home in October 2024 uncovered a knife matching the description given by Anderson hidden inside a safe.\n\nAnderson went on to tell the cops the pair dismembered Bledsoe. They placed his head, hands and feet in a “pickle bucket’ full of concrete. \n\nInvestigators said Anderson recalls Emmert driving them toward a town with “Green” in the name before they dumped the body at a dump site. Police noted how the remains eventually identified as Bledsoe’s were found approximately 10 miles from Greencastle. \n\nAccording to the court documents, other accounts of Anderson’s tale also lined up with the state of Bledsoe’s remains. These included tying up the body in nylon rope and spray painting the body black to try and conceal it.\n\nIn a furthering damning revelation, state police said details about the body having no limbs or head was ever released to the public. Further, no details about the body being spray-painted or tied up were released to the public, either. \n\nDespite Anderson accusing Emmert of shooting Bledsoe and stabbing him multiple times, police said only Thomas Anderson is charged with the murder of Tony Bledsoe at this time. \n\nAndy Emmert’s home was searched last October, with two Oldsmobile Cutlasses — the same vehicle Bledsoe was last seen driving — towed from his property. \n\nDespite this, ISP did not comment on the status of Andy Emmert in connection to this cold case beyond Perrine saying, “This arrest is not the conclusion of our investigation.””\n\n**Sources**\n\n[FOX59 article](https://fox59.com/news/indycrime/state-police-make-arrest-in-1992-cold-case-of-tony-bledsoe/)\n\n[WISHTV article](https://www.wishtv.com/news/crime-watch-8/authorities-arrest-hamilton-county-suspect-for-murder-of-man-missing-since-1992/)\n\n[Previous Write Up 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/UnresolvedMysteries/s/AnKdmcNR2O)\n\n[Previous Write Up 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/UnresolvedMysteries/s/QhC0cQMykB)",

      "title": "A popular young nun vanished after a shopping trip in Baltimore in 1969. Her body was found weeks later in a rubbish tip. Decades later, allegations of a cover-up involving clergy sex abuse cast her murder in a chilling new light.",
      "text": "**Trigger Warning**: This post contains detailed discussions of sexual abuse, clergy abuse, child abuse, and murder. Reader discretion is advised.\n\n---\n\n# Summary:\n\n* Sister Cathy Cesnik, a beloved 26-year-old teacher at a Baltimore Catholic girls' high school, vanished in November 1969.\n* Her body was found in January 1970 in a remote rubbish-strewn ravine. She died from blunt force trauma to the head.\n* Decades later, multiple former students accused Father Joseph Maskell (the school chaplain) of sexual abuse.\n* One survivor claims Maskell showed her Cathy’s corpse as a warning.\n* Maskell was never charged with Cathy’s murder but is now considered one of the most prolific abusers in Maryland history.\n* DNA from the crime scene has never matched any known suspect.\n* There's a Netflix docuseries called *The Keepers* which brought international attention to the case in 2017.\n* A 2023 Maryland Attorney General report confirmed decades of cover-ups by the Archdiocese.\n\n---\n\n# Who was Sister Cathy Cesnik?:\n\nCatherine Cesnik was born in Pittsburgh in 1942 and joined the School Sisters of Notre Dame at age 18. In the late 1960s, she taught English and drama at Archbishop Keough High School in Baltimore, an all-girls Catholic school. She was vibrant, loved poetry and music, and was admired by her students for her compassion and advocacy.\n\nBy late 1969, Cathy had moved out of the convent and was living in a flat with another nun while teaching at a state school. She was still close with many of her former Keough students.\n\n---\n\n# Disappearance and Discovery:\n\nOn the evening of Friday 7 November 1969, Cathy went shopping for an engagement gift and some bakery buns. She cashed her wages, likely visited a bakery and never returned home.\n\nAt around 4.30am the next morning, friends found her car oddly abandoned just a block from her flat. The doors were unlocked and the car was muddy. The box of buns she had purchased was still inside.\n\nOn 3 January 1970, her body was discovered in a remote ravine in Lansdowne, roughly six miles from her home. She had suffered a fatal skull fracture from a blunt object. Her remains were badly decomposed, and it could not be determined whether she had been sexually assaulted.\n\n---\n\n# The Original Investigation:\n\nPolice interviewed Cathy’s friends and colleagues. One person of interest was Father Gerry Koob, a Jesuit priest and close friend (they had discussed leaving religious life to marry). He was soon cleared, having an alibi and passing a polygraph test.\n\nAnother priest who worked with Cathy at Keough, Father Joseph Maskell, was briefly questioned but was not considered a suspect at the time. The case eventually went cold.\n\n---\n\n# Allegations Against Father Maskell:\n\nIn the 1990s, survivors Jean Hargadon Wehner and Teresa Lancaster came forward accusing Maskell of systematic sexual abuse at Keough in the late 1960s. They alleged he raped and drugged girls, sometimes with the help of other clergy and even police officers.\n\nJean stated that after she told Cathy about the abuse in 1969, Maskell took her to a remote area and showed her Cathy’s dead body, warning: \"You see what happens when you say bad things about people.\"\n\nMaskell fled to Ireland in 1994 and died in 2001. He was never criminally charged. The Archdiocese has since paid hundreds of thousands in settlements to Maskell’s victims.\n\n---\n\n# Renewed Investigations and The Keepers:\n\nIn 2017, the Netflix docuseries *The Keepers* reignited interest in the case. It featured interviews with survivors, investigators and citizen sleuths Gemma Hoskins and Abbie Schaub, who uncovered new leads.\n\nIn 2017, Baltimore County police exhumed Maskell’s body for DNA. It did not match forensic evidence from Cathy’s crime scene. Other suspects were also tested with no matches.\n\n---\n\n# Recent Developments:\n\nIn 2023, the Maryland Attorney General released a 456-page report detailing decades of clergy sexual abuse and cover-ups in the Archdiocese of Baltimore. Maskell is named as having abused at least 39 victims. The report also implies another priest at Keough (identified by journalists as Gerry Koob) may have also abused students.\n\nThe Child Victims Act of 2023 eliminated Maryland’s statute of limitations for child sex abuse lawsuits. The Archdiocese filed for bankruptcy in response to anticipated lawsuits.\n\nThe FBI also exhumed Joyce Malecki’s body in 2023. She was murdered days after Cathy and her case may be connected.\n\n---\n\n# Theories:\n\n* **Maskell Ordered It:** Cathy was silenced for knowing too much about the abuse at Keough. Maskell may have enlisted police allies or others to kill her.\n* **Police Involvement:** Some survivors implicate a Baltimore County officer known as \"Brother Bob.\" One anonymous woman said she was abused by a cop involved in Cathy’s case.\n* **Other Perpetrators:** *The Keepers* raised names like Edgar Davidson and Billy Schmidt, both of whom acted suspiciously after Cathy’s murder. Neither has been charged.\n* **Unrelated Serial Killer:** Some believe Cathy may have been the victim of a serial predator active in the region. But DNA in at least one similar case (Pamela Conyers) was recently matched to a different, now-deceased suspect.\n\n---\n\n# Conclusion:\n\n56 years later, Sister Cathy's murder remains unsolved. DNA has not identified the killer, but Maskell remains the most plausible suspect in terms of motive.\n\nLaw enforcement believes the case can still be solved if someone with knowledge comes forward. New techniques like forensic genealogy offer some hope.\n\nCathy Cesnik died young but her story helped expose an appalling pattern of abuse and cover-up. Her former students continue to demand the justice she never received.\n\n---\n\n**What do you think?** Could Maskell have orchestrated Cathy’s murder without leaving any evidence? Was a police officer involved? What might finally bring this case to a resolution?\n\n---\n\n# Sources/Further Reading:\n\n**Netflix –** ***The Keepers*** **(2017)**  \n[https://www.netflix.com/title/80122179](https://www.netflix.com/title/80122179)\n\n**Maryland Attorney General’s Report (April 2023):**  \n[https://www.marylandattorneygeneral.gov/news%20documents/OAG\\_redacted\\_Report\\_on\\_Child\\_Sexual\\_Abuse.pdf](https://www.marylandattorneygeneral.gov/news%20documents/OAG_redacted_Report_on_Child_Sexual_Abuse.pdf)\n\n**CBS News - FBI to Exhume Body of Joyce Malecki (December 2023):**  \n[https://www.cbsnews.com/news/fbi-to-exhume-body-joyce-malecki-netflix-the-keepers-1969-murder-baltimore/](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/fbi-to-exhume-body-joyce-malecki-netflix-the-keepers-1969-murder-baltimore/)\n\n**NPR - 'The Keepers' Witness Was Already Living a Nightmare (June 2017):**  \n[https://www.npr.org/2017/06/21/533797877/before-her-teachers-murder-this-keepers-witness-was-already-living-a-nightmare](https://www.npr.org/2017/06/21/533797877/before-her-teachers-murder-this-keepers-witness-was-already-living-a-nightmare)\n\n**The Washington Post - Exhumed Priest's DNA Doesn't Match Evidence (May 2017):**  \n[https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/true-crime/wp/2017/05/17/exhumed-priests-dna-doesnt-match-evidence-in-case-of-sister-cathy-slaying-from-1969/](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/true-crime/wp/2017/05/17/exhumed-priests-dna-doesnt-match-evidence-in-case-of-sister-cathy-slaying-from-1969/)\n\n**Baltimore County Government - Sister Catherine Ann Cesnik Case:**  \n[https://www.baltimorecountymd.gov/departments/police/unsolved/homicides/cesnik-sister-1970](https://www.baltimorecountymd.gov/departments/police/unsolved/homicides/cesnik-sister-1970) \\[I'm from the UK and this link wasn't accessible to me, so I used [https://web.archive.org/web/20241107131244/https://www.baltimorecountymd.gov/departments/police/unsolved/homicides/cesnik-sister-1970](https://web.archive.org/web/20241107131244/https://www.baltimorecountymd.gov/departments/police/unsolved/homicides/cesnik-sister-1970) \\]\n\n**Archdiocese of Baltimore - Response to 'The Keepers':**  \n[https://www.archbalt.org/promise-protect-promote-healing/bishop-w-francis-malooly-responds-to-the-keepers/](https://www.archbalt.org/promise-protect-promote-healing/bishop-w-francis-malooly-responds-to-the-keepers/)",

      "text": "Hello everyone! As always, I'd like to thank you all for your votes and comments on my last post about Loretta Norwood, and, wouldn't you believe, I can actually bring everyone (kind of) good news! u/Mysterious-Date8123 had looked through the records of the Harris County District Clerk's office, and managed to find out that Loretta is currently serving time in the Harris County jail for child abandonment and aggravated assault with a deadly weapon. This means that Loretta is accounted for and isn't considered missing anymore. The man Loretta left her son with, who she claimed to be the boy's father, has filed a request for a paternity test, but the results aren't available online. I think that it's safe to say that our work here is done, and we have to let the law enforcement do its job; I just want to say that I hope that Loretta's son will be able to grow up in a safe and stable environment, be it with family or foster parents. Once again, thank you so much to u/[Mysterious-Date8123](https://www.reddit.com/user/Mysterious-Date8123/) for their work!\n\n  \nToday I'd like to cover another disappearance case; There is a fairly recent (six months old) write-up by u/Dr_Pepper_blood [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/UnresolvedMysteries/comments/1dq7827/missing_in_wisconsin_suffering_from_ptsd_15_year/)\\- however, new articles have been released recently that give us more info about the whole story and contain a lot of new details, so I figured that I might create a new one with new info to bring more attention to the case once more. \n\n\n\nBACKGROUND\n\n  \nJoniah A Walker was 15 when she went missing from Milwaukee, Wisconsin, USA.\n\n  \nShe enjoyed baking bread from scratch and watching the show Cupcake Wars. Everyone who knew her described her as very intelligent- according to her mother, Tanesha Howard, she could walk and talk before she was one year old. When Tanesha became ill with COVID 19, Joniah drove her to her doctor's appointments- Tanesha didn't even know her daughter even knew how to drive. She missed a lot of classes at the time, but she managed to pass them anyway. Joniah also showed interest in babysitting, and wanted to become a professional babysitter.\n\n  \nJoniah was described as \"shy\", and she had sadly struggled with mental illness, specifically depression and PTSD. She was also quite distrustful of strangers. She was described as \"introverted\" and struggled with making friends; Her mother recalls that she asked her how she was able to quickly make friends and talk to people. A few weeks before she went missing, Joniah asked her mom how she would feel if she never saw her again. Joniah always prefered to talk to adults, and not children and teens her age.\n\n  \nJoniah was forbidden from using certain apps used to contact people, but her parents believe that she managed to find other ways to talk to do it; Investigation after Joniah's disappearance had revealed that she was using Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat, IMVU Virtual World, Discord, YouTube, Gmail, and \"some websites for adults\". According to her mother, as Joniah got older, she became less involved with her family at home, and more involved with people online, allegedly \"doing stuff she had no business doing”. The investigation into her disappearance revealed that Joniah had been watching videos about \"doomsday prepping\" and \"living off the grid\".\n\n\n\nIt was also confirmed during the investigation that Joniah used websites she wasn't supposed to be able to access as a minor, and that she communicated with older men- she even declared that she loved one of them. About a year before she disappeared, she showed Tanesha a photo of a \"white man\" and kept asking \"isn't he cute?\", too which her mother responded with a resounding \"No\". Joniah's father, Jonathan, recounted a time where he saw Joniah seemingly talk with a man online on her iPad (he only saw a message saying \"I love you\") and he snatched it from her hands, but Joniah wouldn't press her finger to unlock it. He described the man as white, in his 30s, with a slightly reddish beard and glasses. On another ocassion, Jonathan found his daughter's diary, with one entry saying \"I am glad my dad didn’t open my iPad because he would know all my secrets\". On another day, Jonathan took Joniah and her friend to a restaurant, and noticed that Joniah had a \"large knife\" with her. When he asked why would she need it, she replied \"for self-defense\". \n\n  \nIn 2018, Joniah wrote a letter to someone she met online, who went by \"Zach\", with the letter allegedly being addressed to Pennsylvania. The letter was never sent, but it disappeared the day Joniah went missing. Joniah was reportedly \"obsessed\" with Zach. \n\n\n\nTanesha had a feeling something wrong had been going on with her daughter for a while, but her other children kept telling her that she was paranoid. She had a feeling that someone was watching Joniah and asked her older children to check on her when she was home alone (at the time, Joniah lived with her mother and older brother), or to not let her walk the family dog alone.\n\n\n\nJoniah had her own debit card an a bank account, because she \"didn’t give (Tanesha) a reason not to trust her\". \n\n  \nBefore she disappeared, Joniah got an amazon package inside of a giant box, contents of which she didn't want to show her mom. She claimed that it was a backpack. Ultimately, Tanesha never got to see what did her daughter actually bought. Allegedly, Joniah had been ordering quite a lot before she disappeared.\n\n  \nAround April or May, Joniah apparently lost a lot of weight- Tanesha took her to a doctor and she was supposed to go to a follow-up visit with her daughter, but didn't get to due to Joniah's disappearence.\n\n  \nTanesha is a social worker. Joniah and Tanesha shared a very close relationship, and Tanesha would always call her daughter \"Baby girl\", due to Joniah being her youngest daughter. Tanesha described her daughter as a \"perfect daughter. She is angelic, soft spoken and very intelligent\", \"inquisitive\" and \"very sweet, very soft-spoken\". In the police report, it's stated that Tanesha said her daughter was “not street savvy,” “a very smart girl,” “intellectual,” “polite,” “well-mannered,” “\\[socially\\] awkward,” and “soft-spoken”. \n\nJoniah's therapist said that she was a \"very intelligent person\" and that she was \"not comfortable with physical attention because of past trauma\".\n\n\n\nDISAPPEARANCE\n\n  \nJoniah was last seen on the 23rd of June when she was caught on her neighbour's ring camera, as she was leaving her home at the 400 block of West Brown Street, near the intersection of East Reservoir Avenue and North Buffum Street, at around 2:30 PM. She was walking at a fast pace, but seemingly slowed down once she turned the corner, according to a witness. On the recording, Joniah was wearing her brother's clothes, which she usually didn't wear, and she was wearing a large backpack on her back. It's possible she also took her HP chrome laptop, but it's not confirmed. At around 3:27 PM, someone called Joniah's therapist from Joniah's phone, and later that evening, a message was sent from Joniah's phone to the therapist, where she said that she ran away from home.\n\n\n\nJoniah's father was supposed to pick her up from her home at 4 PM, so that Joniah could go get her work permit for a local pizzeria, but when his daughter didn't return home, Howard became worried. He tried to call Joniah, but she wasn't picking up; He then called Tanesha, but she wasn't able to get her daughter to pick up either. Jonathan then called Joniah's friends and siblings, and when they didn't know where she was, he started to knock on neighbours' doors- but nobody saw Joniah.\n\n  \nWhen Tanesha tried to report her daughter as missing, she was met with sarcasm and dismissal from the officer taking her report in. \n\n  \nWhen the police managed to get into Joniah's phone, they discovered that she used wi-fi and apps to hide her data usage, meaning that no info could be extracted; Joniah deleted everything before she left. The only phone calls that were made with the phone were to Joniah's parents and siblings, but she did use a lot of internet data when it was examined closer. \n\n\n\nShortly after Joniah's disappearance, strange emails started to show up in the inbox of an address that only Joniah would know about (it was discovered during the investigation). They were traced to a website that allowed to send emails annonymously, and they stopped coming relatively quickly. There was also an \"unrecognized number\" on the phone bill- Joniah's family tried to call it multiple times, but it always went to voicemail, which indicated that the user was someone named \"Flowers\". Officers have contacted the number too, and talked to a woman who was \"uncooperative\".\n\n  \nWhen digging through Joniah's iCloud data, the investigators found a note with two addresses and phone numbers. When they arrived at one of the addresses, they were suprised to find out that anyone was living there- a man who lived there said he moved in three years ago, and that he never heard of Joniah. \n\n  \nAnother thing that was discovered through Joniah's iCloud was a phone number that was sent to her through snapchat, with a name \"Zach\" attached to it, who is described in police documents as \"a white male with red hair and a beard”, just like the man Howard saw on Joniah's iPad. The full name of the man is known to police, but the man isn't accused of anything, so it is witheld from press. \n\n  \nAn undisclosed time after Joniah went missing, her brother had recieved two location data points, that Tanesha suspects were sent from Joniah's phone. \n\n  \nMackenzie Thomson, Joniah's older sister, said that she managed to log into her sister's snapchat and found \"distrubing\" videos; All of Joniah's contacts on snapchat appeared to be older men, both from the US and outside of it. The majority of the messages have been deleted; Videos associated with the account started in June of 2020 and ended in June of 2022. There are no photos on the iCloud- it's believed that they were all saved through snapchat. \n\n  \nOn the 2nd of July 2022, Tanesha had recieved a call from a man calling from a prison in Richmond, Virginia. The man knew her name and introduced himself; He said that he was in prison for \"a Violation of Probation and reckless driving\". There was another call from that prison two days later, but we don't know any details about it. She also recieved a call from a prison in Charlotte, North Carolina; The man calling identified himself as ‘Ewayne’ or ‘Emmanuel’- he said he was looking for a girl named \"Kyeta Kyeta\", and that he got the number from social media. There were also calls from different scammers who tried to extort money from the family by claiming they knew where Joniah was.\n\n  \nThe police reports that a woman from a child advocacy group was involved in helping Joniah, and that Joniah had read \"two books related to learning the German language\" recently. \n\n  \nJoniah had logged out of her facebook app and deactivated the \"find my\" function on her iPhone and iPad on the day she went missing.\n\n  \nPolice managed to track down \"Zach\" to an address in Pennsylvania, but he no longer lived there- he moved out some time before, and his mother gave police his new address. When Zach was finally contacted, he admitted that he did talk to Joniah when he was 17, but he never met her and he had no idea where could she be.\n\n  \nOn July 29, 2022, Tanesha recieved an email associated with (@)riseup.net, a website boasting about \"“IP addresses or store data that can uniquely identify users” and that “all user data, including email, is encrypted\".\n\n\n\nCONCLUSION\n\n  \nThis is such a confusing case. It seems like a straight-forward story of a troubled (mentally ill, shy, and with experience of trauma) girl being groomed by someone and leaving home to be with them, but there's so many strange details surrounding it- Why did Joniah loose so much weight? What was inside the amazon orders she made? Why did the inmates try to contact Tanesha? What's up with the encryption site? Who sent the two coordinates? Is Zach telling the truth?\n\n  \nI feel like the most likely explanation is that Joniah was groomed by someone online, and then convinced to leave home and run away. The whole secrecy surrounding her online activity leads me to believe that someone taught her how to hide her trail, and, given her intelligence, she managed to execute the plan pretty much flawlessly. It seemed like she was in contact with many adult men, each of them could potentially be someone who managed to sway her- tracking them all down would be a lot of work. \n\n  \nI am suspicious of Zach, but I feel like he could turn out to be a red herring- if he's telling the truth, of course. It seems like they were in contact for a relatively long time, a couple years at least, which in itself is kind of odd- Joniah was only about 10 or 11 in 2018, back when she wanted to send him a letter. There could be an innocent reason here, but let's be honest, in cases like this, there almost never is. \n\n  \nWhat caught my eye was that Joniah seemed to be interested in survival and living off the grid. Of course, people have different interests, but given Joniah's disappearance, it's quite suspicious- was that her plan? To become fully independent and live off the grid? But why? From what we can gather, Joniah lived in a loving home and was very close to her mom- what would she be running from? \n\n  \nHer family believe that Joniah was groomed by someone online. They mentioned sex trafficking, or that Joniah is held captive somewhere- which I would say is unlikely. Joniah came from a loving, attentive home, and that's just not the kind of environment human traffickers recruit from. Investigators have allegedly searched through a confidential database to see if Joniah might be involved in sex trafficking, but they didn't get any results. \n\n  \nRegardless of what happened, I feel so sorry for Joniah. She seems like such a sweet girl, clearly clever and capable, but she got pulled into the wrong crowd and most likely swayed by someone who wanted to harm her. It happens quite often with kids and teens who are intelligent, but are facing social difficulties for different reason and can't easily fit in with their peers. I really hope that this is an Alicia Navarro situation, and that Joniah is alive somewhere out there, and when she'll turn 18, she will walk into a police station and ask to be taken out of the missing person's registry. That is, if she won't be found sooner, of course, hopefully healthy and well.\n\n  \nJoniah A Walker was 15 when she went missing, and would be 17 now. She is Black, 5' 1\" (61 Inch / 155 cm) and 100 lbs (45 kg). She had long, black hair, styled in braids, and brown eyes. Her ears are pierced. She was last seen wearing an olive green t-shirt with the Adidas logo on the front, blue jeans and blue and white shoes- she was also carrying a large backpack.\n\n  \nIf you have any info about Joniah's wherabouts, please contact the Milwaukee Police Department - Sensitive Crimes Division at (414) 935-7405 (case number 221740136)\n\n\n\nSOURCES:  \n\n1.

      "title": "Woman goes on a camping trip with her long-term boyfriend; Her car is found on a forest road after two weeks, disabled, with no sign of the owner- Where is Danielle Lopez? (2024)",
      "text": "Hello everyone! As always, I wanted to thank you for all your comments and votes under my last post about Namrud \"Rudy\" Tessema- I hope that he will be found soon.\n\n  \nToday I bring you another case of someone mysteriously vanishing in the woods.\n\n  \nBACKGROUND\n\n  \nDanielle Evelyn Lopez was 37 when she went missing from Woodland Township, New Jersey, USA. \n\n  \nShe grew up in West Chester, Pennsylvania, raised by her single mother, Sue Quackenbush. Danielle was a good student and used to be a cheerleader. She was a middle child and had two brothers who have both died- her older brother died by suicide on Chrismas Day in 2015, and her younger brother died in a car crash only 10 months later.\n\n  \nAt the time, Danielle was living with her paternal grandfather in Delran, New Jersey. The two were very close and frequently travelled together. In 2013, they were featured in a local newspaper in an article about how they bridged the generational gap. Sadly, in 2020, her grandfather had passed due to COVID, and her father died just a month after. Around the same time, Danielle made a heartbreaking decision to put down her old dog, Roscoe, who she loved very much. Sue said that Danielle struggled with grief, but she seemed to be doing all right before she went missing.\n\n  \nDanielle was in a relationship with a man named James Scott Dunn. They were together for seven years by the time of her disappearance, but they were dating on and off. Sue didn't think that James was a good partner for her daughter, as he was significantly older and had convictions for theft and drug-related crimes.\n\n  \nShe was known to frequent Brendan T. Byrne State Forest as well as Pemberton Township and Willingboro.\n\n  \nSue said that her daughter was \"sweet, creative, and loving\", and that she was \"a wonderful daughter and a vibrant light in (her) life\". Danielle was \"very kind, always thinking of someone else. Loved her family\" and \"bubbly, loved singing karaoke\".\n\n  \nDISAPPEARANCE\n\n  \nBefore she went missing, on the evening of the 12th of April, Danielle told her mother that she planned to go camping with James. The conversation was \"wonderful\" according to Sue, they \"spoke about a lot of things\", and Danielle \"was upbeat and happy at the time\". Danielle used to camp as a child, but Sue wouldn't describe her as a \"frequent camper\" as an adult.\n\n  \nDanielle was last seen on the 13th of April, leaving the Wawa (seems to be a conveniance store) on Route 72 in the Vincentown section of Southampton in Burlington County at around 9 AM. She was caught on the store's security camera as she was leaving with \"someone\" (The investigators seem to know who it is but don't want to share their identity). Danielle allegedly looked \"good\" (as in not distressed or depressed) on the video.\n\n  \nAt 6 PM, a couple driving by spotted Danielle walking on Lost Lane in Penn State Forest in Woodland in southern Burlington County, around 12 miles (19 km) away from the campground. They chatted briefly; During their conversation, Danielle told them that she was looking at the trees and drove into the puddle by accident. She asked them for help with pushing her car out, but the couple told her to try catch someone else by the main road, and Danielle agreed. The interaction was caught on their GoPro, and it was shared with the investigators. The couple have actually passed Danielle earlier than that too- when she was driving, allegedly alone; That was also recorded on their GoPro. In the recording where they interacted, Danielle seemed \"lucid, coherent, and OK\", according to Sue. She also had her phone in her hand, but it's unknown if she had cell service; Sue seems to believe that Danielle was calm because she called someone to come help already. In the video, Danielle was wearing different clothes than the ones she wore in the Wawa video.\n\n  \nDanielle was reported missing by her mother, Sue, when she stopped responding to her calls. Sue noticed on her Wawa app that Danielle has bought a coffee in one of their stores (the two shared their account) and gave that info to the police.  \n\n  \nHer car, a 2008 2-door blue Hyundai Accent, was later found by the police, disabled, on Lost Lane Road in Penn State Forest, Woodland Township on the 1st of May, which is right where the interaction with the couple took place. Sue drove out to the place the car was found, and she claims that there's \"no way\" Danielle would drive out there. Inside, some \"personal items\" were found, along with the clothes Danielle was wearing in the Wawa video. The battery was dead, and the car had to be jumpstarted- after that, the hazard lights turned on. There was no sign of suspicious activity around the car.\n\n  \nDanielle's phone hasn't been found, and her bank accounts have been inactive.\n\n  \nHer boyfriend has been interviewed about the case. He said that he last saw Danielle on the morning of 13th of April. As of 15th of September 2024, he was in state prison for unrelated charges. Multiple other people who have been around Danielle shortly before she went missing, including the person that was with her at Wawa, were also interviewed. There are no official suspects named.\n\n  \nCONCLUSION\n\n\n\nSue implies that police have lead her to believe that they are most likely looking for Danielle's remains, and seems to believe that her daughter is dead, and that foul play might've been involved.\n\n  \nJames was reportedly \"devastated\" by Danielle's disappearance. He says that he wasn't on the campground on the night she disappeared, and returned in the morning after she was gone. He says that the investigators should focus on a camper that had been allegedly bothering Danielle whenever he wasn't around.\n\n  \nAfter the loss of her sons, Sue joined an organization called [Tragedy Assistance Program for Survivors](https://www.taps.org/) (TAPS), where she recieved help from a peer mentor. She's giving back to the program by mentoring mothers who have also lost multiple children. After Danielle went missing, the organization is offering her all the help they can offer.\n\n  \nThere is a 5,000$ reward for \"the direct location or information leading to (Danielle's) direct location\" available untill the midnight of the 31st of July.\n\n\n\nDanielle Evelyn Lopez was 37 when she went missing, and would be 38 now. She is a white woman, 5'4\" (64 Inch / 163 cm) and 135 lbs (62 kg). She has blue/green eyes and brown hair. She has a slight scar on her upper lip, and her ears are pierced. \n\n  \nIf you have any info regarding Danielle's wherabouts, contact the New Jersey State Police - Red Lion at (609) 859-2282 (case number H660-2024-00052).\n\n  \nSOURCES:\n\n1.

      "title": "Misty Copsey went to the Fair and was never seen again. ",
      "text": "Misty Copsey was an average 14 year old girl in Puyallup, WA in 1992 and she was excited to go to the Puyallup Fair with her friend, Trina Bovard. Misty's mom worked overnights as a caretaker for an elderly woman and would not be able to pick her daughter up from the fair, which made her hesitant to let Misty go. But, like most teenagers, Misty was insistent and eventually her mom, Diana, agreed to let her go as long as she made sure to catch the bus home. Misty promised and her and Trina went to the Fair. \n\nThey had a typical fair day - they rode the rides, ate the foods, and enjoyed their time together. Soon, Misty realized what time it was and that she was going to miss the last bus ride home. Trina only lived a mile and a half from the Fair and was going to walk home but Misty lived a considerable distance away, in a town called Spanaway, which was a 20-30 minute car ride away but was an hours away walk. When she missed the bus, she called her mom at her job and suggested she would have an older friend of her's, 18 year old Rheuban Schmidt, pick her up but Diana was adamantly against this. She asked Misty to call other friends for a ride and let her know who was picking her up. Misty agreed and hung up the payphone. \n\nWhen Misty couldn't find another ride home, she decided to walk the 8+ miles home and began walking towards the nearest freeway on-ramp, Highway 512. Misty never arrived home and was never seen again. \n\nMisty's mother filed a missing person's report but due to a previously filed missing persons report on Misty and fellow classmates claiming to have heard from or seen Misty after her disappearance, the police closed the case without ever really looking for her. \n\nWhen police did finally investigate Misty's disappearance, they spoke with Misty's friend Trina who stated that prior to separating, Trina called Rheuban for a ride home despite her mother telling her no. According to Rheuban, Misty did call him for a ride but he declined to assist due to not having enough gas for the journey. However, Rheuban's roommate stated that he left shortly after the phone call and assumed he went to pickup Misty. According to Trina, Misty called Rheuban again and told him to go to her home to get gas money but he again declined. It was at this time the Trina and Misty agreed to go their separate ways and both walk to their respective homes. \n\nHowever, police soon learned this was a lie and Trina never walked home but in fact received a ride home from her 23 year old boyfriend, Michael Rhyner. Michael was 8 years older than Trina and had been accused of abducting and raping an 11 year old girl when he was 16 years old, though charges were never filed against him. This news was concerning to police for several reasons and they decided to question Trina further where she admitted to offering Misty a ride home. According to Trina, Misty declined the ride home as she was not comfortable with Michael and that was when she decided to walk home and/or seek other rides home. Police theorized that after taking Trina home, Michael took the opportunity to return to the vicinity of the fair and offer Misty another ride home. After questioning Michael and subjecting him to a polygraph, they dropped him as a suspect after he passed the polygraph. \n\nAfter clearing Michael, they returned to their original suspect, Rheuban, who changed his story and stated that he blacked out after Misty's second phone call to him and he had no idea what he did afterwards. He stated that the next memory he has is waking up at his grandmother's home the following morning which is located in Enumclaw, which is a 45 minute drive from Spanaway. This concerned police and made them questionable of Rheuban as he refused Misty a ride home due to not having gas though the round-trip drive from his home to the Fair and back was less mileage than the drive to Enumclaw. Once Rheuban admitted to suffering blackouts, they asked him to submit to a polygraph exam which resulted in an inconclusive reading. One question in particular that was inconclusive was whether he could have blacked out and harmed Misty. \n\nSeveral acquaintances of Rheuban's stated that he admitted to having Misty's remains buried on his grandmother's property. When questioned by the police, Rheuban admitted to making these claims but stated they were lies made to make everyone stop questioning him about the disappearance. He submitted to a second polygraph exam, which he passed. With no further evidence, the case against Rheuban stalled and the disappearance went cold. Unrelated to this case, Rheuban was accused of rape by a female acquaintance though she dropped the charges against him shortly after making her claims. Rheuban would later have a restraining order taken out against him by his wife and have an unrelated arrest for theft. \n\nDuring searches for Misty, her underwear, jeans and one sock were found in a ditch located near Highway 410 and Weyco Rd which was no where near the last place she was seen. Half a mile away, her toothbrush and hair pick, both items she carried with her regularly, were discovered. 15 years after her disappearance, unknown male DNA would be found on her jeans (not semen or blood). \n\nA local man, Corey Bober, developed a theory that Misty's disappearance was related to two other missing teanage girls from the area, Anna Chebetnoy and Kimberly DeLange, who disappeared in 1990 and 1988 respectively. Corey's theory revolved around the length of time between disappearances as Anna disappeared 2 years and 1 month after Kimberly's disappearance and Misty disappeared 2 years and 1month after Anna. Corey soon integrated his life into Diana's life and while this was initially a welcome presence in her life, it soon began to fill her with unease and she quickly became suspicious of Corey's involvement in the case, believing him to be responsible for Misty's disappearance. This belief was also held by the Puyallup Police Department. Corey attempted to clear his name by submitting to a polygraph exam though he canceled it and never offered again. Corey is not considered a serious person of interest in the case as he has a partial alibi and is known to suffer from mental health issues and has been arrested for drug charges. \n\nIt was been 32 years since Misty Copsey's disappearance and there are no real leads or suspects in the case and Misty's remains have never been found. This case is local to me and every year outside of the Fairgrounds, an age progressed photo is displayed of Misty with a request for information. If anyone has any information, they are asked to call the Puyallup Police Department at 253-770-3343.\n\n(https://int-missing.fandom.com/wiki/Misty_Copsey)\n\n(https://www.king5.com/article/news/crime/unsolved/misty-copsey-disappearance-remained-unsolved-for-decades/281-071fadd1-538a-43d1-8282-401c3c0d4119)\n\n[Missing Kids Age Progressed Photo](https://www.missingkids.org/poster/NCMC/774514/1)",

Two potential serial killers, an ominous cult leader, and an entire life story later, her case still remains unsolved. ",
      "text": "*This write up is quite lengthy, but I promise this case is well worth the read. Grab a snack, grab a drink, and settle in.*\n\n\nIn the summer of 1983, a family was visiting the Yosemite National Park in California, eager to spend the day taking in the sights of the lush green forests and stunning mountain peaks- however, the day had something far more somber in store for them, something that would remain a mystery for over forty years. The family, which comprised of adults and a few children, pulled over on the side of a forest road next to Summit Meadow, and most the children dispersed in different directions once they exited the car, excited to get out and play. A young teenage boy in the group hung back with his father, and the two strolled over to the tree line where the forest met the meadow grass. With very little to do in ways of entertaining himself, as he was speaking with his father, the boy picked up a stick and began to idly dig into the earth with it. As the boy moved the stick back and forth in the dirt, he noticed he was uncovering something underneath, which looked off white in color. The father and son looked closer, and as the father kneeled down to inspect what it was, he noticed fingers were sticking out from underneath the dirt. He immediately told his son to head back to the car, gathered all the children, and the family made their way to the forest service rangers building to report the remains that they had found. \n\nWhen investigators arrived on scene, they discovered that the remains consisted of a severed arm and hand, which had been mostly decomposed, yet still had pieces of flesh attached to the bones. Investigators believed that animals must have scattered the rest of the remains, and that the body had most likely been lying out in Summit Meadow since sometime in 1982. They concluded that the body had been previously frozen due to the icy temperatures of the following winter, and then had thawed out during the spring, and once again began to decompose during the hot summer months. A medical examiner examined the forearm and hand, and was able to determine that the remains most likely belonged to a petite woman at least 25 years of age, who mostly likely weighed around 110 pounds. A large scale search was put on for the rest of the remains, which included helicopters, and volunteer searchers on foot, yet nothing else was discovered. \n\nTwo National Park Criminal investigators were tasked with the case of Summit Meadow Jane Doe, Don Coelho and Kimberly Tucker. They began their search for the woman’s identity by combing through missing persons reports from Yosemite National Park within the last few years, and stumbled upon a case that may have fit: fourteen year old Stacy Arras who went missing in the park in 1981. Stacy and her father ventured into Yosemite to embark on a four day trip on the High Sierra Loop, which was to be done riding mule with a group of 8 other people. The first leg of the trip was to ride the mules to Sunset High Sierra Camp, which was at an elevation of 9,400 feet above sea level. The group arrived to the camp around 3 pm on the 17th, and once they settled in, Stacy took a shower, and decided that she wanted to walk 1.5 miles to nearby Sunset Lake. Another man, who was much older at 77 years old, agreed to walk with her to the lake, however, he quickly tired and needed to take a break during the hike and sit down. Stacy continued on without him, and she was last seen by the tour guide who stated that he saw her about 50 yards south of the trail. Stacy was never seen again. \n\nWhile Stacy Arras seemed like a viable candidate to be Summit Meadow Jane Doe, she was soon ruled out, and investigators were back to square one. With very little to work with, they seemed to be at a loss. However, in 1984, word began to spread that a serial killer had just been arrested in Texas, and he had been confessing to have killed upwards of 150 people all across America, including California. That man was named Henry Lee Lucas, a name many of us are already very familiar with. \n\n*Henry Lee Lucas* \n\nHenry Lee Lucas was born on August 23, 1936 in a log cabin in Blacksburg, Virginia, to parents Nellie Viola Lucas and Anderson Lucas. Henry’s father would lose both his legs in a freight train accident, and kids in the neighborhood would taunt him and call him “No Legs.” Henry’s upbringing was tumultuous, and when he was 8 years old, his mother beat him so viciously over the head with a wooden plank, it caused him to spend three days in a coma. When Henry was 10, one of his brothers stabbed him in the eye with a knife, which quickly became infected when his mother sought him no medical care. His mother ignored Henry’s injury for days, until a teacher smacked him in the face with a steel ruler, which caused the eye to burst. After this, the eyeball was surgically removed and he was fit with a glass prosthetic eye. \n\nThe abuse in Henry’s childhood went further than physical abuse into mental and emotional torture. His mother, who was a sex worker, would force Henry to sit and watch her have sex with clients, and if he didn’t watch, she would beat him until he turned back around. In time, Henry’s mother would begin to dress Henry in women’s clothing and pimp him out to clients as well, both men and women. His mother also shot and killed Henry’s pet mule in his twenties. This cumulative abuse is what Henry said caused him to despise women as a whole, saying he wanted to kill every woman in the world and he didn’t even think of them as human. \n\nIn December of 1959, Nellie would visit Henry in Michigan for Christmas, and while she was there, she repeatedly told Henry how much she disapproved of his fiance, Stella Curtis. Nellie insisted that Henry move back to Virginia to care for her, as she was elderly, and this led to many arguments between mother and son. On January 11, 1960, the arguments had escalated to the point that Nellie picked up a broom and hit Henry over the head, and he retaliated by picking up a knife and stabbing her in the neck, killing her. Henry was arrested after he attempted to flee, and he was sentenced to 40 years in prison, but after a handful of suicide attempts, he was transferred to the Ionia State Mental Hospital. Henry was released in 1970 due to overcrowding, and he told the psychiatrist who evaluated him that he was not ready to go, and that they would regret it if they let him leave early. They released him anyway. \n\nHenry has claimed to have committed many, many murders over the years, some alone, and some with his partner, Otis O’Toole. Henry once said: \n\n> *”I killed 'em every way there is except poison. There's been strangulations, there's been knifings, there's been shootings, there's been hit-and-runs... I didn't have any [emotions]... I had no feelings for the people themselves, or any of my crimes... I'd pick them up hitchhiking, running and playing, stuff like that. We'd get to going and having a good time. First thing you know, I'd killed her and throwed her out somewhere. I don't know how to really explain why I kept on. It was just, like I say, as though I left my body. And just as though the more you look at them, as though that person wasn't dead. And you just keep stabbing them and imagining that person's not dying.”*\n\nHowever, Henry was finally caught when his murders began to get a little too close to home. Henry began to hang around with a 15 year old girl, Becky Powell, and the two made their way to California, where Henry’s employers wife had asked Becky and Henry to care for her invalid mother, Kate Rich. Kate went missing three weeks later, and soon, Becky would wind up missing as well. Police connected the dots back to Henry Lee Lucas, and arrested him, to which he quickly confessed to both murders. Henry claimed that he had stabbed Kate to death and burned her body in a gas operated oven, and that he had gotten into an argument with Becky and he had stabbed her in the chest with a knife. He stated that he then proceeded to engage in necrophilia with Becky’s body, before he dismembered her and buried her in a field next a train station. He wound up bringing the police to Becky’s remains, where they were able to locate all of her. \n\nOnce Henry was in jail, he began to confess to many, *many* more murders. Not dozens, but hundreds. It got to a point that Henry was taking “tours” all across the country, with investigators letting Henry lead the way to crime scenes he claimed to have been involved with, and this led to many crimes being closed. When detectives on the Summit Meadow case heard of this, and learned that Henry had killed in national parks across the country, they, too, were eager to speak to him. They scheduled a meeting, and Henry was brought to both Don and Kimberly and an interview was conducted. Henry, naturally, confessed to the crime, stating he had strangled a woman and left her body in Yosemite, but that was about as much as he gave them. \n\nIt got to a point where a journalist began to notice some gaps, or rather, glaringly obvious oversights, in Henry’s stories. He would claim to have committed a murder in one state, and then the very next day have committed another murder clear across the country. It became obvious to investigators across the nation, and the public, that Henry Lee Lucas was more of a hoax than anything, and his stories were now looked upon with skepticism instead of intrigue. Technically, he was a serial killer, but everyone began to think his killings were far less than he had claimed to have actually committed. \n\nHowever, Kimberly and Don still felt the need to speak to Henry one more time, just to see if they could get a little bit more clarification in the Summit Meadow Jane Doe case, but they went into this meeting with a skeptical mindset. They two investigators flew to Texas to interview Henry in the prison he was at, and when they arrived, the Texas Ranger asked them if they were armed. The pair stated that they were not armed, because in that time period no one was permitted to fly with guns, and the Texas Ranger told them that if they wanted to interview Henry Lee Lucas they needed to be armed, and handed them his own gun. \n\nDon and Kimberly entered the meeting with Henry, and it began the same as before- small details that seemed vague, very little information but enough to keep them on the hook, until Henry said something curious. He stated that when he picked up a blonde hitchhiker, he took her to a clearing where they had sex, and he told her it was time to go. This woman said she wanted to stay a bit longer, and he said *“Okay, then I’ll leave you here”* and proceeded to strangle her to death. He stated that after killing her, he looked up into the trees, and noticed some yellow wooden signs nailed into the trees above him, about 20 feet up, that hand numbers etched into them. This instantly got Don’s attention, because he knew that Summit Meadow had skier signs nailed into the trees which would help direct skiers on which were the trails to proceed on. These signs were not everywhere in the park, but they *were* in Summit Meadow. Don and Kimberly asked Henry for more details about the day spent in Yosemite with the hitchhiker, and he stated that the two sat down in the area under some trees, had about four cans of Budweiser beer, some fried chicken that had been wrapped in tinfoil, and had consensual sex. He told the detectives that if they found the spot, they would find tin foil, beer cans, a canteen, and a piece of fabric from the hitchhikers jacket. Don and Kimberly thanked Henry Lee Lucas for the interview and left back home to Yosemite, eager to try to locate the exact spot that Henry might have been that day. \n\nDon and Kimberly arrived back into California, and made their way to the spot that Summit Meadow Jane Doe’s remains were found, and began to search around, not expecting to find much. However, forty yards away from where the arm and hand were found, one of the investigators spotted something on the ground: it was four empty Budweiser cans. Knowing Budweiser was a popular beer and it wasn’t uncommon for trash to be left around the park, they considered it intriguing but not quite the score they were looking for, but it was enough for them to continue searching in hopes of finding more. On the same day of the search, they were able to locate three more items: a crumpled up piece of tin foil with fried chicken remnants inside, a canteen, and a piece of green fabric which seemed to belong to an item of clothing. Exactly as Henry Lee Lucas said. \n\nThis was enough for the two investigators to believe that Henry was most likely responsible for the death of Summit Meadow Jane Doe, however, a few days after their discovery, Kimberly Tucker was taken off the case and reassigned to manager of concessions in the park. Her superiors had mentioned this was because they hadn’t needed so many park criminal investigators, but it was a huge blow not only to Kimberly, but to Don and the case of Summit Meadow Jane Doe, as well. \n\nUnfortunately, this led to the case being put on the back burner for many years, until a skull was found nearby Summit Meadow and conclusively linked to belonging to the same person that the arm belonged to. With a skull, investigators were able to put together a composite sketch of Jane Doe, using her skull and clay to form her features. Testing revealed that Jane Doe might have been of Latin descent, and her composite bust and sketch were made with dark hair and features, however, this led to very little in terms of leads. Once again, the case went on the back burner, until more killings began within Yosemite National Park in the 90’s. \n\n**Yosemite Park Killings** \n\nOn March 18, 1999, forty two year old Carole Evon Sund, her 15 year old daughter Juliana Sund, and 16 year old Argentinian foreign exchange student Silvina Pelosso were staying at Cedar Lodge just outside Yosemite National Park, when the three women suddenly went missing. A large scale search was put on for the three missing women, and eventually, the charred bodies of Carole and Silvina were found in the trunk of their rented Pontiac car. Carole had been strangled and shot to death, and Silvina had been raped and shot. Since they were burned beyond recognition, dental records had to be used to confirm their identities. A week went by, with no sign of where Juliana had been, when a hand drawn map was sent to the local police with directions to where Juliana’s body could be found. On the top of the map, the words “We had fun with this one,” were scrawled in ink.  Investigators went to the area marked on the map where they discovered the remains of Juliana, who had been raped and her throat slit. \n\nDuring their investigation, they began to interview the staff of the Cedar Lodge where the women had been staying, for any information about who may have killed them or if anyone suspicious had been on the grounds of the property leading up to their murders. Numerous employees were interviewed, including a man named Cary Stayner, who had stayed calm during his interview and was not considered a suspect due to the fact he had no prior criminal record and was seemingly not suspicious during the interviews with police. \n\nA few months later, on July 22, 1999, 26 year old Joie Ruth Armstrong was taking a hike within Yosemite national park. Joie had passed numerous other hikers and had waved to a few before continuing on her walk, but a few minutes after she waved to a couple whom she passed, the sounds of blood curdling screams rang out in the forest. A handful of hikers rushed into the direction of the screams, where they found Joie covered in blood. Joie had been stabbed and was bleeding to death, but sadly, despite being found so soon, she succumbed to her injuries and was pronounced dead. When police began to interview witnesses nearby the trails, and also witnesses where she was staying, police learned of a blue 1972 International Scout that had been parked outside her cabin the day prior. This vehicle was learned to be owned by Cary Stayner, who quickly became the prime suspect not only in Joie’s murder, but the murders of the three women several months prior. When this information was discovered, police quickly tracked down Stayner in a nudist resort in Wilton, California, and was promptly arrested and taken into a Sacramento police station for questioning. When interviewed, Stayner quickly confessed to the murder of Joie Armstrong and the murders of Carole Sund, Juliana Sund, and Silvina Polesso. \n\nThe name Cary Stayner was not unknown to the police, nor the public, as his family had been in the news prior due to his own brother’s kidnapping, which lasted seven years before he escaped. \n\n**Steven Stayner** \n\nSteven Stayner, brother of Cary Stayner, was abducted from Merced, California on December 4, 1972, when he was approached on his walk home from school by a man named Ervin Edward Murphy. Ervin was acquaintances with a convicted child sex offender by the name of Kenneth Parnell, as the two had worked together at the Yosemite National Park. Ervin was described as simple and trusting, and Parnell has told Ervin that he was a pastor, and he needed help abducting young boys so he can raise them religious and “following the Lord.” \n\nErvin used religious tracts to stop and talk to boys, mostly telling them that their church needed donations. On December 4th, he spotted Steven and asked him if his mother would be willing to donate to the church, and Steven said yes, that she most likely would. Ervin then told Steven to hop in his car and he would drive him back home so they could speak to his mother, and a white van pulled up that had Parnell sitting at the wheel, and Steven hopped in. However, Parnell and Ervin did not take Steven home, but instead to a cabin in Cathey’s Valley, which was sadly only several hundred yards away from Steven’s own grandfathers home. \n\nSteven was repeatedly raped by Parnell, and when asked if he could go home, Parnell told him that his parents signed over legal custody to him as they could not afford so many children, so Steven belonged to him, now. Steven was given a new name, Dennis Gregory Parnell, and Parnell passed himself off as Steven’s father and the two travelled across California, frequently moving. When Steven became a teenager, he was often left unguarded by Parnell and even allowed to go out on his own, but later when asked why he hadn’t escaped during these moments, Steven sadly stated that he had no idea how to summon for help. \n\nAs Steven got older, Parnell began to look for a younger boy to kidnap, using Steven as a way to lure in younger children. Most attempts were unsuccessful, however, on February 14, 1980, Parnell kidnapped five year old Timothy White. Seeing another boy having to endure what Steven himself had gone through, Steven was determined to return Timothy to his parents. On March 1st, 1980, while Parnell was working, Steven and Timothy left Parnell’s home and hitchhiked to Timothy’s hometown, but unfortunately, young Timothy wasn’t able to direct Steven to the home of his mother and father. Instead, they went to the police station, and explained their story, and Parnell was quickly arrested and taken into custody. Steven and Timothy were both returned to their families, and Parnell was convicted of kidnapping and sentenced to seven years in prison, but only served five before he was released on parole. Steven, back at his home with his parents and siblings, had no idea that his own brother was in the making of becoming a serial killer in the same area he was abducted from. \n\nOnce Cary Stayner was arrested for the Yosemite murders, police began to theorize if he was responsible for the Summit Meadow Jane Doe, as they believed his killings started long before 1999. Cary would have been 22-23 when the killing of Summit Meadow Jane Doe happened, as he resided in nearby Merced, merely 75 miles from Yosemite, and he was known to spend a lot of time within the park during his life. However, without an identity to Jane Doe, it was nearly impossible to link him to her killing. \n\nYears continued to go by after Cary Stayner was arrested, and by 2017, the case of Summit Meadow was more or less long forgotten about, except by those who had taken the case to heart, notably Don and Kimberly who had first worked the case back in the 80’s. By now, Kimberly’s children were grown and her son, Cullen, was also working in the Yosemite National park and soon took on the role of criminal investigator in the park. Cullen and his boss were in their office one day, and his boss pulled out an old, dusty box, marked “Summit Meadow,” and had explained to him that his mother had once worked on this case, and asked him if he was interested in picking it back up and seeing if he could find any new leads. Cullen agreed, and set to work on the case of Summit Meadow Jane Doe. \n\nThe skull was sent to NCMEC, the National Center of Missing and Exploited Children, where a CT scan was done on it and a new composite sketch was made up of Summit Meadow Jane Doe. A sample was sent to Parabon labs to determine a DNA profile, which was successful in pulling a full DNA profile from the remains. Based on DNA testing and the CT scan, Cullen was shocked when the image of the composite sketch came back to him through email. The woman found in the meadow in the 80’s wasn’t of Latin descent nor did she have dark features, the sketch was of a fair haired, blue eyed woman with blonde hair. While they still had no where to turn using this information alone, it was a shock to investigators, and Cullen’s mother Kimberly, to have a face to match the remains, let one alone one that looked drastically different from what they had thought she had looked like. \n\nWhen genetic genealogy began to break through as a forerunner in helping solve cases, such as in the case of Joseph James Deangelo as the GSK, investigators on the Summit Meadow case were eager to see if they could use genetic genealogy to solve the identity of their Jane Doe. With the DNA at Parabon, they put a genealogist on the case who was able to determine a family tree for Jane Doe that went back to the 1600’s. Soon, they were able to narrow it down to one single woman who disappeared from record around 1982. Her name was Patricia Hicks Dahlstrom. \n\nCullen Tucker was able to determine that Patricia still had a living sibling, as well as a handful of nieces and nephews, and he began to call the family in hopes of speaking to them about Patricia. He called numerous times in one day with no answer, until finally, a woman picked up on the other end, and Cullen stated that he worked for the Yosemite National Park Criminal Division, and that he wanted to speak to her about Patricia Hicks. The woman on the other end of the line was shocked, and stated that that was her aunt, and she had been missing for over forty years after she had left town with a cult. He had to deliver the bad news to her that her aunt was not only deceased, but that she had been a Jane Doe for decades, and had most likely died at the hands of a serial killer. What Cullen would uncover about Patricia and her whereabouts before her murder proved to be almost as dark as her death itself. \n\n[Patricia Marie Hicks Dahlstrom](https://imgur.com/a/Mj0mruX ) was born on June 1st, 1954, in Spokane, Washington to parents Otilla Schoenwald and Edwin Gilbert Hicks. She had two older siblings, Judith and Edwin Jr, and she was especially close with her older brother. Patricia was described as happy and bubbly, and her best friend stated she was drawn to her in the eight grade because she was loud and boisterous, and because she cussed. When Patricia was 17, and a junior in high school, the United States Army had sent her family a letter regarding her older brother Edwin, who was enlisted. The letter stated that Edwin had committed suicide and had shot himself. When Patricia had learned of this, her best friend stated that she had drastically changed, and instead of being the bubbly, boisterous girl she had grown to love, she became withdrawn and in her own head much of the time. Her best friend stated that she no longer had a zest for life like she had once had. While Patricia was already into spiritual books prior to her brother’s death, it was said afterwards, she fully immersed herself in them, perhaps in an attempt to find answers she was longing for. Once Patricia graduated from high school in 1972, she said goodbye to her best friend who was taking a summer trip, and the two didn’t see each other until the following year. \n\nWhen the two friends parted, Patricia was already seeing a fellow student by the name of Ed Dahlstrom, and by the time her friend returned back to Spokane, Patricia had married him. The marriage didn’t last, however, and Patricia had filed for divorce in 1974, keeping her ex husbands last name of Dahlstrom. By the time that Patricia was 25, her spiritual journey had led her to the path of a local cult, which she had deeply immersed herself in. When Patricia’s best friend last saw her, she stated that she had gone to Patricia’s home where in the room was a single mat on the ground, and an alter in the corner, and that Patricia had shaved her head because the leader of the cult told her that she was too vain about her hair. Soon after this, Patricia moved to Merced, California with the cult, and family was not able to contact her again. In 1982, Patricia’s mother had died, and even then Patricia’s sister wasn’t able to find her in order to let her know. \n\nThe leader of the cult was Donald Gibson, who had quite a tumultuous upbringing. While three of Donald’s siblings turned to heroin to cope for their upbringing, Donald had turned to eastern religion. Donald’s niece stated that Donald had a very charismatic, magnetic personality, and that he had a talent for zeroing in on what someone might need, or was lacking, in their lives. This led Donald to gaining the trust of those around him, which he used to form the cult he ran. While many people who had been a part of the cult in the 1980’s refused to speak to investigators, still out of fear of Donald, a prior roommate offered to speak to them, and stated in a text to Cullen Tucker: \n\n> *”I was emotionally ragged and raw. It has taken me many years to heal and gain insight into those years. I had to throw out most of what I believed and accepted to be true about myself, God, and my personal salvation. Finding some peace of heart and peace of mind has been a long, hard struggle. Donald brought Patty to Merced from Spokane, and I believe I met her in 1978. Donald asked me if I would take her in. I loved her from the first time I met her. I was raising two boys alone and working, had no social life, and it was nice having another woman in the house. I feel Patty was my saving grace. Patty was a young woman, looking for a purpose in her life. I never understood how Donald could attract intelligent, beautiful women to follow him. I never could figure that one out. But Donald attracted young males with sex and drugs. I remember a lot of attractive young men, all with a glazed expression.”*\n\nThe cult took a very dark turn once it was fully formed, with Donald taking the members paychecks, forcing them into arranged marriages, and requiring sexual rituals in front of the entire group. Donald would routinely go to parks in order to try to recruit new members, and a victim of Donald’s stated that he had met him in a park and felt that he was under some kind of trance after Donald had offered him some LSD. He stated that he quickly lost consciousness, and when he finally woke, that Donald was performing an oral sex act on him against his will. Donald explained to the underaged teenager that he “needed his seed for religious purposes.” According to police, this had happened numerous times over to different victims, and when this victim came forward, they had put out an arrest warrant for Donald Gibson. \n\nDonald was arrested for supplying drugs to minors, as well as for sodomy and oral copulation of minors, and he was sent to trial. A lead detective on the case against Donald stated to a documentary program, Wild Crime: \n\n> *”Until Donald was arrested and charged, I had no idea of the sexual abuse that was occurring on those young cult members. I was stunned when the charges were first read. I think my jaw dropped. I was surprised about a lot of things that I wasn't aware of. It was a shock, I know, to all of us. At the start of the trial, I personally came to believe that Donald Gibson had some power. I can understand why a young man would sense power in Gibson as I felt it. During the trial, we really got to look at how this cult operated and the amount of power that Mr. Gibson had over his followers. Some people described him as a predator. Other people described him as manipulative, that he's a person that could take advantage of people, and other people didn't really see him as a threat. Most of the people in the cult remained obedient to Gibson. But points during the trial, he was very angry that their testimony was not stronger than it was. I think that Gibson was capable of killing someone that he felt had failed him, including Patty Dahlstrom. Donald Gibson was found guilty on two counts of oral copulation with minors and two counts of sodomy with minors. A total of four counts. After the jury found Gibson guilty, I requested that the court take him into custody, and that's what should have happened. But he was out of custody. I don't think Gibson was stupid. He was aware that he was soon going to go into custody. He figured it was time to vamoose.”*\n\nStrangely, when Patricia testified in defense of Donald Gibson, another name familiar to this case was in the courtroom as a spectator- Cary Stayner. The Stayner family and the Gibson family were long time, close friends, and Cary was a good friend of Donald. Cary was there when Patricia gave her testimony, however, it is still uncertain if Cary had anything to do with her death. A detective on the case said this about Cary being in the courtroom: \n\n> *”The one thing that really surprised me was during Donald Gibson's trial, nobody knew until years later that Cary Stayner was one of the spectators in that trial. This was 1981. 17 years later, the 1999, Cary Stayner killed four people in and around Yosemite National Park. The Stayner family and the Gibson family were friends. The Stayner family would watch the kids, the Gibson family, and vice versa. And even sometimes the Stayner grandparents would also watch the kids. If Cary Stayner were in the courtroom when Patty was testifying, there could have been an innocent reason for it. He knew the Gibson family, and he wanted to show support. But here's what's important. That would have been the opportunity for him to come into contact with Patty, who ultimately goes on to become a homicide victim. And you know that Cary Stayner went on to become a serial killer. That becomes an important piece of information that you have to resolve somehow. Knowing that Cary Stayner was at Donald's trial makes me wonder, was there more of a connection there than we knew about?”*\n\nDonald Gibson never showed up for his sentencing date, and he has evaded police until this day. Once Donald was gone for about a month, Patricia decided that there was nothing left for her in California, and she boarded a bus to leave, and never told her roommate where her final destination was to be. All we know is that Patricia Hicks Dahlstrom somehow ended up in Summit Meadow of Yosemite National Park, where she would eventually wind up dead and her identity unknown for forty years. We know she crossed paths with a serial killer, Cary Stayner, an insane cult leader, Donald Gibson, and perhaps the most intriguing of them all, Henry Lee Lucas. Lucas is known for mostly being a fraud, despite having a few confirmed deaths to his name, but authorities who have worked this case firmly believe that he must be the killer of Patricia Hicks Dahlstrom, based on the fact that the four items he said would be in the vicinity of her body were in fact there. Patricia’s case has never been solved, but the only silver lining of her case is that she was finally able to get her name back and her story told. \n\n\n**© TaraCalicosBike 2025**\n\nLinks: \n\n[Find A Grave](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/245044151/patricia_marie-dahlstrom)\n\n[Unidentified Awareness](https://unidentified-awareness.fandom.com/wiki/Patty_Hicks)",

      "text": "The Grimes Sisters - 1956 Murder  \n\nThe year is 1956. The scene is Brighton Park, a working class neighborhood on the south side of Chicago, where Patricia and Barbara Grimes lived with their mother and four other siblings. Patricia was to turn 13 in three days, and Barbara was 15. Their mother, Lorretta, and father, Joseph, had divorced in 1951, but the children were on good terms with their father. The family was not well off, and Lorretta worked outside the home besides having charge of a large family.\n \nPatricia and Barbara were avid fans of Elvis Presley, having seen his first movie \"Love Me Tender\" ten times. On the night of Dec. 28, they asked permission to see it again at the local Brighton Theater. They left home at 7:30 p.m. with $2.50 to cover tickets, concessions, and possibly staying for a second showing. They may have walked but could have taken a bus to the theater, 1 1/2 miles away. Once there, they were seen by a friend, Dorothy Weinert, who was sitting behind them with her own sister. As Dorothy left after the first showing, she saw Barbara and Patricia in the concession line, indicating that they did decide to stay to see the movie again. Dorothy said they were on their own and seemed fine.  \n\nLorretta expected the girls home by 11:45 p.m. if they stayed for the second showing. When they didn't arrive home, she got worried. She sent an older sister and a brother to the bus stop to wait for them. After the girls were not on the next three buses, brother and sister returned home. Loretta had started calling around their friends to see if anyone had any idea about their whereabouts, or what they had done after the movie. With no one knowing anything, she called the police at 2:00 a.m. to report the girls missing.   \n\nPolice then mounted one of the largest missing persons searches in Cook County history to that date. A task force was created, and hundreds officers were deputized to search for the missing girls full time. 300,000 people were questioned, 2,000 subjected to further questioning.  The FBI became involved when Loretta Grimes received ransom notes. One note sent her to Milwaukee on Jan. 12 in company with FBI agents, to wait in a church with $1,000 ransom money. Another note told Loretta to leave a case of money at LaSalle Street Station. Both were hoaxes.  \n\nSightings began to come in - the girls were seen on the north side asking for directions, getting off a CTA bus at 11:05 p.m. the night of the 28th, in a Kresge's five and dime store listening to records. Two teenage boys said they saw the girls around 11:30 p.m. on Dec. 28, a few blocks from home, jumping in and out of doorways and laughing.  Another teenage boy said he was walking behind the girls and saw them getting into a dark-colored Mercury with two men, one in the front seat and one in the back.    \n\nThe story went national, and with it a theory that the girls had voluntarily gone to Nashville. One woman said she had met them at a bus station there and had taken them to an employment agency to get jobs. The clerk at the agency identified them from photographs. Loretta Grimes didn't believe her daughters would have left with nothing but $2.50 and the clothes on their backs. She begged whoever had the girls to let them call her. Eventually Elvis himself went on radio and television telling the girls if they were \"good Elvis fans,\" they would return home and ease their mother's worries. Syndicated advice columnist Ann Landers printed a letter she'd received from a girl who claimed to have seen the sisters on the night they went missing:  \n\n> \"Outside the show we all got to talking and we exchanged phone numbers. When we got to the street where we turned off, we said goodbye and we ran across the street. Then Betty forgot something she had to tell Barbara and we ran back to the corner ... A man about 22 or 25 was talking to them. He pushed Barbara in the back seat of the car and Pat in the front seat. We got part of the license number as the car drove by us. The first four numbers were 2184. Betty thinks there were three or four numbers after that ... When we heard that they were missing we didn't know what to do.\"\n>  - Section of an anonymous letter sent to Chicago Sun-Times advice columnist Ann Landers, January 1957.  [From Wikipedia, *Murder of the Grimes Sisters*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder_of_the_Grimes_sisters)  \n\nPolice were unable to trace the car from this information. The letter writer was anonymous and was never identified. \n  \nA classmate of Patricia's had two phone calls to her home during the night of Jan. 14. The caller asked for Sandra, but then hung up. Sandra's mother thought the caller sounded frightened, and thought it was Patricia.  \n\nAn anonymous caller told police that the girls were dead and would be found in a park in Lyons Township, an unincorporated area considerably west of Brighton Park. He said this knowledge had come to him in a dream. The call was traced, and the caller identified as Walter Kranz. He was questioned and released.  \n\nThe second week of January, there was a heavy snow followed by cold, and alter a thaw. On January 22, Leonard Prescott was driving on German Church Road in unincorporated Willow Springs when he saw something flesh-colored off the side of the road. He thought it looked like a mannequin. He brought his wife back for a closer look, and they were horrified to find the naked bodies of two girls sprawled in the snow. One was face down, the other face up and partially covering the other's body. Prescott called the police. Joseph Grimes identified the bodies as his daughters, but broke down, and a family member made a formal identification of Barbara and Patricia Barbara had extensive bruising on her face, while Patricia had puncture marks on her chest such as would have been made with an ice pick.  Incidentally, the location where the girls were found was about a mile from the park mentioned by Walter Kranz. It was far from the girls' neighborhood, almost to the western boundary of Cook County.  \n\nThere was no obvious cause of death such as stabbing, strangulation, or gunshot. Barbara had had sexual intercourse before her death, but no sign of forcible molestation. It was surmised that the bodies had lain there for some days but had been covered by snow and preserved by cold weather. The wounds were ascribed to animal predation. The cause of death was ultimately listed as murder, secondary shock due to cold temperatures.  Date of death was Dec. 28 or 29.  \n\nWith the bodies found, the police case turned to looking for suspects. The number one suspect was 53-year-old Walter Kranz, who had called police with his dream vision about where the bodies would be found. He was also suspected of having written one of the ransom notes. Kranz maintained that his only knowledge of the crime came from being a psychic. He was questioned several times, but without evidence linking him to the crime, they had to release him.  \n \nA second suspect was Edward \"Bennie\" Bedwell, a twenty-something drifter who worked part time as a dishwasher in a restaurant and who affected a look like Elvis. His employer reported to police that Bennie came into the restaurant early on the morning of Dec. 30 with another man and two girls. The girls resembled the Grimes sisters. One girl was staggering. They sat listening to the jukebox and left in a car. One of the girls told a waitress that they were sisters. A patron at the restaurant corroborated the story.  \n\nBennie was arrested and questioned for three days. He finally confessed to the murders and was charged on Jan. 27. He said the girls had been with him and his accomplice for a week. Bennie and his friend \"Frank\" had taken the girls to bars and fed them hot dogs, but when their sexual advances were refused, they beat the girls, knocked them out, and took them out to German Church Road where they dumped the bodies beyond the guard rail. This was alleged to have happened on Jan. 13.  In a hearing on Jan. 31, Bennie recanted, saying he had made the confession due to police coercion and good cop/bad cop tactics.  In addition, his story was contradicted by forensic evidence based on the stomach contents which did not include alcohol or hot dogs, matched the girls' last meal at home, and indicated death within five hours of leaving home on Dec. 28. To cap it all, records showed that Bennie was actually clocked in at work on Jan. 13 at the purported time of the murder.  Because the case against him was falling apart, he was released on bond on Feb. 6.  Lorretta had been outraged by his claims about her daughters carousing in saloons, and categorically refused to believe it. All charges against Bennie were dropped in March.  \n\nThe third suspect was 17-year-old Max Fleig. He had been in a juvenile facility and had a record of violence. In a different case, he self-admittedly beat women who resisted his attempts at rape. For the Grimes case, he was persuaded to take an unofficial polygraph even though Illinois law said it was illegal to give them to minors. During the polygraph, he allegedly confessed to the murders. But there was no evidence tying him to the case, and he had to be released. The following year, he confessed to the beating death of 14-year-old Mary Lou Wagner.  (Source: Chicago Tribune, Dec. 6, 1957)  \n\nMeanwhile, citizen reports of having seen Barbara and Patricia continued to come in. The Chicago newspapers were making the most of the crime:  \n\n> \" Once the bodies were found, the Grimes case dominated Chicago's front pages for days on end. The Tribune invited readers to send in their personal theories of the crime, offering $50 for any they chose to publish. The Sun-Times accompanied Loretta Grimes on a shopping trip, then ran a photo of models wearing the sort of clothing the sisters had on when they disappeared. 'Discovery of any of these items of clothing could provide an important lead for police,'  the paper advised its readers.  Headlines changed with each edition. 'Police Grill Bennie / As He Alters Story,'  the banner in the city edition of the Sun-Times on January 27, gave way to 'Bennie's s New Statement / Grimes Girls Ditched Me' in the three-star final. The next day's Sun-Times was virtually a one-topic paper. The banner story, 'Bennie Charged / As Girls'Slayer,' filled two pages. The text of Bedwell's confession plus various sidebars filled three more. There were three full pages of pictures. Kup's Column decreed that 'the police work on the grim Grimes case deserves the wholehearted applause of the entire community.'  And yet another page offered profiles of the two mothers. \" - \"Death and the Maidens,\" Tamara Shaffer, *Chicago Reader,* 3/20/1997   \n\nControversy erupted among the investigators. Harry Glos, a chief investigator in the coroner's office, disagreed on the time of death. He said there was a thin film of ice on the bodies, which could only have been formed if they were warm when dumped along German Church Road, putting the death around Jan. 7. He also publicly stated his belief that both girls had been beaten and repeatedly molested, with that detail having been left out of reports out of respect for the girls and their mother. He questioned why injuries on the bodies had not been adequately investigated. When Glos refused to retract his statements, he was fired from the coroner's office. However, the sheriff in charge of the case agreed with him and hired him to work without pay for their team. Accusations of political motivations and grandstanding flew from both sides.  \n\nThe funeral for the sisters was held on January 28, and they were laid to rest at Holy Sepulchre Cemetery in Alsip, Illinois. Lorretta had been unable to work while the investigation was going on, but neighbors, the church, schools, and other local organizations raised funds that allowed the mortgage on the Grimes house to be paid off, as well as paying for the burial. \n\nIn May, Lorretta received a disturbing phone call. A man's voice taunted her that he was the killer, and derided the police for trying to pin it on Bennie Bedwell. What made the call stand out for Lorretta was that the caller said he knew something no one else would know, that \" 'The smallest girl's toes were crossed at the feet!' This caller then laughed before terminating the call.\" - [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder_of_the_Grimes_sisters)  \n\nIt is time to bring up two other crimes from the 1950s that have sometimes been suggested to be connected with this case. In October 1955, three young boys, John Schuessler, 13, his brother, Anton, 11, and Robert Peterson, 13, went missing after leaving a movie theater in downtown Chicago. Their bodies were found in a forest preserve north of the city. They had been beaten, strangled, and their naked bodies tossed in a ditch. The similarities with the Grimes sisters' murders caused some to think the perpetrator might be the same. The Schuessler-Peterson murders were finally solved in 1995, with stable hand Kenneth Hansen being tried and convicted twice. He died in prison in 2007. Although the crimes occurred relatively close in time and have similarities, the M.O. is different - Hansen murdered the boys violently, whereas the coroner had difficulty even assigning a cause of death for the Grimes sisters. I do not know how seriously law enforcement explored a link between the two crimes, but since the Schuessler-Peterson murders were still unsolved, it would not have taken them very much further.  \n\n15-year-old high school sophomore Bonnie Leigh Scott went missing on Sept. 22, 1958 from her home in Addison, Illinois, a suburb of Chicago. On Nov. 15, Boy Scouts discovered her body near a guard rail in a forest preserve in Palos Township. This was less than ten miles from where Barbara and Patricia had been found. Bonnie was nude and had been decapitated. Charles LeRoy Melquist, a sometime boyfriend and current friend of Bonnie's, who had previously offered witness testimony in her disappearance, was questioned and eventually confessed to the killing.  \n\nThe day after the body was found, and before she had even been identified, Lorretta Grimes got another phone call. This time the caller said he got away with another one. Lorretta said the voice, a distinctive one, was the same person who had called her in May 1956 to taunt her. This crime, and the phone call, seems more like the Grimes murder than the triple murder of the three boys. However, sources say Melquist was \"not allowed\" by his attorney to be questioned in connection with the Grimes case. Bonnie's murder could also be a copycat of the Grimes murders. Melquist smothered Bonnie in his car, and decapitated her when visiting the scene about a month later. The connection of the two cases was largely made by a retired policeman, Ray Johnson, who took up the Grimes case in 2010. He wrote a blog post about Bonnie on the 59th anniversary of her death; you can read it [here](https://web.archive.org/web/20190111165045/http://www.chicagonow.com/chicago-history-cop/2017/09/59th-anniversary-of-the-murder-of-bonnie-leigh-scott-of-addison-could-lead-to-closure-in-the-1956-grimes-sisters-murder/).  \n\nIt would seem logical and maybe even comforting to think that Melquist was the perpetrator in both crimes. It would be far preferable to think that there was only one such person roaming the area in the mid-50s. But Melquist didn't live anywhere near the Grimes girls. There are other differences. He had a prior relationship with his victim. He confessed in detail during a polygraph. If you believe in Lorretta Grimes's mystery caller, that doesn't accord with the boasts of getting away with it. This is an interesting theory, but I am not convinced. (Melquist served only 11 years of his 99 year sentence, and later married and had children.)  \n\nThe Grimes parents died without ever getting justice for their girls, Joseph on June 19, 1965 and Lorretta on Dec.8, 1989, aged 83. All are buried in Holy Sepulchre Cemetery.  \n\nThe murder of Barbara and Patricia Grimes remains unsolved, and is still an open case with law enforcement. It is hard to imagine what evidence might come through to solve it at this date. But this is an age when miracles happen even with very cold cases. Maybe it will happen here.   \n\nSources  \n\n[*Murder of the Grimes Sisters*, Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder_of_the_Grimes_sisters)  \n[*Death and the Maidens*](https://chicagoreader.com/news/death-and-the-maidens/), Tamara Shaffer, Chicago Reader, March 20, 1997  \n[*Grimes Sisters: The Unsolved Murders of Chicago's 1950s Teens*](https://truecrimetime.com/grimes-sisters/), True Crime Time, Aug. 27, 2023  \n[*The Grimes Sisters: An Unsolved Cold Case*](https://thehauntedlibrarian.com/2022/04/06/the-grimes-sisters-an-unsolved-cold-case/), The Haunted Librarian blog, April 6, 2022  \n[*The Grimes Sisters,*](https://theorem-factory.com/2017/05/31/the-grimes-sisters/) Theorem Factory, May 31, 2017  \n[Find a Grave: Barbara Jeanne Grimes](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/5501564/barbara_jeanne_grimes)  \n[Find a Grave: Patricia Kathleen Grimes](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/5501557/patricia_kathleen_grimes)",

      "title": "The 1979 murder of Kerryn Tate in Western Australia has been solved using genetic genealogy. Suspect is now theorised to be a previously undetected serial killer.",
      "text": "22 year old Kerryn Tate was last seen at 11am on 29 December 1979 in the inner Perth suburb of Mt Lawley after being dropped off by a friend. Her body was discovered the following morning when authorities responded to a bush fire approximately 40km away in Karragullen. Due to the arrangement of the scene, some theorised that the murder had occult undertones - this no longer appears to be the case.        \n        \nTate was housesitting in Karragullen at the time of the murder and possibly accepted a ride from her killer back to the area before being attacked. She had been bashed over the head with a piece of wood before her body was set alight. A ring of burnt tree stumps surrounding the body gave rise to the above theory of withcraft as a motivation, however it would appear now that this was only done to destroy evidence.                  \n            \nThanks to the diligent collection of evidence at the scene in 1979, WA Police were able to identify a male DNA profile. Using commercial databases they developed a family tree of over 10,000 distant relatives before zeroing in on one man, Terrence Fisher. Fisher was ex-military and appears to have lived an otherwise normal life working as a tradesman until he died of cancer in 2000 aged 50.     \n       \nPolice now theorise that Fisher was a previously undetected serial killer who may have also been involved in the 1986 murder of Barbara Western and the 1991 murder of Kerry Turner. Turner's body was discovered approximately 7km from Tate's, while Western was discovered only a few hundred metres from the Tate crime scene. All three women disappeared in similar circumstances, seemingly being abducted from inner Perth suburbs after a night out with friends. All 3 appear to have possibly hitchhiked or accepted rides from strangers. Turner was previously hypothesised to have been an early victim of Claremont Serial Killer Bradley Edwards.      \n        \nWA Police and Kerryn Tate's family are now appealing for any member of the public with knowledge of Fisher to come forward and assist them in their inquiries. Tate was born in Victoria before moving to New South Wales at age 1. She had given birth to twins a few years prior and moved to Western Australia following the tragic death of one of the twins. Thankfully her surviving family now have answers if not justice.      \n            \nhttps://www.crimestopperswa.com.au/open-cases/homicide-kerryn-mary-tate-karragullen/  \n           \nhttps://www.news.com.au/national/crime/stunning-breakthrough-in-unsolved-murder-of-woman-after-nearly-five-decades/news-story/3b5a49871d6ba95803e419333c630392?amp",

      "title": "In November of 1985, 67 year old Dexter Stefonek left his son’s Oregon farm planning to drive 2,000 miles to his Wisconsin home. The next day, his car was set ablaze at a rest stop in Montana, his body discovered in a landfill, and a strange message written in a bathroom stall. Who killed Dexter? ",
      "text": "In 1984, sixty seven year old [Dexter Stefonek’s](https://imgur.com/a/kClpJaC ) life was overturned when his wife, Vivian, of forty-four years, passed away. Six years prior, Dexter retired early from his job at a local Rhinelander, Wisconsin paper mill in order to care for his wife and tend to her in her final years. A few months after the death of Dexter’s wife, he felt the need to be close to his remaining family, and travelled to Oregon to visit his son and his grandchildren at their family farm. The comfort of having family around was peaceful for Dexter, but after a few months, and nearing the anniversary of his wife’s death, he felt the need to return home to his own house in Wisconsin. \n\nDexter made up his mind to leave his son David’s home, but David was concerned about his father and hesitant to let him go. David had expected Dexter to spend the winter with him, but when November rolled around and Dexter was ready to leave, David pleaded with him to stay. He felt that Dexter shouldn’t be alone in Wisconsin when he could be in Oregon with him and his family. Dexter told him that his mind was made up, and David reminded him that if any point during the drive he changed his mind, he was more than welcome to turn around and come back home to David and his family.\n\nOn the morning of November 18, 1985, Dexter packed his bags in his brown Plymouth Horizon and prepared himself for the 2,000 mile trip from Oregon to Wisconsin. Dexter was so eager to return home that told David that instead of stopping at motels to sleep or rest, he would instead pull into rest stops to sleep before hitting the road again. Hearing this increased David’s concern, but recognizing that his father was an adult who was able to make his own choice, he hugged his father goodbye and reminded him he was always welcome back should he change his mind. \n\nAt 10:20 am November 19th, the day after Dexter left Oregon, a burning car was discovered on long, deserted stretch of Interstate 94 in Montana. The car was found at the Bad Route rest stop near Glendive. Sheriff Jim George was one of the first on scene, and upon seeing the inside of the car completely engulfed in flames, he spoke to other members of the State Highway Department who claimed that they had not seen anyone occupying the vehicle. When they checked the car’s registration, they discovered that it was registered to Dexter Stefonek. An arson expert was brought to the scene, who stated that he believed the car has been deliberately set on fire using gasoline, and that the back seat of the Horizon was completely drenched in the liquid. Investigators also noted that the back seat was pushed all the way back, mostly likely for a driver who was very tall, but Dexter was a shorter man and they believed if he drove the car that it would be pushed all the way up towards the steering wheel. They determined that the driver had to have been at least over 6 feet tall. \n\nAuthorities were worried that Dexter might have walked away from the car  looking for help, and was overcome by the severe temperatures. Without much to work with, they began to try and piece together the timeline of events of that morning before the car was discovered. A custodian for the rest stop named Fred Siegle was spoken to, and he claimed that he arrived at the Bad Route rest stop between 8 and 8:30 am, where he had seen an empty pick up truck in the parking lot. Next, a highway maintenance supervisor named Clyde Mitchell arrived at the rest stop at about 8:45 am, where he noticed two pick up trucks parked in the parking lot: Fred’s, and another white Chevy pickup truck that had been facing southeast. Curious, Clyde walked to the rest stop utility room to speak to Fred, and asked him how long the white pickup truck had been parked there and if he had seen anybody who it may have belonged to. Fred told him that he did not know how long it had been parked in the parking lot, and that he hadn’t seen anyone around it. Piqued with interest, Clyde decided to take a closer look at the Chevy, and noticed that it had Arizona plates with a Phoenix license plate holder, blue trim along its white exterior, and a cow catcher attached to the front. There was clothing inside the back of the truck which indicated someone may have been living in the vehicle. Despite checking out the car, he didn’t think anything was suspicious about it, and he left to make his rounds at the other rest stops around 9:15 am. \n\nThirty minutes later Fred was exiting the parking lot of the Bad Route rest stop, and he noticed Dexter’s brown Horizon pulling in. He witnessed a man get out of the car carrying two large containers, and stopped to ask the man if he needed any assistance or was having any car trouble. The man replied that he had run out of gas and went to get some, and needed to fill his tank. When asked the description of the man, Fred stated that he was about 6 feet tall, between the ages of 35 and 40 years old, had a light complexion and was clean shaven. He stated that the man was acting normal, and at the time he didn’t feel that there was anything suspicious going on. When Fred returned a half hour later, Dexter’s car was engulfed in flames. \n\nFour months passed, when on March 8, 1986, a local couple named Cindy and Bill Shaw made a trip to a local landfill to dump trash. The landfill was 17 miles away from the Bad Route rest stop. While walking around the landfill dumping their own trash, Cindy stumbled upon a man’s wallet lying on the ground. When they looked inside and found an ID, they wondered if it was connected to the burning car discovered at the rest stop four months earlier. They decided to search around the landfill to see if anything else seemed out of place since their last visit there, and they noticed a handful of items that hadn’t been there before- a shaving kit, a suitcase, and an assortment of men’s clothing. Bill also stumbled upon a man’s boot lying in a pile of garbage, and when he went to pick it up, he was horrified to discover a man’s foot lying underneath a mattress, partially covered. Knowing not to touch anything further, the couple called the police to report the body. Authorities arrived along with the coroner, and the body was taken to the medical examiner’s office, where it was positively identified as Dexter Stefonek through dental records. During the autopsy it was discovered that Dexter had suffered a very violent death- there were marks on his hands, throat, and a bruise on the front of his skull. This bruise was determined to be due to Dexter being pistol whipped before being shot twice in the back of the head with a large caliber gun. \n\nAuthorities were able to rule out robbery as a motive as they found money inside of Dexter’s suitcase. Strangely, despite determining that Dexter’s body had been in the landfill for months, Dexter’s clothing and suitcase had only been there for a few days, as Cindy and Bill told authorities that they had been to the landfill a few days prior to the discovery, and that none of those items had been there at the time. \n\nAnother clue in the case was discovered one week after Dexter’s body was found in the landfill. In the men’s room at the Bad Route rest stop, written in pencil, the words “Hot Jock, Wisconsin, Shot wad*, 11 85” were graffitied inside of a stall. Police believe that the words “Hot Jock” could have been a CB radio handle, and believed that a trucker might have been involved in the killing. Authorities believed wholeheartedly that the words had been written by Dexter’s killer, and that they were strategically placed there after the body was found to taunt the police and to brag about the murder. \n\nPolice began to to piece together a timeline of Dexter’s final day on November 19th, and along with it, a theory. They believe that Dexter has pulled into the Bad Route rest stop at around 7 am on the day of his death, and that the killer had already been there before Dexter arrived. They believe that the killer may have had asked Dexter for a ride, perhaps under the guise of needing gas, but since Dexter was hard of hearing, Dexter did not respond. They determined that this act of perceived rudeness might have set the killer off, and he may have pulled a gun on Dexter and forced him into the backseat of his own car. They feel that the killer had abducted Dexter and killed him shortly after, before hiding his body in the landfill. Then, the killer returned to the rest stop, set the car on fire to destroy evidence and keep officers occupied while he escaped. \n\nPolice were at a loss when it came to a suspect of Dexter’s killer, but they did have some theories about the man. They believe that he had killed before, and most likely would again, perhaps “hunting” at rest stops along long stretches of highways. They also believe that the killer was familiar with the area, because the landfill was remote, located off a a little used dirt road 4 miles from Glendive. They know for a fact that he was between the ages of 35-40, was clean shaven, with a light complexion, and had been wearing a parka on the day of the murder. He may have been using the CB handle “Hot Jock.” \n\nWhen put under hypnosis, Clyde Mitchell was able to tell authorities that the first three numbers of the license plate on the white Chevy was “1 4 7,” which helped police narrow down the list of vehicles to only 60, however they were unable to determine if any of these vehicle owners had anything to do with the death of Dexter. The case was reopened in 2012, and stalled for another 12 years. In January of 2024, authorities announced that they finally had a potential suspect in the murder: a 79 year old man by the name of Charles Gary Sullivan, who was serving a 15 year prison sentence for the 1979 murder of Julia Woodward. Julia had been murdered in Reno, Nevada, and Charles was arrested for her murder in 2019 when DNA linked him to the crime scene. Charles DNA was already on file when he was required to register as a sex offender in 2007. \n\nPolice were attempting to link him to the murder of Dexter based on a handful of reasons: witness statements, his vehicle in 1985, age, physical description, license plate having been of Arizona origin, and travel patterns. When police attempted to speak to Charles about the death of Dexter, he fell back on his 5th amendment rights and refused to speak to them. With nothing else to go on, and having little evidence to link him to the crime, police were unable to file charges against him, but they still believe that he was potentially responsible for the death of Dexter Stefonek. Cell mates of Charles have stated that he told them exactly what had happened to Dexter that cold autumn day in 1985. \n\nDespite having a suspect, Dexter’s murder is still unsolved. Tragically, David has lost two parents in the span of one year, and recalls that he had a bad feeling about his father leaving his Oregon farm that day in 1985. \n\n*The source I used left this word out in their article, and after reading the comments I realized this additional word was in the graffitied message, and it alters the meaning of the message.

      "title": "Why It's Possible Cynthia Anderson's Disappearance Was Staged",
      "text": "The disappearance of Cynthia Anderson is one of Toledo, Ohio's longest-running mysteries. Here are the details:\n\nCynthia Anderson was born in 1962. She was raised in a very conservative, Christian fundamentalist family with her sister, and had an equally very Christian boyfriend and social circle.\n\nHer father described her as a \"quiet, obedient type of girl\" who never made waves. But he also disapproved of her behavior in the months prior to her disappearance, as he said: *“Just before she disappeared however, she was becoming like a debutante. She was spending a lot of time on her face and herself and she’d skip breakfast for this reason. And that may be part of the problem.”*\n\nIn 1980, at 18, Cynthia Anderson had a series of dreams she recounted to her family about someone abducting and murdering her. The following year, she was working at a law firm. In the summer, she received phone calls that were apparently threatening, though the only one that someone directly witnessed, according to accounts, was the day before she disappeared. The man who witnessed it - a client of the law firm - didn't hear anything on the other end, just said Cynthia looked scared and hung up.\n\nAt the same time, graffiti saying \"I Love You, Cindy\" appeared in the office park where she worked. However, the man who wrote this came forward and said it was intended for a different Cindy who he was in a relationship with, and that woman confirmed it. So though many accounts have made much of it, it's unrelated to the case.\n\nHowever, her bosses were worried enough after Cindy's reports of harassment to implement a policy that she should always lock doors after leaving, and install a buzzer she could use to alert businesses nearby if there was an emergency.\n\nOn August 4, 1981, she got up and went to work. She was due to quit in two weeks to attend Bible college with her boyfriend. It was usual for her to be alone in the office in the mornings while the lawyers were out at meetings.\n\nThe office janitor saw Cindy at her desk around 9:30, and then some patrons passing by noticed Cindy through the window at about 9:45 am. At 10 am, someone called, and no one answered the office phone.\n\nWhen two lawyers in the office returned at noon, they found the door and the lights on, the door locked, and Cindy nowhere to be found. Cindy would usually place the phones on hold and leave a note if she was going to step out, and that hadn't been done either. Her purse and car keys were gone, though her car was parked outside.\n\nWhile they were looking for clues as to what happened, they noticed the book Cindy was reading was open on her desk to a scene of a violent kidnapping, the only violent scene in the book.\n\nA month later, law enforcement got a call from a mystery woman speaking in low whispers. *\"She kept saying she had to go. I kept begging her to stay on the line, give me more information, give me an exact address, something that we could act on. A short while later, she again called. The lady mentioned that there were two houses side by side owned by the same family, and that the family was out of town. But their son was home and he was the party that was holding Cindy in the basement. We did check street after street on the north end to see if we could find two houses side by side. There’s many, but you can’t find any positive location to the house.”*\n\nCindy has not been heard from again. Her social security number has not been used and a substantial amount of money in her bank account has not been touched.\n\n**Reasons People Think She Was Abducted/Killed - And Why I Think It was Staged:**\n\n**The dreams, threatening phone calls, and graffiti:**\n\nThe graffiti is brought up often, but has been definitively proven to have nothing to do with Cindy, so it's unrelated. I can't find evidence of the threatening phone calls being heard or witnessed by anyone other than Cindy, except for the one phone call witnessed by a legal client the day before she went missing, in which he didn't hear anything the caller was saying, just said Cindy looked scared and quickly hung up. Cynthia also refused to give any details about the phone calls - who it was, what gender, what they were saying, what they wanted, etc. Also, Cynthia was a pretty receptionist working in a visible place. People could also definitely be crank-calling her and saying obscene stuff, as that's not exactly uncommon, without intending to murder her.\n\nThe dreams seem to have taken place a full year before her disappearance, and way before any threatening phone calls were supposedly made. Some people say she subconsciously had already perceived a threat; I think it's far more likely that around the time she turned 18 and realized her family, boyfriend, and surroundings had planned out her whole ultra conservative Christian life for her even in adulthood, she might have either started setting the stage to run away or her brain literally dreamed about her being abducted to get away from her family. I know people who have left fundamentalist families; running away, even though usually in less dramatic ways than this, is often the only option as a teenager.\n\n**Her sister and family said she had no reason to leave, and nothing was going on that would make her run away.**\n\nHer dad prized her quietness and obedience and disapproved even of her wearing makeup and dieting, and her boyfriend, sister, and social circle, were all Christian fundamentalists. If Cynthia wanted to leave or leave the religion, it's unlikely she could openly talk about it to anyone in her surroundings. Her behavior changing and gravitating towards spending more time on herself and her appearance points to a break in the values she was raised with and an increasing disregard for the approval of her family.\n\nRe: nothing in particular was going on that would make her run away: on the contrary, Cindy was about to quit her job in two weeks, the only thing that gave her a modicum of independence and a life away from church and family, to start Bible college with her equally fundamentalist boyfriend. So it seems she left right before a *major change in her life*, just before she was about to be locked into a life she possibly didn't want. The end of her job and limited freedom away from her fundamentalist circle fast approaching, may have forced her hand.\n\n**The fact that her Social Security number hasn't been used and she didn't take money out of her account**\n\nThough it would be hard to keep going in life without using your Social Security number, people disappear for years and surface decades later all the time without their Social Security number ever having been pinged in the meantime. Lots of people live and work their entire lives in the US without even having a Social Security number. So it sounds hard, but not impossible.\n\nAs for the money, if she wanted to make it look like she was abducted and didn't run away, draining her bank accounts would have given the game away. She could also easily have been putting some money aside in cash from her job to save up.\n\n**Her book being open to the scene of a violent kidnapping.**\n\nThis makes it so much more probable to me that she ran away. It's a thing no real kidnapper would take the time to do, in an office park where Cindy's desk was *extremely visible to anyone walking outside*, but definitely a very cinematic touch that someone running away might do to further lend credence to the idea that they've been kidnapped.\n\nCynthia would know exactly how much time she had alone in the office that morning due to knowing her boss' schedule, and could take her time to set the scene up. Also, her doing things around the office wouldn't attract the attention of any neighboring employees passing by the window.\n\n**The new focus on makeup and dieting.**\n\nAgain, this makes it seem likely she perhaps had either met someone outside of her circle she was interested in, perhaps a client at the law office, or just wanted to make a change for herself. It also makes it seem like she was deviating from the way she had been raised, as her father clearly judged her for it.\n\nIt also makes it *more* likely, to me, that her stalker was made up. Obviously, everyone is different and reacts differently, but it seems *highly* unlikely to me that a terrified woman being stalked by someone is suddenly going to start a makeup routine and try to draw *more* attention to her appearance and emphasize it. Most women react by doing exactly the opposite, a combination of the stress and anxiety from a stalker causing them to neglect their appearance, and wanting to draw attention away from themselves in a vain effort to put off a stalker.\n\n**The call from a mystery woman saying Cindy is being held in a house.**\n\nTo me, this seems like a call from Cindy herself to keep up the ruse. The low whispers were clearly meant to give the impression that the woman couldn't speak safely, but she had time to give an awful lot of somehow highly detailed and yet simultaneously useless and unspecific information about Cindy being held hostage. To know that Cindy is being held in the basement of a white house, next to another house, owned by the same family, but they're out of town, but the son is left behind and holding her, is an awful lot of detailed info to know and share without being able to name something actually helpful like...I don't know, a street name or neighborhood, or house number, or nearby landmark/store. She knew all that info and had the time to say all that to the police but couldn't give any detail that would actually point the police towards a location?\n\nThe whispers are equally likely to have been Cindy speaking that way so her voice wouldn't be recognized, as it's almost impossible to identify vocal qualities when someone's whispering.\n\n**Her car was in the parking lot**.\n\nTo me, taking her car would be kind of pointless, as if she wanted to disappear, she would have to ditch it at some point anyway. She couldn't just keep driving something so easily identifiable and traceable to her if she wanted to start a new life. She did take her purse, though. And it's possible she either hopped on a bus, or had an accomplice who picked her up, potentially a man she was seeing or interested in. That same accomplice could have called the office the day before to fake a threatening phone call.\n\nIn fact, I did some sleuthing because I am hardcore procrastinating today, and the last address for Feldstein's law firm (Cynthia's boss) in the link I provided is in an office park with a bus stop *literally* right outside it.\n\n**Alternate theory that one of the lawyers or clients killed her:**\n\nThere is a theory that one of the lawyers Cynthia worked for, Richard Neller, or a client of his, Jose Rodriguez Jr., killed her. Neller had Jose as a client right before Cynthia disappeared. Jose was pissed at him cause he didn't get him a better deal for one of Rodriguez's charges, so he fired Neller. Then in 1995, Rodriguez was arrested for drug charges again, and a witness came forward and said Jose killed Cynthia to get back at Neller for not handling his case well.\n\nThe witness was deemed unreliable - I believe I read somewhere that it was a prisoner, which would make him even more unreliable as prisoners come forward all the time telling police they can share info about other crimes in exchange for reduced sentences, and a lot of it is made up - and the motive seems very far-fetched for me. \"You got me a bad deal for my drug charges, so I'll kill your secretary?\" Not to mention, this witness came forward *14 years after Cynthia's disappearance*. And clearly, that theory of being murdered by Jose doesn't line up with the phone call about her being held in a basement by someone's son. So at least one of those theories is wrong.\n\nI should also add, I can't find any record of Rodriguez being arrested for murder, attempted murder, or any violent offense in his life. People who deal drugs aren't necessarily always murderers, or even often murderers. Neller *was* also arrested for drug trafficking, so clearly they had something going on, and other theories state that Cynthia overheard something she shouldn't have.\n\nBut for me, this also doesn't line up at all with the story of someone stalking her for months.\n\nIs it possible that someone helped Cynthia start a new life, and because she had been relatively sheltered and was young, that person took advantage of her and caused her harm at some point? Sure. But I think all indicators point to Cynthia choosing to leave of her own accord that day.\n\nAnyway, I'd love to hear your thoughts and comments!\n\n[https://charleyproject.org/case/cynthia-jane-anderson](https://charleyproject.org/case/cynthia-jane-anderson)\n\n[https://unsolved.com/gallery/cynthia-anderson/](https://unsolved.com/gallery/cynthia-anderson/)\n\n[https://navigatingadvocacy.com/episodes/cynthiaanderson](https://navigatingadvocacy.com/episodes/cynthiaanderson)\n\n[https://medium.com/true-crime-addiction/secretary-disappears-leaving-only-cryptic-clues-behind-true-crime-3977afd63ae4](https://medium.com/true-crime-addiction/secretary-disappears-leaving-only-cryptic-clues-behind-true-crime-3977afd63ae4)\n\n[https://lawyers.findlaw.com/ohio/toledo/1818749\\_1/](https://lawyers.findlaw.com/ohio/toledo/1818749_1/)",

      "title": "Man splits from his friends and goes to party in a club; He is caught on the club's parking security camera one last time as he's leaving and seemingly vanishes into thin air after that- Where is Harley Morris? (2024)",
      "text": "Hello everyone! As always, thank you for all your comments and votes (and a reward!) under my last post about David McAfee- I hope that he will be found soon.\n\n  \nToday I'd like to highlight another mysterious disappearance with few clues.\n\n\n\nBACKROUND\n\n\n\nHarley Warren Morris was 29 when he went missing from Tyler, Texas, USA.\n\n  \nHe spent most of his life in Florida, but he was living with his father, Bill Morris, in Tyler, before he went missing. Their relation was described as \"special\", and that the two were best friends.\n\n  \nAt some point in his life, Harley and his mother were involved in a road rage incident, during which Harley had been shot in the hip, and he still had the bullet lodged in his body, as it was impossiblle to get it removed.\n\n  \nHarley was a nature enthusiast who loved fishing and gardening- he had already chosen the seeds he wanted to sow in his garden in the spring before he went missing. \n\n  \nHarley worked at Prime 102, a local steakhouse, along with his father, Bill Morris. He was, apparently, a pretty good chef- when his father broke his leg while working at Breaker’s (seems to be some kind of restaurant- there is a seafood restaurant of that name in Tyler), Harley took over for him and turned out to be quite good.\n\n  \nHarley's family claimed that he didn't do drugs.\n\n  \nHis mother, Wendi Morris, said that Harley was \"loving (and) compassionate\".\n\n  \nTaylor Attaway, Harley's brother, said that Harley \"(Said) what he (meant)\" and that he \"always (build) everyone up around him. He’s who I strive to be\".\n\n\n\nDISAPPEARANCE\n\n  \nHarley was last seen at around 3 AM on the Sunday of 21st of January, when he was leaving a club called 50 Grand Club, located on the 2100 block of North Grand Avenue, near Texas College, alone; He was heading north, allegedly home. It's unclear if Tyler had drinked anything, but on a security cam recordings, you can see him stumbling a bit. He was caught on a camera in the parking lot of the club, and seemingly vanished without a trace.\n\n  \nAccording to his family, this is the first time in Harley's life where he went to this club (that's how I understood the statement; More on it in the conclusion). His friend drove him there. Wendi claims that Harley and his friends \"got off (from work) a bit late\", and they decided to go to Sports Zone (a bar and grill) for a few drinks, which was their weekend ritual; Harley then split off and went to a few other clubs, untill he ended up in the 50 Grand Club with some acquaintances. There isn't much info about it, but it seems to be an \"after hours\" club.\n\n\n\nHarley was reported missing on the next day by his father, when they weren't able to get in contact with him, and when he didn't show up for work, which was apparently unlike him. According to his father, Harley had left his phone at home, which he did often.\n\n  \nTips have reported that Harley was last seen around the Glass Recreation Center, on the northside of Tyler. It isn't stated if the sightings could be verified. During the investigation, the police had asked the residents and businesses north of Gentry Parkway to North Loop 323 to check any cameras or doorbell cameras between 3 to 7 AM on the 21st of January. \n\n\n\n  \nCONCLUSION\n\n  \nIt's suprising that Harley's movements past the parking lot of the club he was at were never tracked, or at least not conclusively- it's like the earth swallowed him the second he stepped out. I don't know how reviewing the home security footage went, as no specific info has ever been given to the public- if any clues were found, they weren't shared. \n\n  \nThe timeline about what happened after Harley split with his friends in Sports Zone isn't clear, but I did my best to piece it together. In one of the early sources, Wendi stated that Harley had never been to a club before- but that can't be the case, as going to Sports Zone seemed to be his and his fiends' weekly tradition. Perhaps she meant that the never went to 50 Grand Club? Or maybe the Sports Zone was more of a pub, while 50 Grand was a club? \n\n  \nWhile I do hope that all of the people Harley partied with have been interviewed, I'm not sure on if they had anything to do with his disappearance. Of course, there can always be a more complex story or personal drama underneath it all, but I don't think that's the case. \n\n  \nIf I had to guess, I feel like Harley might've been a victim of a misadventure- he seemed to be under the influence of something when he left, perhaps he was drunk, and either died of exposure or had an accident.  There are a few small bodies of water in relative proximity, but I feel like if he was there, he would be found by now (though of course it's possible to miss bodies in/underwater during searches). The area is mostly residential, but there are some wooded areas around, where his body might be. \n\n  \nThere's always a chance that Harleyhas met with foul play, though I would wager on it being opportunistic. I saw someone speculating that he might've been hit by a car and hidden, but I don't know how likely that would be; It feels like one of these \"true crime myths\" where incidents of hiding someone you hit with a car happen every day, while I almost never see these stories actually happen in the news. Still, it is a possibility.\n\n  \nHarley is deeply missed by his family. Wendi had moved to Texas from Florida to be able to look for for her son in person. Bill had said in interviews that he sleeps under his son's blankets and uses his knives when he cooks. They also created a charity, \"Hearts for Harley\". The family had attempted to look for Harley's remains using metal detectors, hoping that the bullet in his hip will ping back. While they continue to hope, it seems like they believe that Harley is sadly deceased.  \n\n  \nThere is a 10000$ reward for information leading to Harley's whereabouts. Crimestoppers is also offering 1000$ for information leading to his whereabouts as well. \n\n  \nHarley Morris was 29 when he went missing, and would be 30 now. He is white, 6’3” (75 inch / 190 cm) and weighs 160 lbs (73 kg). He had long, dirty blond hair and brown eyes. He was last seen wearing a black jacket with grey sleeves, black pants and a black Prime 102 hat. \n\n  \nIf you have any info about Harley's wherabouts, contact the Tyler Police Department at 903-531-1000 or submit an anonymous tip [here](https://www.cityoftyler.org/government/departments/police-department/resources/report-an-anonymous-tip). \n\n\n\nSOURCES:\n\n1.

      "text": "Hi everyone,\n\nAs a long-time British Columbia resident, I have always followed true crime cases around the province, and wanted to make a post about a lesser-known case from a decade ago, which most people have never heard of. This case hits close to home for me, as I spent many years living and working on a ski resort in BC.\n\n19-year-old Jake Kermond was a young Australian man who travelled to Whistler, British Columbia in early 2015 to do some skiing. From all accounts, it appears as though he had arrived in Whistler sometime in April 2015 and had been skiing throughout the month. Jake had reportedly been staying at the Adara hotel, and was last seen by the hotel staff on the evening of April 26, around 7:30 pm, when he extended his stay by two days, until the 28th. Notably, the Adara hotel would have most likely been charging rates of around $200/night during the ski season, which seems like it could have been a steep rate for a young 19-year-old 'ski bum', when hostels and cheaper accommodation would have been available throughout the village. \n\nOn April 30, hotel staff reported Jake missing after he failed to check out of his room. Notably, most of his belongings were left behind, including his ski boots (which are typically quite expensive, can be custom-molded, and are a very important part of a skier's gear). However, his passport and his Armada skis with blue and orange bindings were not in the room. There was a thought that Jake had potentially been attempting to sell his skis, but this was never confirmed. Some sources state that Jake had told hotel staff that he'd lost his wallet on the mountain on April 26th. Jake was last seen wearing dark pants, a white and black baseball cap, and a baggy green jacket. \n\nInitially, the Australian foreign affairs department stayed in contact with Jake's family and advised them not to fly to Canada in a panic, hoping that Jake had maybe gone to the U.S. to renew his visa. But if Jake had lost access to his funds after losing his wallet, this seems unlikely. \n\nBetween late April and mid-June, not much new information was discovered or released about Jake's disappearance, until June 17, when his body was discovered by a dirt biker. While the exact location of his body was never released, sources state that it was 'near a cliff area', 'partially buried in a gravel pit', and 'behind an industrial building' at a quarry location south of Whistler, somewhere near the 2010 Olympic Village. If so, this places the dump site location a 25-30 minute drive away from Whistler proper. \n\nIdentification of Jake took some time, due to decomposition. At one point, the RCMP stated that they were investigating whether he was pushed from the cliff, or whether he fell, but this was never clarified in the media. There has never been anything confirmed in the media as to whether his identification or skis were ever found, either with Jake or elsewhere. \n\nAfter 2015, there is basically zero further information available online regarding Jake Kermond's mysterious death. \n\nIf you have any information, please reach out to the RCMP.\n\n  \n[Australian teen identified as victim of suspicious death in Whistler | Vancouver Sun](https://vancouversun.com/news/metro/australian-teen-identified-as-victim-of-suspicious-death-in-whistler)\n\n[Australian teenager may have been pushed off cliff in Canada, police say | Australia news | The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2015/jul/11/australian-teenager-may-have-been-killed-in-canadian-ski-resort-police-say?CMP=gu_com)\n\n[Jake Kermond: Body of Victorian teenager found near ski resort at Whistler in Canada - ABC News](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2015-07-10/victorian-teen-found-dead-at-canadian-ski-resort/6609760)",

      "title": "The Keddie Cabin Murders Revisited",
      "text": "The Keddie cabin [murders](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keddie_murders) are a quadruple homicide committed on April 11-12, 1981 in a small low income housing development located in [Keddie](https://www.desertusa.com/dusablog/keddie-resort/?srsltid=AfmBOoo48zlqCOgzIL-LQ_5jn4hj4hqejX5ur5BBtb1LxGFVlz0hI987), California and are still unsolved to this day.  Glenna \"Sue\" Sharp (36), her oldest son John (15), youngest daughter Tina (12), and John's friend Dana Wingate (17) were the victims.  Sue was living in the [small](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/0*5df5ahlBiPss90sf.jpeg) cabin with her 5 children: John, Tina, oldest daughter Sheila (14), and younger sons Rick (10) and Greg (5).  On the night of the 11th, John's friend Dana was to spend the night at Sue's cabin (number 28) as well as Rick and Greg's friend Justin Smartt (12), while Sheila spent the night at a neighbor's cabin that was merely ten feet away from Sue's.  On the morning of the 12th, Sheila was returning home when she made the horrific discovery of Sue, Dana, and John murdered in the cabin's living room.  Sue had been beaten with a blunt object and stabbed repeatedly, and her panties were found stuffed in her mouth and wrapped in tape and tied with a bra.  Sue's wrists and ankles were tied together and her nightgown was lifted up and she was left in a sexually suggestive position.  John's wrists were tightly bound and he too was hit repeatedly with a blunt object and his throat was slashed.  Dana was hit repeatedly over the head with a blunt object and was \"manually strangled\".  Dana and John's ankles were tied together with extension cords.  Dana's hands were bound with tape, but the bindings were loose.  Sheila ran back to the neighbor's house to get help, and as they were calling the police, some of the neighbor's went back to the cabin and found that Rick, Greg, and their friend Justin were unharmed and they took them out of the cabin through their bedroom window.  Missing from the scene was Tina.  Rick, Greg, and Justin all say that they slept through the night and didn't hear anything, as well as the neighbors were Sheila was spending the night.  The FBI and California's Department of Justice were brought in to investigate the murders and possible abduction of Tina.  After extensive searches yielded no trace of Tina, the FBI \"[backed off](https://www.newspapers.com/article/feather-river-bulletin/22497222/)\" the investigation.  3 years later, a man searching for discarded bottles found human remains in an remote wooded area roughly 60 miles south of Keddie.  The remains were identified as [Tina's](https://img.newspapers.com/img/img?user=3202105&id=154588979&clippingId=10318445&width=820&height=727&crop=2098_2232_2003_1776&rotation=0), but no cause of death could be determined.  \n\nThe case grew cold and over the years interest in the case grew, thanks largely in part to the internet.  Multiple theories were thrown around, and slowly information from the original police investigation began to leak online.  Based off of this information, two suspects began to emerge as the favorites: Martin Smartt and John \"Bo\" Boubede.  Martin lived with his wife roughly 100 yards away from the cabin where the murders were committed, and Bo had recently moved in with them a few weeks prior.  The friend who spent the night in the cabin on the night of the murders, Justin, was Martin's stepson.  A lot of information implicating Martin and Bo came from Martin's wife Marilyn, who claimed that the three of them went out to the bar (also located in the resort community within walking distance of the murder cabin), then they came back home around 11, and that Martin and Bo left and came back later that night, allegedly burning something in their stove in the early morning hours.  Martin also allegedly confessed to a therapist that he had killed Sue and Tina, but had nothing to do with the boys.  In a letter written to Marilyn, Martin said that he \"paid the price of your love & now that I have bought it with four people lives\".  Since they were neighbors of the Sharp family, Martin and Marilyn were questioned early in the investigation, and they had asked Martin if anything was stolen from his residence recently and he mentioned a hammer: which also was one of the murder weapons.  Bo died in 1988 and Martin in 2000.  If you read any articles or watch any show/documentary about this case, it always revolves back to Martin and Bo as being the likely suspects based largely on the above information.  But I do not believe either one of them had anything to do with the murders, and thanks largely in part to the focus being **squarely** on them for the last 15+ years, the case has gotten muddier than ever.\n\nOn an [episode](https://www.investigationdiscovery.com/video/people-magazine-investigates-investigation-discovery/cabin-28-horror-in-the-woods) of People Magazine Investigates covering this case, they actually show the letter in full that Martin wrote to Marilyn, and you can tell that the one line about paying the price of four people's lives is not a confession to a murder, but rather the fact that he had left behind **his** four children to be with Marilyn and her children.  \n\n> Dear Marilyn,\n\n> First off, you know that I haven't tried to hurt you with my letters. I'm writing this after our phone call Monday (4-27). Marilyn, there's two things I want you to know; the first is that I love you & I don't care what has happened. Now is the time to start over. Call now!\n\n> You don't know how much I suffered before I met you. I asked God to send me someone who would care for me. I thought he sent you. I remember the hour, the words that were said; I said your phone number a thousand times that night.\n\n> I've given you my heart. All of it! Please try & think back. What do you think I've paid for you.\n\n> **For three years I've heard about your kids; Don't get me wrong I love them too! Now I'll ask! What about mine? Don't you think I love them? Honey I gave up four of the most precious things in my life; for what? For you!** The answer is simple!\n\n> Now I'll ask you. **Why should I love your kids more than mine. I've tried! That's more than you can say. I don't think you ever loved me much less my kids and yet you expect this from me & I've given it to you. I've paid the price of your love & now that I have bought it with four people lives, you tell me we are through. Great! What else do you want?**\n\n> I've paid the price! I've given my flesh & blood for you. I'll gladly pay your bills. Just send them in! **You know that I love you more than my own kids. Can you say that? I know you have given up a lot to be with me. But I don't think you know what I've paid. Yes, I'm jealous! For the price I've paid I should be. You can't seem to understand how bad you have hurt me. I'm crawling back! Take me! I've paid for your love.** Please give it back at least once. If you don't, you know you've stolen my heart and given it to the street.\n\n> I love you. Think about what I've given up for you, Marde Call me! Please don't wait till it's too late! I've given it all! What else do you want!\n\nIMO, it's obvious that the four lives he is referencing are his own children, and not the murder victims.  As for his alleged confession to a therapist, the popular story is that the police were informed of this confession and did nothing to follow up on it.  But it's not true.  A documentary was made and released 30 years after the murders, and in this documentary was where the confession to the therapist had been revealed for the first time.  A local newspaper wrote an article about the documentary, and brought up the [confession](https://i.ibb.co/wZjXyzHh/keddie.png):\n\n> Referencing the police report about the therapist, the film explained that \"there was no indication\" the local police ever followed up on the report by the therapist's friend.  Even in that case, though, it seemed strange that the Department of Justice wouldn't have acted on the therapist's information.  How could two police agencies, one local and one federal, miss two independent opportunities to follow up on a possible confession?\n\n> When questioned about this claim, the Plumas County Sheriff's Office allowed this reporter to view a later report, which appeared to be related to the first one.  **The report indicated that the therapist was interviewed by the Department of Justice in reaction to the original report.  The document explained the therapist told investigators he spoke with Martin several times but the vet never admitted to the killings, essentially denying that he told his friend he received a confession.  The report indicated that Martin's wife called the therapist after the murders saying she thought Martin committed them but that Martin denied this later.**\n\nAs noted in the letter that Martin wrote to Marilyn, they were suffering marital problems before and well after the murders.  IMO, Marilyn started to cast suspicion Martin's way as a possible suspect because their marriage was over as far as she was concerned and she was done with him.  But no physical evidence (hair, blood, fingerprints, DNA, etc.) ties either Martin Smartt or Bo Boudebe to the crime scene.  No logical motive exists for either one of them.  Yet to this day, they are the focal point of discussion about this case.  In [2018](https://web.archive.org/web/20180415002049/http://www.plumasnews.com/keddie-murders-revisited/) it was announced that DNA that was found on the tape used to bind the victims was matched to a \"**living suspect**\".  Martin and Bo had been dead for years at that point, so it couldn't have been them.  \n\nThe problem with discussing this case is that most people are fixated on Martin and Bo as being the most likely suspects, and a lot of the information from the original police investigation are reports that were transcribed and typed out on message boards over the years.  According to these transcribed police [reports](https://www.tapatalk.com/groups/keddiecoldcase/chuck-walke-and-henry-thompson-32-pages-t92.html), a few weeks after the murders someone came forward and said that a local man named Chuck had scratches and cuts all over his hands.  Because the original investigation was focused on Martin and Bo, the police did not question Chuck until July of 1981.  When questioned by the police to his whereabouts on the night of the murders, he said that on the early morning hours of April 12th, he and a friend of his named Henry had driven to the Keddie resort between 3:30 a.m. and 4:00 a.m. to see if a friend of Chuck's was going to be at work on Monday morning.  This friend lived in a cabin directly behind where the murders were committed.  Chuck told the police that they left when they saw no lights on at their friend's house and as he and Henry were leaving, he saw two suspicious men getting into a truck at the entrance road to the resort.  Henry was questioned by the police and did not say anything about seeing two men or a truck as they were leaving, only that he saw a man inside the resort and it looked like he was dumping trash.  When questioned about the inconsistencies in their stories, they couldn't explain why they were different.  Neither one of them had an alibi, other than each other.  Both admitted to being near the crime scene in the early morning of the 12th.  Both Chuck and Henry did take and pass polygraphs (IIRC so did Martin Smartt) and seemed to fall off of the police radar after this.  In October of 1981, an anonymous call came in to the police saying that a railroad worker had confessed to the murders and that \"it only started out as a game\".  This person called in several more times and eventually met with investigators and identified the railroad worker as Henry.  Henry was questioned in April of 1982 about this alleged confession...and he admitted that he did confess, but it was only because he was tired of people teasing him with the nickname \"Keddie machete\".  He again denied to investigators as to being involved and said it was a \"dumb thing to\" confess to.\n\nIMO, Chuck and Henry are more probable suspects that Martin or Bo.  But I think so much time and energy has been focused on Martin and Bo because only certain portions of the original police reports have ever been released publicly.  The reports on Chuck and Henry end in April of 1982 after he admitted to the confession but that it was false.  There could be more information that clears them.  There could be more that incriminates them. There could someone totally unknown to the public that the police have on their radar.  What I don't understand is they had a DNA hit on a \"living suspect\" in 2018...why was nothing done at that point?  \n\nTL;DR version: this case has been a convoluted mess since these murders were committed and has gotten worse over time with rumors and gossip being treated as fact.  I am hopeful that this case can be solved.  What do you think?  Would love to hear any theories or other suspects that could be involved.",

      "text": "[This was the Miyazawa home](https://www.reddit.com/media?url=https%3A%2F%2Fpreview.redd.it%2Fthe-miyazawa-family-was-murdered-at-home-in-setagaya-japan-v0-8affb61ybnxe1.jpg%3Fwidth%3D1200%26format%3Dpjpg%26auto%3Dwebp%26s%3Dbd7619e7216070e0807885d889b719070ac0df2d) in Setagaya Japan, and inside it lived 4 people. While they were at home shortly before the New Year, relaxing and enjoying the evening, an intruder broke into their home and killed them all – and he was in no rush to leave. The killer stayed inside the house for hours, during which he ate the family’s food, used their restroom, and even used their computer. As the killer left, he left behind a mountain of evidence including his blood, his fingerprints, and most of his clothes – but to this day, he’s never been found. The case, often called the “Goldilocks Murder” in Japan, continues to attract public attention to this day due to how shocking it was and is.\n\nSetagaya is an administrative ward inside The Tokyo Metropolis, a prefecture formed by combining the old Tokyo City with surrounding cities and islands. As a result, Tokyo is basically the Japanese equivalent to a state. Setagaya is one of the safest wards in Tokyo, which makes this crime all the more shocking.\n\nIn the year 2000, Tokyo planned to expand Soshigaya Park – the park right next to the Miyazawa home – as it had become quite popular. As a result, residents near the park were offered good money to sell their homes – even over 100 million yen in some cases, which at the time would’ve been worth over a million dollars.\n\nAs a result, Mikio and Yasuko Miyazawa, ages 44 and 41, sold their home but were still living in it at the time, planning to move the following March. The couple lived with their children, Rei and Niina, in a neighborhood called *Kamisoshigaya*. Yasuko’s mom Haruko lived next door alongside Yasuko’s sister, brother-in-law, and nephew, though the couple were almost never home for various reasons. By the time of the murder, the neighborhood which once held 200 homes was down to just 4, and still shrinking.\n\n[**The Miyazawa Family**](https://www.reddit.com/media?url=https%3A%2F%2Fpreview.redd.it%2Fthe-miyazawa-family-was-murdered-at-home-in-setagaya-japan-v0-elfwap8pcnxe1.jpg%3Fwidth%3D500%26format%3Dpjpg%26auto%3Dwebp%26s%3Dd56c10f593393c16b1a14003424980f5073db9b1)\n\nYasuko was a tutor, holding classes in her sister’s home since she was often away. Mikio worked from home for *Interbrand*, a marketing company based in London. Though they might not have been rich, the Miyazawas enjoyed a comfortable life. Niina was 8 years old, and Rei 6. The two children loved their grandmother, often spending time with her and even cooking for her. In fact, Niina had gone to visit her grandmother the very night she and her family were killed.\n\nThe day of the murder itself was like any other. At around 6 PM, the Miyazawa family went shopping at Seijogakuen Mae Station, a railway and commercial center just under a mile from their home. They ate dinner together, enjoying a meal consisting of Shirataki Noodles and Rice with vegetables, mushrooms and chicken, and around 7 PM, Yasuko called her mother next door. Niina went over to watch TV with her until 9:30, and at 10:38, Mikio read an email for work. It looked to be another normal night – until it wasn’t. \n\nSometime after 11PM on December 30^(th), 2000, an intruder broke into the Miyazawa home and began his assault. Police aren’t certain about how he got in, but the leading theory is that he climbed a tree onto the second-floor balcony and went in through the window, cutting its screen off to get inside. Once inside, he went to Rei’s room where he found the young boy sleeping. He strangled him and left, walking downstairs to continue the massacre. It was at this point that he encountered Mikio, whom he chased upstairs. As he was running to the second floor, the intruder stabbed Mikio all over with a sushi knife he had brought with him, breaking the blade in the process. After that, he made his assault on Yasuko, who was asleep in a room on the third floor with her daughter Niina. After climbing up the ladder, the intruder stabbed Yasuko with the same blade he used to kill her husband. Since he broke it earlier, however, it didn’t work. Because of this, the killer went downstairs to grab a knife from the kitchen, during which time Yasuko grabbed Niina in her hands and climbed down to the second floor, trying to get away. She wasn’t able to escape, sadly, as the intruder caught her on the second floor, stabbing and cutting her repeatedly. After Yasuko, her daughter was the intruder’s last victim. Just like that, the entire family was gone. \n\nAfter murdering the family, the intruder was in no hurry to leave. He stayed at the house for hours, drinking barley tea and eating ice cream from the family’s freezer, and he took time to rummage through the family’s documents and rob the place. He wasn’t careful about leaving behind evidence either. In fact, he left what investigators called a \"treasure trove\" of evidence. He ate with his hands, squeezing the ice cream from the containers and leaving his fingerprints all over the place in the process as well as his saliva. He had cut himself deeply during the assault and used the family’s bathroom to bandage himself, meaning his blood was everywhere. He even left his feces, unflushed, in the family’s toilet, and he left some of his clothes on the couch when he fled the crime scene. He fled sometime after 1 AM, and we know this because he used the family’s computer to access the internet at 1:18 AM on December 31^(st). He tried to buy movie tickets with Mikio’s credit card, but it didn’t work. \n\nWhat happened after that is a mystery. No one knows who he was, why he did it, or where he went afterwards. For all we know, he could’ve literally just walked out the front door after committing one of the worst killings in Japan’s modern history.\n\nThe morning after the murders, Haruko called over to greet her family and make plans for the day, but they didn’t answer. So, she went next door and rang the doorbell, and again, no answer. It was at this point that she used her key to open the door, walking right into the crime’s grisly aftermath. Haruko called the police, and soon enough dozens of Tokyo Metropolitan Police officers were on the case. \n\nThe first thing the police wanted to do was get a suspect, and, given the plethora of evidence left behind, it looked to be an extremely easy task. However, as time went on, investigators realized that the case was far more difficult than it let on.  \n\nFor starters, the killer’s fingerprints weren’t in any Japanese database, even though Japan requires fingerprinting to get a driver’s license, or some other official documents. Even after comparing more than 50 million fingerprints, none were a match for the killer. \n\nAn analysis of the killer’s blood revealed that he was likely East Asian, with possible European descent on his mother’s side. His Y chromosome – which you inherit from your father – had a distinct marker which police said was “common in 1 in 4 or 5 Koreans, 1 in 10 Chinese, and 1 in 13 Japanese.”  \n\nLooking at his clothes, investigators found more possible links to Korea. For example, his footprints were from a size 11 shoe made in Korea that wasn’t sold in Japan. Other than that, the killer left behind a variety of apparel, including a bloodstained shirt, a fanny pack with various dyes and sand from Nevada in it, a jacket, a scarf, a bucket hat, some handkerchiefs, and black gloves which he brought but didn’t wear during the murder. Many of the clothes as well as the knife the killer brought could have been bought locally.  \n\nConsidering the physicality needed to enter the house and everything else, police came up with a general description of the killer: he was around 5’7” (170 cm), between the ages of 15 and 40, and possibly a foreigner. He was also quite thin, since the window he entered was very small and had no clothes fibres on it, meaning he got through without rubbing up against the sides of the window much. To top it all off, he had a deep cut on his hand. With this image in mind, they set out to find their man. \n\nLooking more closely at the killer’s shirt, police determined that it was 1 of only 130 sold in Tokyo. They tried to track down the shirt’s buyers, hoping one of them would be the culprit, and they even managed to find 12 of them. However, none of them were determined to be the killer. This mirrors a trend of evidence and tips leading nowhere in the investigation. \n\nIn the more than 20 years since the murder, more than 280,000 investigators have worked on the case, investigating countless tips and thousands of pieces of evidence. There’s even a 20-million yen reward for information leading to the killer’s arrest. Despite the large police presence and incredible public support, no one has been arrested for the crime, and the killer eludes law enforcement to this day. As time goes on, it looks like the killer may never be caught.  \n\nEven though no one knows for sure what happened that night, some people have their own ideas... \n\n**Evidence and Theories** \n\nRemember how I mentioned there was a park next door? Well, it turns out that before the Miyazawas passed away, Mikio was spotted arguing with some young skaters who went there. Apparently, he didn’t like how noisy they were. Because of this, some people think a disgruntled skateboarder climbed over the tree and committed the unspeakable acts. Interestingly enough, the killer’s clothes did have sand from next door on them. It’s certainly possible, but it doesn’t make much sense to kill the entire family over an argument with one member. Plus, the sand could just be from him walking through the park to get to the Miyazawas’ home. All things considered, this theory just doesn’t make much sense. \n\nSome people think the murder might have been financially motivated – after all, the Miyazawa’s *did* get paid a hefty sum to sell their homes. The killer took some money from the scene – about 150,000 yen in fact – which would seem to support the idea even more. However, he left even more money behind than he took, not to mention jewelry, which makes robbery an unlikely motivation. Even if it wasn’t a simple robbery, however, money could have definitely been involved. \n\nMany people speculate that the family’s murder was a contract killing – in other words, someone hired a hitman to take the Miyazawas out. There are various reasons why someone would do this, including financial motives. Fumiya Ichihashi, a well-respected investigative journalist in Japan, says as much in his 2015 book *The Setagaya Family Murder Case*. According to Ichihashi, he met with a South Korean man named “K” who had much to say on the subject. \n\n**“K” claims** to have at one point talked to Yasuko, who, while telling him about her son’s health problems, mentioned the money she got from selling her home. Wanting this money for himself, “K” devised a plan to take it. He hired “R,” another South Korean man who served in the military at some point, to do the job. “R” then entered the family’s home and committed the atrocious acts already described. Giving more credibility to his argument, Ichihashi claims to have gotten ahold of “R’s” fingerprints – and he says they’re a match for the ones found at the crime scene. \n\nThis theory also explains why the house was flipped upside down when police arrived – after killing the family, K was looking for their money. In the end, he didn’t find much, as he only made off with about $1,500 worth of currency, and he left behind more than he took.  \n\nThough Ichihashi is famous for his investigative prowess, his theory isn’t bulletproof. For one, the killer used a knife that wasn’t well suited for the task, which is why it broke on Mikio. If he were a professional hitman, you would expect him to know what type of weapon to use.  \n\nCritics of the theory also point out that foreigners are fingerprinted upon entering Japan, meaning the killer would have had to have been smuggled in. However, mandatory fingerprinting for foreigners was abolished in 1999 and not re-established until 2007, meaning a foreigner *could* enter and leave with no problems at the time.\n\nThe biggest problem with the “murder for hire” theory, however, is the sheer amount of evidence the killer left behind; if he is a hitman, he’s the sloppiest hitman ever. But perhaps being sloppy didn’t matter. If the killer really was a South Korean national as Ichihashi claims, then he could be as careless as he wanted. After all, without any witnesses or other evidence linking him to the crime, extradition would be almost impossible, meaning the killer would be safe once he left the country... As Ichihashi writes,\n\n>**...my interpretation was that the criminal was not Japanese, did not live in Japan, and immediately escaped overseas.**  \n\nThat said, South Korea has assisted Japan on a number of cases, so escaping the country might not be a ticket to freedom after all. In the end, we may never know, as though Ichihashi claims he gave the killer’s fingerprints over to the police, “R” still remains unarrested. \n\nAnother theory is that a worker at a nearby grilled meat shop committed the murders. An article published by Yahoo News recounts the story, wherein several witnesses including a witness referred to as “A” give details about the suspect, called “H.” “A” claims to have seen “H” the day after the murders while he was walking his dog, no more than a few miles from the crime scene. When “A” saw him, he had a bandage on his hand, just like the killer would. “A” described “H” as a young man, likely around 20, and standing about 5’7” – just like the police’s initial profile. “A” also mentioned “H’s” hat – which he believed was similar to the clothing left at the scene – and his BMX bike. Since there was no sign of a car involved in the crime, it’s very possible the killer rode a bike to and from the scene. \n\nFollowing up on the tip, police interviewed several other potential witnesses, including “H’s” former boss and coworkers. They corroborated “H’s” physical description, although one interviewee personally thought it wouldn’t make sense for “H” to be a murderer, since he was “like a big brother” to her.  \n\n“H’s” former boss, whose home had been vandalized shortly before the Miyazawas were murdered, mentioned that he often invited his employees home with him. If “H” really killed the Miyazawas, he could also be the person who robbed his boss. \n\nUnfortunately, nothing has ever come of the “H” story, leading many to believe it’s nothing more than another dead end. The shop he worked at closed down sometime after the murders, and with it went all records of “H” being there. “H” himself has never been arrested as a result of the investigation. \n\nThose are the main theories surrounding the murder. Some people speculate about revenge for some grievance or another, but those are just general ideas without much weight to them.  \n\nToday, the Setagaya Family Murders are as shocking to the public as they were 24 years ago. The Tokyo Metropolitan Police force has vowed never to give up on the case, and the public won’t give up either. As a result of public outcry, the statute of limitations was removed on potential death penalty cases so that work on the Miyazawas’ murders could continue. To the public, the idea that children could be so mercilessly slain is unfathomable.\n\nEven the officers involved are personally grieved by it. Takeshi Tsuchida – the former Chief of Police at Seijo Police Station who oversaw the case until he retired – regularly visits Mikio’s mother to this day, talking with her about the case and sharing his sympathies. Mikio’s mother, the most devastated person of all, often prays for her family and wonders why her grandchildren especially had to go through what they did. Tsuchida, Mikio’s mother and others from the police force pass out fliers every year at the train station near Setagaya, hoping someone will finally come forward with information to close the case.  \n\nExactly 100 days after the murder, a Buddha statue depicting a protector of children was found near the home. As they were unsure who placed it there, police passed out fliers asking whoever placed it to come forward. Why did they place it there – was it a memorial to the dead, or a message? Did they know who did it? In any case, the fliers never got a response, so this too became a dead end. \n\nThe Miyazawa home remains unfilled to this day, alone and fenced up and falling apart. Investigators, who hope to demolish it, made records and replicas of all the evidence inside so that nothing of value is lost.\n\nMore than 23 years after their deaths, the Miyazawas live on in public thought and fascination, not just in Japan, but all around the world. As time goes on, we may only hope to one day know what really happened that night in Tokyo... \n\nSources:\n\n\\- [The killer without a face - ABC News](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2019-12-29/the-house-of-horrors-in-setagaya-japan/11771304)\n\n\\- [Setagaya family murders remain unsolved after 24 years - Japan Today](https://japantoday.com/category/crime/setagaya-family-murders-remain-unsolved-after-24-years-1)\n\n\\- [Tokyo police seek public's help on Setagaya family murder 24 years ago - The Japan Times](https://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2024/12/14/japan/crime-legal/setagaya-murder-police-information/)",

(2024)",
      "text": "Hello everyone! As always, thank you for your comments and upvotes under my last write-up about the Staten Island John Doe- I hope that his name will be given back to him soon.\n\n  \nToday's write-up is, I believe, the first 2024 case I ever covered. \n\nEDIT: I've changed the word \"client\" to \"customer\", as some readers found it misleding- I apologize, I'm not a native speaker and I didn't realize at the time of the writing that it can make such a drastic difference in context. The \"client\" in title should also be \"customer\", but I can't edit the title by myself- if any mod sees this, please feel free to change it.\n\n\nBACKGROUND\n\n  \nMarissa Kay Carmichael was 25 when she went missing from Greensboro, North Carolina, USA.\n\n  \nShe resided in High Point, North Carolina, about 25 minutes south of Greensboro. She worked in Waffle House on Westchester Drive in High Point.\n\n  \nMarissa is a mother of five kids, one of which is disabled. She also looked after her mother, Sara. She lived in a home with her kids, parents, and a female friend, who will be called \"A\", and who allegedly didn't have a place to live, so the Carmichael's took her in. According to Sara, A interfered in her daughter's life quite a lot.\n\n  \nMarissa has been arrested for drug possession in North Carolina in 2018 and has been arrested on misdemeanor charges not long before she went missing.\n\n  \nSara described her daughter as \"(...)such a beautiful girl. She’s very sweet, caring, empathetic, and wanted to help everybody. My house hasn’t been empty since she was 14 or 15 because she had friends that we opened up our home for\". She also said that Marissa \"(...)makes people laugh. She can turn the littlest thing into a lot of fun\". Sarah said that Marissa was her best friend, and that the two were in near constant contact through text messages.\n\n  \nJamil Ismail, Marissa's cousin, said that \"She’s very optimistic, she’s just a great person all around\".\n\n\n\nDISAPPEARANCE\n\n  \nOn the 13th of January, Marissa told her sister, Emma, that she was going to the club, and asked her to not tell their mother, because she \"didn't want her to worry\".\n\n  \nOn the night of her disappearance, on the 14th of January, Marissa was partying at an Airbnb at 444 Gorrell St with a few people. She allegedly fell asleep at the party, and found out that the friend she was with, A, has left. Marissa then went to a club called one17 lounge; Marissa's friends last saw her when they were in the lounge- they split, texting \"See you in the AM\". After that, Marissa went back to the Airbnb with a man ( we'll call him B), but they sat in his car outside and didn't go inside. Another man (we'll call him C) was hanging outside the Airbnb as well. An altercation broke out between Marissa and B.\n\n\n\nAt some point during the night, she was dropped off at an Exxon gas station at 809 East Market Street, less than a mile from the one17 lounge by B. There, she called 911 at 3.40 AM, stating that she didn't know where she was (except for the fact that she was in Greensboro), and that \"he\" (she never used B's name in that call) threw all her things out of a car but kept her cellphone. She also said that \"he\" ordered her to go into the gas station and \"grab some shit\"- but when she was inside, B has left. When the dispatcher asked Marissa if she was hurt, she said no. Marissa's main concern seemed to be a lack of a way to return home, as she couldn't call anyone to pick her up without her cellphone.\n\n\n\nA police officer arrived at 4:20AM, but Marissa was nowhere to be seen. The officer then spoke to the clerk, who claimed that Marissa \"got a ride from another customer\"- there are recordings that prove that Marissa left in C's car, and not with B. \n\n  \nThe last contact from Marissa were two calls to Sara from C's phone at around 5AM. Sara was asleep and didn't pick up; She assumed that Marissa was at her work at Waffle House. Marissa then called her father- When he picked up, she told him that there was an emergency and that she needs to talk to A. Marissa's father went into her bedroom and saw A sleeping in Marissa's bed. The conversation between women was brief, and after A disconnected, she went back to sleep. When A woke up around lunchtime, Sara confronted her about the call and about Marissa not appearing at work. A then said that Marissa was in Greensboro and was trying to get home, and that she asked A to get her phone back from B, but A told her that she doesn't know B and never met him. Sara found it suspicious that A disregarded the fact that Marissa was in trouble and just kept on sleeping; A hasn't been back in the Carmichael's house since the 14th of January, the day Marissa went missing.\n\n  \nSara tried to call C's phone when she saw that the number was trying to call her, but when she contacted it, she got a text saying that Marissa's asleep. Sara, undeterred, wrote that she wants to speak to Marissa, but the other person said that she \"walked up to the store\", and was saying anything to justify not giving Marissa the phone. When Sara asked for an address to pick up Marissa, she recieved one for a Sheetz gas station, but when she got there, there was no Marissa.\n\n\n\nMarissa was officially last seen at 3:46AM and reported missing by Sara on the afternoon of the same day; Sara also gave the name of the man who she believes was involved with her daughter to the police (we don't know if it was B, C, or someone else entirely).\n\n\n\nMarissa's social media have been silent since the 14th. Her phone has been turned off.\n\n  \nIn the next days, Marissa's cousin, Toshia Poplin, organized searches and scoured Greensboro looking for for Marissa, but no trace of her has been found. \n\n  \nAccording to Sara, the Exxon gas station workers didn't want to help Marissa because C was a good customer. Later on, they've even allowed him to tear down Marissa's missing person posters that were hanged up at the gas station because \"(...)he’s getting mad and it’s bothering him, so (the employees) took them down. So, (they) put them back up on the pumps\". C was interviewed in the case and is considered a witness.\n\n  \nSara got a few messages from A, but never personally spoke to her again. A told her that she \"didn't fight Marissa\" and to keep her name out the case, because she \"doesn't want to be in danger\".\n\n  \nAn establishment called the Magnolia Hotel has security cameras that point straight at the doors to the Airbnb Marissa was partying at the night she went missing, but it's unclear if the police even has them, as they were never shown to Marissa's family. Sara has heard that Marissa was given a handful of xanax in the Airbnb, and she could confirm if her daughter was drugged by the way she walked if she saw the security camera recordings.\n\n  \nCONCLUSION\n\n  \nThis case is quite mysterious, and I believe it can go in multiple different directions. The Greensboro police seems to know a lot more than they let on, and have stated early in the investigation that they won't be sharing new info about the case. This feels like they have strong suspicions as to what happened, but they don't have the evidence to prove it.\n\n  \nThe biggest question many people have is if A, B and C worked together or not. And yes, I can certainly see reasoning for it- A could've lured Marissa to the party, B could've gotten into an argument with her and leave her vulnerable and without her phone, and C could've picked her up and taken somewhere else. However, I don't think that's the case; I think that this scenario hinges on too many uncertain factors to pull it off to make it a good plan. I do feel like C might've been following Marissa since he spotted her at the Airbnb; He could've seen that she was pushed out at the gas station, went after her and pretended to be a concerned customer who promised to take her back home. He is probably the most suspicious person out of the three; A could've just taken Marissa to a party in a dodgy neighbourhood and leave her sleeping on a couch (so negligent and a bad friend but didn't want to harm her) and B could've just been a random guy she met and got into an argument with. \n\n  \nSadly, I believe that Marissa is probably deceased. I don't think that she would leave her family- they seemed very close and Marissa didn't seem to have the typical issues like debts, ones that make people take off. Looking after five (almost certainly young) kids, her sick mother and working a shift certainly isn't easy, but we have no known reasons to suspect that she's taking a break from her life. A lot of people seem to lean towards sex trafficking, but I'm not sure; There are certain reasons to believe that it might be the case (see below), but this isn't usually how sex trafficking works. The victims are usually teens from poor families that can't count on the care and support of people like parents or social workers. Marissa was a young adult and seemed to be tightly knit with her family, and her disappearance was noticed and reported almost instantly. I think that Marissa might've either died from something like misadventure, accident or overdose (accidental), or due to foul play, either from C or another stranger who saw a woman who didn't have way to contact anyone and was potentially intoxicated/drugged. \n\n\n\nMarissa's family believes that she is being held against her will, drugged, and is a victim of sex trafficking. Sara says that her daughter \"(...)is not a compliant person. She’s a fighter. Marissa would put up a fight. She would spit, scratch, bite. She’s smart enough to take out one of her braids and throw it under the seat or an earring. Anything that would leave evidence that she was there\". The family started to investigate a motel called Studio 6 Motel, located at 2000 Veasley St, that has allegedly been used for sex trafficking. C allegedly rents a room and has multiple women there, and three people confirmed that they've seen C and Marissa, who was told to \"keep her head down\" when they've entered the room.\n\n  \nSadly, scammers have been attempting to extort money from the Carmichaels, by pretending to be Marissa on social media or sending messages saying that they will release her for a price, but the family is certain that they are just after the money and aren't related to the case.\n\n  \nSara has been looking after Marissa's five kids, and that, combined with the stress of her daughter being missing, has damaged her already frail health (she has breathing issues, is on an oxygen tank, has uterine cancer, and is a diabetic)- she has been hospitalized at some point after her daughter's disappearance. Her other daughter, Emma, reminds her mother to eat and take her insulin. To Sara, her health is a small price to make sure that Marissa is back home with her family.\n\n  \nUnfortunately, around June, the Carmichaels have made a hard decision to put all five of Marissa's children up for adoption, as they were unable to provide them with adequate care due to Sara's health issues.\n\n  \nMarissa Carmichael was 25 when she was last seen. She is biracial, 5'4\" (64 inch / 163 cm) and 260 pounds (118 kg). She has a heart tattoo on her face and one of a butterfly near her eye. Marissa was last seen wearing a white Tweety Bird T-shirt, blue jeans and yellow sneakers, plus long black and blonde braids. If you have any info on Marissa's wherabouts, contact the Greensboro police at 336-373-2222, or anonymously through Crime Stoppers at (336) 373-1000.\n\n  \nSOURCES:\n\n1.

      "title": "Today will mark 37 years since Mr. Cruel's first attack on a family of four, when he broke into their Lower Plenty, Melborune, Australia home, where the parents' 11-year-old daughter was raped by Mr. Cruel. 37 years later, no suspect has ever been apprehended. ",
      "text": "On Saturday, August 22, 1987, in Lower Plenty, Melbourne, Australia, an unidentified man man wearing a custom-made balaclava broke into a family of four's home where they were fast asleep by very quietly breaking the glass in the family's lounge at 4:00 AM.\n\nThe man was well-prepared as he was armed with:  a handgun,  a kitchen knife, fours sets of handcuffs, red and white nylon cord, a small grey library bag, three rolls of red and green electrical tape, and one roll of surgical tape.\n\nHe entered the parent's bedroom and said them to them, \"Be quiet, or I'll hurt someone.\" He then forced the wife to tie up her husband, and forced both of them into their bedroom closest. Mr. Cruel said to the parents: \"Get into the wardrobe, and sit down. Get into the closet, and knell down.\"\n\nThe offender then used the phone in the parent's bedroom to make an apparent phone call, and called the supposed person, \"Bozo\". Victoria Police later found no actual phone call was ever made, and was a red hearing made by Mr. Cruel.\n\nAfter securing the closet door with a shoe rack, Mr. Cruel then got a radio and turned it up loudly to 3KZ, to drown out sounds the family was trying to make.\n\nMr. Cruel then went to the terrified 7-year-old son's bedroom, where he tied the son up to his bed post.\n\nHe then went to the terrified 11-year-old daughter's bedroom, tied her up, and took her to another room where she was raped.  Mr. Cruel said the daughter \"How old are you? What's your name? She told him her name, but he them mistakenly called her \"Kate\".\n\nHe then forced the daughter brush her teeth, and bathe afterwards to destroy all DNA evidence.\n\nHe then led the daughter to the kitchen and forced her down onto the floor where took food from their refrigerator where he helped himself to cold lamb, biscuits, milk, and orange Juice.\n\nThe offender then took the daughter to the family lounge where she was raped again.\n\nIn between attacks, Mr. Cruel would go back to the parents and son's bedrooms to check on them, and taunt them.\n\nBefore Mr. Cruel left, he told the daughter, \"I'm going to leave now, so count to 100, and then you can free your parents.\"\n\nOn his way, he picked up the broken glass the destroy window, and ripped their telephone out of the wall, so they couldn't call 000.\n\nAt 6AM, the daughter heard Mr. Cruel officially leave after he closed the back door, and knew it was safe to free her parents and brother.\n\nBy 6AM, Mr. Cruel had been in their house for two full hours by that point.\n\nWhat Mr, Cruel had stolen from the family's home:\n\n* a men’s red, black and yellow tartan shirt,\n* a pair of Roger David trousers with a 82-85cm waist,\n* a navy blue Ecuadorian Shirt Company parka with fake black fur collar which may have been the only one of its kind in Australia, $250 cash,\n* an 18 carat gold engagement ring with a white diamond mounted in between four gold claws and the number 4132 stamped inside,\n* a Gillette safety razor,\n* a dark brown vinyl bag,\n* a rare box set of classic music records by the London Philharmonic Orchestra, branded ‘Classic Gold’.\n\nSources:\n\n[Mr Cruel, The Unknown Child Abductor Who Terrorized Australia (allthatsinteresting.com)](https://allthatsinteresting.com/mr-cruel)\n\nWebsite dedicated to unmasking Mr. Cruel: [Who is Mr Cruel? – Website dedicated to unmasking Melbourne child predator Mr Cruel](https://whoismrcruel.com/)\n\n[The Case of Mr Cruel (arcgis.com)](https://storymaps.arcgis.com/stories/8c5f843543b740bc96d972e9519ea122)\n\n[Lower Plenty Attack – Who is Mr Cruel?](https://whoismrcruel.com/lower-plenty-attack/)\n\nMr. Cruel documentary: [Mr. Cruel: The Mystery Murderer Of Melbourne (youtube.com)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ArIl4189jDw&embeds_referring_euri=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bing.com%2F&embeds_referring_origin=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bing.com&source_ve_path=Mjg2NjY)\n\n[Case 41: Mr Cruel - Casefile: True Crime Podcast (casefilepodcast.com)](https://casefilepodcast.com/case-41-mr-cruel/)\n\n[Possible breakthrough in case of Mr Cruel who abducted girls and murdered one in 1980s in Melbourne | Daily Mail Online](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-10569225/Masked-child-killer-Mr-Cruel-terrified-city-abducting-young-girls-homes-three-decades-ago-raped-elderly-nun-years-earlier-loose.html)\n\n[Mr. Cruel | Unidentified Wiki | Fandom](https://unidentified-awareness.fandom.com/wiki/Mr._Cruel)",

      "title": "60 years ago today, Beverly Jarosz was murdered in her home of the Cleveland surburb of Garfield Heights, on December 28, 1964. The medical examiner who also worked on The Cleveland Torso Murders, and served in WWII described it as the most horrifying scene. Who killed her?",
      "text": "Beverly Jarosz was a 16 year old living in Garfield Heights, Ohio, when she got brutally murdered in her home on December 28, 1964. By all accounts, she was popular, intelligent, and kindhearted. She was very attractive and had many male admirers. Most of the male admirers were boys she went to school with & young men in her neighborhood, but there were a few admirers that were older men who were out of her age bracket. She also had a boyfriend, as well as an ex-boyfriend.\n\nThroughout the year of 1964 before the murder, there were some weird & unsettling disturbances, like multiple phone calls a day where the caller hung up immediately after someone answered the phone, and an unsigned present left for Beverly in her backyard. The most disturbing occurrence of them all, is when Beverly's dad came home from work one night, to find a man looking up at the window of the bedroom Beverly shared with her sister. Beverly's dad chased the man, but he managed to get away after being chased for a block.\n\nOn December 28, 1964, Beverly had plans to go the mall with her friends Barbara & Margie in the afternoon. Before that, Beverly and her sister went to their grandmother's house for lunch, after their parents left for work earlier that morning. They arrived there around 10:30 am. Beverly stayed at her grandmother's for about an hour and a half, as she needed to get home to get ready to meet with Barbara, as they were meeting Margie at her house. Beverly got driven home by a young man who was a neighbor of her grandma's, and arrived home shortly before 12:30pm.\n\nIn between the time she got home & the time she got murdered, there were three phone calls made to the house. The call that stood out was the second of the three, from an unknown man who referred to himself as \"Steve Stackowicz\", who apparently wanted to know if her father was home. The last one of these three calls was from her concerned grandma at around 1:15pm, but Beverly told her she had to hang up right after confirming she got home safe, as it seemed like Barbara was at the door.\n\nIt turned out Barbara was reportedly running late, and she got dropped off at Beverly's house by her mom at 1:25pm. Barbara said that she rang the doorbell multiple times, and got no response, but she heard loud classical music blasting from inside the house, as well as an extremely loud thud, “like someone knocking over a dresser”. Barbara said that she ended up leaving after waiting for a while, assuming that Beverly was mad at her for being late. When her two friends didn’t show up at her house, Margie called Barbara. That’s when ultimately Beverly’s grandmother was called. She got Beverly’s father to leave from work, to go back to the house and check up on things. All this took at least a couple of hours to unfold.\n\nIn between 4:00pm & 4:30pm, around 3 hours later, Beverly’s dad comes home, finds her dead in her room, and calls the local police. The scene was so horrifying to the local police, that they called Cleveland police department for help. The medical examiner (who also worked on The Cleveland Torso Murders), as well as the police captain (who became lead detective for Garfield Heights)  described it as the most horrifying scene they ever witnessed. Beverly was stabbed multiple times with numerous stab wounds all over her body, was strangled with a rope, and had been partially undressed. The killer seemed to stab in intervals of 3, judging from looking at her body.   Footprints were found in a patch of sand by the curb, but were not helpful. Even though it was winter, there was no snow on the ground. The killer’s escape route was through the backyard, as there was a police dog who followed a scent from the room, and out the back door. Beverly's hair was also found in a bush in the backyard.\n\nThe police interviewed hundreds of people. Many of Beverly’s male friends came in voluntarily, and were fingerprinted, and polygraphed. All of them passed. There were many leads that led nowhere. One odd thing did happen, seven years after the murder. Thaddeus & Eleanor Jarosz were still living in the same house where their daughter Beverly had been murdered. Their other daughter Carol, was not living with them, as she was in college at this point.\n\nOne day, when Thaddeus & Eleanor were at a funeral for a neighbor, someone broke into the house. Only 1 thing was stolen, it being a gold watch. It looked like someone broke into the house, to look for something. Two prints that were framed, and were hanging up on a wall, were taken down, and their backing was torn out. The prints were copies of Beverly's 2 favorite paintings. What the person was looking for, and if they found it, is a mystery.\n\nThe Suspects/Persons of Interest:   \nThere are well over a dozen people that the police and/or the public either found interesting, or could not count out. I will list the people, but in NO SPECIFIC ORDER of how likely/unlikely they are: \n\n**James Mondezlewski** \\- The 18-year-old young man who drove Beverly home. James and his parents, Sonya and Johnny Mondzelewski, were neighbors of Beverly's grandparents, and when James Mondezlewski’s mom, Sonya Mondzelewski saw Beverly walking to the nearby bus stop to take the bus home, she asked James to drive Beverly home, as it was cold out, being winter and all. \n\nBecause of how often Beverly visited her grandparents who lived a mile or two away, she was likely familiar enough with James to get in his car with him alone. James Mondzelewski said it took 15 minutes to drive Beverly home, after which James returned home, changed his clothes, and had lunch. James didn't go inside or stick around to chat with Beverly after dropping her off. \n\nJames pulled into the driveway to drop her off, then went straight home. James was just coming home from a job interview when James' mom asked James to drive Beverly home, and so when James got home, he changed out of his clothes that he wore to the interview, into regular clothes. \n\nJames drove Marie Vanek to Jarosz house to be with family afterwards, as Sonya Mondzelewski asked James to drive Beverly's grandmother over to the Jarosz house, later in the day on 12/28/1964. Because James was the last person to see Beverly alive outside of her killer, GHPD brought James up in the room to show James Beverly’s body, to see James’ reaction. GHPD didn't see anything out of the ordinary in James' character, so James was ruled out pretty quickly. James is currently an eye doctor in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania \n\n\n\n**Larry Young** \\- GHPD questioned Larry Young, who’s mother Stella Young bad-mouthed Beverly after she either rejected Larry, or dumped Larry after dating Larry for a bit. There have been differing reports as to whether Larry was legitimately dating Beverly, or if he was simply infatuated with her. What is known is that Larry was heartbroken over Beverly, and Larry's mother, Stella Young, hated Beverly. \n\nAccording to a man named Robert, whose parents were family friends of the Youngs, Stella was mentally deranged, and Robert claimed that Larry's dad told Robert's dad that Stella killed Beverly. It’s hard to believe that not only would Larry’s dad sell out his wife, but that Robert's parents wouldn’t come forward. Either way, Stella and Larry were ruled out. \n\n  \n\n\n**James Krawczyk** \\- Reporters interviewed a middle-aged neighbor named James Krawczyk, who claimed to have seen Beverly’s killer run from the house. James Krawczyk was home because of the White Motor strike, and his wife confirmed to journalists that he often stood by the window, looking at Beverly’s house, saying “Sometimes, he even gets up at night to look out the window, I guess he likes the view”. James Krawczyk later admitted to police that he made up the name to get himself in the paper. His child worked with Beverly’s ex-boyfriend Daniel Schulte at the car wash, although his child was definitely younger than Daniel. Because Beverly hung out there, the Krawczyk child knew her, and his name has come up over the years as well \n\n**Daniel Schulte** \\- Daniel Schulte was Beverly's 19-year-old ex-boyfriend, who was considered “a bad-boy-ex” and a “greaser” in the teen circles of the time. Daniel and Beverly hung out when\n\nhe was 17 and she was 14, but they weren’t allowed to formally date because Beverly’s parents didn’t allow it. \n\nUnlike a lot of boys who Beverly went out with, Daniel was a steady boyfriend. Daniel’s idea of a date was making out behind the carwash. Daniel dropped out of high school in Grade 10 and enlisted in the Air Corps, but was back in town for Christmas. Although Daniel was dating a new girl, it was known he still pined for Beverly. \n\nBeverly’s friends were chagrined because they thought Daniel was a bad influence. Margie told GHPD that “Beverly would never have thought of doing the things with Roger that she did with Daniel”. Schulte hung out with the rough greaser crowd, trying to imitate James Dean, who was an American actor in the 1950's, being remembered as a cultural icon of disillusionment and social estrangement. \n\nCarol said that Beverly broke the relationship with Daniel when she was in tenth grade, but author James Badal said Daniel was Beverly's boyfriend until about March of 1963, which is when Beverly was in ninth grade (Badal’s account is accurate). Daniel took it hard, sending flowers, an easter basket, letters, and showing up at her all-girls catholic school after class Schulte claimed to have been working when Beverly was killed, and showed a timecard supporting his claim. However, his next door neighbor claims to have seen him arrive home in a hurry. \n\nHe was associated with a group of other bad people at the time. Daniel showed up at Beverly’s viewing with a girl at his side, but returned later alone, and sat quietly by himself. While on leave, Daniel had picked up some part-time work and produced a time card that showed he was on the clock when Beverly was murdered. The woman who lived next door to Daniel told GHPD that she had seen Daniel come home that day and run inside in a hurry. She watched Daniel in the reflection of her garage window. \n\nDaniel was given a lie detector because of this, which Daniel passed. It is notable though, that the tests in 1964 weren't as reliable as they are today, and even today, they're not admissible. Moreover, in more recent years, around 2005, Daniel Schulte refused to talk with police, and ended up moving to Israel. \n\nIn the 2010's, Carol said she wrote Daniel an email, thanking him for sponsoring Beverly’s page on find-a-grave website, and Daniel wrote Carol a very nice note. Carol and Daniel have exchanged a few emails since Beverly’s 50th anniversary. Because of this, people on social media thought Carol was being easy on Daniel, and trying to give Daniel a pass. \n\nOn December 28, 2016, the 52nd anniversary of Beverly's murder, Carol said that she had not given Daniel a pass at all. After Carol contacted Daniel to thank him for sponsoring Beverly’s find a grave, she gave Detective Carl Biegacki Daniel’s email address, and Carl had a few questions he wanted to ask Daniel, but Daniel didn’t reply to Carl.\n\nCarol pleaded with Daniel a couple times via email, asking Daniel to communicate with Carl, but Daniel did not reply. The aforementioned above, as well as the fact that Daniel left the country shortly after the Beverly Jarosz case was reopened in 2004, kept Daniel on Carol’s list at the time of the 52nd anniversary of Beverly's murder. \n\nHowever, in July 2021, Carol seemingly changed her mind on Daniel, as she said that she only had two people on her list, and neither one of the people she named were Daniel. It is honestly very possible, that Daniel not talking with GHPD in recent years could be because he wanted to get away from the case, as he was still hurting over Beverly \n\n**Roger McNamara** \\- Beverly's 19-year-old boyfriend at the time of her murder. Roger met Beverly through his cousin Margie, Beverly's best friend. Margie's and Roger’s moms worked at a bank. Described as a “straight-laced conservative college student having very strict moral attitudes”, so quite the opposite of her ex-boyfriend Daniel Schulte. \n\nRoger was studious and religious, and was well liked by the Jarosz family. Roger was a Republican, and Roger attended Latin mass and spoke out against the liberal alterations of Vatican II. Carol, who had never cared for Daniel, liked Roger, as Roger treated her well. Beverly particularly enjoyed attending parties at Roger’s fraternity and meeting Roger’s older, educated friends. \n\nRoger and Beverly had long term plans. Roger would take Beverly to the museum and the music carnival. Roger was due to take Beverly to Winter formal. Roger claimed to have been home sick, working on his car when Beverly was killed, and GHPD considered Roger's alibi weak. Roger's car was blue, and he loved to keep it clean. Roger was given a polygraph also which he passed. \n\nHorrigan said to Cleveland Press that “There are some elements to Roger’s present story that bother us”. Roger was at a party the previous night, which was at Beverly's house, and he and Beverly went out at some point, and were \"lovey-dovey\" according to Carol, so it does seem unlikely that they'd be on bad terms the following day. \n\nRoger's first polygraph was inconclusive, but he passed the second one. However, lie detector tests in 1964, weren't nearly as reliable as they are today, and even today, are inadmissible. Carol said she couldn't know for sure, but she believes that Roger was lead detective William Horrigan's top suspect, so much so that Horrigan only focused on Roger. \n\nWilliam Horrigan, the Garfield Heights lead detective in the 1960's, believed that something happened when Beverly and Roger went out on 12/27/64, which led to 12/28/64's events. Carol did say that Roger maintained contact with her mom Eleanor throughout the years. \n\nAt some point, Roger got married, had children, then got divorced. Roger worked for a bunch of financial firms over the years, and supposedly had/has a nasty demeanor. Roger remains a steadfast Republican and Catholic. Roger McNamara was living in Northeast Ohio in 2008, but\n\nappears to be living in Silverdale, Washington now. It turns out that Horrigan was wrong, as Roger was CLEARED BY GHPD in recent years. \n\n**John Paliyan** \\- Beverly's 18-year-old neighbor, who lived 2 houses east of the Jarosz household. John Paliyan went to St. Therese Elementary School with Beverly, although was three years older. Paliyan’s dad fixed TV’s, and John’s dad came over to the Jarosz household a couple of times to fix TV tubes. \n\nJohn was stated to have an eye for Beverly by neighbors, and admitted that he would spy on Beverly sunbathing in her backyard, during the summer months. He was also home alone at the time, so there is no one who can vouch for him. He was stated by classmates to be shy, so it's possible that he was the one who left the anonymous gifts for Beverly, because he couldn't muster the courage to speak to her directly. \n\nThere were no fences separating John's backyard from the Zemgulis family's or Beverly's, so leaving the gifts would be of low to no difficulty. Moreover, Paliyan did not pass a lie detector test, as it was inconclusive, and according to a coworker, was asking how to pass one. At some point, Detective Carl Biegacki considered that it could have been John Paliyan, since JP admitted he’d watch her sunbathing from his bedroom window. \n\nJohn married a psychologist at some point. Paliyan was contacted by crime author James Renner in the 2000's and told Renner that any request for an interview should go through Paliyan's lawyer named Jay Milano. Paliyan told Renner that GHPD recently spoke to him, and Paliyan said that he was being framed and there was a cover-up going on. \n\nAdditionally, Paliyan's sister was approached by GHPD at work, was questioned for over an hour, and lawyered up. GHPD wanted to know if she disposed of the knife for her brother. But a big thing that has always pointed away from Paliyan, is that Beverly most likely would have had the doors locked, and wasn't extremely familiar with him. \n\nIt's hard to see Beverly being comfortable with John being in the house, as she was skeptical of men, and knew she had a stalker. Moreover Paliyan was also said to be a sissy by those that knew him. James Renner said Paliyan was his pick back then, but that Carl Biegacki and GHPD pretty much ruled Paliyan out in recent years, so Renner doesn't think Paliyan did it any longer. \n\n**Bruce Bilek** \\- A 21-year-old college student, living directly behind the Jarosz household in 1964. The Jarosz family knew Bruce better than they knew John, because they saw Bruce working all the time at the library, and Bruce went to their church. \n\nThere were a couple times when Beverly went to later church service than Carol and Eleanor, and Bruce would drive Beverly home, so Bruce and Beverly were not only better acquainted than Beverly was with John, but they were quite familiar with one another.. He claimed to have been in his garage working on his car, which was supported by his parents.\n\nBruce could have had a potential line of sight of Beverly getting dropped off by James Mondzelewski, depending on if either his garage door was open, or if he was outside of his garage when Beverly got dropped off. \n\nIt is notable that he became an art teacher at a high school afterwards, and he reportedly asked female students to pose in bikinis, so he could take photos of them. He made at least a couple of his female students uncomfortable, and he made a student's assistant so uncomfortable that she left her job. \n\nThere was some sort of joke going on in Beverly's friend circle, where Beverly was teased about Bruce having the hots for her. Bruce was questioned after GHPD saw a note Beverly had written to Margie. Beverly’s note said \"Bruce came over to see what I look like when I’m not dressed. I have my blue robe on and my hair is still in curlers”. \n\nBruce said he didn’t ever really talk to Beverly, which was not true. Bruce's alibi was considered solid, so he was never given a polygraph. It is notable however, that parents would usually protect their children, even if they think or know that their child is guilty. Additionally, Bruce's parents definitely couldn't have been keeping an eye on him the whole time, because they were in the house doing stuff, so that is noteworthy \n\n**Harry Madol** \\- A 17-year-old door-to-door salesman, who moved to Garfield Heights in September 1964, 3 months before Beverly's murder. Harry’s parents divorced by the time he was 5 years old. Harry's father lived in Michigan, and Harry's mother's house, which was on East 141st Street in Garfield Heights, was a 15-minute walk from the Jarosz house. \n\nHarry lived at his mother's, right off McCracken Road on East 141st Street, which was around a mile from Marymount, and around a mile away from the Jarosz house, give or take for both. Harry was violent by age 2, and accused of breaking and entering at age 9. Harry was out of seventeen behavioral institutions & schools by age 17. \n\nAfter moving to Garfield Heights in Sept 1964, Harry started working at Halle's Department store in Cleveland, where Jarosz family shopped at. Harry also worked at Burroughs and Southgate. Because Harry moved to Garfield Heights at the end of September 1964, none of the stalking could have been him. Harry was living in Michigan, in a reformatory school for hardcore juvenile sex offenders during the summer of 1964. Harry had just got released from there at the time of his move to Garfield Heights. \n\nThe anonymous gifts couldn’t have been from Harry, because the box with the bracelet addressed to Beverly was left in June, according to Beverly's sister,. The hang-up calls also started in the summer, so Harry would not have been the one to make them. Moreover, Thaddeus saw the man looking up at the window of Beverly's bedroom in the summer as well. \n\nUnlike the others who Beverly was acquainted with, the main argument for Harry Madol possibly being Beverly's killer, is that he has a violent criminal record. Harry attacked 3 women atknifepoint in 1963 before the move to Garfield Heights. By age 17, Harry had raped his stepmother and threatened to kill his half-siblings. The reason Harry was sent to the reform school for sex offenders is because of the sexual assault of his stepmother. \n\nHarry stabbed a pregnant housewife named Gerda Leedy on February 16, 1965, a little over a month and a half after Beverly's murder. Gerda Leedy’s husband was an Elyria radio broadcaster. When Cleveland detectives found Harry after stabbing Gerda Leedy, he was at the Embassy Apartments at Prospect Avenue in a closet hiding. \n\nCleveland detectives were also working on the Beverly Jarosz case, and they noticed that Harry had three scars on him, two on his face, and a two-inch scar on his wrist. According to Beverly's sister Carol Jarosz, Harry couldn't account for his whereabouts between 12:00 pm, and 5:00 pm. on December 28, 1964, although in the papers it said that Harry stated that he was at Halle's. \n\nHe also confessed to Beverly's murder, then recanted it. When Detective William Horrigan and GHPD start speaking to Harry after Harry confesses, Harry was giving a totally different layout of the house, as well as giving different times, and different things that happened at Beverly’s. The knife used to stab Gerda Leedy was also smaller than the one used to stab Beverly. Harry didn’t give anything consistent with what really happened . When asked about why Harry confessed, Harry said “because you guys are gonna pin it on me anyway”. \n\nHarry took 4 polygraphs regarding Beverly, and all polygraphs were inconclusive. Lee Teeters, who was considered an expert, administered the polygraph. Harry Madol's fingerprints were also inconclusive. Recent GHPD lead detective Carl Biegacki said “GHPD polygraphed Harry, and inconclusive, but I got a handful of other people that were inconclusive too”. \n\nThe original lead detective at the time in 1964, William Horrigan, had 72 hours to link Harry Madol to Beverly Jarosz, as he had to return Madol to Elyria’s police to stand trial for the Gerda Leedy stabbing, and decided that it was plenty of time to determine that Harry Madol didn't do it. The papers stated that Horrigan said that “the man arrested outside Elyria” (referring to Harry Madol) probably was not important in the case. Horrigan said to reporters “If I thought he was a hot suspect I would have gone out last night”. \n\nOn February 17, 1965, the Akron Beacon Journal posted about Harry Madol. The Akron Beacon Journal said Harry got arrested in Cleveland the day of publishing. The Akron Beacon Journal said Harry denied Jarosz slaying, but admitted to stabbing Gerda Leedy. \n\nAfter the Journal stated that Harry said he was working at Halle's on December 28, 1964, the journal also said that Horrigan said “if Madol’s alibi doesn’t check out, he looks to me like a hot suspect”. Because of this, Carol Jarosz's statement that \"Harry Madol couldn't account for his whereabouts between 12:00 pm, and 5:00 pm. on December 28, 1964” is very debatable. Harry Madol said he always carried a knife and often made knives. Harry Madol was chased out of Lindhurst for high pressure tactics as a salesman, as a housewife called police saying Harry\n\nwas too persistent in sales tactics. It turned out that Harry was selling without a sales permit as well. \n\nMadol was tried as an adult for the Gerda Leedy stabbing and was sentenced to 1-20 years. In 1972, Madol was granted parole, but he broke his parole and fled Ohio. For the next 18 years after that, Madol’s life would be one of fleeing, and eluding authorities, using women, doing scams, fighting extradition in Atlanta and Quebec, and being convicted of federal scams in federal court. \n\nIn 1990, Madol was granted release for the stabbing of Gerda Leedy and the federal scams. By the time Ohio granted Harry Madol his release, Harry was doing a mining scam in Arizona while on final parole bout in San Francisco, and when people saw he was ripping them off, he fled to Quebec, Canada. \n\nWhen Madol fled to Canada, it would take the RCMP almost 3 years to apprehend Madol, and to come to Atlanta to stand trial for the federal scams and parole violation in the Gerda Leedy stabbing. Harry would go on to live in England for a number of years in the early 2000’s, like around 2002-2006 or 2002-2008. Harry's most recently known financial scam was in Austria in 2006. Harry is believed to be living in Europe, Germany being a frontrunner, but Switzerland and Sweden being possibilities as well. \n\nKeep in mind, there is also no actual evidence that Harry knew Beverly. In the 3 months, in between the time he moved to Garfield Heights, and Beverly's murder, he worked at a place where Beverly went to on occasion, so while it's possible they crossed paths, it is nothing but speculation. \n\nThe only things that make him plausible are his confession, and his violent crimes. Moreover, the only way it could have been him, is if Beverly left her door unlocked that day, which is very highly unlikely. The house was not broken into, and there is no way Beverly would have allowed a random male (especially a creepy one) in the house, so Madol's only chance would have been if the door was open. \n\n**Barbara Klonowski** \\- Beverly's friend, who was supposed to meet her that day. Beverly and Barbara were acquaintances in earlier grades, but didn't start hanging out until eleventh grade, when they started going to downtown Cleveland for shopping a few times, and even to the art museum once. \n\nDue to Beverly being among the most attractive girls in Garfield Heights and having many male admirers, she was easily the best with males in her friend group. According to people who went to school with the girls, in Beverly's friend group, Margie didn't have a jealous bone in her body, and seemed to be the only one that didn't mind all the attention that Beverly got from boys and \n\nyoung men. Barbara apparently did. Teenagers/Adolescents get really mad about things like these.\n\nI will say that Marie Vanek’s original statement to GHPD was that Beverly said \"I have to go\", but then in her statement of Jan 4 or Jan 5 of 1965, Marie Vanek started saying that Beverly said that \"Barbara was at the door\". Regardless of if Beverly indeed specified that Barbara was at the door, it seems that Beverly's grandmother thought Barbara did it. \n\nAdditionally, in one of the newspapers multiple years after Beverly’s murder, her father Thaddeus Jarosz said that he differs with Horrigan’s belief about Beverly’s killer, as Horrigan was sure it was a male, and Thaddeus thought it was a female. “She is being shielded from arrest by relatives,” said Thaddeus. Thaddeus was definitely referring to Barbara in this statement. \n\nBarbara’s family, the Klonowskis, were a very wealthy and respected family. Barbara’s grandfather owned the “Bank of Cleveland”, and the Klonowski family was associated with Benjamin Stefanski and the Stefanski family, who owned “Third Federal Savings & Loan”. \n\nBecause of this, from 1964 to now, people have speculated that Barbara was Beverly’s killer, or was at least involved in Beverly’s killing, and her family covered it up. Barbara’s brother, who became a lawyer, has been quite nasty with people who could even consider the possibility of his sister and/or family being involved, and has made both legal threats, and personal threats to people over the years, the personal threats being violent. \n\nIn 2008, before John Paliyan was cleared, he spoke with author and investigative journalist James Renner, and Paliyan said that he was being framed and there was a cover-up going on. Just like Thaddeus Jarosz, it seems like John Paliyan was talking about Barbara and/or the Klonowski family, but didn’t want to mention any name. \n\nBecause of the fact that Beverly was stalked throughout the year of 1964 leading to her murder at the end of year, she was definitely super cautious, so she most likely would have had her doors locked, and likely would only let in someone she trusted. \n\nBarbara would have been one of those people she trusted, and since she was expecting Barbara that day, she would have been the most likely person that Beverly would have let in. Barbara reported hearing loud music and a loud sound like a dresser falling when she was waiting at the door, but that could have just been a cover story, as she was actually inside the house, and had the music turned on. \n\nNobody was there with nor saw Barbara waiting at Beverly's door. Barbara claimed to have been running late, and the only person to support that was Barbara's mom, who was a music teacher and said to be a crazy person by former students. Like I mentioned in the Bruce entry, parents would usually protect their children, even if they think or know that their child is guilty. Barbara did not meet up with their other friend Margie, who Beverly and Barbara were originally supposed to meet. Margie had to call Barbara to find out what happened. The fact that Barbara didn't meet up with Margie, and didn't even call to let her know that she or Beverly weren't coming, is suspicious. This could mean that Barbara went home to wash off any evidence on her, and either forgot to call Margie, or just didn't want to call Margie. \n\nOne of the two possible downsides to this theory, is that Barbara may not have had the strength to do all that to Beverly. Detective Carl Biegacki did say in the late 2010's that \"Barbara Klonowski and Margie Gorney had nothing to do with Beverly’s murder, 'especially' Barbara Klonowski\". It would not have been impossible, however. Jealousy brings out the worst in people. \n\nAlso, a young man called Gary Grayson, who was a classmate of someone that Beverly dated at Garfield Heights High School, picked Barbara up in his car a few blocks from Beverly's house, near the time of her murder. Gary Grayson was driving in his 1958 Corvair on Turney Road. He was a year older than Beverly and Barbara. \n\nGary Grayson was questioned, but not given a polygraph. He was admittedly in the area at the time of the murder, and knew one of the people involved with Beverly that afternoon, well enough for Barbara to get a ride from him. That would make him a friend of a friend. Since it is believed that Beverly’s killer may have gotten into a car after the dog scent stopped at McCracken, it makes one wonder if Gary Grayson was that driver, and was actually waiting for Barbara, as opposed to running into her. Carl Biegacki did not mention Gary Grayson by name when speaking in the late 2010's. \n\nMoreover, Beverly previously dated Barbara's cousin, Stanley Klonowski, who was interviewed by police as well. Beverly was the one who broke it off with Stanley. According to Beverly, Stanley was misunderstood and troubled. Stanley didn’t seem to pan out, although just like Barbara, he did not take a polygraph or give any fingerprints or DNA. \n\nIf Barbara was behind Beverly's murder, a possibility is that either Stanley or Gary were involved, and helped carry it out. Stanley may not have been over Beverly, and the break up could have really messed him up. When you add that along with Gary's whereabouts, and Barbara's jealousy, a slim possibility emerges that Barbara and Stanley and/or Gary were behind it. Regardless of which one of the two Barbara had helped her, they could definitely have gotten the job on Beverly done. Since there was no DNA found under Beverly's fingernails, and 2 methods of murder were used, 2 killers is a definite possibility. \n\n**Vidocq's pick: Unnamed Family Friend** \\- In 2015, lead detective Carl Biegacki and GHPD got the most serious about the case since 2004, and in October 2015, they took the Beverly Jarosz case to the Vidocq Society, a highly regarded crime-solving organization in Philadelphia. Carl described Vidocq Society as “a group of law enforcement officers that are the cream of the crop, from profilers to FBI agents to detectives from all over”. \n\nThe Vidocq Society is made up of 82 members who volunteer to serve as confidential consultants to assist law enforcement in solving difficult cold cases. Its 82 members are forensic\n\nprofessionals, current and former FBI profilers, criminologists, medical examiners, homicide investigators, forensic scientists, psychologists, polygraph examiners, prosecutors and coroners. \n\nGHPD and their lead detective Carl Biegacki presented a powerpoint to the Vidocq Society. The experts of the Vidocq Society were able to assist GHPD, and bring to light a few things that GHPD didn’t know of before, and GHPD were able to develop even another suspect from that, someone who the Vidocq Society came up with who was not previously on the list of persons of interest. The Vidocq Society swore by their pick to GHPD. After Beverly's sister appeared on Fox News 8 in March 2017, there was a tip that came into the Garfield Heights Police Department that named this person as a suspect. \n\nThe GHPD lead detective at the time, said that he also had access to the Jarosz house, and was at the house numerous times, and a family friend. \n\nBiegacki said that despite being a cautious girl, Beverly would have 100% let him in, and that there's no doubt about Beverly letting him in. Biegacki said Vidocq Pick’s friends who were to be his alibi did not confirm his story of his whereabouts on 12/28/1964. Vidocq’ pick refused a polygraph test, refused to give DNA, Refused to give fingerprints then and now.\n\n  \nA FB group about the case called \"Beverly Jarosz: 1964 Ohio Case of a 16 year old girl\" is a great place to get more information. A youtube channel called \"Words, Ideas, and Conversations\" posted a very informative podcast episode on this yesterday, I recommend checking it out!\n\nSources: \n\n[https://imgur.com/a/ELED9Nq](https://imgur.com/a/ELED9Nq)\n\n[https://books.google.ca/books?id=LcLBGdkLI0EC&lpg=PA37&ots=7-mI44QxBS&dq=beverly+jarosz&pg=PA37&hl=en&redir\\_esc=y#v=onepage&q=beverly%20jarosz&f=false](https://books.google.ca/books?id=LcLBGdkLI0EC&lpg=PA37&ots=7-mI44QxBS&dq=beverly+jarosz&pg=PA37&hl=en&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q=beverly%20jarosz&f=false)\n\n[https://www.cleveland.com/metro/2014/12/beverly\\_jarosz\\_murder\\_50\\_years.html](https://www.cleveland.com/metro/2014/12/beverly_jarosz_murder_50_years.html)\n\n[https://www.cleveland.com/whateverhappened/2004/12/police\\_armed\\_with\\_new\\_tools\\_re.html](https://www.cleveland.com/whateverhappened/2004/12/police_armed_with_new_tools_re.html)\n\n[https://leelofland.com/lisa-black-famous-unsolved-cleveland-homicide-beverly-jarosz/](https://leelofland.com/lisa-black-famous-unsolved-cleveland-homicide-beverly-jarosz/)\n\n[https://community.babycenter.com/post/a62674543/armchair-detectives-the-unsolved-murder-of-beverly-jarosz-triggers](https://community.babycenter.com/post/a62674543/armchair-detectives-the-unsolved-murder-of-beverly-jarosz-triggers)\n\n[https://www.cleveland.com/metro/2016/10/beverly\\_jarosz\\_a\\_voice\\_preserv.html](https://www.cleveland.com/metro/2016/10/beverly_jarosz_a_voice_preserv.html)",

      "title": "The \"accidental\" death of Phillip Meshew",
      "text": "This is a very obscure case that I stumbled upon while looking through newspaper archives.  There's very little discussion online but those who do know about it find it to be strange.\n\nIt was a Sunday morning on September 29th, 1968.  Usually, Jean Pierre Meshew would be getting ready for church, as he was a reverend at his local Episcopal church.  This morning however, he will not be attending church.  The previous night at around 7:30pm, his son, 15 year old Phillip Meshew, left home to presumably play in a large wooded area located around The Forest Hill Cemetery area, a favorite spot of his.   Phillip didn't come home that night.  Worried, his parents notified authorities of their missing son.  At 5:30am, Hamilton County deployed rescue units to search the areas where Phillip’s parents thought he would possibly be.  At around 9am, a county rescue worker made a disturbing discovery.\n\nOn a hill overlooking the southwest corner of the cemetery, off in a wooded area, the body of Phillip Meshew was found hanging by the neck at the base of a small tree.  He was also nude except for his shoes and socks with his clothes folded neatly near his body.  The noose was a thin cotton rope with a sweatshirt lining the noose, padding out the neck.  The branch that the noose was tied around was broken, likely from the weight of Phillip.  His body was noted to have been covered in small burns and some papers report Meshew as having been “sexually mutilated”.  Dr. George Beckmann Jr., the Hamilton County medical examiner, said that the cause of death was asphyxiation from the rope.  Beckmann also added that Meshew had been “brutally sexually assaulted and tortured with cigarettes”.  He waited to make an official ruling for the cause of death until he received toxicology results from the State Lab of Toxicology in Nashville.\n\nThe Chattanooga Police Commissioner, James E. “Bookie” Turner arrived on scene and immediately block it from the public and the press.  Turner took personal charge of the case as he had been friends with the Meshew family due to their sons attending the same school.   About Phillip, Turner said, “He was a great kid”.  He otherwise said very little to the press, not allowing them anywhere near the scene, but stated that the case was “an atrocious act of murder”.  He reportedly put all available detectives that he could on the case.  \n\nPolice interviewed the cemetery caretaker, William Thompson Jr.  Thompson reported seeing Meshew and some other boys playing in the woods around 3 - 3:30pm on Saturday, with him stating that Phillip was a frequent visitor of the cemetery.  He then saw Phillip return later that day on bicycles with a friend to walk around the cemetery near the office for a while before leaving.  Meshew then returned to the area by himself.  Thompson  locked up the cemetery around 7pm, noting that the only two people he saw were “two old ladies picking up plastic flowers at a dump”.  Before he left, he did his rounds around the cemetery, taking him by the area where Phillip was found and said he saw no one.  Thompson then returned at 7am the next morning.\n\nThe investigation lead into Monday the 30th.  The Tennessee Bureau of Investigation sent down agent Joe Hanhan to help with the probe into what happened to Meshew.  Certain items at the scene were sent off to the TBI labs in Nashville, but there was no elaboration on what the items were.  Authorities were still tight-lipped about the affair with Lt. Jack Robb telling the press that “the investigation is going on”, adding, “ but if anything gets out it could hinder us.”  That same day at 11am, the funeral services for Phillip were held at the Thankful Memorial Episcopal Church where his dad was the rector.  It would be officiated by Rt. Rev. John Vander Horst and William E. Sanders.  His body would then be sent to Barlow, Kentucky to be buried.\n\nPhilip Meshew was born in Cairo, Illinois.  He came to Chattanooga in 1966 with his 4 other siblings. Friends and neighbors all remarked that Philip “was a good kid” who was “well liked”.  He was a sophomore at Chattanooga City High School in autumn of 1968.  His father, Jean Pierre Meshew, was ordained into the Episcopal church in 1967.  Before that he was a deacon for the Thankful Memorial Episcopal Church, which drew the family out to Chattanooga.  Jean had met Phillip’s mother, Janet, in Cairo during her time in nursing school and the two got married, having Phillip in 1953.  Janet had several interests aside from nursing including art and political activism, with her marching for civil rights in the 1960s and writing letters to politicians.  She even quit nursing later on and become a taxi driver and cook on a shrimp boat.\n\n11 days after the discovery of Phillip Meshew’s body, Dr. George Beckmann Jr. ruled his cause of death to be “asphyxiation due to an accident”.  Despite the police saying that “it was an atrocious act of murder” initially, they agreed with Dr. Beckmann’s findings.  Nothing else was given out as explanation for how \"the accident” happened.  Same went for any updates on the nature of the reported injuries and mutilation.  After October 11th, 1968, there hasn’t been any new information relating to this case as far as online archives go.    \n\nIt’s very bizarre that the initial reports of this crime are that it was a sadistic sex crime and murder against a high school boy, only for it to be ruled as an “accidental” hanging by those same authorities is definitely a jarring turn in the narrative.  That’s furthered by the reports that the TBI had sent items off to be tested and statements by police about the need to keep this case quiet.  With the lack of details in this case combined with the 180 narrative shift opens a lot of room for speculation if you don’t buy the official ruling. \n\nLet's go over a few possible theories.\n\n***AUTHOR NOTE: I should clarify a point that is made in this section of the post:  There is NO proof that Phillip was gay.  I included it as point based on theories put forth in a***[ comment thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/UnresolvedMysteries/comments/n7b0km/comment/gxfjwkm/) ***discussing the case on this sub before I made this post.  It was theorized that he may have been the victim of a hate crime or that IF he was gay, it could've had something to do with the eventual vague ruling of the case.  This point has seemed to cause a lot of confusion.  This whole section consists of pure speculation based on very limited information, so nothing here is stated fact.  Just INTERPRETATION AND PRESUMPTION.***\n\n**The death was accidental:**\n\nThe initial reporting of this case in no way makes this seem plausible, but there could be an explanation for all of these details: autoerotic asphyxiation.  There have been many know deaths throughout the years caused by a form of masturbation in which the person chokes themselves out until they hit a point of orgasm, which to some creates a very pleasurable experience.  If done wrong, it has been known to lead to death.  Phillip was hung from a small tree which could make it possible for him to set this up himself.  The detail about the sweater padding the neck would imply that he was seeking to make it more comfortable and avoid leaving a ligature mark on his neck which would be easily noticed.  The location is also very secluded and he seemed to know when the place closed up so he could try it out in private.  He picked the southwest part of the cemetery which seems to be surrounded by a large patch of woods.  The “ cigarette burn marks” could have been caused by bug bites and the “sexual mutilation” that was reported could have been a scavenging animal from the woods.  Perhaps authorities, possibly at the request of his family, decided to maintain “his dignity” by not further explaining the nature of the accidental hanging.\n\n**Murder theory:**\n\nOne commentor on reddit postulated that Phillip was the target of a homophobic lynching attack.  There is no proof that he was gay, but it was speculated as a factor that could have led to a hate crime lynching. Another reason he could have been targeted was due to his mother's involvement in the civil rights movement.  He was in the Southern United States during the 1960s where attacks of this nature had occured.\n\nAnother Phillip was targeted by sadistic sexual predator who raped and tortured him, then hung him from a tree to slowly choke him out.  The initial reports indicated that he was “brutally sexually assaulted and tortured with cigarettes”.  Those two details came from the medical examiner who would eventually rule it to be an accident, so it’s not just media hyperbole.  Some reports even say the desecration of Phillip’s body went as far as sexual mutilation.  \n\nIf the murder theory is true, why cover it up like this?\n\n**Cover-Up?**\n\nWith the jarring, 180 degree turnaround on the statements from officials on what happened to Phillip, it does raise the question of why that was if the idea of an accident doesn’t sit right.  One reason that was touched upon in the other theories was having to do with covering it up due to morality or out of respect of the family’s dignity had there been socially unfavorable details about Phillip in terms of his sexual orientation/experimentation.  This is the 1960s in the South which doesn’t have a reputation for reflecting the progressive social values of the era, mixed with the religious reputation that Phillip’s father had.  It could be enough for authorities, especially given the family friendship of Police Commissioner Turner to pull some strings and sweep the event under the rug.\n\nPhillip could have also been targeted by a person or group that had some measure of protection by authorities.  It could’ve been a homophobic mob or group of bullies that had parents who were higher ups in the local area and Tennessee at large, allowing their kids to get away with it.  Or it could be a sadistic predator with family or institutional protection, even perhaps a pedophile network of sorts that has prominent members, something along the lines of The Family murder case out of Australia in the 70s. \n\nWhile all of the wounds could be explained by an animal, I would also think a medical examiner for the county would be able to tell the difference.  That being said, there's always room for error and the initial shock could’ve just caused the officials to think to confidently label it a murder before they investigated further.  \n\nA lot of this is still grasping at straws because the truth is that there is not enough available information to make sense of the very little, yet polarizing information that is known.  It certainly is a very baffling series of events that have been mostly forgotten.  \n\n**SOURCES**\n\n[\"Minister's Son Found Tortured\"](https://www.newspapers.com/article/the-republican-ministers-son-found-tort/171722002/)\n\n“St. Elmo Rector’s Son Found Dead”  **Chattanooga Times Free Press** September 30th, 1968\n\n“Minister’s Son Found Tortured and Hanged”  **Winston-Salem Journal** September 30th, 1968\n\n“Minister’s Son Found Hanged” **The Tennessean** September 30th, 1968\n\n[“Hanged Boy Buried; Probe Continues” The Tennessean October 1st, 1968](https://www.newspapers.com/article/the-tennessean-chattanooga-murder-meshew/162997929/)\n\n[“Death Ruled Accidental” Danville Register and Bee October 10th, 1968](https://www.newspapers.com/article/danville-register-and-bee-meshew-ruling/171720769/)\n\n[Janet Meshew's Obituary ](https://www.legacy.com/us/obituaries/savannah/name/janet-meshew-obituary?id=26492586)",

The ensuing investigation resulted in over 4,000 witnesses from over 40 countries being questioned but not one suspect.",
      "text": "(Thanks to [F9reverWithSNSD](https://www.reddit.com/user/F9reverWithSNSD/) for suggesting this case via [this post](https://www.reddit.com/user/moondog151/comments/1g7vgdl/for_my_international_readers_or_anyone_interested/) asking for case suggestions from my international readers since I focus on International cases\n\nEDIT: 11 days. Not 19\n\nEDIT 2: To clarify the title. What I meant and was going for by \"no suspects\" was that the police never actually identified any people to name as suspects. In hindsight, probably should've gone with something better)\n\n[Trude Espås](https://imgur.com/9MT6YvZ) was born in Orkanger, Norway, sometime in late 1975. Little information is available on her background, but based on what is known, she likely enjoyed travelling. At Finnmark University College in Alta, she studied two years' worth of English and Russian, which would've helped her immensely in her travels. While in Alta, newspapers stated that she worked \"in the environment\".\n\nThis likely played a role in her choice of a summer job. On July 31, 1996, Trude, now 20 years old, was hired as a maid at the Hotel Union in the small village of [Geiranger](https://imgur.com/QcUWfGK). Geiranger was a small and scenic village and one of Norway's most well-known tourist spots due to its natural beauty. (It was also the setting for the 2015 movie The Wave.)\n\nNormally, Geiranger has a population of around 250. But during the summer, that population can jump up to 3,000; for the 1996 tourist season, it reached 5000 people, 98% of whom were foreign tourists who had likely never been to the area before nor likely to return once the season was over.\n\nAugust 8, was Trude's day off and at around 3:45 in the afternoon she went into the center of Geiranger to enjoy her day off in the town. She then went to the local grocery store. She was then observed sitting on a [viewpoint/rock](https://imgur.com/o02sBBZ) just outside Geiranger. That was the last confirmed sighting of Trude that day.\n\nOn August 9, a hotel housekeeper went to the police to report Trude missing as she had not been to work that day. Because of Geiranger's natural landscape, a fjord, surrounded by mountains. It was feared that she either fell or suffered some other accident. The police didn't waste much time forming a massive search party. A search party that utilized sniffer dogs and helicopters on just day one alone.\n\nOn August 10, a man entered the police station carrying a [handbag ](https://imgur.com/4y8VqW2)and a book he had found. The two objects were found on a separate rock adjacent to a highway just outside of Geiranger. At some point, Trude got up from the rock, crossed the road, and climbed a hiking trail above the road. Therefore the police now knew to focus their search efforts in that area.\n\nOn August 12, the police had permission to search the dormitory adjacent to the hotel where Trude lived. Inside, the police found her passport and wallet, which suggested that she likely intended to come back. In her dorm was also a note.\n\nOn August 2, [she had made four notes on a piece of paper](https://imgur.com/5zoLbwW). They said \"Elin - Store - German - Crutches\". Elin was the employee who was training her, the store was likely the one she was last seen at, but German and Crutches they could not decipher the meaning of.\n\nOn August 13, a man found a red T-shirt along the road. It was the same shirt Trude was last seen wearing.\n\nProfessional divers also scoured the fjord and other surrounding waterways but found nothing of note. By now, the police were under the belief that foul play must've been involved in Trude's disappearance and they had already questioned 11 people but none of them wound up being involved.\n\nThe search was then expanded to mostly all of Geiranger. Officers from outside the immediate area, including officers from Kripos, were called in. 70 members of the Norwegian Red Cross were mobilized, and police searched along the entire roadside and combed just about every beach.\n\nBy August 18, tourists who had heard what had happened voluntarily gave up their cameras, leaving police with over 1,000 photos to sort through. They had hoped that one of them may have unknowingly captured Trude after her last known sighting, but to no avail. Despite the immense effort and resources put into finding Trude, the police were ultimately at a loss and failed to find her.\n\nOn August 19, an elderly married couple, both locals of Geiranger were out for an evening walk along the highway. Once their walks took them by a pile of rocks, they were suddenly struck by a foul odour. They followed the smell and found themselves at a pile of loose stones and rocks, about 100 meters away. They saw [a pair of white shoes](https://imgur.com/YqYaKNR) sticking out from under a pile of rocks.\n\nThey decided not to go any closer or remove the rocks and instead called the police. The police arrived, sealed off the area and began removing the rocks one by one. That was not a quick task as whatever was buried underneath the stones was covered very thoroughly.\n\n[Eventually, the police uncovered the decomposing body of a young girl](https://imgur.com/NkHAfPZ). The body was identified as Trude. Although the cause of death was never publically disclosed, it is believed she had been strangled. It was also said that Trude had been raped.\n\nUnfortunately, because of the heavy decomposition, the police struggled to place the time of death reliably. The police also found foreign hairs on Trude's socks. The police were only able to create a partial DNA profile with it. It was tested against the DNA of all the local males in Geiranger but none of them matched.\n\nIt was deemed unlikely that she was killed on the rock she was seen sitting at. Especially because it was out in the open and thus there would be many witnesses if anything did happen there. The police, in fact, knew exactly how many people would pass by.\n\nThe rock was near a road, and police were conducting traffic control at the time. They estimated that 2.5 cars were driving by every minute. Walking trails were nearby as well, and the boats in the fjords would have a clear enough vantage point, too.\n\nThere was one part of the path though, just below the crime scene where the path rose slightly and thus was obscured from the main road and the walking trails. The police believed the murder likely happened here. If this murder had occurred any other time of the year, solving it wouldn't be that difficult with the relatively small population. But now, 98% of the suspect pool were foreign tourists who wouldn't be staying long, didn't speak the language and might've already left.\n\nThe police attempted to map out the identities of all the tourists and vehicles in Geiranger on August 8. They secured the guest lists for all the hotels, motels, and campsites, and everyone who had used a credit card was registered and put into a police database. Unfortunately, many of the tourists visiting were still allowed to leave Geiranger, and there was not one thing the police could do to stop them or even know they left.\n\nLuckily it didn't take long for their first suspect to emerge. One of the hotel's employees came forward with a statement to the police. They were one of the witnesses who saw Trude on the rock. While lying down, she saw a man at the edge of the forest.\n\nThe man sat still and stared at the witness for 20 minutes. Once she stood up from the rock, he followed behind Trude. He then asked, \"What time is it?\" in German. They described him as \"unpleasant.\" Afterward, he walked toward the rock Trude was last seen sitting at.\n\nShe described this man as pale, clean shaven and appeared to be Northern European. He stood at 1.85 meters tall, had a normal body build, grey-blue eyes, and dark brown hair. He was dressed in light shorts and a short-sleeved polo shirt with horizontal stripes, blue on a white background. [A sketch](https://imgur.com/R5hwYj6) of this man was soon put together.\n\nNext, a Swedish couple on a camping trip in Geiranger came forward. They were on a walk when they saw a woman sitting on a rock, this woman almost certainly being Trude. Later they walked by the same rock and saw her gone. After a few meters, one had to go relieve himself. They went up a footpath alongside the highway and halfway up the path they heard a scream which they said sounded like a child's scream.\n\nOne didn't want to investigate out of potential fear or a belief that it was just a playful scream from a child playing with his parents but her husband persisted. He eventually found himself around 30-40 meters away from what he thought was a child lying against a cliff. [He also saw another man standing above them](https://imgur.com/0Brzphy). He eventually noticed the husband and the two looked at each other for a while before the husband finally left to pee. He had simply assumed the man to be the child's father and when he returned, both were gone.\n\nAll of this had gone done roughly 20 meters away from where Trude's body had been found.\n\nThe sketch of the \"German Man\" was shown to the Swedish Couple and the husband said he thought the face looked a little familiar but couldn't be entirely sure. Meanwhile, his wife never got a good look at the man in question to begin with.\n\nAnother thing of note was an older model of an American blue car with temporary plates. Such a vehicle was seen in Geiranger on the day Trude disappeared and hadn't shown up again. Perhaps they were just passing through or nobody noticed them on any other days but the police are also interested in speaking to the owner of that car.\n\nThat German man was the police's primary lead and they sparred no expense in trying to track him down. But it was all for naught. The police had questioned over 4,000 witnesses from 40 countries, including neighbouring nations like Sweden all the way to far-off nations like South Korea with many interpreters called in to help. The police also received and followed up on 1,900 tips. Despite their best efforts. The police didn't get any closer to naming a suspect.\n\nIn July 2017, the case was featured on a German TV show due to the likelihood that the murderer was the mysterious German man. After the episode aired, a man contacted the staff of a Norwegian TV Show called \"Åsted Norge\" and said he might be able to help.\n\nOn August 2, 1996, he had been vacationing in Geiranger and took three photos especially that may be of use. [One of them, taken on August 2, depicted a man with only one leg using crutches](https://imgur.com/gFcrMVP). These pictures were shown to locals and one of them, a woman who was 16 and working at a kiosk at the time said she recognized him.\n\nThe man acted very creepily toward her and asked a bunch of personal questions such as where she lived, and how far away her house was. The man was also speaking German. While it did likely explain the notes left in her diary, the police do not believe him to be the killer. He did not resemble the sketch and the other German man did not use crutches and had both of his legs. Disposing of Trude's body would've been very difficult if not impossible to do with the other German's disability.\n\nThe police also took hair samples from hundreds of tourists who could be tracked down again. They were compared against the DNA profile from the hairs but none of them matched.\n\nThe police also had 15,000 pictures and 300 videos to go through and so many more were sent forward as people rediscovered their old vacation photos. Over 500 separate people of various nationalities sent in the aforementioned pictures and videos.\n\nSo even 20 years after Trude's murder, the police were still sorting through various photographs and footage for any potential leads. The police also spent over 13 million kroner on the investigation.\n\nIn November 2017, they came across [a photo](https://imgur.com/3vcrwoY) overlooking the fjord with about 5 boats on the water. The photo was dubbed the \"5:15 Photo\" as the boats left the port at 5:15 PM. The police were able [to digitally enhance the photo and saw a small red dot on the rock Trude was sitting on](https://imgur.com/9YReH4j). The dot was likely her red T-shirt.\n\nBefore this photo, the last known sighting of Trude was at 5:00 PM. A second photo of the same spot was taken at 5:26 and by then Trude was gone. Therefore, the police pieced together that Trude left the rock between 5:15 PM and 5:26 PM. This narrowed down her time of death and matched the statement made by the Swedish couple.\n\nIn May 2023, a woman came forward and said her son had confessed to the murder. In November 1999, she was questioned and said her son confessed during a heated argument meaning this was in fact the second time she came forward. He also told her that he was in Geiranger that day without anyone knowing about it and was driving an old blue car he had rented.\n\nSupposedly, he had put his hand over her mouth after she started screaming during consensual sex and wanted to silence those screams as he was scared passersby would think he was raping her. He kept his hand over her mouth until he wound up suffocating her by accident.\n\nThe problem, he was already dead by the time of both confessions so he had no means of defending himself. The car was not the smoking gun one would think as two of the same model were in the area and witnesses were inconsistent on what colour the license plates were.\n\nBut most of all, everyone else who knew him said that was straight-up impossible and that his mother was lying. He worked at Sognsvann in Oslo and was there on August 8th as well giving him an alibi.\n\nFurthermore, nothing was able to link him to Geiranger that day. His bank card wasn't used, nobody had seen him, he hadn't gone to any local stores, border any boats, the police never saw him when they were questioning everybody they saw and so on.\n\nHe did travel to Geiranger on August 8, 1997, the one-year anniversary of Trude's murder but the police believe that to be a coincidence and nothing more. He often travelled across Norway and only did so with his friends so going there alone would be highly out of character.\n\nThe police also checked with the Norwegian Public Roads Administration to see if he may have rented or had access to a blue American car with temporary plates. Nothing in their records indicated that. In 1996 he leased a dark green local vehicle.\n\nbased on her 1999 interview, the police were already considering him but by 2023 they were able to rule him out definitively. Either he lied to his mother during that argument in a public place that no other witnesses attested to. Or for some reason, his mother lied about him after his death.\n\nTrude's family was so desperate for a resolution that for a brief while they considered that Tony Alexander King might be responsible. Tony was a serial rapist from The United Kingdom who is now serving life imprisonment for the murders of Rocio Wanninkhof and Sonia Carabantes in Spain. However, nothing shows that he was in Norway at the time.\n\nThe most recent lead was in April 2024, when the Norwegian Ministry of Justice worked with the South Korean authorities to track down 27 additional South Korean tourists to hear their testimony. It was a joint effort that began in October 2023. Only 16 were found and none of them had anything of use to say. Nor did their photographs shed new light on the case.\n\nThat is where this case ends. It remains not just one of Norway's most famous cold cases but simply cases in general. Trude's mother has stated that even though the killer hasn't been found, she's still satisfied with the police's investigation and has never once accused them of being incompetent. She has come to accept that they tried their absolute hardest but are simply out of leads to pursue. Her exact words were \"I have no complaints about the police's efforts,\"\n\nEven if the mysterious German is innocent. The police still believe that the killer was likely one of many tourists and that he likely returned to his home country not long after the murder. Possibly before the body was even found.\n\n***Sources***\n\n***Fornemmelse for mord - Trude Espås

      "title": "The 2021 Murder and Dismemberment of Adam Johnson in Minneapolis",
      "text": "_Preamble: This is an unsolved murder in Minneapolis that I feel has fallen through the cracks, and needs resolution. What follows is a special expanded post, with as many details as could be gathered._\n\n## Victimology\n\nAdam Richard Johnson, 36, was a lifelong Minnesota resident who became the focus of a horrific homicide case in 2021. He was a **father** – sources indicate he had at least two young sons, and possibly a third child – and was described by loved ones as a fun-loving person when sober. Johnson struggled with **substance addiction** and serious **mental health issues**, challenges that had contributed to periods of instability in his life. In the weeks leading up to his death, he had no permanent address and was reportedly **homeless**, having moved out of a relative's home in suburban Inver Grove Heights in June 2021.\n\nDespite his personal struggles, family and friends insist that Adam was a **caring father and friend** at heart. The mother of one of his children (who chose to go by \"JoJo\") said he \"would always try to have fun\" and was a valuable part of her family. She acknowledged Johnson had **multiple run-ins with law enforcement** during rough periods – likely minor offenses influenced by his mental health and addiction problems – but she firmly believed those past troubles were unrelated to his murder. Importantly, those close to Johnson say he had **no known enemies** and was not involved in gang activity or organized crime. In JoJo's words, \"This was not gang… not a drug cartel. This was somebody who knew him\" – suggesting that if someone wanted to harm Adam, it was likely personal. At the time of his death, a toxicology report showed Johnson was **sober**, despite his history of substance use, indicating he was not under the influence when the crime occurred.\n\n## Crime Details\n\n**Discovery of Remains:** Adam Johnson's dismembered body was discovered in mid-2021 through a series of grim finds around Minneapolis. Key events in the **timeline** include:\n\n1. **June 17, 2021 (Northeast Minneapolis):** A passerby called 911 after finding human body parts behind the Ukrainian American Community Center on Main Street NE. Additional remains – including sections of a leg visibly lying on a lawn – were located shortly afterward near the intersection of 3rd Ave NE and University Ave, just blocks away from the first site. These initial discoveries were in the St. Anthony West neighborhood of Northeast Minneapolis.\n2. **June 22, 2021 (West River Parkway):** Five days later, at about 6:45 a.m., a **severed head** was found placed on a public park bench along West River Parkway at East Franklin Ave, near the Mississippi River. Notably, a man had passed the same spot at 6:15 a.m. and saw nothing, indicating the head was **deliberately positioned in that half-hour window**. When discovered, the head was reportedly **frozen solid and beginning to thaw**, suggesting it had been stored in a freezer and then dumped at the scene.\n3. **July 4, 2021 (Mississippi River):** On Independence Day, more of Johnson's remains were recovered from the Mississippi River near the old Pillsbury mill at St. Anthony Main (across from downtown Minneapolis). This was the **fourth separate location** where parts of his body were found, completing most of the remains. Investigators indicated that even after this recovery, some body parts were still unaccounted for.\n\nAuthorities quickly confirmed all the scattered remains belonged to the same victim, identified as Adam R. Johnson. The Hennepin County Medical Examiner ruled Johnson's death a **homicide**. While specific cause of death has not been publicly released, police stated it was clear from the condition of the body that Johnson was killed and **dismembered post-mortem**. The crime's gruesome nature was underscored by a disturbing detail: a **word had been carved into the flesh** of one of the body parts. Family members later revealed that the word **\"PERV\" (short for \"pervert\") was etched into Johnson's forehead** – an apparent message from the killer. This mutilation and the fact that the head was kept frozen indicate a high degree of planning or premeditation by the perpetrator. Additionally, law enforcement disclosed that DNA evidence (not belonging to Adam) was recovered from under the victim's fingernails, which could mean Johnson **struggled against his attacker** and managed to scrape their skin or blood. Those DNA samples have been analyzed by the FBI in hopes of identifying a suspect. The FBI was also sent a **piece of Johnson's skull** for forensic examination, to glean any clues about the tools or methods used in the dismemberment.\n\nThe pattern of how the body was disposed – with parts **strategically scattered** across the city over a span of weeks – is highly unusual. Some remains were left in plain sight (e.g. a leg arranged outside a community center, and the head placed on a bench) as if on **display**, while others were dumped more covertly (in garbage bags or into the river). This mix of brazen public staging and hidden disposal added to the complexity of the investigation. Police noted from the start that they **had not recovered an entire body** initially and continued searching for missing parts. By late July 2021, with the recovery of the torso from the river, authorities had found remains at four locations and believed they had located most of Johnson's body. The final discovery of the torso seemed to mark the end of the grisly scavenger hunt for remains.\n\nForensic investigators have kept many details confidential, but the publicly known evidence paints a picture of a highly **organized and violent crime**. The killer's actions – freezing body parts, carving a derogatory word, and distributing remains in different areas – appear intended to **dehumanize the victim and possibly send a message**. Minneapolis police confirmed they are treating the case as a homicide (as opposed to any accident or self-harm) and from early on they theorized the attack was **focused (targeted) rather than random**. No similar cases were found in the region, indicating this was not part of any serial pattern or ongoing threat to the general public. Given the forensic evidence, investigators believe Johnson likely knew his killer, and that the crime was committed with considerable rage and planning. All of these details have guided the search for a motive and suspect.\n\n## Possible Motivations\n\nDetermining why someone would commit such an extreme act is a central question of this case. **Authorities have not announced an official motive**, but several possibilities have been considered based on the evidence and statements from family and police:\n\n- **Personal Vendetta or Revenge:** The **targeted nature** of the killing strongly suggests a personal motive. Police noted that the attack \"appeared to be very focused\" and not a random crime of opportunity. This implies the perpetrator had a specific grievance against Adam Johnson. The extraordinary violence – overkill manifested in dismemberment – often points to **extreme anger or hatred** toward the victim. One theory is that someone close to Johnson harbored a deep resentment (for example, over a perceived betrayal, debt, or interpersonal conflict) and exacted revenge in a gruesome fashion. The fact that the killer went beyond just killing – mutilating the body and defacing it – indicates a highly **personal rage** was at play. In interviews, Johnson's ex-partner JoJo speculated that perhaps Adam \"bugged the wrong person\" when asking for help or shelter, indicating a confrontation that turned deadly. However, she and other family members could not point to any specific enemy or conflict in his life that would predict this level of brutality.\n- **\"Perv\" Carving – Vigilante or Misguided Justice:** The decision to carve **\"PERV\"** into Johnson's forehead is a glaring clue to the killer's mindset. It suggests the murderer wanted to label or shame the victim with the accusation of being a \"pervert.\" This has fueled speculation that the crime was a form of **vigilante justice** – for instance, the killer might have believed (rightly or wrongly) that Johnson committed a sexual offense. One online theory posits that Johnson may have been killed by someone avenging a sexual assault or abuse, essentially acting as judge and executioner. It's important to note that **no evidence has surfaced that Johnson was involved in any sex crimes**, pedophilia, or similar behavior. His family adamantly denies the notion that he was a \"pervert\" and fears that this carved label was simply meant to tarnish his reputation after death. The vigilante theory remains unproven, but the killer clearly wanted the word \"PERV\" to be seen – perhaps to justify the crime in their own mind or to direct suspicion toward a false motive. Carving that word could also have been intended to humiliate Johnson publicly, underscoring how **personal and vindictive** the crime was.\n- **Psychological Gratification or Sadism:** Another possible motivation is that the perpetrator derived some kind of **perverse thrill or psychological gratification** from the act. The level of mutilation and staging (freezing the head and displaying it) indicates a degree of **sadism or psychopathy**. It's possible the killer enjoyed exerting power over the victim even after death, essentially \"posing\" the remains to shock the community. For such an individual, the murder could have been driven by a desire for domination and infamy rather than a specific personal grudge. However, this theory conflicts somewhat with the evidence that Johnson was likely chosen for a reason (since random serial killers typically don't leave explicit personal messages like name-calling). Investigators did check for any **broader pattern or serial links** and found none, which makes a roaming serial killer scenario less likely. If the motive was primarily psychological (e.g. the killer's own deranged fantasy), it still seems Johnson was *selected* as the victim for a purpose, not just a victim of chance. The crime's mix of organization and personal taunting suggests an offender with a disturbed psyche who also had a specific issue with Johnson.\n- **Misdirection or Other Motives:** It's worth considering that some elements of the crime might be **misdirection**. For example, carving \"PERV\" might have been done to throw investigators off or to tarnish the victim's image, rather than reflect the true motive. If the killer had a different reason to kill (robbery, jealousy, etc.), they may have staged the scene to look like a vigilante crime to avoid suspicion. So far, investigators have not publicly floated alternative motives. They have explicitly **ruled out gang involvement or drug cartel tactics**, as the crime does not fit those patterns and Johnson wasn't connected to such groups. In sum, the **leading hypotheses** center on a personal cause – whether it was revenge for an alleged offense, a crime of passion from a personal dispute, or the work of a dangerously disturbed individual who knew the victim. The presence of intense rage and the effort to degrade the victim (rather than conceal the body quietly) suggests the motive was deeply personal and filled with contempt.\n\n## Suspect Profile (Behavioral Analysis)\n\nWith no named suspect so far, investigators and experts have drawn on the case evidence to **infer the kind of person** who likely committed this crime. Based on what is known, a possible psychological and behavioral profile of the **unknown perpetrator** can be outlined:\n\n- **Someone in the Victim's Circle:** All signs point to the perpetrator being **personally acquainted** with Adam Johnson. There were no random aspects – Johnson was specifically targeted and lured or subdued without a public struggle. Forensic psychologist Dr. Michael Thompson, who examined the case details, believes the killer was \"someone who knew him\". Minneapolis Police also stated early on that the attack did not appear random, implying the victim was chosen deliberately. This suggests the suspect could be a **friend, acquaintance, or intimate partner** of Johnson's, or otherwise someone who had interacted with him (possibly a fellow transient individual, neighbor, or an ex-associate). Johnson's transient lifestyle put him in contact with various people for shelter and help; the perpetrator may have been one of those contacts whom Johnson approached for assistance, as JoJo theorized. Because there's no evidence of broader criminal enterprise involvement, the culprit is likely a **lone actor (or possibly a small group)** with a personal vendetta.\n- **Extreme Anger and \"Overkill\" Tendencies:** The manner of the murder indicates an **explosive level of rage**. Dr. Thompson noted that the crime shows signs of *\"extreme rage. A great deal of emotion went into the killing. But then killing wasn't enough.\"* In other words, the perpetrator didn't stop at causing Johnson's death – they went further to mutilate and desecrate the body. This kind of **overkill** is often driven by intense personal anger or hatred; it can be seen in crimes of passion or revenge, where the killer's emotions are profoundly involved. The carving of a slur (\"PERV\") into the victim's flesh is a glaring example of the killer's desire to **dehumanize and insult** Johnson even after death. Such behavior suggests the offender has a propensity for **violence and cruelty**, and was in a highly agitated emotional state during the crime. It's likely the killer felt justified or righteous in what they were doing – for example, believing the victim \"deserved\" punishment – which could stem from a warped moral reasoning (as in vigilante killers) or personal resentment. The ferocity also raises the possibility of **past violent behavior** or a history of uncontrolled anger in the suspect's background. An individual capable of this brutality may have exhibited red flags previously, such as domestic violence, cruelty to animals, or other aggressive acts (though no specific suspect has been identified to check against these traits).\n- **Calculated and Forensically Aware:** While fueled by rage, the perpetrator also showed a level of **planning and calculation**. The dismemberment itself suggests the killer had a private location and sufficient time to methodically cut apart the body. JoJo remarked that **\"they knew what they were doing. They knew how to do it\"**, indicating the cuts and dismemberment appeared non-spontaneous and possibly done with some skill. It is possible the killer has a background that made them comfortable with blood and anatomy (for example, experience with hunting, butchering animals, or medical knowledge), though that is speculative. The act of **freezing the head** demonstrates foresight – by preserving the head, the killer prevented rapid decomposition, which allowed them to display it days later in a recognizable state. This macabre decision could have been aimed at ensuring the victim's identity (and the carved message) would be easily seen by all, or simply to shock whoever found it. Additionally, the staggered dumping of body parts over two weeks indicates an **organized approach**: the killer may have been hoping to mislead investigators, delay a full identification, or create a dramatic effect. The perpetrator managed to avoid detection while placing remains in public areas, suggesting they conducted these actions during very early hours and possibly **scouted for the absence of surveillance cameras** (indeed, the security camera at the location of the first dump was not operational at the time). All this points to a person who is **cunning, careful, and remains calm enough** to execute a plan even after committing a rage-fueled murder. This blend of emotional fury and cold calculation is characteristic of someone with a potentially psychopathic or sociopathic personality profile.\n- **Need to Control the Narrative:** By leaving a message on the victim (literally carving \"PERV\") and by choosing the locations to deposit body parts, the killer exhibited a desire to **control how the crime was perceived**. This behavior can indicate a perpetrator who is **manipulative and attention-seeking**. They may have wanted the crime to send a specific message – perhaps to the community (\"there's a pervert among us\" scenario) or to the victim's family. Such killers sometimes take pride in their work and may even follow media coverage of the case closely, reveling in the alarm it causes. The boldness of leaving remains in public suggests the offender was not only trying to hide the body (in fact, they ensured it *would* be found), but also to **taunt law enforcement or the public**. This could mean the suspect has a certain level of confidence or even a feeling of superiority over authorities. However, it's also possible the killer was primarily focused on shaming the victim (for whatever perceived transgression) and wasn't concerned about getting caught, which might hint at an unstable mental state or an expectation of not being linked to the crime.\n\nOverall, the **unknown perpetrator** is profiled as a likely **male** (statistically, dismemberment homicides are overwhelmingly committed by men) who was **close to the victim**, harbored intense rage, and had the logistical capability to carry out a complex, gruesome crime. They possessed a disturbing mix of emotional fury and calculated forethought. Such an individual may have shown controlling or violent tendencies in other areas of life. Law enforcement have kept an eye out for anyone in Johnson's orbit who fits this profile – someone who suddenly left town, had unexplained injuries (since Johnson fought back and drew DNA), or who had made past threats against him. As of now, however, no suspect has been publicly identified, and the profile remains a tool to guide the investigation.\n\n## Investigation Status and Developments\n\nThe investigation into Adam Johnson's murder has been active since the day his remains were first found, but **progress has been slow and largely kept confidential**. Here is an overview of the case status and developments since 2021:\n\n- **Police and FBI Involvement:** The Minneapolis Police Department (MPD) immediately launched a homicide investigation in June 2021, calling the case \"very unusual\" given the nature of the crime. By that fall, the **FBI joined the investigation** to provide additional resources and forensic expertise. The FBI's involvement included specialized evidence analysis – for example, processing the DNA found on Johnson's body and examining the skull fragment in their lab. The collaboration between MPD and federal agents indicates the seriousness with which authorities are treating the case. Despite this, investigators have maintained a **tight lid on details**, citing the need to preserve the integrity of the case.\n- **Persons of Interest:** As of the latest updates, **no arrests have been made** and **no official suspects or persons of interest** have been publicly named. Police spokesman John Elder stated shortly after the murder that while there were \"some suspicions and evidence that look promising,\" the investigation would be painstaking and he did not anticipate quick results. This suggests detectives may have leads or theories they are pursuing quietly. They likely interviewed Johnson's family, friends, and known associates extensively. Some individuals may have been scrutinized (for instance, anyone who saw him in the \"second week of June\" when he was last seen alive, as noted on family flyers), but **authorities have not disclosed any key suspect**. The lack of an arrest after more than three years implies that the perpetrator either left very little traceable evidence beyond the DNA (which perhaps hasn't matched anyone in criminal databases) or that investigators are still working to build a circumstantial case strong enough to prosecute. MPD has emphasized that the case remains open and active. In public statements, police have refrained from sharing their working theories, which is common in an unsolved homicide to avoid tipping off the culprit.\n- **Evidence Processing:** Forensic evidence collected in this case has been crucial. The **DNA under Johnson's fingernails** was sent for analysis; if it yields a profile, it could be run through CODIS (the national DNA database) for any hits. As of the last update in late 2021, that DNA testing was underway. No announcement has been made about results, which likely means either the DNA did not match any known offender on record, or investigators are holding that information internally. The **murder weapon** and tools used for dismemberment have not been recovered or identified publicly. Given the nature of the dismemberment, the killer might have used common implements (such as a saw or large knives) that would be hard to trace. The FBI's examination of the skull fragment was possibly aimed at determining precise cut marks or trauma that could indicate what tools were used or the sequence of events. Any findings from those forensic analyses have not been released to the public. In short, there is forensic evidence (DNA, tool marks, etc.) that could eventually lead to a suspect, but as of now it has not cracked the case.\n- **Police Theories:** Officially, investigators have kept their theories close to the vest. Unofficially, clues from their comments show they are considering it a **targeted, personal crime**. Early on, MPD canvassed for surveillance video in the areas where remains were found, but notably one key camera was not working. Detectives likely reconstructed Johnson's final days – he was last confirmed alive in the **second week of June 2021** based on contacts with family and possibly sightings. They would have tried to pinpoint who he was with and where he was staying. Given the assumption that \"somebody who knew him\" did it, the pool of potential suspects includes acquaintances from the streets, shelters, or anyone he recently lived with. Investigators have not publicly discussed motive, but the **\"focused attack\"** and absence of similar cases means they aren't chasing a serial killer scenario. There were rumors in the community about a group of people being involved or witnesses to the crime, but police have not confirmed any such accounts. The case has been referred to as a \"complex investigation,\" and the lack of information suggests detectives are being meticulous. In a case like this, they would want to gather as much evidence as possible (DNA, digital data, witness statements) before moving on a suspect, since a prosecutorial win would require overcoming the fact there were no direct eyewitnesses to the killing that we know of.\n- **Family and Public Appeals:** Johnson's family has been proactive in seeking justice. They hired a **private investigator** to look into leads independently. They also set up a **GoFundMe reward fund** to encourage tips, supplementing the standard Crime Stoppers reward. Crime Stoppers of Minnesota initially offered $1,000 for information leading to an arrest, and the family added an additional $2,500 on their own. Flyers were distributed asking for any information about Adam's last movements (one poster noted \"Last seen alive 2nd week of June – Justice for Adam\" and provided tip line numbers). These efforts, along with media coverage, generated dozens of tips, according to police. Investigators have been following up on tips as they come, but as of the last official word, none had yet broken the case. Police continue to urge anyone with knowledge to come forward, underscoring that even small details could be crucial. The case remains classified as **unsolved**, but not closed.\n- **Current Status:** As of 2023/2024, there have been **no major public breakthroughs**. The Minneapolis Police Department has not issued new press releases on the Johnson case beyond the initial year, and no suspect has been publicly named or arrested. This homicide is considered **open and active**, meaning detectives will continue working it and checking new DNA databases or leads that arise. It stands as one of Minneapolis's most disturbing unsolved murders in recent memory. Johnson's mother, Lisa Sanchez, expressed frustration at the slow progress, but acknowledged that investigators had some \"promising\" leads they were pursuing, even if an arrest wasn't imminent. In cases like this, resolution can take time – sometimes a tip pans out years later, or a suspect's DNA might enter the system due to an unrelated crime and finally match the evidence. Until then, the community and Johnson's loved ones await justice.\n\n## Media Coverage and Public Speculation\n\nThe bizarre and gruesome nature of Adam Johnson's murder ensured it received considerable attention in local media and sparked widespread **public speculation**. From 2021 into subsequent years, the case has been a topic of discussion in news reports, online forums, and even true-crime outlets. Here are some key aspects of how the story has been portrayed and debated publicly:\n\n- **Extensive Local News Reporting:** Twin Cities news outlets provided detailed coverage of the case, especially in 2021 when the story unfolded. Outlets like Fox 9, KARE 11, and the Star Tribune ran updates as new body parts were found and as the victim was identified. The media reports highlighted the **shock and fear** in the community – finding dismembered remains in public places is extraordinarily rare, and Minneapolis residents were understandably alarmed. Journalists often used words like \"gruesome\" and \"disturbing\" to describe the case, and headlines noted the **mystery** of who could commit such a crime. Johnson's family members, including JoJo and his mother, spoke to reporters to humanize Adam beyond the gory headlines, sharing that he was \"a human being\" who mattered to them. Their interviews were emotional, with expressions of grief and pleas for anyone with information to help. For a time in mid-2021, this case was front-page news in Minneapolis. As months passed without an arrest, the frequency of news updates dwindled. By late 2021, local TV stations ran segments noting the case was **unsolved X months later**, and raising the question of whether a killer would ever be caught. The Star Tribune ran an article in July 2021 when the FBI got involved, emphasizing that the mystery continued and the family was desperate for answers.\n- **True Crime Community Interest:** The strangeness of the case (e.g. the frozen head with a message) caught the attention of true-crime websites, podcasts, and online communities far beyond Minnesota. On Reddit, for instance, threads in subforums like r/UnresolvedMysteries and r/Minneapolis dissected every known detail. Armchair detectives debated theories: one prevalent theory was that Johnson's killer was meting out vigilante justice for a sex crime, as inferred from the \"PERV\" carving. Another theory in these discussions was that the **\"PERV\" label was a red herring** – a calculated deflection by the killer to focus attention on a fake motive. Some commenters guessed the perpetrator could be someone with medical or butcher experience given the dismemberment, or that it might have been a group attack rather than a single killer (though no evidence has confirmed multiple people). The online discourse also touched on Johnson's background, with a few insensitive speculations about his lifestyle given the word carved on him. However, others who knew him or followed local news chimed in to reiterate that **Adam was not known to be a sexual predator**, cautioning against smearing a victim who cannot defend himself. In essence, the internet treated the case like a dark puzzle, with many trying to piece together motive and suspect from the sparse facts. To date, these discussions have remained speculative; no definitive suspect has been identified through amateur sleuthing.\n- **Focus on the \"PERV\" Inscription:** Both media and the public latched onto the striking detail of the carved insult. Because police were initially tight-lipped, it was actually Johnson's family who confirmed to KARE 11 that the word \"PERV\" had been carved into his forehead. This revelation led to a lot of soul-searching coverage about what kind of person would mutilate a body in that way. Some experts interviewed in media described it as an act of **\"overkill\" and dehumanization**, meant to degrade the victim and perhaps project the killer's own justification onto the crime. The sensational nature of this detail arguably overshadowed other aspects of the case in the public eye – it's a detail people remember. It raised the question: was Adam Johnson falsely labeled, or did the killer truly believe he was a \"pervert\"? Local talk radio shows and commentaries discussed how vigilantism can stem from unfounded rumors, and how unfair it is if an innocent (in that regard) was posthumously smeared. Police have not commented on any evidence regarding a potential sex-crime angle, leaving the \"PERV\" label as a grotesque mystery. Regardless, this facet of the case has kept it in public discourse because it is so unsettling.\n- **Comparison to Other Cases:** Minneapolis and the surrounding area have had very few crimes comparable to this one, but notably, in the years since, a couple of other **dismemberment cases** occurred in Minnesota (for example, a high-profile case where a man murdered and dismembered two ex-girlfriends, which was solved and the perpetrator convicted). Those cases, while also gruesome, were domestic in nature and did not involve public display of remains. The contrast has been noted in forums: the Johnson case stands out because of the **public staging and lack of resolution**. True crime bloggers and even a few YouTube documentary shorts have covered Adam's story, often labeling it as one of Minnesota's most bizarre unsolved murders. This outside attention keeps some pressure on the case. However, it can be a double-edged sword – along with genuine interest can come misinformation. Law enforcement has to sift through tips that might originate from speculative claims online.\n- **Family's Voice and Public Memory:** Through it all, Adam Johnson's family has tried to ensure that the public remembers he was a **person, not just a victim of a macabre crime**. JoJo and other family members have given interviews to keep the case alive in media, emphasizing that Adam was loved and that he **did not deserve the horrific end he met**. They have expressed frustration with the lack of answers but also gratitude for community support. The **GoFundMe \"Justice for Adam\"** and reward posters have circulated periodically on social media, especially around the anniversary of his death, to remind people that the case remains unsolved. In Minneapolis, the case occasionally resurfaces in news retrospectives about unsolved crimes. It is likely to remain in the public consciousness, fueled by both the empathy for the victim's family and the morbid curiosity such a rare crime generates.\n\n**Current Speculation:** As of now, public speculation continues, but **no concrete suspect or motive has been confirmed**. The most prevalent assumptions are that the killer knew Adam, acted out of extreme personal rage (possibly over a perceived sexual transgression), and carefully tried to control the narrative of the crime. Some observers have theorized that the perpetrator might eventually **brag or slip up**, given the brazen nature of the act – a personality that bold might find it hard to stay completely quiet. Tips have trickled in as recently as late 2022 via Crime Stoppers, according to family, but nothing has broken the case open. The community remains eager for resolution. Until an arrest is made, the murder of Adam Johnson stands as a chilling whodunit, and the question \"**Who killed Adam Johnson and why?**\" continues to haunt both his loved ones and all who have followed this tragic story.\n\nUltimately, the hope is that with continuing investigative work – and perhaps advancements like genealogy DNA matching or someone coming forward – this case will be solved and the **killer brought to justice**, providing answers for Adam's family and a measure of safety restored for the community.\n\n\n\n## Sources\n- https://www.fox9.com/news/family-of-victim-shocked-and-dismayed-after-dismembered-man-found-in-minneapolis#:~:text=%22He%20would%20always%20,said%20JoJo\n- (continued in a comment due to post length restrictions)",

      "title": "Eric Cheeks vanished after a party in West Virginia. A year later, a lost hiker found his remains on the Appalachian Trail. His death remains unexplained.",
      "text": "Eric Cheeks, a 19-year-old from Jefferson County, West Virginia, disappeared in April 2000 after attending a party with friends. One year later, his skeletal remains were found 300 feet off the Appalachian Trail. The cause of death is still undetermined, and no arrests have ever been made.\n\n# Who Was Eric Cheeks?\n\nEric Grant Cheeks, known affectionately as “Spud,” was a quiet, kind-hearted 19-year-old from Harpers Ferry, West Virginia. He lived with his parents, Roy and Donna Cheeks, in the Keyes Ferry Acres subdivision on Blue Ridge Mountain. A 1998 graduate of Jefferson High School, Eric worked at a urethane manufacturing company in Purcellville, Virginia, and helped coach youth football with his dad. He was close with his family and unsure of his future, much like many young adults.\n\n>“We are blessed to have had you in our lives, if only for a short time. The memories remain forever.” — Roy and Donna Cheeks\n\n# The Night He Disappeared\n\nOn Friday, April 21, 2000, Eric went to a party on Cave Road near Charles Town. Witnesses said he had a bottle of vodka, which deeply disturbed his family. “How does a 19-year-old get a fifth of vodka?” his father later asked.\n\nAt some point during the night, Eric became upset. Witnesses said he left the party with four other individuals. Some say he asked to be dropped off a mile from home. Others believe he may have been forced out. His family thinks the latter is more likely, pointing to an injured leg that would have made walking difficult.\n\nEric never came home. His parents immediately began searching the area on foot and with help from volunteers. Police brought in dogs, but no trace was found.\n\n>“Booze will do strange things to a person. But I know my son.” — Roy Cheeks\n\n# The Discovery of His Remains\n\nExactly one year later, on April 22, 2001, a hiker who had strayed from the Appalachian Trail found skeletal remains near the West Virginia–Virginia border. The hiker, disoriented, had gone off course and stumbled upon the body in a remote, wooded area 300 feet from the trail. The location was inaccessible by car and reportedly reachable only by four-wheel-drive followed by a hike.\n\nWith the remains were personal items: Eric’s wallet, driver’s license, pager, credit card, and necklace. Dental records confirmed the body was his.\n\nJurisdiction was briefly in question due to the site’s proximity to the state line, but it was ultimately determined to be in West Virginia. The West Virginia State Police took the lead.\n\n# The Investigation and Inconsistencies\n\nDespite identifying the remains, authorities were unable to determine a cause of death. There were no signs of trauma or injuries. Toxicology tests were attempted, but decomposition rendered them inconclusive. Police labeled the case suspicious but never officially declared it a homicide.\n\nWitness accounts remained inconsistent. Most agreed Eric left the party with others, but they disagreed on what happened next. A man on Hostler Road claimed Eric came to his house to use the phone. He provided a detailed description, but no phone records supported the claim. Months earlier, an anonymous tip had also pointed police to a man in the same area, but he denied involvement.\n\nThe confusion over Eric’s final moments only added to his family’s grief.\n\n# Was It an Accident?\n\nOne theory suggests Eric may have tried to walk home via the Appalachian Trail. His house was nearby, and he may have believed the trail would lead him there. However, the weather that night was cold and windy, and Eric was not dressed appropriately. He may have become disoriented or hypothermic, wandered off-trail, and died of exposure.\n\nStill, his family is skeptical. Eric hated walking and had a hurt leg. They believe something happened to him, possibly at the party, that others have been afraid to talk about.\n\n# Other Cases in the Area\n\nEric’s discovery came just weeks before two other major finds in the same region:\n\n* **Susan Capino**, 17, a Jefferson High School student who had been missing since 1997, was found dead in June 2001 in a wooded area of Blue Ridge Mountain. Her death was declared a homicide and remains unsolved.\n* **Patrick Hornbaker**, 32, was found shot in a nearby home. Two men were eventually convicted in his murder.\n\nAuthorities have said there is no known connection between the cases.\n\n# Final Thoughts\n\nEric’s family still seeks answers. No one has ever been charged or officially named a suspect. His sister, Marcia, wrote:\n\n>“We try to remember the smile on your face—the love in our hearts is your mark on this place. We will always miss you and wish you were here.

      "title": "On This Day (2003): Blue Skies, Black Death: The Mysterious Death of Stephen Hilder",
      "text": "In the tight-knit, trust-driven world of skydiving, accidents are expected—but nobody expects murder.\n\nOn 4 July 2003, 20-year-old cadet and skydiver Stephen Hilder fell to his death during a parachuting competition at Hibaldstow Airfield in the UK. At first, it seemed like a tragic accident—a double parachute failure. But what investigators discovered shook the skydiving world to its core: someone had sabotaged his gear.\n\nStephen was a passionate and skilled jumper with over 300 jumps under his belt. He was in his first year at the Royal Military College of Science and had teamed up with friends David Mason and Adrian Blair for the British Collegiate Parachute Nationals. They were known as “Black Rain” and had recently placed in earlier competitions.\n\nThe trio was in high spirits when they arrived at the dropzone. Despite bad weather delaying jumps, the mood was upbeat. On the evening of July 3rd, a themed fancy dress party took place. Stephen, dressed in a thrifted leather mini dress, sang Bon Jovi karaoke and partied with his teammates into the early hours.\n\nThe next day, the skies cleared enough for competition to resume. Black Rain performed what would become their best jump ever, earning 19 points—likely a winning score. But when it came time to deploy parachutes, only two canopies appeared in the sky.\n\nStephen’s didn’t.\n\nInstead, one skydiver remembered seeing a stray bundle of white fabric falling. That was Stephen’s reserve chute—detached and drifting. On the ground, instructors initially thought someone had landed off-course. But when a reserve parachute was recovered with no person attached, they knew something was horribly wrong.\n\nStephen’s body was found in a cornfield. Neither his main nor reserve parachutes had functioned. Skydiving experts soon confirmed the unthinkable: the risers of his reserve parachute had been deliberately slashed, and the bridle cord that links the pilot chute to the main parachute pin had been cut and tucked back into place. The sabotage had been executed with intimate knowledge of skydiving gear and concealed in a way that would pass all routine gear checks. Whoever did this knew exactly what they were doing. Once he exited the aircraft, Stephen had no chance of survival.\n\nPolice declared the dropzone a crime scene. DNA was taken from every person there—over 90 individuals. Hook knives, commonly carried by skydivers, were collected as potential murder weapons. Despite the massive investigation, no clear suspect emerged.\n\nStephen’s teammates, Mason and Blair, were eventually arrested and questioned but released without charges. A third man, connected to a Leeds University skydiving club, was also arrested later, but again no charges were filed. All were eventually cleared.\n\nMonths passed. Police considered everything—from love triangles to pranks gone wrong. But no clear motive could be found. Similar occurrences overseas were investigated. Then, investigators shifted focus: what if Stephen had sabotaged his own gear?\n\nThe theory was controversial. Police found fibres from the slashed risers on his clothes and a pair of scissors with his DNA in the locked trunk of his car. He had once joked about skydiving being a good way to die, and he was under stress—facing academic struggles, debt, and a cooling relationship.\n\nBut those who knew him weren’t convinced. He had made future plans, performed normal pre-jump checks, and tried to deploy both his parachutes. There were plausible explanations for the location of the fibres. Suicide by staged sabotage seemed out of character and implausibly complex. It would also have meant implicating his closest friends.\n\nIn March 2005, nearly two years after his death, a coroner returned an open verdict: not enough evidence to declare it suicide or murder.\n\nThe case remains unsolved. The skydiving community, still haunted by the breach of trust, largely rejects the suicide theory. And many believe the real culprit may still be out there.\n\n**Sources:**\n\nBook: [Mishap or Murder?](https://www.amazon.com/Mishap-Murder-Mysterious-Deaths-Disappearances/dp/06488)\n\nWikipedia: [Death of Stephen Hilder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_of_Stephen_Hilder)\n\nCasefile: [Episode 88](https://casefilepodcast.com/case-88-stephen-hilder/)\n\nGuardian article: [The Man Who Fell to Earth](https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2003/oct/05/features.sportmonthly)\n\nDocumentary: [Real Crime: Sky Diver Murder or Suicide?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ISnSp-IcEA)",

      "title": "Keeslyn Noelle Roberts, missing since 1/18/2020, Caleb Smith found deceased. Both went missing from same location only 2 days apart. more below. ",
      "text": "Before I get into this, I first want to say that I have no affiliation with any law enforcement, investigative or government agency whatsoever. I do not know either of the victims or their families.  I’m simply a parent of several kids, that is trying to help other parents find answers. This is going to be a long post.\n\nThese two cases occur within the same time frame and involve the same location. It has been stated by officials that these two cases are not connected, so I will cover them independently.\n\nThe intent with making this post is to spread awareness about both cases, and hopefully spark new interest. Someone out there has information regarding one or both cases, and the families of both victims deserve some closure and/or answers.\n\nAll the information within this post was taken from interviews of Keeslyn’s family, and/or a reporter who has worked with the families since the cases began. I will provide links to any articles/videos used to gather information as well.\n\n**Caleb Nathaniel Smith --**\n\nOn January 16, 2020, Caleb Nathaniel Smith (21/Male) of Chatsworth, GA was planning to visit some friends in the nearby city of Rome, GA. Caleb had told his grandmother prior to leaving to leave the deadbolt unlocked because he had planned on returning home that night.    He stopped for fuel along the way at a Flying J in Resaca, GA, located at 288 Resaca Beach Blvd in Gordon County, Georgia. It’s important for both cases to note that this Flying-J had a Denny’s restaurant attached to it with a dining room connected to store area of the Flying-J. Also worth noting, this Flying-J/Denny's is a truck stop right off exit 320 on I-75. There is always traffic in and out, at all hours between regular customers and truck drivers.\n\nAt 12:32AM (January 16, 2020 – shortly after midnight)  CCTV footage shows a lone male seated at a dining table within the Denny’s. Caleb enters the Denny’s dining area and seats himself at a nearby table facing the lone male. A few moments later Caleb calls his grandmother to let her know where he is, and that he didn’t have enough gas to make it to Rome. He also informs her that he is going to ask the lone man in the dining area if he could have $5 for gas.  Caleb gets up and talks to the man on two separate occasions. It is unknown if this man gives Caleb money for gas. After the second interaction, Caleb goes back to his table and sits down facing the man again. He then gets up and leaves the gas station never to be seen alive again.\n\nLater that morning (still January 16, 2020) Caleb’s grandmother, worried by him not returning home, drove to the Flying-J. Upon arriving she noticed Caleb’s car backed into a parking spot on the backside of the Denny’s restaurant, out of sight of any cameras. She found that Caleb’s car was unlocked. Inside his car, his keys were found on the floorboard, his cell phone was in the glove box with the battery removed and the vehicle had roughly a half a tank of gas. If you remember, he had called his grandmother and stated that he did not have enough gas for his trip and intended to ask the lone male for gas money. His jacket was also in his vehicle. Weather records state that the temperature around the time of his arrival at the Denny’s was in the low 60s, but had dipped into the 40s in the days prior.\n\nAfter locating his vehicle but not finding Caleb, his family reported him missing. Gordon County Sheriff’s Office states that on January 16 and January 17^(th), 2020, deputies searched areas around the Flying-J truck stop both on ground and in the air with no results. Officials did not process Caleb’s car for evidence.\n\nOn February 3^(rd), 2020 Caleb’s nude body was found 5 miles away from the Flying-J in a marshy overgrown area between the Sugar Valley and Hill City communities. According to the Sheriff’s Office a citizen had found him in a “poorly drained, heavily overgrown area.” Earlier that day, coincidentally, the fire department had been dispatched to the same general area in reference to a brush fire.\n\nThe initial report stated no immediate indications of violence were apparent. The GBI autopsy revealed no evidence of violence or foul play. Toxicology results showed he died from methamphetamine intoxication, and his death was ruled accidental.\n\nSeveral shoe prints were found around Caleb’s body, yet Caleb was found completely nude without shoes or socks on, to add to that, the bottom of his feet were clean showing no mud or dirt as you would expect from someone walking in a marshy area barefoot. His family was not allowed to identify the body, and his clothes were never recovered.\n\nCaleb’s case was closed. The family does not agree with the findings.\n\n \n\n**Keeslyn Noelle Roberts –**\n\nThere are some discrepancies in this case. I’ve done what I believe is due diligence in only providing information given by Keeslyn’s parents and their trusted reporter, as I feel they know this case better than anyone. Also, with this being an active case my Open Records Request to the GBI was denied.\n\nOn January 17, 2020 Keeslyn Noelle Roberts (20/Female) was scheduled to attend a probation meeting with the Whitfield County Sheriff’s Office in relation to charges she received in 2018. She failed to appear for her meeting.\n\nOn January 18, 2020,  Keeslyn was taking a friend (whose name I will omit, but can be found through research) to work at the Denny’s restaurant attached to the Flying-J in Resaca, GA. She dropped this friend off for work around 7pm with the intent to take them back home after they got off work at 10pm. This friend gets off work at 10pm and goes outside and sees Keeslyn’s car parked in the parking lot. According to Keeslyn’s father, Eric, this friend then calls Keeslyn and talks to her on the phone at which point she says “I’ll be back in a few”.\n\nBetween 11pm on the 18^(th) and midnight, Keeslyn enters an employee only area of the Denny’s. An employee confronts Keeslyn and informs her that she is not allowed to be in that area. According to reports, an “altercation” followed, which prompted the employee to call local authorities. It was reported that Gordon County Sheriff’s Office had been dispatched to the Denny’s in reference to a suspicious female. Keeslyn fled before law enforcement could arrive, dropping her backpack as she exited the restricted area.\n\nThe backpack she dropped contained her car keys, wallet, her ID, debit card, cash, phone charger, and some clothing.  This is believed to be the last confirmed sighting of Keeslyn Noelle Roberts\\*.\n\nOn January 20, 2020, Keeslyn’s probation officer calls her father Eric and informs him that Keeslyn had missed her meeting. At this point Eric and Keeslyn’s mother, Shannon, had not heard from Keeslyn in a few days, which was abnormal according to the parents. Eric goes to Keeslyn’s boyfriend’s house where she had been staying at the time and asked him if he had seen Keeslyn or talked to her. As Eric started to leave the boyfriend’s property, the boyfriend informed Eric that Keeslyn’s car was parked at the Flying-J but he was not sure where Keeslyn was. Eric then goes to the Flying-J and locates Keeslyn’s car. Inside the car he finds some of her belongings, with the exception of some clothing.\n\nEric calls to report his daughter missing. Two Gordon County Sheriff’s Deputies arrive on scene and inform Eric that he must report her missing to the Murray County Sheriff's Office, as she was a resident of Murray County. Eric stated that there was no search done by the two responding deputies from Gordon County.  Eric does report his daughter missing to the Murray County Sheriff's Office, as directed by Gordon County Deputies. According to Eric, it takes 5 days for his daughter’s case to be passed to a detective. In this span of 5 days, there had been no searches done for Keeslyn, no one had been questioned and the Flying-J had not been investigated in any manner, nothing had been done. Eric also states that Keeslyn’s car was never processed for any form of evidence.\n\nAround 45 days after her disappearance, the family gets a tip from a Flying-J/Denny’s employee stating that there are some clothes near a dumpster. Eric and Shannon travel to the location and find that there are in fact some clothes under a bush, behind a dumpster. The specifics of the items found were not detailed, but Shannon confirmed that a shirt that was found did belong to Keeslyn.\n\nThe parents called local authorities to the scene once more. The authorities bag the items as evidence but tell the parents that they cannot send the items off for DNA analysis or any other kind of testing, as no crime had been committed.\n\nAs time passed Keeslyn’s parents continued their search as much as possible. They searched the area where the body of Caleb Smith was found to rule that out, with no success. At some point (exact timing unknown), the GBI gets involved in the case.\n\nAn important piece of evidence that this case is lacking is Keeslyn’s cell phone. It has never been recovered. According to the parents, local authorities have not tried to request her phone records. The phone was pinged (date of ping unknown), but the last known location of the phone was at the Flying-J around 11pm on the 18^(th). Her parents have looked through her social media that they were able to get access to, but have been unable to gain or be granted access to her text messages. Her father states that her number has since been recirculated by the provider and no longer belongs to Keeslyn.\n\nOne discrepancy in this case that I consider to be a potentially major discrepancy, are the dates listed by NAMUS and the GBI.\n\nPer the NAMUS website, Keeslyn Roberts’ last date of contact was 1/18/2020, with her vehicle being recovered/located on 1/20/2020, which aligns with numerous other reports about the case as well as all statements made by her parents. However, the GBI website reports a last seen date of 1/28/2020. Perhaps this is a data entry error on the GBI’s part, or maybe there is much more information than being made available to the public.\n\nAlso worth noting, when Eric recovered Keeslyn’s vehicle, he noticed that the driver’s seat had been moved farther away from the steering wheel than where Keeslyn would have had it, as if someone much taller than Keeslyn had been in the driver’s seat.\n\n  Additionally, Keeslyn’s car was found backed into a parking spot (which is something she would not have done according to Eric)  within 5 spaces from where Caleb Smith’s vehicle was also backed in. Keeslyn Roberts and Caleb Smith both went missing from the same exact location, only 2 days apart. Authorities say there is no evidence to suggest that the two knew each other and the cases are not connected or related.\n\n SUMMARY TO APPEASE THE MODGODS: Both victims went missing from the same location within 2 days of each other. One case has been closed, the other remains open and location of the victim is unknown. Do you or someone you know have any information regarding either case?\n\nThough Caleb’s body was found, Keeslyn Roberts is still missing.

      "text": "On the evening of May 31, 1997, 15-year-old Vanessa Dawn Smith left her family’s residence on Winton Way in rural Winton, California at approximately 7:00 p.m. for her routine walk through the neighborhood. It was a walk she typically took with her mother — but that evening, Vanessa went alone. She never returned and has not been heard from since.\n\nLater that evening, Vanessa’s walking stick was found along the side of Mercedes Avenue, approximately 200 yards east of her home, and along her regular route. There were no signs of struggle or a trace of Vanessa at the scene.\n\nNotably, Vanessa left her purse (which contained her savings) and a sentimental watch at home — items she was very attached to. She was described as close to her family, had no history of running away, and was an active member of a Mennonite church.\n\nAuthorities have stated they do not believe she left voluntarily, and her case has remained cold and unsolved for over 27 years.\n\nIf you're familiar with the area, or have thoughts on what may have happened to Vanessa that night, do share.

      "title": "Robert Levinson: Retired Federal Agent Who Went Missing in 2007",
      "text": "Robert Levinson, who was born in Flushing, NY in 1948, had served as a loyal federal agent for twenty-eight years, first for the DEA and then the FBI, before retiring from public service in 1998 and opening his own small private-detective agency. In 2007, while on a business-trip to Kish Island, he went missing and was never again located by his family-members or friends. Kish Island was an island under the jurisdiction of Iran. Since that time his case has garnered significant public attention and has been a recurring item of discussion in the context of American–Iranian relations. Numerous officials on both the American and Iranian side have commented on the case and resolved to find out what happened, but to this day, the whereabouts of Levinson and whether or not he is still alive remain totally unknown. Moreover, some of the details of the case are highly baffling, and lead one to wonder how such a situation could even arise in the modern world.\n\nA few years after the disappearance, Levinson's family-members were given an annuity worth 2.5 million USD by the CIA in exchange for not proceeding with a lawsuit against the agency. In 2020, during the COVID pandemic, a federal court ordered that an additional 1.4 billion (yes, billion) USD be paid to the family out of frozen Iranian assets. That was also the point at which the legal system finally declared Levinson to be \"dead in absentia\" (legally dead). The United States Department of State maintains a 20 million USD reward for information regarding Levinson. Also in 2020, President Trump reiterated the United States government's demand for answers. So how was this situation brought about?\n\nKish Island was, and still is, a resort-island governed by Iran which allows visa-free entry for Americans and citizens of other Western countries. It was part of an attempt by Iran to create a sort of international commercial zone similar to Hong Kong or Singapore, and it had grown to the status of a regional economic hub, but there were also allegations that the island was a haven of organized crime. Despite speaking about his trip to Kish Island as an investigation into cigarette-smuggling, the fact was confirmed after Levinson's disappearance that he was, in fact, working on behalf of the CIA. There was an American citizen named Dawud Salahuddin who had converted to Islam and defected to Iran, but who had indicated dissatisfaction with the Iranian regime, and was possibly willing to provide valuable information about Iran to the United States government. Levinson was sent to Kish Island in order to meet with Salahuddin at the Hotel Maryam. Following Levinson's disappearance, Salahuddin released a statement saying that the meeting took place as intended, but that the two of them were arrested shortly afterward by the Iranian government. The next day, Salahuddin was released while Levinson remained in custody. Three weeks after Levinson's disappearance, Press TV, a television-station operated by the Iranian government, reported that Levinson had been taken into custody by the Iranian authorities but was expected to be released shortly.\n\nThe fact of an American operative being arrested in Iran is not by itself too enigmatic, but one of the strange elements of this case is that, with the exception of the Press TV report, the Iranian government has spent eighteen years repeatedly denying that it had taken Levinson into custody, or that it knows Levinson's whereabouts. Even though Levinson vanished on Iranian soil, the Iranian government claims innocence and has made several apparent statements of good faith saying that it wishes to cooperate with the United States and to find the truth of what happened.\n\nEven more strangely, in late 2010, three years after the disappearance, Levinson's family received a video showing Levinson alive but in poor health, being kept in some sort of holding facility. A few months later, the family received several photographs of Levinson. The materials were sent through emails in an anonymous and untraceable manner. The Iranian government denies sending the materials. **EDIT. According to the Unresolved Podcast, the initial email contained a demand for the United States government to release a list of prisoners, but the names did not match any known persons.**\n\nFor over forty years, Salahuddin has been a wanted fugitive in the eyes of the United States government owing to his murder of an Iranian dissident in Maryland prior to his defection to Iran. Since that time, being a media-figure in Iran of some visibility, he has openly admitted to committing the murder and proudly stands by his actions. Within Iran he has worked as an English teacher, freelance-writer, and television-editor, making use of his native proficiency in English. He is married to an Iranian woman, and by all accounts he continues to reside in Tehran happily to this day.\n\nIn the wake of the Israel–Iran War and renewed negotiations between Iran and the United States, the matter of Levinson is likely to be mentioned once more at the negotiating table. As recently as 21 June 2025, the children of Levinson have spoken to the media asking President Trump for further investigation into the matter. In the period since Levinson's disappearance, several American citizens who were taken hostage by Iran such as Siamak Namazi, Emad Shargi and Morad Tahbaz have been freed, but the Iranian government continues to deny that Levinson was ever taken by them in the first place.\n\n### Questions for Discussion\n\n* How certain can we be, absent of the admission of the Iranian government, that Levinson is, or was, in fact, taken hostage by them?\n* Is there any possible motive for the Iranians refusing to acknowledge that they have, or had, custody of Robert Levinson, even while admitting their captivity of other American citizens and eventually freeing them?\n* Is there any good explanation for why the video and photographs of Robert Levinson in captivity were anonymously sent to his family-members?\n\n### Sources\n\n* https://apnews.com/article/ee9eb08ce68c4f6ab6dba43da5cc398d\n* https://www.upi.com/Top_News/US/2017/03/22/Family-of-CIA-consultant-missing-10-years-sues-Iran/9041490183573/\n* https://www.cnn.com/2017/03/22/politics/robert-levinson-family-sues-iran/\n* https://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/14/world/middleeast/a-disappearing-american-spy-and-the-cia.html\n* https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/ex-fbi-agent-who-went-missing-in-iran-was-on-rogue-mission-for-cia/2013/12/12/f5de6084-637b-11e3-a373-0f9f2d1c2b61_story.html\n* https://www.cnn.com/2016/08/03/politics/us-sends-plane-iran-400-million-cash/index.html\n* https://www.cnn.com/2016/01/18/opinions/moriarty-levinson-family/index.html\n* https://www.upi.com/Top_News/US/2024/03/08/fbi-anniversary-robert-lvenison-detained-iran/4591709920992/\n* https://apnews.com/article/fbi-robert-levinson-iran-trump-fbe54def70bc9114bb52348153bc4cc5",

      "title": "On January 24, 2020, a 32-year-old Mississippian with health issues and a fear of the dark went missing after leaving home at dusk without her medication. Where is Rebecca Reid?",
      "text": "Rebecca Lee Reid, born on May 1, 1987, was a 32-year-old known for her kindness, faith, and gentle spirit. Standing 5’7” and weighing around 325 pounds, she was known in Pearl River County for her black hair, brown eyes, distinctive glasses, radiant presence, and talent for reciting entire Bible passages.\n\nDespite her bright personality, Rebecca battled severe diabetes, asthma, and hypertension, requiring multiple medications. Her mental health issues left her with a juvenile mindset, increasing her vulnerability. Her fear of the dark kept her from walking alone at night, making her early evening disappearance all the more puzzling.\n\nOn January 24, 2020, around 4:00 p.m., Rebecca returned home to the 200 block of Leetown Road in Lumberton to turn off a boiling pot before her sister, Vada, left for work. This was her last confirmed sighting. Her family initially believed she’d intended to walk about a mile and a half along a nearby wooded trail to her father’s farm. She’d never taken this route before, but someone had shown it to her earlier that day. Vada doubts Rebecca, given her frail health and the fading light, would have undertaken such a journey alone. Rebecca’s father, upon returning from his shift to find her missing, called Vada. \n\nRebecca’s glasses, Bible, mother’s necklace, medication, and the boiling pot remained at her home, indicating she didn’t leave voluntarily. Over two hundred volunteers — including horses, drones, and dogs — searched the 1,500-acre woods for Rebecca, feared disoriented or injured en route to her father’s farm, but she wasn’t found. Witnesses reported seeing her near a white SUV, possibly a Chevrolet Trailblazer, on Leetown Road, but authorities found no confirmed link. Her family suspects she was abducted by someone she knew or trusted, as her fears and mental health issues would have prevented her from willingly approaching strangers or entering their vehicles. \n\nDespite a Silver Alert, flyers, media coverage, family efforts, interviews, advanced technology, travel, and increased rewards, Rebecca remains missing. Though hope endures with each tip and sighting, the ache of uncertainty persists. Rebecca’s yearning family urges anyone with even minor information to kindly come forward.\n\nETA: Thank you to u/lannett for insightfully noting that a pastor’s wife was questioned about Rebecca’s disappearance but isn’t a suspect. Vada said Rebecca granted her access to her bank account for disability and Social Security payments, but it hasn’t been used since Rebecca went missing. The pastor’s wife told investigators she was with a relative at the time and denies any involvement. Although she has been questioned, no church members, including her, have been identified as suspects.\n\n___\nThank you all for your engagement and inquiries regarding this case! Feel free to ask more; here are the current Q&As:\n* Who started boiling the pot?\n\nMy sources don’t specify.\n\n* Why *was* there a boiling pot?\n\nMy sources are unclear, but u/Internal_District_72 suggested Rebecca or Vada might have been boiling water for sweet tea to steep and cool.\n\n* Where was Rebecca coming from when she turned off the boiling pot?\n\nMy sources don’t clarify.\n\n* Why did Rebecca turn off the boiling pot instead of Vada?\n\nMy sources don’t confirm, but perhaps Rebecca, knowing Vada had to leave soon, chose to do so out of consideration.\n\n* Were nearby water bodies inspected?\n\nAlthough the case files lack details on specific water bodies, law enforcement extensively searched the 1,500-acre area using drones, ATVs, dogs, and hundreds of volunteers. Given this extensive effort, it’s unlikely any major water bodies within the primary grid were overlooked.\n\n* If Rebecca had died in the woods, wouldn’t there have been a strong odor?\n\nScavengers can disarticulate and scatter remains within days, dispersing odors beyond detection, while the cold late-January temperatures would have slowed decomposition.\n\n* Who showed Rebecca the new trail to her father’s farm?\n\nMy sources don’t specify — only that Rebecca’s cousin, Katie Cooley, claimed *someone* did.\n\n* How does Rebecca’s fear of the dark relate to her disappearance if it wasn’t dark when she went missing?\n\nThe real issue isn’t Rebecca going missing in daylight, but that the dusk transition in the unfamiliar forest likely distressed her.\n\n* If Rebecca needed financial help, wouldn’t a relative be a more logical choice than the pastor’s wife?\n\nAlthough not explicitly stated, Rebecca’s strong religiosity and intellectual disabilities may have led her to prioritize perceived spiritual authority over family bonds in her trust hierarchy.\n___\n*If you have any information about Rebecca Lee Reid’s disappearance, contact Mississippi Coast Crime Stoppers at 877-787-5898, Pearl River County Sheriff’s Department at 601-798-5528, or submit an anonymous tip via [P3 Tips](https://www.p3tips.com/Drill.aspx).*\n___\n* [Rebecca Lee Reid](https://charleyproject.org/case/rebecca-lee-reid)\n* [Cold Case: WLOX Investigates the Disappearance of Rebecca Reid](https://www.wlox.com/2023/04/13/cold-case-wlox-investigates-disappearance-rebecca-reid/?outputType=amp)\n* [MBI Investigating Disappearance of 32-Year-Old Pearl River Co.

      "title": "What do you think really happanned in Hinterkeifeck in March-April 1922? Especially interested in the replies from Germans and, of course, Bavarians.",
      "text": "I have been reading about the Hinterkaifeck murders for years, and the more I revisit the case, the less it feels like a crime and the more it resembles a haunting. For those unfamiliar, this happened in April 1922, in a remote Bavarian farmstead. Six people were murdered: Andreas Gruber, his wife, their widowed daughter Viktoria, her two children, and the maid who had just started working there. Most of them were lured one by one into the barn and killed with a mattock. The killer then entered the house and murdered the remaining two victims.\n\nThere was no theft. There was no escape. There was no clear motive. Only silence, blood, and something that still feels far more terrifying than any logical explanation.\n\nWhat unsettles me most is what happened after the murders. The killer stayed on the farm for days. He fed the animals. He cooked meals. He slept in the house. He walked through the rooms as if he belonged there. He moved like someone who had always been there, someone who knew the family, someone who felt entitled to the space. It did not feel like the actions of a person in flight. It felt like something had emerged from the walls, done what it came to do, and settled in for a while.\n\nAnd then he disappeared.\n\nOf course, I do not literally believe that the killer was something supernatural. But the nature of the crime feels absolutely unnatural. It feels demonic. Not in the Hollywood sense, but in the way the entire scene was too calm, too intentional, too impossible to explain. Whoever did this did not panic. They waited, they listened, they acted with complete control. And then they left no trace.\n\nThe family had been hearing noises in the attic in the days before. One of their house keys went missing. Unknown footprints appeared in the snow, leading toward the house but never leaving it. A newspaper was found inside the home that no one in the family had subscribed to. The previous maid had quit her job, claiming the house was cursed or haunted. It was as if someone had been watching for a long time. Then they struck.\n\nAnd still, no one saw a thing. No one reported anything suspicious. The village was small, incredibly small, the kind of place where you cannot leave your house without three people noticing your direction and mood. And yet this person came and went like a shadow.\n\nMany people online like to pin it on Lorenz Schlittenbauer, but I really do not believe it was him. First, this was a tiny village. If he had done it, the locals would have known. He was already ostracised just for seeming off when the bodies were discovered. Second, Andreas Gruber, who was supposedly Lorenz's primary enemy, died far less brutally than the others. If this were a revenge killing, you would expect the opposite. Third, Schlittenbauer was a well-off local landowner. He had a reputation to maintain and never demonstrated disturbing behaviour before or after. Fourth, he had asthma, and in the 1920s, that was not something you could ignore or manage easily. Finally, and most importantly, why would he do it? Why would he kill an entire family, hide in the attic before the murders, stay in the house afterwards, feed animals, and then leave with nothing? What purpose would that serve?\n\nNone of it adds up.\n\nThis is why I am writing here. I am not looking for drama or wild speculation. I want to ask a more grounded question, especially to people from Bavaria or with family roots in the region. Are there still rumours about Hinterkaifeck? Are there stories that never made it into the official files? Did your grandparents or relatives ever mention it? Did they avoid it? Did they know something but refuse to say it out loud?\n\nI know there is a German documentary with people who were alive back in 1922 on the case, but it is apparently very difficult to understand, even for native German speakers who are not from Bavaria. The dialect is too thick. I do not have the linguistic energy to decipher it. There is also an online massive wiki-style archive filled with original documents, testimonies, and scans. I love working with primary sources, but honestly, this is a full-time project in itself. If anyone wants to go down that rabbit hole, the resources are there, and I admire your willpower. But what I am really looking for right now is human memory.\n\nBecause I believe some truths live beyond paperwork. Some people carry stories in silence. Some memories are passed down in fragments, and even those can mean something.\n\nIf you have heard anything, even a whisper of a theory, or a story handed down in your region, I would genuinely like to know. And if you are reading this in Bavaria, please ask your grandparents.\n\nSources:\n\n[https://www.thetruecrimedatabase.com/case\\_file/hinterkaifeck-murders/](https://www.thetruecrimedatabase.com/case_file/hinterkaifeck-murders/)\n\n[https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/502044/chilling-story-hinterkaifeck-killings-germanys-most-famous-unsolved-crime](https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/502044/chilling-story-hinterkaifeck-killings-germanys-most-famous-unsolved-crime)\n\n[https://medium.com/the-mystery-box/the-hinterkaifeck-murders-germanys-oldest-unsolved-massacre-17dea740e031](https://medium.com/the-mystery-box/the-hinterkaifeck-murders-germanys-oldest-unsolved-massacre-17dea740e031)\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V22FRSrHq2o&t=3s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V22FRSrHq2o&t=3s) (Documentary link)\n\n[https://wiki.hinterkaifeck.net/wiki/Hilfe#Akten,\\_Aussagen,\\_Berichte,\\_Dokumente,\\_Vertr%C3%A4ge,\\_Zeitungsartikel](https://wiki.hinterkaifeck.net/wiki/Hilfe#Akten,_Aussagen,_Berichte,_Dokumente,_Vertr%C3%A4ge,_Zeitungsartikel) (Wiki Link)",

      "title": "The Mysterious Death of Actress Thelma Todd",
      "text": "At 10:30am on December 16, 1935, 29 year-old actress Thelma Todd was found dead in the driver’s seat of her Lincoln Phaeton. The car was parked in a private garage attached to a home owned by Jewel Carmen, the estranged wife of Thelma’s boyfriend and business partner, film director Roland West. Thelma, who rose to fame playing the “straight woman” in comedies starring the Marx Brothers, Buster Keaton, and Laurel & Hardy, was in the prime of her career when she was found dead. After an investigation and autopsy, it was later ruled that Thelma had died of carbon monoxide poisoning, though it is unclear whether her death was a result of murder, suicide, or simply a fatal accident. While the official cause of death was listed as “accidental with suicidal tendencies,” Thelma Todd’s death remains one of Hollywood’s most enduring mysteries almost 90 years later.\n\n**Thelma Todd and Roland West**\n\n[Thelma Todd](https://imgur.com/PIu0ICM) was born in Lawrence, Massachusetts on July 29, 1906. After winning the title of Miss Massachusetts in 1925, she was discovered by a Hollywood talent scout and was quickly signed by Paramount. While Thelma’s success in Hollywood was defined by her presence in comedy films, in 1931 she decided to make a foray into dramatic films, and was cast in the crime drama *Corsair*, directed by [Roland West](https://imgur.com/Utn3bH3). Thelma and West began a romantic relationship during the making of *Corsair*, despite the fact that West was married to actress [Jewel Carmen](https://imgur.com/m7kR77u) at the time.\n\nThelma’s relationship with West ended shortly after filming wrapped on *Corsair*. Then, in 1932, Thelma suddenly married [Pat DiCicco](https://imgur.com/7LEcoiM), an agent, film producer, actor – and rumored mobster who worked for [Lucky Luciano](https://imgur.com/fYtDNyt). According to reports, Thelma and DiCicco’s relationship was volatile, with many of their arguments ending in physical violence, including one fight that resulted in a broken nose for DiCicco and an emergency appendectomy for Thelma. The two divorced in 1934, after just two years of marriage.\n\nFollowing her divorce from DiCicco, Thelma resumed her relationship with Roland West. They also went into business together, opening [Thelma Todd’s Sidewalk Café](https://imgur.com/6ZzLQYK), a supper club on Pacific Coast Highway, just north of Santa Monica in the Castellammare area of Pacific Palisades. The Sidewalk Café became a Hollywood hotspot frequented by celebrities, politicians, and even mobsters. \n\nThelma and Roland lived in an apartment above the restaurant, though West was still married to Jewel Carmen at the time, who lived in a house just up the hill from the restaurant. While the two residences were only about a block apart, the route from the cafe to the house and garage included a [steep staircase with over 200 steps](https://imgur.com/iTnMnQm). It was in the garage of this home that Thelma’s body was found. \n\n**“Accidental Death with Suicidal Tendencies”**\n\nOn December 14, Thelma attended a party thrown by actress [Ida Lupino](https://imgur.com/0AgaeQL) and her father [Stanley ](https://imgur.com/Cu8nO0I)at the [Trocadero](https://imgur.com/vnslyBZ), a popular Hollywood restaurant and nightclub. Guests at the party reported that Thelma was in good spirits, although she apparently had a confrontation with her ex-husband, Pat DiCicco, at some point during the night. DiCicco had been invited to the party and a seat was saved for him beside Thelma. But when DiCicco showed up with another woman, Thelma became angry and there was a confrontation between her and her ex-husband.\n\nAt 1:50 am, Thelma called West and told him she would be leaving soon and coming home, but right after that call, she ran into some friends and spent over an hour talking with them. Thelma finally left the party around 3:15 am on December 15; she was driven home by her chauffeur, Ernest O. Peters, and they arrived at her apartment at the Sidewalk Café at 3:45 am. Normally, Peters would walk Thelma up the stairs to her apartment, but that night she declined his assistance. This was the last confirmed sighting of Thelma Todd until her body was found in the garage the next day. \n\nJust over 24 hours later, at 10:30 am on December 16, Thelma’s assistant, Mae Whitehead, discovered the actress’s lifeless body in the front seat of her car. Mae thought her employer had simply fallen asleep, but she quickly realized that Thelma was dead and the police were called. \n\nThe state of Thelma’s body–and whether or not she had any injuries–is one element of the case that has long been debated. Some reports claim that the only injuries on Thelma’s body were a bruise on her forehead and a split lip, which would likely have been caused by falling unconscious and hitting her head on the steering wheel. However, other reports released shortly after her death claim that Thelma had bruises around her throat, a broken nose, and two broken ribs. \n\nOfficially, Thelma Todd’s death was classified as “accidental with possible suicidal tendencies.” The police’s theory was that, upon returning home from the party at the Trocadero, Thelma was locked out of the apartment by Roland. Unable to get into the apartment or wake Roland to let her in, Thelma walked to her car parked in the garage up the hill from the café. Given that it was a chilly night in December, the police theorized that Thelma went to her car to warm up and turned on the ignition so she could use the heat, which flooded the garage with carbon monoxide, resulting in her death.\n\n**Discrepancies and Unanswered Questions**\n\nOn the surface, Thelma’s death would appear to be nothing more than an unfortunate accident. However, there are a number of details that complicate the narrative posited by the police.\n\nThe first strange detail is the state of Todd’s hair and clothing; despite the fact that the night she disappeared was exceptionally windy, Todd’s hair was still neatly styled when her body was found. Her shoes were also in pristine condition, which wouldn’t be the case if she had walked the distance from her apartment above the cafe to the garage. During the investigation into Thelma’s death, a female police officer of about Thelma’s size [made the walk](https://imgur.com/XGtRoas) wearing a similar pair of shoes to the ones Thelma was wearing on the night of her death; by the time the officer made it from the café to the garage, the shoes were scuffed and worn. In addition to her shoes not being damaged, Thelma’s stockings were untorn and her feet were clean, so she also didn’t make the walk without her shoes.\n\nAdditionally, Thelma’s friends stated that making the walk to the garage would be very out of character for her as she did not enjoy exercise and complained of an old ankle injury that made walking distances difficult for her; in fact, Thelma always had her assistant bring the car to her at the restaurant as she refused to make the walk up the hill to the garage. Also, this would not have been the first time Roland had locked Thelma out of the apartment; when this had happened in the past, Thelma had broken the window to gain entry to the apartment rather than walk to the garage.\n\nThere are also conflicting stories about whether or not Thelma would have been able to unlock without waking Roland. Most reports indicate that Thelma did have a house key on her when her body was found, but it is not clear if this single key could have gained her entry to her apartment. Some sources claim that the apartment had two separate locks–a door lock and a deadbolt–that required two different keys. Thelma may have only had the key to the door lock, not the deadbolt, which Roland engaged before going to bed that night. \n\nAnother inconsistency was that Thelma’s autopsy showed undigested peas in her stomach; peas were not served at the party at the Trocadero, and all evidence points to the fact that Thelma went directly from the party to her apartment. Along with the peas, Thelma’s blood alcohol level was quite high when she was found but other guests from the Trocadero party reported that she had only consumed a few drinks and did not seem impaired when she left the party. (Though it should be noted that the BAC discrepancy could be caused by the delay between her death and the discovery of her body.)\n\nThere were also two unconfirmed reports of Thelma Todd’s activity on December 15, the day between the party and the discovery of her body. Thelma’s friend Martha Wallace stated that she received a call from someone she believed to be Thelma at around 4:00pm on December 15 telling her that she’d be arriving at her party soon with a surprise guest. However, the caller never identified herself and Thelma didn’t show up at Martha’s party, so it cannot be confirmed that the caller was indeed Thelma Todd. Jewel Carmen, West’s estranged wife, also reported seeing Thelma on December 15, saying that she witnessed her in the garage sitting in the passenger seat of an unknown man’s car. \n\nDespite the finding of “suicidal tendencies,” the idea that Thelma committed suicide has been rejected by almost everyone who knew her, and was also doubted by the LAPD investigation. When her body was found, her trunk was full of dozens of wrapped Christmas gifts, and she had recently put a down payment on a property near the café where she hoped to build a garage (so she would no longer have to have her car parked so far from the supper club). While the feelings of close friends and family cannot be evidence of suicidal inclination, it is important to note that Thelma did not have a history of depression or past suicidal tendencies or ideation. In addition, carbon monoxide poisoning was a fairly well-known phenomenon at the time of Thelma’s death, so it is highly likely that she would have been aware that sitting in a running car in a closed garage was a recipe for disaster. \n\n**A Cast of Shady Characters**\n\nIn addition to the strange details surrounding Thelma’s death, in the months leading up to her death, Thelma had been dealing with stalkers and extortionists. She had received letters from someone threatening to kill her and to burn down her restaurant if she didn’t pay the letter writer $10,000. The letters were traced to a man named Harry Schimanski, who was arrested in 1935 for the crime. Another man, Edward Schiffert, believed he and Thelma were involved in a secret romantic relationship and also sent her threatening letters. He was later committed to a mental institution. \n\nThelma was also rumored to be having troubles with mobsters who wanted to use her supper club as a gambling hall. Supposedly, Thelma refused this request, leading to a feud with the mob and Lucky Luciano. Given her ex-husband’s ties to the mob–and to Luciano in particular–rumors flew after Thelma’s death that the mob was somehow responsible and that Luciano and Thelma were having an affair. However, other sources claim that Luciano and Thelma never even met.\n\n**A Classic Hollywood Mystery**\n\nSo what happened to Thelma Todd? One of the main challenges in this particular case is that it occurred during the reign of the Hollywood studio system, which was incredibly invested in maintaining strict control over the actors in their employ. The Big Five studios (of which Paramount was one), promoted promising talent via the star system, which often included morality contracts for the actors and was designed to cover up behaviors and incidents that could “damage” the star’s image. \n\nThis image control is obvious in the reports that were written immediately following Thelma’s death. For example, the day after Thelma’s body was found, the *LA Times* ran a story stating that Roland West was residing with his wife Carmen, and that his relationship with Thelma was only one of business partners. The true arrangement–that Roland and Thelma were romantically involved and lived together above the café while his estranged wife resided in a house a few hundred yards away–was quite far from what would have been considered “wholesome” at the time and so was not reported accurately. And yet details like this are incredibly important–particularly given that the sequence of events set forth by the police is based on the fact that Thelma and Roland were living together in an apartment above the café on the night of her death. An accidental death would be the most palatable to the studio, as either a suicide or murder would have brought much more scandal to Thelma Todd’s death. \n\nWhat is clear is that there are many unanswered questions in the death of Thelma Todd. Was her death a careless accident, one brought on by being locked out of her home by a spiteful boyfriend on a cold December night? If this is the case, how did she get from her supper club to the garage without the wind messing up her carefully styled hair or the long uphill walk causing any scuffs to her shoes or stockings? And where did the undigested peas in her stomach come from if they weren't served at the Trocadero?\n\nMany of the facts related to Thelma’s case have been sensationalized in books, film, and television, but 90 years after her death, the circumstances that led to the death of one of the most popular actresses of the early Hollywood system remain a mystery.\n\n**Sources:**\n\n[https://hollywoodrevue.wordpress.com/2016/12/16/the-mysterious-death-of-thelma-todd/](https://hollywoodrevue.wordpress.com/2016/12/16/the-mysterious-death-of-thelma-todd/)\n\n[https://www.newenglandhistoricalsociety.com/the-mysterious-death-of-massachusetts-movie-star-thelma-todd/](https://www.newenglandhistoricalsociety.com/the-mysterious-death-of-massachusetts-movie-star-thelma-todd/)\n\n[https://www.latimes.com/local/obituaries/archives/la-me-thelma-todd-19351217-story.html](https://www.latimes.com/local/obituaries/archives/la-me-thelma-todd-19351217-story.html) \n\n[https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/ct-xpm-1991-05-05-9102090725-story.html](https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/ct-xpm-1991-05-05-9102090725-story.html)\n\n[https://www.nytimes.com/1935/12/26/archives/reports-miss-todd-bruised-on-throat-prosecutor-will-question.html](https://www.nytimes.com/1935/12/26/archives/reports-miss-todd-bruised-on-throat-prosecutor-will-question.html)",

      "text": "With the anniversary of this case coming up I wanted to make a post about this case and hear some further opinions on what is an extremely bizarre, puzzling and brutal crime \n\nhere are 2 links for those who want to know more about the case\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Killings_of_Russell_and_Shirley_Dermond\nhttps://www.fox5atlanta.com/news/lake-oconee-mystery-fbis-quest-for-justice-intensifies-in-dermond-murders\nIn the first week of May of 2014, Russell and Shirley Dermond, a couple who was approaching 90 was supposed to attend a kentucky derby party in their upscale neighborhood on lake oconee in central GA. The couple never made it to the party, and after a few days went by, their friends became concerned when they did not hear from the Dermond's, so some neighbors went over to check on them\nThat is when the neighbor found a horrifying scene, Russell Dermond dead and decapitated in his garage, Shirley Russell nowhere to be found. The neighbor then called 911\nThe house was immaculate, it was an extremely clean crime scene and there was no evidence they were even killed at the house\n10 days later, 2 fisherman found Shirley's body 6 miles away from the home, she was dumped into the lake. She had been beaten to death and had 2 cinderblocks strapped to her legs and tossed overboard. her body was disposed of via boat\nI consider myself fairly well read about this case and I feel the entirety of the crime raises alot of interesting questions. id love to hear peoples thoughts on these questions/motives and the type of people and their motive who would do this. County Sheriff Howard Sills has been very media friendly about this case and has shared a decent amount of details/insight. Below are a few questions i have about the case, feel free to comment your thoughts, etc.\n\n-the crime scene was extremely clean, russell was decapitated in the garage but otherwise the house was immaculate. why decapitate russell? if it was to hide the ballisitcs evidence would it not have been easier to use a different weapon?\n\n-I feel they likely came to the house with the plan to decapitate them as they had to have a very sharp knife(sheriff said a super clean cut) and a container to take the head away in. what would be the motive for this?\n\n-sheriff has stated he thinks there was at least 2 people, possibly more involved\n\n-Russell was not killed in the garage where he was found. he was likely shot due to gun shot residue being found on his shirt. there's no blood spatter in garage, why kill him elsewhere and then bring him to the garage? where was he killed?\n\n-Shirley was killed in a different manner and much more brutally, why use 2 different methods for killing them? why bother removing her body and his head and hiding them, meanwhile RD body was just left on the floor of the house?\n\n-Shirley was not killed at the house and her body was dumped via boat\n\n-this is a significant part of the crime imo, because removing Shirley from the property(in a boat especially) increases the risk of being caught 50x. i feel like there had to be a noteworthy reason to do this but cannot think of one\n\ni think these killers are local, they had to have a boat and a truck/trailer to transport that boat. imo these guys had to be VERY comfortable on that lake, in order to kidnap an old lady, bring her onboard the boat, likely kill her onboard, and then tie cinderblocks to her and dump her body overboard. this is ALOT of work/effort and is very risky to do, which doesn't gel with leaving his body at the house\n\n\ni think most likely it had to be some form of extortion, where they arrived by boat(even though sherriff says he doesn't think they arrived by boat) and then kidnapped SD in order to get $ out of Russell and Russ refused and things went wrong from there",

      "title": "The senseless murder of Marina Ruggiero in San Luis Obispo in 1991.  Who stabbed to death this bright and happy college student after she returned to her hotel from a friend's wedding?",
      "text": "San Luis Obispo, with its stunning scenery, coastal proximity, and lush mountain backdrop, perfectly embodies the idyllic Californian lifestyle. Situated on the 101—about two hundred miles northwest along the coast from Los Angeles—it has attracted students and tourists for decades.\n\n[San Luis Obispo](https://preview.redd.it/nvzfnlygy0te1.jpg?width=1280&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ee2bc89119fa5600982e1189aed76649f41340ab)\n\nThe town is best known for California Polytechnic State University (Cal Poly). Many true crime aficionados will recall that Kristin Smart vanished from this campus. Cal Poly sits just north of US Route 101, opposite a strip of hotels that have long accommodated prospective students, parents, and tourists.  This vibrant area features various bars, restaurants, and a wedding venue called the Monday Club, which overlooks a picturesque mountain. By the summer of 1991, San Luis Obispo had not seen a homicide in a year and a half.\n\nOn the weekend of August 24-25, 1991, Marina Ruggiero, aged 20, along with her parents John and Maria and her sister Carmela, planned to attend the wedding of Raguel Mezin, a family friend and student at Cal Poly.  The Ruggiero and Mezin families had been longtime friends and neighbors in San Pedro.  The parents and sisters booked adjoining rooms at the Cuesta Canyon Lodge (now The Wayfarer), which lay only a few hundred feet from the venue. Marina and her sister Camila stayed in room 327 on the third floor of the hotel.\n\n[Marina Ruggiero](https://preview.redd.it/qmmyhu8ky0te1.png?width=408&format=png&auto=webp&s=4538eb5649eb76b9dfbfb00c320359a132a11a32)\n\nMarina, known for her striking dark hair and natural beauty, was described as quiet and reserved—a lover of nature who did not seek to flaunt her good looks. Her aunt once remarked of the Ruggiero family, “traditional Italian; a very emotional, very loving, talk-with-your-hands kind of family.” Marina had a three-year relationship with Greg Hald, who was on a trip to Mexico at the time; he called her “the love of his life” and said they’d discussed marriage.  She worked as an office manager at Lens Technology and attended evening classes at El Camino Community College in Torrance, having previously studied at Bishop Montgomery Catholic High School. Marina was a good Catholic, and attended church often.  Her family and she actually visited the Old Mission Church in San Luis Obispo the day before the wedding. Tragically, Father John Wadovich from the same church was called the next day to administer Marina her last rites. \n\nOn the night of Sunday, August 25, Marina attended the reception at The Monday Club across Monterey Street from the hotel. Everything is said to have been ideal.  She celebrated, danced, and enjoyed time with family and friends. Later that evening, around 9:00 to 9:30, she informed her family that she would return briefly to the hotel room to change before rejoining the group for a smaller late-night gathering. This routine decision would soon turn tragic.\n\n[The Monday Club](https://preview.redd.it/58wf3gpmy0te1.png?width=2540&format=png&auto=webp&s=de560d3d418d1bb551915f04a673eb3ceedcd5b1)\n\nReports vary on the exact sequence, but Marina’s family discovered her body in room 327 at approximately 11:00. Initially, they found the room locked; after retrieving another key from the lobby, they entered to find her body laid out on the bed with a towel covering her face. She had been stabbed repeatedly in her upper body.\n\nThe scene became chaotic as the family attempted to resuscitate her. Paramedics quickly transported Marina to the local hospital, but despite their efforts, she succumbed to her injuries. While it remains unclear if she was still alive when first discovered, the severity of her wounds made her survivable likely impossible.\n\nDetectives expressed frustration over the compromised scene. Lead investigator Gregory Clayton commented, “We’re not blaming the paramedics. They have a different agenda—saving lives.” However, worse than the compromised scene itself was the total lack of evidence found more broadly.\n\n[Detective examining scene.  Appears to be looking into room 327 from adjoining room](https://preview.redd.it/aatfcvqpy0te1.png?width=1081&format=png&auto=webp&s=aef642f016ad1d26e3a26b0b868bf8b51092e06a)\n\nNo weapon was found at the scene, and nothing appeared stolen. Investigators noted pry marks on the door and a cloth rag near her body—possibly used as a gag. No eyewitness reported suspicious activity. The pry marks raise questions: Did someone break into the room to wait for Marina, as suggested by the family attorney Vernon C. Kroll, or did the offender follow her from the wedding? Investigators never confirmed whether the room key was left inside, a detail which seems crucial given that the door appears to have been locked upon the killer's escape.  Is this hold-back evidence that only the killer should know?  One article suggests there are unidentified fingerprints in blood found at the scene, though these prints were never matched to anyone.  The lack of more mention regarding these prints, along with the possibility that up to a dozen people entered the room before detectives, makes one question the veracity of them as evidence.\n\nThe autopsy revealed multiple stab wounds, including one that pierced her heart. Investigators estimated the time of death between 9:30 and 10:00, suggesting she was killed shortly after returning to her room. Although Marina was not sexually assaulted, her skirt and top were removed. She had been wearing a burgundy rayon suit jacket, a matching knee-length skirt, a black tank top, black nylons, and black shoes. Some reports suggest she had been in the room for a period before the confrontation; detectives stated she was grabbed from behind, leaving open the possibility that the killer might have hidden in the bathroom as she changed.\n\nThe family’s attorney believes Marina did not know her killer. No one left the reception with her, and no wedding guest emerged as a suspect. In a 2019 article in The Tribune, Sgt. Chad Pfarr, of San Luis Obispo Police, noted, “There was no sexual assault. It wasn’t a robbery. Her valuables were left behind. We’ve talked to everyone who was at the wedding, and we even have license plates of cars in the area.”\n\nThe case went cold quickly. The police never named a suspect and remain frustrated by the lack of progress. Detectives have speculated that DNA might eventually help solve the case, yet no suspect’s DNA is available for comparison. “This is really a ‘who done it?’” said Sgt. Pfarr.\n\n[Evidence room, \\\\\"Ruggiero\\\\\" written on container to the right](https://preview.redd.it/53xnxpqvy0te1.png?width=1350&format=png&auto=webp&s=884ccd09024efc517bd074ebac26b1c9c544c22b)\n\nLater, the Ruggiero family sued the hotel over its security failings. The doors to the hotel rooms were vulnerable to being opened easily-either with a credit card or even just a key to a different room, according to one maintenance worker at the hotel. The lawsuit highlighted that the doors also lacked peepholes and chain locks.\n\nFor over three decades, Marina’s family has endured the devastating loss of her life. As of the last article in 2019, both her parents were still alive, although her father appears to have since passed. My deepest condolences go out to Marina’s family and friends.\n\n\\-------\n\n[Previous Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/UnresolvedMysteries/comments/1jkmo4d/three_bizarre_cases_of_missing_and_murdered_women/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)\n\nThis next section is somewhat of a continuation of my previous post exploring serial offenders as suspects in bold and bizarre crimes.  Some may believe that this crime suggests an inexperienced offender, who chose a bad plan for their crime, but it may be just the opposite.  The crime’s boldness and sophistication imply that an experienced offender may be responsible. Detectives have failed to establish a motive, leaving us to consider that the motive was in fact the act of murder itself- and the ensuing fear and grief it caused. While the crime does not appear sexually motivated on the surface, the lack of another explanation raises questions.\n\nWe must further explore how and why the offender targeted Marina. She was not a local; she was just one of many beautiful young college girls in town. It seems plausible that the offender themselves were not local and had simply noticed Marina that night or in the previous day.  They could have been staying at any of the dozen or so nearby hotels.\n\n[Route 101 north, hotel center, Monday blub across the street, creek visible behind](https://preview.redd.it/lkvx6ipxz0te1.png?width=1217&format=png&auto=webp&s=0f9df487bb68f8fddcbdae121108eb227f2db0b2)\n\nThe idea that the suspect observed Marina in the hotel is logical, and likely necessary if they were waiting in her room. It seems unlikely that the offender, having seen the family of four entering their adjoining rooms, thought that this was an ideal setup for an attack. A very bold offender might risk such a move, but it remains a huge gamble.\n\nIt is possible that someone with intimate knowledge of the hotel—a staff member, perhaps—could have executed such a maneuver. They might have provided a semi-plausible excuse if caught, such as performing maintenance. Nearly a decade later, Cary Stayner used a similar ruse to murder a mother, her teenage daughter, and their family friend at the hotel where he worked as a maintenance worker. However, investigators never suspected anyone employed by the hotel.\n\nAnother possibility is that the suspect observed the wedding and followed Marina after noticing she left the event alone. Whether the offender pushed into the room behind her or opened the door while she was inside remains speculative, but both scenarios seem plausible. The pry marks on the door are suspicious, yet available photos do not show them, and investigators do not suggest that the door was actually pried open. Could the perpetrator have tested the door after seeing the sisters staying in the room?\n\nWhile examining the area around the wedding venue and hotel, I noticed a pedestrian bridge directly behind the venue that crosses the small San Luis Obispo Creek. This bridge connects the two sides of Andrews Street; on the southerly side, it opens to a quiet residential area. After crossing the bridge, one immediately sees the wedding venue, and there is ample vegetation along the creek to observe wedding guests, and potentially follow one of them as they leave the venue alone.\n\n[Pedestrian bridge from neighborhood side](https://preview.redd.it/l3l94pu3z0te1.png?width=2357&format=png&auto=webp&s=22d2a1eabda35c86a44a4994673e476e1c283974)\n\n[Pedestrian path to the right, parking lot for The Monday Club wedding venue](https://preview.redd.it/z7y681haz0te1.png?width=2468&format=png&auto=webp&s=d61e82a612a21473175cd5fd793473f9dbe1a3ae)\n\n[The Monday Club, pedestrian path to the right, creepy guy in hood is an unpaid actor](https://preview.redd.it/8r98snsgz0te1.png?width=2217&format=png&auto=webp&s=ecf83caedcee9ad42f3a0ec21af0bc9ff2ea50d9)\n\nIt’s unfortunate, there is so little evidence in this case that we are forced to rely on circumstantial details. I believe that a sophisticated offender, well-versed in forensics, would try to avoid leaving DNA at any cost by 1991. In the previous-years the first cases involving DNA were hitting the news channels, though the whole concept would continue to remain foreign to the general public until the O.J Simpson trial a few years later.  If the true motivation of the crime is the murder itself-and the fear and grief it would cause, especially around this joyous occasion-then maybe the offender did not feel the need to sexually assault the victim.  We cannot rule out that the offender intended to assault Marina but could not complete the act due to the struggle. However, the presence of a gag indicates that the offender controlled her for some period. This control might have enabled a potential sexual assault, but that did not occur.  No sexual assault may suggest a possible personal motivation—yet every indication points to there being no personal connection between Marina and her killer. Some might argue that placing a towel over her head implies a personal connection, but I wonder if this was either to avoid potential forensic transfer, like blood spatter, or whether the body was staged for some unclear motivation.  It is hard to speculate about potential body staging given the chaotic scene, but there is potential suggestion of such.\n\nIn the end, this offender was either extremely lucky or highly sophisticated—perhaps both. We must consider that the offender successfully fled the scene despite potentially having blood on their clothing. The police investigated all leads, all the wedding guests, the hotel staff, the nearby vehicles, yet never came up with anything of substance.  Could this have been the work of a first-time offender who got lucky? A local budding psychopath?  Maybe.  But more likely this crime was committed by a serial offender, and a very competent one.\n\nRegardless of who killed Marina Ruggiero, her case remains incredibly tragic. The murderer not only ended the life of a young woman but also shattered a family, and put a black mark over what should've been a joyous wedding. The cruelty of this crime makes one wonder how can somebody be so evil? Who could do this but a true sadist?  \n\n[Marina Ruggiero](https://www.sanluisobispo.com/news/local/crime/article226883504.html)",

      "text": "I think we sometimes idealize the 1970s and earlier as a time when kids could roam freely without significant danger. Of course, it wasn't really so. It's possible that we simply didn't hear about most crimes committed against kids and teenagers. I previously wrote about the 1956 murders of the Grimes sisters on Chicago's South Side. This crime was preceded by the murders of three young boys after leaving a movie theater in downtown Chicago (Schuessler-Peterson murders, recently solved).  Now I am writing about another Chicago unsolved case – the murder of 15-year-old Judith Mae Anderson while walking home from a friend's house on a summer night.  It is a horrible, frustrating, and yet interesting crime.  \n\n\n**EDIT 7/4/25** to correct misinformation about the investigation. See below. \n\nJudith was a few weeks from turning sixteen and starting her junior year at Austin High School in the Austin neighborhood of Chicago's far west side. It was a working-class neighborhood of modest houses, apartments and two flats with alleys running behind. Judith lived with her parents, Ralph and Ruth. She had three brothers, two of whom were still living at the family home at 1530 N. Lotus. Judith, or Judy, was 5'8” tall, 150 pounds, with long blonde hair and blue eyes. Her father described her as helpful at home and stronger than most girls. Judy had a good friend, Elena Abbatacola, who lived less than a mile away. The two had briefly worked as phone solicitors for a local modeling agency, and often hung around during their off time. Elena had a large family of widowed mother and six brothers and lived in a top-floor apartment at 1019 N. Central Avenue, about a mile away. Another friend was Terry Johnson, who lived at 1743 N. Luna.  In July, she had introduced Judy to an 18-year-old Navy man on leave named Kenneth Blevins. Judy and Kevin had a few dates, but his leave ended and Judy saw him off to the Naval Air Base in Norman, OK on Aug. 11. Also present was Nancy Maguire, whom he had also been dating. There are unverified stories online about a rivalry between the two and Kenneth blowing hot and cold about which one he liked better.  \n\nOn Saturday,  August 16, Judy and Elena went to the Dairy King Soft Freeze ice cream stand, 5756 W. North Avenue, around 7 p.m. The owner's mother and 14-year-old daughter say that they sat around on containers in back till they were told to stop loitering there. They left at about 8:15. Elena says they went back to her family's flat after stopping at a store to pick up snacks. Robert and three of his 13-14 year old friends were at the apartment, Elena's mother was at work at her son's pizza restaurant. The boys left about 10:30, around the same time Elena's brother Leo, 30, arrived home and went to bed. Judy and Elena watched TV until Judy called home at 11 p.m. to ask if she could extend her curfew to watch the end of a movie. Her mother told her no, and that she should be back home by 11:30.  \n\nThere is a report that the boys claim Judy made an earlier call and said she had to leave right away. Elena denied it. The only call her parents got from her was the one at 11 p.m.  \n\nJudy started the walk home alone, a well-worn route for her that would end up with her taking the alley behind the houses on her street (despite her  father's frequent warnings). When she hadn't returned by 11:45, he became worried. He called the Abbatacolas but got no answer. He called another of Judy's friends, but Judy wasn't there. Finally he went to the Abbatacolas' building, where he could see lights in the apartment. But no one answered to repeated rings at the doorbell.  He called the pizza parlor where Elena's mother worked, to be told that Elena was in bed asleep, wouldn't hear the phone or doorbell, and wouldn't answer the door that late anyway.  \n\nMeanwhile at 11:26, police had received a report of a screaming woman in a car in a parking lot behind the high school. On investigation, no one and nothing was found.  \n\nBy 2:30 a.m., the Andersons were getting frantic.  They called the Abbatacolas and insisted on speaking with Elena. All she could say was that Judy had left by herself at 11:15 p.m. At 3:25 a.m. Ralph Anderson called the police to report Judy missing.  \n\nPolice began the task of interviewing people in the vicinity.  The Andersons received one phone call and one letter asking for a ransom, one for $10,000 and one for $20,000. Both were hoaxes.  \n \nThe following Thursday, Aug. 22, boaters in Montrose Harbor on Lake Michigan saw a 55-gallon metal oil drum floating in the water. One boater and his son hoisted it out of the water and saw what looked like something fleshy through a slit near the top. Police were called. The drum was found to contain a woman's torso, legs, left arm, elbow and wrist, but the body could not be identified. Two days later, a smaller sealed metal bucket was found near the shore. In it were a  head, right arm and hands. The body parts were decomposed, but police were able to identify this as Judy by a fingerprint matched to one in her room, supported by dental records and hair in a hairbrush.   \n\nIronically, the police had just distributed 5,000 fliers with Judy's picture and details of her disappearance. Now, from a missing teen, it had become a homicide. A massive investigation was launched. A police task force of up to 250 interviewed all the houses on the route Judy would have taken home. Police searched more than 90,000 homes, 40,000 garages and basements, and 200 boats. Montrose Harbor was dragged, and divers searched the bottom of the harbor.  115,000 persons were interviewed. Over 2,000 suspects were questioned. Chicago police at this time put great stock in lie detector tests, and they administered 73 polygraphs. This included the Abbatacola family. They all passed, one (Joseph) after inconclusive results on the first try. Elena, distraught, went into seclusion after questioning.  \n\nThe cause of death was two bullets to the brain, fired at close range from a .32 caliber weapon. There were four shots in total, two possibly from farther away. The non-fatal shots were to the back of the neck and the jaw. It was theorized that the different entry points and penetration might have shown that Judy was running away. There was no evidence of cuts or wounds prior to death, no defensive wounds, no signs of sexual assault. The time of death was estimated to be 12 hours after Judith's last meal, which was at 6 p.m. on the 16th.  This is curious, as it meant Judy was captive somewhere for hours after being snatched. The dismemberment was crudely done, but the sealing of the metal drums showed a certain kind of expertise that might have pointed to a clue. They were sealed by cutting strips down the sides and folding them over the lid. This was a method seen in junkyards shipping such drums overseas, according to experts in the field who were consulted by police. The larger drum had at one point contained lard oil, which was used in machine shops. 900 businesses  that used this type of oil, including 200 machine shops, were searched. Scientists at a Standard Oil refinery examined the 55-gallon drum, and found only body tissue rather than anything that would provide significant clues.  \n\nReports from the public started to come in. Multiple witnesses concurred about seeing or hearing a woman's cries in the vicinity of the high school around the time Judy left for home. Another woman saw a girl walking alone about three blocks from the Anderson home about 3:30 a.m. An off-duty police officer said she saw two girls, one resembling Judy and wearing the right clothes, on Central Ave. near Fulton St. at 12:30 a.m. A dark convertible drew up and the one who looked like Judy got in. The other started to walk north on Central Ave. A couple closing up their tavern in the Austin area said they were passed by a light blue or green car with two men and a girl at 3:25 a.m. The girl was demanding to be let out of the car, They followed the car for several blocks, but lost it.  Three women reported hearing four gunshots between 1 and 2 a.m. near Merrick Park, not far from the area where the police officer saw \"Judy\" get in the car. Most interesting was a couple who were fishing off the pier at Montrose harbor on the night of Aug. 17 about 11:45 p.m. They saw a car pull up next to the harbor, a man get out and sweep the sea wall with a flashlight, then leave. Half an hour later, a car came to the same spot, backed up to the wall, and the couple heard two splashes as if someone had entered the water. Then the car sped off.  \n\n[Reference map from Websleuths](https://www.google.com/maps/d/viewer?msa=0&ll=41.903695524293816%2C-87.76570365081787&spn=0.174966%2C0.41851&mid=1FXPjwCDqjKsKgqudVqUGL6sD6Aw&z=16). Click each pointer for a description and location on the map.\n\nJudy's friend Terry was questioned extensively, first from Boston where she was on vacation, then again for five hours on returning. She said Judy would not get into a car with a stranger and had even balked at getting into a car with a boy Terry knew. She gave the police the names of two men (or older boys?) who had a dark convertible with a black top. This was similar to the description of a car where a woman was reported to be crying or struggling, trying to get away. She told them she had made a call to Judy's house the night of the murder from a gas station in the neighborhood, and gave them the name of the attendant. (The Andersons corroborated the call, at 10:50 p.m. on the 16th.) Terry seemed scared, and her mother asked for police protection for their family until the murderer was caught, but it's unknown if this was given.  \n\nDivers in Montrose harbor found a city directory where Judith's name was written and several streets in the area were underlined. Ralph Anderson said the handwriting wasn't hers, nor was the directory. A girl found a hatchet with stains that might have been blood wrapped in a towel and stuffed into a crevice in rocks along the lakefront.  100 police began searching the Chicago and North Western rail line after oil drums were seen there. In an unusual move, the CPD appealed to the Chicago Public schools, and  16,000 teachers and 440,000 students volunteered to help search for clues.  \n\nPolice followed up at the gas station, where the attendant, Charles Homer, admitted that he had owned a .32 caliber gun, but he had sold it a month ago to someone he knew only as “Jack.” Homer was held overnight, but released and eliminated from the inquiry. Finding Jack would be more difficult.  He was described as a bearded construction worker, about 5'10” and 170 lbs. People who knew him said he had been growing a beard over the last few weeks. He was separated from his wife and allegedly went out with teenage girls. He had not been seen lately.  \n\nRalph Anderson felt that Judy might have known her attacker or that the attacker knew her route, and took her by surprise. He said she would have put up a good fight. She was tall and strong, played basketball and volleyball. He also mentioned that Nick Abbatacola would sometimes give the girls a ride home. It was reported that a policeman lived with the Andersons for a year on the chance that the perpetrator would come back. \n\nA psychological profile of the likely perpetrator described a man between 26 and 40, unmarried, shy around women in public, emotionally immature, with a mental age of about 15.  Mayor Daley offered a $10,000 reward for information leading to the killer; The Chicago Tribune offered $50,000. \n\nDespite one of the largest manhunts in the city to that date, police were not able to charge a suspect. Every lead fizzled out. By March 1958, the team working on the case had dwindled from over 500 to 11. But in April, another investigation brought a person of interest to their attention. Sgt. Charles Fitzgerald had a team surveilling a 23 year old construction worker in a series of assaults on the north side. He would follow buses in his car, then attack lone women after they got off the bus. He threatened them with a knife and bound them with rope, but never committed rape. He was shot Feb. 26, 1958 while trying to evade police on surveillance. This suspect eventually pled guilty to the charges of assault and assault to rape, being sentenced to 1-14 years in prison. Given his crimes, police became very interested in him for both the Judith Anderson case and the 1956 bludgeoning murder of Margaret Gallagher. Gallagher was pulled into the bushes while sunbathing at Foster Avenue beach. (This murder was known as the Spyglass Case, because a man in an apartment building was scanning the beach with field glasses, and saw her being dragged away.) They pursued him to the extent of placing law enforcement officers undercover in positions near him hoping to elicit confessions. They put a female officer, a former nurse, in the hospital as his private duty nurse. She turned the conversation to the infamous murders of the past few years. She said he didn't react to the Peterson-Schuessler murders, or the Grimes sisters. But when she talked about Margaret Gallagher and Judith Anderson, he began sweating, crying, and his pulse jumped up to 128-138. A similar result occurred when lie detector tests were administered on April 8. According to a Chicago Sun-Times report, the “needle jumped” when he was questioned about the Gallagher and Anderson cases.  \n\nDetermined to get a confession from him, police put an officer undercover, first at Cook County Jail and then in a prison cell in Joliet. He never confessed to either murder to this officer. The officer testified at trial that the suspect came back from a meeting with Sgt. Fitzgerald and was upset. \"He was pretty disturbed. He said Sgt. Fitzgerald was a nice guy. I told him I didn't know what he was talking about, and [he] said: 'You know - about the Gallagher-Anderson murders - that's what I'm talking about.' During this conversation he also said He said 'I want to tell you something, but my life is at stake and I might get the chair or 199 years.' Eventually while undergoing a lie detector test the suspect  confessed to the lie detector specialist in the presence of the warden, but he refused to sign the confession. He later retracted and, alibied by his father, he was acquitted at trial. As for the Anderson case, there has been no confirmed evidence to tie him to the case. Allegedly his mother worked at the modeling agency where Judith and Elena had once worked. Allegedly he was overheard confessing to his father on the day the polygraphs were administered. Allegedly he confessed to the police. If there was proof of these confessions, they would have been able to pursue a case. But there was nothing strong enough to charge the man. After serving his time, the suspect moved to Texas in 1967 with his parents.  \n\nFrom here, the case has faded out of the news, except for a 2007 50th anniversary Chicago Tribune article. They interviewed two policemen on the Chicago cold case unit about the status of the case. There is a DNA sample from the one-time prime suspect, and they still have the drums, but there is hardly any other forensic evidence, and none to test it against. Police never found the gun, nor any of Judith's clothes. She had been wearing a white blouse, black sweater, tan toreador pants, and white shoes. She wore a silver necklace and had a wallet. There is an interesting podcast episode where one of the cold case detectives gave an interview about the case. One thing he said was that some of the stories that were being reported did not exist in police files, that it was as if the newspapers carried out their own investigation.  Some skepticism is probably needed with the more sensational reports. \n\n\nSo who killed Judy?  \n\nSome suspect the Abbatacola family, since Elena was the last person to see Judy alive. The grounds for suspicion: Her story slightly changed, from Judy saying she would take the bus home, to Judy telling her she would walk. Although at least three members of the family were home when Ralph Anderson went to their house, no one would answer the door or the phone. Elena's brother Nick sometimes gave the girls rides, and he once asked Judy for a date. She turned him down. Nick had at 15 been accused of molesting a younger boy, for which he spent time at the Chicago State Hospital from April 1955 to May 1956. Another brother, John, was arrested for attacking a man who, he said, was bothering his brother Nick. Brother Joseph was a sheet metal worker who might have had access to oil drums, and the knowledge to create the sealed cans. He did not have an alibi. However, the CPD were evidently satisfied with their interviews and polygraphs. Nick was alibied by his brother John, who said he was working at the pizza parlor from afternoon  till past midnight. The family moved to California at some time after the murder. \n\nSome still suspect the construction worker. He was an unstable person who allegedly confessed to two murders, but was tried and acquitted of one and never charged in the other because of a lack of evidence. Suspicion of him seems to rest on (1) his criminal history, (2) the fact that his mother worked at the modeling agency where Judith and Elena once answered phones, and (3) an inconclusive polygraph. Some of the detectives on the case believed he was the killer, and it seems the Anderson family might have believed it as well. Ralph Anderson once said that he knew who killed Judy, but they couldn't prove it. But even after extreme efforts, the CPD were unable to get anything to tie him to the crime.  \n\nHowever that doesn't mean police didn't look at other suspects. They followed up on the two men whose names they got from Terry Johnson. That lead petered out. They questioned a gas station owner who said he had sold a .32 caliber gun to a man he knew as “Jack” a month prior to the murder. There are even claims that they questioned William Thoresen III, troubled son of the president of Great Western Steel and alleged to be a suspect in the 1966 murder of Valerie Percy in Kenilworth, IL.  \n\nThere is a theory that Judy did make an earlier call from Elena's apartment, and arranged to meet someone. This would line up with the report of her waiting on Central Ave. and getting into a car that pulled up (although the times don't fit).  In this scenario, it could have been one of the males whose names have been mentioned, or another male friend we don't know about. I think this is doubtful, since Judy didn't get permission to stay out late. There wouldn't be much time for an assignation.  \n\nHere again is a [map of the Austin neighborhood with significant places marked.](https://www.google.com/maps/d/viewer?msa=0&ll=41.903695524293816%2C-87.76570365081787&spn=0.174966%2C0.41851&mid=1FXPjwCDqjKsKgqudVqUGL6sD6Aw&z=16) Courtesy of a [user on Websleuths](https://websleuths.com/threads/il-judith-anderson-15-chicago-16-aug-1957.92029/post-7669804).  \n\n\nHere are the major reported events of the 16th-17th:  \n11:00 p.m. -Judy calls home  \n11:15 p.m. - Judy leaves on foot (per Elena Abbatacola)  \n11:26 p.m. - Anonymous call to police about a woman screaming near Austin H.S. grounds  \n12:30 a.m. - Police officer sees a girl resembling Judith get into a car on Central Ave. near Fulton. Her friend walks north on Central.  \n“A few hours” after 11.p.m. - Report of a screaming girl struggling to escape a dark blue Cadillac convertible. Location not released.  \n1 a.m. - 2 a.m. - Three women hear four gunshots near Merrick Park, not far from where “Judith” was seen getting into a car  \n3:25 a.m. - Couple are passed by a light blue or green car, girl inside demanding to be let out.  \n11:45 p.m. August 17 – Couple fishing at Montrose harbor observe a car pull close to the harbor, shine a flashlight, leave, return and drop 2 items into the water  \n\nThis fits a theory that an unknown man saw Judy walking home and she either got in or was forced into a car, was taken somewhere and was shot in the early morning of the 17th. Then the killer dismembered the body and packed it into metal drums, to be disposed of late at night. Maybe he expected them to sink, but they didn't. It seems like that was his only mistake.  \n\nJudith Mae was cremated and her funeral held on Aug. 30, 1957. The location of her ashes is unknown. Her father died in 2003, her mother in 2005. Her murder, along with those of the two Schuessler brothers and their friend, and the Grimes sisters, was a loss of innocence for the city of Chicago. A few years later, in 1963, a young girl was murdered after leaving the Austin YMCA summer day camp in broad daylight. The concept of serial killers was not known, but was there possibly one operating in Chicago during this time? Personally, I think it's both more likely and scarier that there have always been disturbed individuals among us, and they took the opportunity when victims came to hand. In Judith's case, I go with the theory that someone saw her alone late at night and overpowered her, got her into a car, and killed her. Questions remain about where they took her after grabbing her off the street, and where the gruesome preparations took place. I don't think we need to wonder about a motive when dealing with this type of person. It looks like a thrill kill.   \n\nThe Cold Case Unit has the files, but there have been no updates. I doubt there ever will be, unless some DNA can be found. That, or a deathbed confession, are the best hopes of solving this crime. If you have come this far, thank you for reading even though this is a very cold case. A horrible, frustrating and yet interesting crime.  \n\nNote: I didn't provide the name of the person who was pursued so doggedly by the police, because it appears he may no longer be considered a suspect by the CPD. Furthermore, he was never charged. The Chicago Tribune omitted his name in their 50th anniversary article, and I decided to do the same.  \n\nSources    \n\n[Judith Mae Anderson, The Daily Mirror, Larry Harnisch](https://ladailymirror.com/2007/08/27/judith-mae-ande-4/)  \nThere are not many online sources on this case, but this August 2007  blog post is a comprehensive review.

      "text": "(Thanks to [Clear-Ad-8798](https://www.reddit.com/user/Clear-Ad-8798/) for suggesting this case via [this post](https://www.reddit.com/user/moondog151/comments/1g7vgdl/for_my_international_readers_or_anyone_interested/) asking for case suggestions from my international readers since I focus on International cases)\n\n[Ingrid Caeckaert](https://imgur.com/FdK42vO) was born on May 7, 1964, in Maldegem, Belgium. She was the only child of a couple who ran a bakery in their village. Ingrid lived with her parents but occasionally spent nights with her boyfriend at an [apartment in Knokke-Heist](https://imgur.com/k1aivV3), a relatively small village on the coast of West Flanders.  \n\nIngrid was successful in her own right as well. She had and ran her own real estate agency called [Agence Atlanta](https://imgur.com/DcWyg6O) which was located in Knokke-Heist. She was described as an attractive, well-dressed woman who was in a steady relationship and lived a quiet life. \n\nOn March 16, 1991, she briefly visited a clothing store run by a friend of hers. She said Ingrid was in a good mood. She then went to a bakery to buy a sandwich before going to her boyfriend's apartment to have lunch. She arrived at the apartment building at 1:00 p.m.  Normally, she'd go back to her parents to eat her lunch but as she had a meeting with a client in the area she didn't want to stray too far. \n\nOnly a few minutes later, one of the residents took the elevator down to the sixth floor of the building. Once she stepped out of the elevator, She found herself frozen in her tracks. [The elevator was situated in front of the stairwell](https://imgur.com/DSnjMH5) on the seventh floor. So as soon as the doors opened, she could see, lying on the stairs the dead and bloodied body of Ingrid Caeckaert. \n\nIn a panic, she took the elevator back down and ran outside in a frenzy. She eventually reached a phone booth where she called her husband who promptly told her to call the police. \n\nThe police arrived at a truly brutal crime scene. Blood was everywhere, stemming from the over 62 stab wounds that Ingrid had sustained. Based on the defensive wounds to her hands and arms, Ingrid likely put up some fierce resistance against her attacker, and based on the blood spatter, said attacker likely began stabbing her on the stairwell. \n\nLuckily, the killer had injured himself during the murder and left a blood trail of his own. He left a bloodied handprint on the glass door leading to the apartment and a 170-metre trail of blood on the street and sidewalk outside. Blood was also found on the seventh floor and the stairwell between the seventh and eighth. He likely heard the elevator opening and went upstairs to avoid being seen. Outside, the blood trail abruptly stopped. The police took that to mean the killer got in a car and fled the scene before the police could arrive. \n\nThe police then caught what they believed to be their second lucky break. The apartment was in a highly populated and heavily trafficked location and on that day in particular, there was a long line just outside the ATM with the ATM in question being right next to the apartment. In fact the line had yet to clear by the time the police arrived. The police asked all of those waiting in line about what they may have seen. Only one of them reported seeing anything suspicious and that was a single bloodstain on the sidewalk. \n\nThe police then went to the exact area where the blood trail came to an end and asked those nearby if they saw anything suspicious or remembered which vehicle had been there. Many witnesses told police about a small red car poorly parked on that stretch of sidewalk. One witness when put under hypnosis narrowed it down to a [Honda Civic](https://imgur.com/rWdlYKd). The police looked into all owners of a Red Honda Civic in Belgium's West Flanders region but it yielded no results. \n\nNothing was stolen from Ingrid nor was anything taken from her apartment. The police also found no signs of any sexual assault. \n\nSome did float the idea of fraud being the motive. Some real estate scams were going on in the area involving the sales of fictitious land which Ingrid was aware of and heavily against. Perhaps, someone wanted to stop her from going to the police. However, the sheer brutality of the killing led police to believe she almost certainly knew her killer on a more personal level. \n\nWith this in mind, the first suspect the police landed on was naturally Ingrid's boyfriend who she went to see. The police weren't left suspecting him for very long. He had been in his apartment the entire time which the various neighbours confirmed. He was understandably grief-stricken to hear that she had been viciously murdered mere feet from his home without his knowledge. With the most obvious suspect ruled out., the police now had to look into Ingrid's final weeks alive for answers. \n\nOn February 14, 1991, she received a Valentine's card from an anonymous sender. Ingrid knew the card wasn't from her boyfriend but she still seemed to know the sender all the same. Upon reading it, she was said to have ripped it to shreds and was highly irritated upon seeing it. This happened in front of her mother who told the police the story. This would not be the last Ingrid would hear from him. \n\nOn March 2, she opened the trunk of her car and saw a note that somebody had left behind. The note was an anonymous letter somebody had written declaring their love for her. One week later on March 9, another anonymous sender had a bouquet of purple carnations delivered to the real estate agency. \n\nPurple carnations were in interesting choice. Years later Ingrid's mother would state this fact about her daughter \"Ingrid hated carnations and didn't think purple was a nice color: she thought you only give that to dead people,\"\n\nOn March 13, she was staying with her boyfriend when suddenly, somebody rang the doorbell to his apartment. Then a knock. The two weren't expecting any company so her boyfriend got up and used the intercom to ask who was there. He was met with no reply and whoever it was left shortly thereafter. \n\nSadly, nobody else knew much about Ingrid's stalker if anything at all so they had no likeness or information to share with the public. None of her boyfriend's neighbours saw the men who rang the door bell and knocked on his door and none of the local florists remembered any orders for a bouquet of purple carnations. \n\nAll the police could do now was simply take DNA from the killer's blood and hope that they got any hits and the still relatively recent databases the area had on file. At the end of March, the results came back and they were not a match for anyone on file. They also didn't match the DNA of Ingrid's boyfriend. \n\nOn March 30, the local police were suddenly mailed an anonymous letter written in block letters which proved to be potentially enlightening. The letter read as follows \"I killed Ingrid Caeckaert out of love, pour la passion. I knew her very well\". That alone didn't do much to narrow it down but the letter's composition did. \n\nIngrid was murdered in the Flemish region of Belgium, the police investigating were Flemish. Ingrid's friends and family were also Flemish, but the letter itself was written in French not Dutch. Perhaps the killer was Walloon and lived in the Wallonian half of Belgium. Provided the killer wasn't a foreigner or the letter a hoax. \n\nThe police showed the letter to the public via the TV channel VTM and asked anyone who recognized the handwriting to come forward. Another action taken by the police was to pull the DNA from the saliva used on the letter's stamp. Both of these efforts failed to progress the investigation any further. Sadly, the trail went cold after this letter. \n\nIngrid's body was returned to and buried in her native Maldegem. In April, without anyone seeing, somebody arrived and placed three flowers on her grave. Then in 1993, three more flowers were placed on the grave. In 1996, they arrived one more time and left a further three flowers at the graves. The flowers in question, two roses and one purple carnation, the same flower anonymously mailed to her place of work. Whoever he was, he never arrived to deposit any further flowers.\n\nIn the ensuing years, the police suspected two people, a homeless man from Ghent and a man from Schaarbeek. The only reason the two were suspected was because they were near Knokke-Heist and had a past history of sex crimes. After investigating them further, they were found to have no involvement in the murder. The police also exhumed the grave of a man in Waarschoot to take his DNA. The DNA did not match the killer's. \n\nToward the end of 1997, the police made one more public appeal and this time someone did come forward. He recalled a memory of a bloody man near the apartment on the day of the murder. Based on his description, a composite sketch and distributed amongst the locals. Sadly, nobody remembered seeing it and as it had been six years later, some doubts were raised as to how reliable the witness's memory was. \n\nIn November 2002, the police issued another appeal to the public and showed everyone the letters once more. The police also stated publically that they believed the killer to be a secret \"admirer\" incensed over his rejection. To quote the police chief himself \n\n\"Given the frenzy with which the murder was committed, we assume that Caeckaert was the victim of a rejected admirer. She had a steady boyfriend and led a quiet life. But she was a beautiful, young blonde woman. Our working hypothesis is that she was murdered by a man who saw more in her than she saw in him \"\n\nIn 2010, a serial rapist and killer who had raped and killed three young women between the ages of 18-22 was arrested. His name was Ronald Alain Janssen. Willing to entertain any lead by this point, the police compared the killer's DNA to Ronald's in case Ingrid was amongst his list of victims. The DNA was not a match. \n\nOn March 1, 2012, the police made one more appeal and showed off the letter that had been found in the trunk of Ingrid's car two weeks before her murder. According to the Valentine's card, The police said \n\n\"The man was around 30 years old at the time and came from Antwerp. He worked in a pharmacy and was married. The man had two children and rented (or owned) an apartment in the Albert I residence, close to the Heldenplein. He must have been a good customer of the brasserie \"Royal\".\" \n\nShortly thereafter, the police finally tracked him down. By all accounts the case was closed, by all logic, reason and circumstantial evidence this man, whose handwriting matched Valentine's card and was likely stalking her would be the killer. Except, not only did he have an alibi, but he also had one of the most airtight ones the police had ever seen. \n\nAt the time of Ingrid's murder, he was on a ship that was sailing toward Canada and enough records, documents and memories of his fellow passengers survived to prove this claim. All along he had nothing to do with the murder. Ingrid's parents must've believed he was innocent too because they said in an interview that they were clueless as to who the killer could've been. \n\nBut the police did uncover a new piece of information which indicated that someone might've made a previous attempt on Ingrid's life. On December 14, 1989, Ingrid was admitted to a hospital \"with a deep stab wound in the thigh\". She sustained the wound during a cooking lesson at the Hotel and Tourism School Spermalie in Bruges. She claimed that she sat on a chef's knife that was lying accidentally left on the driver's seat of her car. An explanation that many felt was farfetched, to say the least.  \n\nOn March 20, 2014, a video was uploaded to the YouTube channel of the Belgian Federal Police. In the video, they appealed once more for the public to come forward but this time they had a new lead to the killer's identity to share with the public. \n\nIn 2012, after that year's appeal, a woman came forward and told the police that she used to be friends with a Frenchman who worked in the south of France as a tour guide for the local tour bus companies. She told him that sometime between 2000-2005, the bus had made a stop and at a bar, a woman who was a part of his latest tour was alone and crying. \n\nHe asked her what was wrong and what she said wasn't at all what he had expected. She said that she had been \"carrying a terrible secret\" for quite some time. And what was the secret? Her brother had murdered somebody in Knokke-Heist many years ago and she had been keeping it secret because their elderly parents likely wouldn't be able to cope and survive if they ever found out. \n\nThe witness never forgot the story but didn't know who to in the police to tell without knowing of any cases to attach to it. She first heard of Ingrid's murder for the first time in 2012 and after watching the public appeal, that's when the pieces all fell into place for her. \n\nThe witness was able to tell the police the Tour Guide's name and most information about him. He was who the police wanted to speak to the most but sadly that was impossible, he passed away in 2005. So the police settled on the next best thing. Their latest appeal was targeted at those who had ridden on a tour bus in Southern France between the years of 2000-2005. \n\nBy 2014, the police had also questioned over 2000 people in connection to the case. \n\nIn November 2022, over 750 men volunteered their DNA after a new technique for examining DNA, with a specific focus on the male Y chromosome became public. The results would be nearly identical from father to son which meant that even if the killer's DNA was not taken, if it was similar enough to his, then the police could look into the volunteer's relatives. \n\nOn August 2, 2024, DNA samples were narrowed down further again taken from 150 men. Some volunteered in 2022, others surrendered their DNA samples back in 1991 and were having them tested with 33 years' worth of advancements and others were summoned from all over Belgium by the Ghent Public Prosecutor's Office. \n\nThe police were also able to use phenotyping to finally get a rudimentary description of their killer. According to the results, the murderer was likely a Western European man who was approximately 40 years old at the time. That would place him in his 70s if he's still alive. \n\nWhile the police have still yet to publically name any persons of interest or charge any suspects. Ingrid's parents have said that this was the most optimistic they've ever felt toward the case potentially being solved. \n\n***Sources***\n\n[***https://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moord\\_op\\_Ingrid\\_Caeckaert***](https://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moord_op_Ingrid_Caeckaert)\n\n***\\[Faroek\\] Moord op Ingrid Caeckaert in Heist***\n\n[***https://archive.ph/megtR***](https://archive.ph/megtR)\n\n[***https://www.haasje.be/Dreticus/Onopgelost/IngridCaeckaert.html***](https://www.haasje.be/Dreticus/Onopgelost/IngridCaeckaert.html)\n\n[***https://www.vrt.be/vrtnws/nl/2024/05/27/ingrid-cackaert-dna/***](https://www.vrt.be/vrtnws/nl/2024/05/27/ingrid-cackaert-dna/)\n\n[***https://www.vrt.be/vrtnws/en/2024/05/27/a-first-in-belgium-detectives-use-dna-to-create-a-photofit-of-a/***](https://www.vrt.be/vrtnws/en/2024/05/27/a-first-in-belgium-detectives-use-dna-to-create-a-photofit-of-a/)\n\n[***https://focus-wtv.be/nieuws/onopgeloste-moord-ingrid-cackaert-vraag-aan-150-mannen-voor-dna-staal***](https://focus-wtv.be/nieuws/onopgeloste-moord-ingrid-cackaert-vraag-aan-150-mannen-voor-dna-staal)\n\n[***https://www.vrt.be/vrtnws/nl/2024/08/02/caeckaert-150-stalen/***](https://www.vrt.be/vrtnws/nl/2024/08/02/caeckaert-150-stalen/)\n\n[***https://focus-wtv.be/nieuws/voor-het-eerst-robotfoto-op-basis-van-dna-in-belgie***](https://focus-wtv.be/nieuws/voor-het-eerst-robotfoto-op-basis-van-dna-in-belgie)\n\n[***https://www.vrt.be/vrtnws/en/2024/08/02/detectives-to-collect-gerecht-150-new-dna-samples-in-an-effort-t/***](https://www.vrt.be/vrtnws/en/2024/08/02/detectives-to-collect-gerecht-150-new-dna-samples-in-an-effort-t/)\n\n[***https://brusselsmorning.com/knokke-heists-1991-murder-mystery-new-hope-for-caeckaert-case/52522/***](https://brusselsmorning.com/knokke-heists-1991-murder-mystery-new-hope-for-caeckaert-case/52522/)\n\n[***https://www.rtbf.be/article/grace-a-une-nouvelle-loi-l-enquete-sur-l-assassinat-d-ingrid-caeckaert-en-1991-est-relancee-11414460***](https://www.rtbf.be/article/grace-a-une-nouvelle-loi-l-enquete-sur-l-assassinat-d-ingrid-caeckaert-en-1991-est-relancee-11414460)\n\n[***https://www.nieuwsblad.be/cnt/dmf20240526\\_96355337***](https://www.nieuwsblad.be/cnt/dmf20240526_96355337)\n\n[***https://archive.ph/CvFfp***](https://archive.ph/CvFfp)\n\n[***https://archive.ph/tt60p***](https://archive.ph/tt60p)\n\n[***https://www.demorgen.be/snelnieuws/150-mannen-moeten-dna-staal-afstaan-voor-onderzoek-naar-onopgeloste-moordzaak-uit-1991\\~ba8273a1/?referrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com%2F***](https://www.demorgen.be/snelnieuws/150-mannen-moeten-dna-staal-afstaan-voor-onderzoek-naar-onopgeloste-moordzaak-uit-1991~ba8273a1/?referrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com%2F)\n\n[***https://www.nieuwsblad.be/cnt/dmf20230328\\_91664288***](https://www.nieuwsblad.be/cnt/dmf20230328_91664288)\n\n[***https://nieuws.adegem.be/nieuwe-impuls-in-onderzoek-naar-moordenaar-van-ingrid-caeckaert/***](https://nieuws.adegem.be/nieuwe-impuls-in-onderzoek-naar-moordenaar-van-ingrid-caeckaert/)\n\n[***https://www.nieuwsblad.be/cnt/nbna06112002\\_004***](https://www.nieuwsblad.be/cnt/nbna06112002_004)\n\n[***https://www.vrt.be/vrtnws/nl/2024/02/29/dna-wet-parlement/***](https://www.vrt.be/vrtnws/nl/2024/02/29/dna-wet-parlement/)\n\n[***https://www.vrt.be/vrtnws/nl/2022/11/03/meer-dan-700-mannen-zijn-bereid-om-dna-af-te-staat-om-moord-op-i/***](https://www.vrt.be/vrtnws/nl/2022/11/03/meer-dan-700-mannen-zijn-bereid-om-dna-af-te-staat-om-moord-op-i/)\n\n[***https://archive.ph/o4BFs***](https://archive.ph/o4BFs)\n\n[***https://archive.ph/Iz3F7***](https://archive.ph/Iz3F7)",

If not the worst.\n\nHowever we are not going to focus on his known crimes, but the strongly alleged crimes that were never properly investigated.\n\nAccording to his mother who worked with him, Dean Corll would often dispose of \"stale candy\" by burying it in the ground. I remember a soruce stating he would pour concrete over it but I cannot find the source as of now​\n\n\"Mary West, Corll's mother, has said that he was burying \"stale candy\" and trash in the backyard of the candy factory in the mid 1960s, up until 1968 on West 22nd St in the Houston Heights. This could have been Corll's dumping ground if he had started killing in 1968, and had mass graves prepared in advance. The place of the old factory is now a parking lot/supermarket, making it difficult to search for bodies there now. \"\n\nAnd as far as most sources go, The location of the candy factory has never been dug up once. The houston PD has shown little interest.\n\nHowever some other locations were seemingly investigated in the last couple of years but no news as been followed up on or no remains were found. https://www.houstonchronicle.com/news/houston-texas/houston/article/Did-a-Texas-serial-killer-in-the-1970s-stash-20-16373337.php\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/UnresolvedMysteries/comments/begbug/dean_corll_the_unknown_victims_the_potential/ a megathread that is a much better source than my own.\n\nLast thing, One thing I have noticed is that varying online sources seem to be inconsistent as to what has been built upon the location of the candy factory, as noted above some say its a carpark other sources say townhouses.",

      "text": "*Hello! This is part of my series on unsolved cases in California from the 1960s and 70s. If you are interested, the most recent post was on* [*San Diego Jane Doe 1977*](https://www.reddit.com/r/UnresolvedMysteries/comments/1lwqy7o/someone_in_san_diego_a_teen_girl_is_found_in_an/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)*. If you have any questions, comments, or feedback regarding these posts, please let me know.*\n\n**Last Sighting**\n\n[Essie Hiett](https://www.doenetwork.org/cases/719dfca.html), 47, who may use the nicknames Marge or Steele, is officially missing from downtown Oroville, Butte County, CA. She was last seen very early in the morning of Monday, February 13, 1978. At about 1:00 am she left the Card Room at 1949 Montgomery St in Oroville, where she worked as a card dealer.\n\nEssie then went to Rusty Jack's, a bar on Oro Dam Blvd. While there she told friends about how she planned to catch a flight to Seattle that morning, as she and her husband had planned a vacation to visit their children. A friend of hers told law enforcement (LE) that Essie had only had one or two drinks before she left Rusty Jack's at about 1:50am. She drove off into the rainy night in her 1975 brown-over-tan Oldsmobile Toronado Trofeo. She has never been seen or heard from again.\n\n**The Crash**\n\nApproximately 1hr 40min later, at about 3:30am, a female nurse discovered an unoccupied car crashed into a guard rail on the side of Palermo-Honcut Rd, just north of the Honcut city limits. Soon after, the nurse reportedly was almost run off the road by a northbound vehicle about a mile north of the accident scene.\n\nAuthorities later located the northbound vehicle's driver and passengers and interviewed them; according to their testimony, they had \"taken back roads to Oroville in order to avoid a drunken driving arrest.\" They reportedly did not see the crashed car through the rain and darkness. Authorities determined that the vehicle and its occupants were not involved in the crash.\n\nThe inoperable vehicle was soon identified as Essie's. Authorities determined that she crashed her car as she was apparently headed south toward her home in Honcut. \"The car was then driven 165 feet down the road to a point behind a second guard rail,\" then was \"backed off the side of the road into the mud.\"\n\nEssie's home on Ahart Road was within view of, and/or about a half mile from, the accident scene. There were other residences in the area as well. Authorities stated that, \"We assume that she got stuck in the mud when she attempted to turn her car around. Why she was trying to turn around is anyone's guess. I also understand she was very close to an intersection where she could have turned easily.\"\n\nEssie's white pants were found under the left front wheel of her car. There were two drops of blood on the knee area of one of the pant legs. LE believed the placement of her pants were a possible attempt to gain traction of her front-wheel-drive vehicle; however, why she chose to use her pants inside of, for example, her jacket, is unknown.\n\nThe jacket was found inside the car, soaking wet. One of Essie's shoes was also inside the vehicle, while the other was floating in a nearby pond. Unless Essie had backup clothes in her car, she would have been wearing only a shirt, bra, pantyhose, and jewelry when she went missing.\n\nHer purse and car keys were not at the scene and were never recovered. Her purse reportedly contained credit cards, $20 to $30 in cash, and papers; it was determined that the credit cards were never used after her disappearance.\n\nAn intensive search immediately began, including a CHP helicopter, divers, and search & rescue units. It was reported that on the first day of her disappearance, the units spent six hours \"searching fields and orchards and dragging or probing ponds to locate her.\" However, they found no clues.\n\nThere was no evidence that Essie was forced off of the road. While it was initially reported that there was no evidence of the presence of a second person at the scene, a later newspaper mentioned a fingerprint being lifted from her car. Authorities believe that Essie was kidnapped and met with foul play.\n\nLess than a week after Essie's disappearance, authorities received a tip through the Secret Witness program regarding checking the \"alligator ponds\" three to four miles from the accident scene at the east end of Cox Lane. Divers searched the area on February 19, 1978, but found nothing. The information from the tip was not substantial, and authorities believed that it was probably just the caller's speculation.\n\n**Demographics**\n\nEssie is a white female with green eyes and short brown hair that was beginning to gray. At the time of her disappearance she was 47 years old, 5'5, and 130 lbs. She had pierced ears and wears glasses with \"photo grey lenses.\" She wears full dentures, has small surgical scars on her legs from vericose vein removal, and has a half moon-shaped scar on her right temple in the hairline area. Her date of birth is November 18, 1930; if alive today, she would be 94 years old.\n\nWhen she was last seen, Essie was wearing white shoes that were found at the scene, a tan Naugahyde jacket also found at the scene, her glasses, a green blouse with a full-face picture of a female imprinted on the front, pantyhose, and a pair of white pants that was found at the scene. She was also wearing sterling silver earrings, a Timex watch with a blue face and a white metal extension band, and a white gold wedding ring set, which included an engagement ring with five embedded stones and a wedding band with six embedded stones; the total weight of the set is one karat.\n\nEssie is classified as Endangered Missing on the Charley Project and Doe Network. Foul play has been suspected in her disappearance from the onset of the investigation.\n\nEssie's dental records are not available for comparison, as she wore full dentures, but her fingerprints and DNA are. She has two UID exclusions, both of which were found in Virginia in the 1980s. Anyone with information regarding Essie's disappearance is urged to contact the Butte County Sheriff's Department at (530) 538-7434. The agency case number is 78-11872.\n\n**Possible Connections**\n\nGerald and Charlene Gallego, a serial killer couple, were briefly suspected in Essie's case when their crimes came to light; however, they were ruled out when their fingerprints didn't match the one found on Essie's car.\n\nIn the late 1960s and early 1970s there was a rash of murders and disappearances of white women whose cars had become inoperable, primarily in Northern California. None of the cases have been solved, and investigators have proposed the possibility of the cases all being linked. This series of crimes is known by some online as the \"Bad Samaritan,” and include the disappearances or murders of [Rose Tashman](https://cacoldcases.blogspot.com/2025/06/the-murder-of-rose-tashman-may-1969.html), Cindy Lee Mellin, Robin Graham, Cheri Jo Bates, and Christine Eastin, to name a few.\n\nWhile the last official victim of the series is Mona Jean Gallegos, who was murdered in June 1975, other later cases exist that bear a strong resemblance to the known ones, including the murder of [Kathy Neff](https://cacoldcases.blogspot.com/2025/06/the-abduction-murder-of-kathleen-emilia.html) in 1980 and the abduction of [Patricia Schneider](https://cacoldcases.blogspot.com/2025/06/the-abduction-of-patricia-jean.html) in 1982. Essie Hiett's disappearance is another one of these cases that, while not on the \"official\" list, are very similar to those of the Bad Samaritan. Furthermore, while most victims were in their late teens to early twenties, and Essie was 47 years old, the oldest victim in the official list is Ernestine Terello, who was 43.\n\nIn 2015, authorities announced that a man named Marvin Gail Owens was a possible suspect in Essie's case, as that year Owens was charged with the murder of his wife Deborah, who disappeared in November 1978 and was never located. Deborah and Essie disappeared in the same year and had mutual friends, leading LE to think Marvin could have been involved in Essie's case. However, he was eventually ruled out as a suspect.\n\nAccording to the Charley Project, investigators do have another person of interest in Essie's disappearance, though further details are not publicly available.\n\n**Questions**\n\nWhat do you think happened to Essie? Could she possibly still be alive? Did she die from misadventure, or was she murdered? By whom? Why was she trying to turn around, away from her intended destination, when she crashed? Was she killed by a random one-off killer, someone who knew her, or even a serial killer? And perhaps most pressingly, where is she?\n\n**Further Sources**\n\n[CA DOJ](https://oag.ca.gov/missing/person/essie-margarette-hiett)\n\n[NamUs](https://www.namus.gov/MissingPersons/Case#/19279?nav) \n\n[Charley Project](https://charleyproject.org/case/essie-margarette-hiett) \n\n[Butte County Missing Persons Cases](https://www.buttecounty.net/DocumentCenter/View/4550/Missing-Persons-PDF), page 4 of pdf\n\n[WebSleuths](https://www.websleuths.com/forums/threads/ca-essie-marge-hiett-47-oroville-13-feb-1978.218377/) \n\n*Oroville Mercury Register* [2/14/78](https://www.newspapers.com/article/oroville-mercury-register-essie-hiett/163024570/), [2/15/78](https://www.newspapers.com/article/oroville-mercury-register-essie-hiett/163024716/), [2/16/78](https://www.newspapers.com/article/oroville-mercury-register-essie-hiett/163024756/), [2/20/78](https://www.newspapers.com/article/oroville-mercury-register-essie-hiett-se/163024796/), [3/7/78](https://www.newspapers.com/article/oroville-mercury-register-essie-hiett-ca/163024913/), [11/21/80](https://www.newspapers.com/article/oroville-mercury-register-nude-body-not/163025225/), [11/28/80](https://www.newspapers.com/article/oroville-mercury-register-gallego-prints/163025359/)\n\n*Chico Enterprise-Record* [6/15/88](https://www.newspapers.com/article/enterprise-record-essie-hiett-chico-en/163025492/)\n\n[2015 LA Times article mention](https://www.removepaywall.com/search?url=https://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-ln-cold-case-husband-arrested-wife-disappearance-20150219-story.html)",

Patricia was also a member of the school board and had worked her way up in the school system, starting as a school aid and eventually becoming the middle school secretary.\n\nPatricia was married to Gene Jauron, and they had two sons, Jason and Kevin, both older and moved out. Gene had recently retired as well from a career with Mid American Energy, and the two had plans to travel.\n\nAt the time of her death, Gene and Patricia had just moved to a new home at 1515 Old Highway 141, and their old home was actually just across the road at 1516 Old Highway 141. Patricia was found dead at the old home. Friends of the Jaurons said that the two had inherited the new home from an elderly neighbor, and had been living in it for about six months at the time of her death.\n\nAccording to Iowa Division of Criminal Investigation Special Agent Bob Henderson, investigators were at the scene until late Tuesday. Witnesses at the time said the crime scene was cordoned off, and that police seemed to be centering their investigation on a pickup truck that was parked nearby.\n\nNow, beyond revealing it was a family member who placed the 911 call, investigators were very tight-lipped about the scene, not revealing Patricia’s specific cause of death, or confirming other reports about the circumstances surrounding why she was at the old home. They weren’t revealing why the death was being considered a homicide, but that “circumstances” indicated foul play.\n\nEarly on, reports were circling that Patricia was scheduled to meet a prospective buyer at their old house. Despite living in the new home for a while, they were still trying to sell the old home along with some of their belongings that they had left in it.\n\nAnd by Thursday, May 28th, this was confirmed by investigators. According to the Des Moines Register, investigators said that the day Patricia was murdered, she had plans to show a waterbed to a person who had responded to an advertisement she had placed on the KSCJ “Swap Shop” show.\n\nInvestigators also revealed, following an autopsy, that Patricia had died of multiple stab wounds, her body was found in the yard of the old home, and she was killed shortly before 911 was called. Reporting by Michele Link in the Sioux City Journal stated that Gene Jauron had gone to the house and was the one to call 911 after suspecting a problem at the home.\n\nThe medical examiner said there was no evidence Patricia had been raped. They declined to say how many times Patricia was stabbed, what type of knife was used, or if the weapon had been found. Investigators said a suspect had not been identified but said that a red vehicle was seen in the area at the time of the murder. Despite these details, investigators said they didn’t believe there was any imminent danger to the public following her murder.\n\nPatricia was well-known and respected in the community. She was described as being “committed, unselfish, and always looking out for the interests of the school and children”. A friend of Patricia’s was quoted in the Sioux City Journal as saying “It wasn’t just anybody that was murdered, she was a wonderful person”. The friend added that Patricia had touched the lives of so many children in the school, that she was someone the kids trusted and came to for advice.\n\nA few days into the investigation, the Woodbury County Sheriff relayed that they were looking into who responded to Patricia's radio advertisement, but that was just one focus of the search, adding that there are dangers in only focusing on the most promising leads.\n\nRolling into June, residents and businesses in Woodbury County came together. They raised around $6000 for a reward fund, but investigators continued with few leads and very little new information being released to the public.\n\nThe Sioux City Journal reported on June 5th that the Sheriff’s Department and other area law enforcement agencies continued looking for a red passenger car that was seen at the address during the time of the killing, which they suspected occurred between 9 and 9:45 am.\n\nOn June 13th the Sioux City Journal reported that investigators still had no new information but that they were waiting for forensic test results to come back that could point them in the direction of who killed Patricia. This article also states that authorities were considering speaking with a criminal profiler to study the case but that that decision was still a ways off.\n\nOn July 30th, Lynn Zerschiing reported in the Sioux City Journal that the red vehicle spotted at the scene continued to be the primary focus of investigators. As the article states, it’s clear at this point they still have not identified the driver of the red vehicle or the person who responded to the radio ad. Woodbury County Sheriff Dave Amick said no strong new leads had developed and continued to plead to the public to call in with any information they had.\n\nHe said “We are still looking for a smaller red vehicle, which was seen during that time frame. We are still trying to identify that vehicle.” He goes on to say “There may be people in this community who probably have a suspicion who this may be, but don’t think it’s important enough. My message today is even if it seems so remote, please still share that with us. There is no such thing as a bad lead, just some that are better than others”.\n\nIt’s also clarified that Gene Jauron found his wife’s body in the yard downhill from the home prior to calling 911. Investigators say they have been working with other law enforcement agencies around the country, trying to see if similar murders had occurred, but nothing has come back as being potentially related.\n\nHe said that while they have other leads they are pursuing, the red car is their biggest question mark, and at a minimum, that person might be a good witness or could be a suspect.\n\nMonths go by with very little reporting, and no new leads, with investigators admitting they have run out of investigative paths. In November, however, in an article written by Jason Clayworth in the Des Moines Register, it was revealed that Woodbury County officials had turned to the FBI for help in solving Patricia’s murder. They say they have exhausted all leads, and the case has gone cold.\n\nInvestigators presented the case to the National Center for Analysis of Violent Crime. After this presentation, a Captain with the Woodbury County Sheriff’s Department said their review gave them several leads, but that all had been discounted, another investigator said no profile was made of a suspect.\n\nYears go by with very little reporting and no new leads. In 2002, Jim Jenkins reported in the Sioux City Journal that authorities would be reviewing Patricia’s unsolved murder. The Woodbury County Sheriff's Office and the Iowa Division of Criminal Investigation said they planned to reinterview witnesses and information hoping new information would turn up. Sheriff’s Deputy David Fox said at the time “We’ll see if there’s anything we might have missed. We don’t believe we have missed anything. It’s just to go over the case with the witnesses to see if they can add any information to getting this crime solved.”\n\nFox said time has not run out on the investigation, he said “I think with the right information, time is not going to matter. A good lead could still be developed”.\n\nIf anything came from the 2002 review of the case, I wasn’t able to find it in my research.\n\nIn 2005, Gene Jauron spoke with reporter Melissa Lanzourakis during an interview with KTIV News Channel 4. During this interview, he gave his account of what happened the day of Patricia’s murder.\n\nAccording to Gene, the couple had held a yard sale at some point prior to Patricia’s murder, and said a person who had attended that yard sale apparently paid for a dresser that day but never came back for it. The same man then called several times afterward inquiring about purchasing the waterbed and wanting to set up a time to meet. Gene said the man told him he worked at an area packing plant, and that the phone calls the guy made were traced to a pay phone near a local convenience store.\n\nGene alleges that Patricia went to the old house at the time she had scheduled with this person and that she was only supposed to be gone for a few moments. Gene said that from his home across the highway, he could see a red car and believed it belonged to the person looking at the waterbed, and who would eventually kill his wife.\n\nGene goes on to say that when Pat didn’t return home, he went over to the old house to check on her. When he arrived, he said he found the waterbed covered in blood.\n\nGene is quoted as saying “He’d hit her in the head, knocked her down and tied her up. She still had the twine on her one arm, but she got loose. He started stabbing. She got out the basement door and she got out into the yard and he must have stabbed all the way out.”\n\nGene said he found Patricia’s body over an embankment and that all he could do was hold her. He claimed the stabbing had been so forceful, that the knife’s bad had broken off in her chest. Gene called 911 at 10:52 a.m. According to the medical examiner, Patricia had died sometime shortly after 9 a.m.\n\nI haven’t found any articles with comments from investigators on Gene’s version of events. His comments about a yard sale and that person calling back multiple times are not mentioned in any of the other articles on the case, the only mention is that someone called responding to a radio ad Patricia had put out, which Gene doesn’t mention in his account. I have not read any statements from investigators on the extent to which Gene himself was investigated for Patricia’s murder, but it is safe to assume he was investigated. Investigators called the murder savage, and “personal in nature”, indicating the victim likely knew her killer. \n\nIn 2015, the Iowa Cold Cases FB page made a post on the 17th anniversary of Patricia’s murder, and from the tone of the post, it seems clear they are suspicious of Gene. They highlight that Gene appears to be the only witness and person who saw the red vehicle that was the main focus of the investigation and that a girlfriend Gene had after Patricia died left him because she was afraid of him. The post says that he had threatened her after the breakup by bringing a photo of her to her place of employment, and the photo was full of holes from a shotgun blast. I rely on news articles and never social media when researching a case, but the Iowa Cold Cases organization is run by a well-known journalist in Iowa, Jody Ewing, who helped stand up the most recent Iowa Cold Case Unit. So, I do consider their posts to be more reliable, though they did not include sourcing on that specific post.\n\nUnlike previous cold cases I have looked into, I haven't encountered a single news article or statement from investigators insinuating they were ever suspicious of Gene. Most of the articles didn't mention Gene at all, in fact. \n\nGene Jauron passed away in 2012. He always believed someone in the area knew what happened.\n\nIf you have any information on the murder of Patricia Jauron, please contact the Woodbury County Sheriff’s Office at 712-279-6010, or Crime Stoppers.\n\nSOURCES:\n\n* Maggie O’Brien, Woman stabbed multiple times, autopsy shows, The Des Moines Register, May 28, 1998\n* Michele Linck, Police investigate woman’s death, The Sioux City Journal, May 27, 1998 \n* Maggie O’Brien, Woman found dead at rural home; investigators suspect homicide, The Des Moines Register, May 27, 1998\n* Michele Linck, Car sought in probe of murder, The Sioux City Journal, May 28, 1998\n* Michele Linck, Investigation continues into woman’s slaying, The Sioux City Journal, May 29, 1998\n* Patricia A.

      "text": "Part 1  | [Part 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/UnresolvedMysteries/comments/1j7cp6b/23yearold_mother_stacy_peterson_disappeared_oct/)  \n\nIn the annals of true crime, the name Peterson has been an unlucky one for married women. Kathleen Peterson, found dead at the foot of a staircase. Laci Peterson, washed up alongside her unborn son in Oakland Bay. And Stacy Peterson, who disappeared in 2007 and is presumed dead, but has never been found. This write-up will be about the last of the three women, what happened to her, and where she could be now.  \n\nStacy Ann Cales was born January 20, 1984, in the Chicago suburb of Downers Grove. Her early life was marked by tragedy. Her parents Anthony and Christie both abused alcohol and had a volatile relationship. Just three weeks before she was born, her family had gone through a house fire where their two-year-old daughter Jessica died. Three years later in 1987, another sister Lacy would die from Sudden Infant Death Syndrome. After this, Stacy's mother Christie spiraled deeper into depression and alcoholism. She would often be gone for days, was arrested for DUI, battery, shoplifting alcohol and cigarettes. She spent time in psychiatric hospitals for depression and alcoholism. When Stacy was only 6, Anthony filed for divorce after an incident where Christie set fire to his clothes and smashed his car windshield. He was granted custody of the children because Christie never showed up to any of the hearings. \n\nAfter the divorce, Anthony moved the family from place to place, state to state. Money was a problem. The kids were sometimes left alone; according to Stacy, one time for three weeks. They learned to fend for themselves, and became very close. Eventually the family returned to the Chicago area, to Bolingbrook, a newer suburb. Their mother was occasionally back in their lives, though still dealing with her demons. On March 11, 1998, Christie left her home saying she was going to church or to visit a friend. She never arrived and has not been seen since. Her family believe she was murdered by her live-in boyfriend. [Charley Project page](https://charleyproject.org/case/christie-marie-cales)  \n\nEventually Anthony could not care for the children any more. Younger sister Cassandra was taken in by her employer, who became her guardian. Stacy went to live with her half-sister Tina, Christie's daughter from a previous relationship. Stacy worked hard and graduated from high school at 16 with plans to study nursing at Joliet Junior College. She took a job as night-time desk clerk at a local hotel. There, in 2001, she would meet a Bolingbrook policeman who worked nights and frequently stopped by to do a security check at the hotel. They took a liking to each other, and 17-year-old Stacy began dating 47-year-old Drew Peterson.  \n\nDrew Peterson was born January 5, 1954, in Bolingbrook. Son of a Marine who expected strict compliance from his family, he was a high school athlete and a hard worker. His ambition was to go into law enforcement, which he realized by joining the military police in 1974. That year he also married Carol Hamilton, whom he had dated in high school. 1977, he left the military and joined the Bolingbrook police force. He advanced quickly, and in 1978 was loaned to the Metropolitan Area Narcotics squad, working undercover. In 1979 he was named Officer of the Year by the Bolingbrook PD. But hubris would be his downfall. In 1985 he overstepped by ordering an unauthorized investigation, and was fired for disobedience, failure to report a bribe, and self-assigned police action. He was reinstated to the police force after a judge overruled the dismissal, but no longer working for the elite narcotics unit. \n\nDrew and Carol had two sons, Eric and Stephen. But the couple grew apart, and when she found out Drew was cheating, Carol divorced him in 1980.  He was then briefly engaged to 20-year-old Kyle Piry. She broke it off when he started to act jealous and abusive, at one point pushing her to the floor and pinning her arms there. She would later claim that Drew stalked and harassed her after the breakup, following her, issuing tickets for nonexistent infractions. She filed complaints, but there was no action.  \nBy 1982, Drew was married again, this time to Vicki Rutkiewicz Connolly. Drew was 28, Vicki was 23. They ran The Suds Bar together, a side job for Drew. But once again, Drew started cheating, and the couple divorced in 1992. Vicki would later say that the marriage was not happy, that Drew was abusive and once told her he knew how he could kill her and make it look like an accident. Her daughter from an earlier marriage said it was ten years of physical and mental abuse. She said Drew frequently hit her with a belt. He called it being a strict disciplinarian.  \n\nThe woman Drew cheated with was Kathleen Savio, a bookkeeper aged 27. She didn't realize that Drew was still married when they started dating in 1991. Drew could be charming and sweep women off their feet with gifts and trips, and Kathleen was dazzled. He gave her things she had never had growing up. The couple married in 1992 after his divorce became final and moved to a house in Bolingbrook. But the romance turned sour after marriage. After their sons Thomas and Kristopher were born, Drew became cruel to Kathleen, calling her fat, ugly, saying she looked like a dog. She told her family that he was physically abusive, once flinging her into the refrigerator door, another time pushing her against a table. On one occasion she went to the emergency room with a head injury, claiming she had fallen. The hospital notified police, but no charges came out of the incident.   \n\nDrew was often absent from home. In October 2001, Kathleen got an anonymous letter warning her that Drew was dating a 17-year-old city employee and that everyone knew about it. “ 'Village officials (Mayor, trustee’s,) [sic] and everyone at the police department have complete knowledge of this situation...It has been an ongoing joke within the department.' “ The letter said that because of certain political connections he had, Drew was being protected. When confronted, Drew denied everything. Unbeknownst to Kathleen, Drew and his girlfriend had been sleeping together in the basement of the house while his family slept upstairs. Kathleen filed for divorce in August 2002; Drew countered, also filing. The divorce was contentious – it's reported that police responded to 18 domestic disturbance calls at the house between 2002 and 2004. Both parties were named as aggressors. Kathleen was arrested twice, charges dropped. Drew was never charged. In one incident in July 2002, Kathleen alleged that Drew broke into the house and forced her at knifepoint to sit on the steps for two hours, threatening to kill her if she moved. He was angry because he found he was going to have to pay child support. Kathleen reported it to the police, but Drew contradicted most of what she told them. He described the meeting as being pre-arranged, amicable, and even said Kathleen exposed herself to him asking if he “missed this.” Feeling she was not getting any support from Drew's colleagues in the Bolingbrook police, she wrote to the assistant state's attorney for Will County in November of that year for help: “He knows how to manipulate the system. And his next step is to take my children away. Or kill me instead.” [Kathleen's letter and police reports on July 5 incident](https://archive.org/details/332990-savio-letter/mode/2up)  \nKathleen wanted to file an order of protection against Drew, but did not, because she didn't want him to lose his job. The family depended on his salary. But she expressed to her family that she was afraid of him, and that he would kill her and make it look like an accident.   \n\nAmong other issues he had with Kathleen, Drew was increasingly averse to the idea of having to share his assets with her as a result of divorce. A preliminary hearing said Kathleen would likely get the house, child support, maintenance, and a percentage of his pension. There were also other assets such as the Suds Bar, vehicles, cash, and investments.  \n\nThe young girl Drew was cheating with was Stacy Cales. As he had done with Kathleen, Drew dazzled Stacy by showering her with gifts. He bought her a car, got her an apartment and furniture. Drew represented a type of stable life that Stacy had never known. She was not bothered by the age difference; in fact, the two sometimes flaunted it in public.  \n\nIn spring 2002 Drew and Stacy moved to a house a few blocks away from Kathleen's, so Drew could see his sons. Kathleen alleged that it was really so they could taunt her, as they frequently drove or rollerbladed by the house. Stacy was pregnant, and gave birth to son Anthony in July 2003. The divorce had been divided into two parts to allow Drew to marry her sooner. The divorce became final on Oct. 10, 2003;  Stacy and Drew married a week later. The hearing for the division of marital property was to take place the following year. It was set for April 2004.   \n\nThe weekend of February 27, 2004, Drew had visitation with his kids. They spent the weekend with Drew and Stacy at home on the 28th and on an outing in Chicago on the 29th. Bringing Thomas and Kristopher back home, Drew got no answer at the door, nor could he reach Kathleen by phone. The next day, Drew kept trying to call her without success. In the evening he went to the house, again got no answer, then called a  locksmith and enlisted two neighbors to go inside while he waited at the door. He said this was because he didn't want to be accused by Kathleen of doing anything in the house.  \n\nThe neighbors found a horrible scene. Kathleen was nude, face down in the dry, empty bathtub in the fetal position. Her hair was damp, her body had bruises, and she was dead. On hearing screams, Drew raced upstairs, where he was distraught and emotional according to neighbor Steve Carcerano. Bolingbrook police responded and quickly determined that Kathleen had had an accidental fall, so their investigation of the room and the house was cursory. Drew was questioned informally at the station, Stacy at home with Drew by her side. Both averred that he had been at home all night with Stacy. An autopsy determined that Kathleen had died of accidental drowning. The dampness on her hair was blood from a laceration on her scalp. A coroner's jury ruled that it was an accidental death despite Kathleen's family testifying that she had been afraid of Drew.  \n\nKathleen's death resulted in all marital property going to Drew. Drew also produced a hand-written will from 1997 where each of them left their assets to the other. Kathleen's divorce lawyer later contested this, saying she told him she didn't have a will. Kathleen had a $1 million life insurance policy benefiting her sons; Drew as custodial parent would have the management of those funds.   \n\nStacy and Drew took Thomas and Kristopher to live with them, and Stacy adopted the boys. In January 2005, she gave birth to a daughter, named Lacy after her own sister who died of SIDS. It's said that she was a good mother, treating all the kids as if they were her own. She arranged parties and backyard barbecues; the kids were always with her. Drew's brother's wife says Stacy brought his family together. Life had settled down. Around this time Stacy had several cosmetic surgeries including liposuction, a tummy tuck, and breast augmentation. Drew wanted the surgeon to give her size DD cup implants, which the surgeon refused to do because of Stacy's slight frame. But things were not always good between the two. Drew became controlling and jealous. He was obsessed with the idea that Stacy was cheating on him. He came home during his night shift to catch her sleeping with someone.  If she went to the grocery store, he checked the time stamp on the receipt to make sure it jived with how long she had been gone. He would follow her when she left the house. Then Stacy's sister Tina, with whom she had once lived, was diagnosed with cancer, and Stacy would spend time taking care of her. In one disturbing incident, recounted in the book *Fatal Vows* (Joe Horsey), when Stacy returned from one of these visits, Drew made her undress in the front hallway so he could smell whether she had been having sex. When Tina died in 2006, Stacy consoled her brother-in-law at the cemetery. Drew asked “Are you fucking him?” and grilled her afterward at home.  \n\nBy 2007, Stacy was depressed after losing her half-sister, and worn down by the constant accusations from Drew. She was also busy raising four children. She was prescribed an anti-anxiety medicine, and also sought counseling from Neil Schori, the pastor at her church. Drew attended at first, but stopped going. Stacy continued on her own. In Drew's mind, she had a thing with the pastor. Stacy had another confidante in her next-door neighbor, Sharon. The two had become close almost as soon as Sharon moved into the neighborhood in 2004. Stacy told both Sharon and Neil how unhappy she was in her marriage. She confided this to her own family, as well. \n\n On August 31, Stacy called Neil Schori asking to meet with him about something important. She spoke about being afraid of Drew and wanting to get out of her marriage. Then she said, “Can I tell you something?” He told her that she could tell him whatever she wanted. Her next words were: “He did it. He killed Kathleen.” She went on to tell him that she had woken in the middle of the night, and he wasn't home. In the morning she saw him put his own and a woman's clothes in the washing machine. Drew coached her for hours about how to answer if she were questioned, so their stories would be consistent. Schori was shocked to hear this. He treated the information as confidential.    \n\nDrew may have been paranoid, but Stacy was, in fact, in touch with another man. This was Scott Rossetto, twin brother of a man she had dated before Drew came on the scene. She contacted him and they started emailing and calling. Rossetto said some of the messages were “quite perverted and flirty in nature.” Also that if Drew had seen some of them he might well have misconstrued, but that they were just meant in fun. Stacy also told him how she wanted out of her marriage. To another old friend she wrote:  'I have been arguing quite a bit w/my husband. as I mature some w/age i am finding that the relationship I am in is controlling, manipulative and somewhat abusive. as I try to help make changes to this he has become argumentative. '   \n\nBy October, Stacy was actively trying to find a way out of the house. However, she did not want to leave without the children, including Kathleen's boys. She put out feelers to relatives and friends trying to find a place to live. She found her phone bill in Drew's briefcase with numbers highlighted and notes added, so she got a new number that Drew didn't know about. On October 26, she told Drew she wanted a divorce. She packed ten boxes of his clothes and asked him to leave, but he refused. She contacted Harry Smith, the attorney who had represented Kathleen in the divorce from Drew. Among other questions, she wanted to know if they could get more money from Drew because of what she knew about how Kathleen died. The lawyer told her no, and also that he wouldn't be able to represent her because of having handled the other case. \n\nOn October 27, her sister Cassandra came for dinner. When she left, Stacy whispered to her: 'I love you. If anything happens to me, he killed me. It wasn't an accident.'  \n\nThe following day, Stacy was going to help Cassandra re-paint an apartment where their brother Yelton had been living. He had broken parole and had to return to prison, so they had to get the apartment back to its original condition. Another member of the painting party called her about 10 a.m. and she confirmed that she would be coming. But she didn't come. Sharon next door was also looking for Stacy. Drew told her that Stacy was visiting her grandfather. He asked if Sharon could watch the kids while he did an errand, and he returned in about 15 minutes. When Stacy wasn't back by evening, and calls were going to voicemail, everyone started worrying. She had not been to any of the places she was supposed to have gone. At 11 p.m. Cassandra went to the house. One of the boys answered the door and said their mom and dad had a fight in the morning, and Stacy left. Cassandra then called Drew. He told her that Stacy had called him at 9 p.m. to say she was leaving with another man, and had taken $25,000 cash, her passport, and clothes.

      "title": "In June 1958, 41-year-old Louise Crider was reported missing by her husband, John. The following day, her body was found just over a mile away from the Crider’s Columbus, Indiana home. Despite differing opinions amongst law enforcement, her death was ruled as suicide. What really happened to Louise?",
      "text": "On Saturday, June 14, 1958, at approximately 10am, 42-year-old John Crider filed a report with the Columbus, Indiana Police Department regarding his wife, 41-year-old Louise Crider. John explained to an officer, via telephone, he had last seen Louise the previous evening when the pair went to bed together as usual around 9:30pm. Just before midnight, however, John awoke to an empty bed. Assuming Louise was in the room of their 9-year old son, Billy, John simply went back to sleep. \n\nHowever, when he awoke again at 7am the following morning, John found her nightgown in the bathroom, but no sign of Louise. After a search of relatives' homes proved unsuccessful, including at Louise’s sister’s house next door, John made the decision to report Louise missing. \n\nOn Sunday morning, John and Louise's brother-in-law, Carl, reported finding a single set of footprints, they believed to be hers, in a cornfield located approximately half a mile from the Crider home. With this new possible lead, law enforcement gathered a small team of volunteers who assisted in scouring the surrounding wooded areas and fields for any sign of Louise. Just before 1pm, a policeman in the search party found Louise’s body, obscured beneath flood debris, in a water filled ditch bordering Clifty Creek. \n\nLouise’s body was located just over a mile away from her home, and roughly one half mile away from the footprints John and Carl had found. She was found fully clothed in denim blue jeans and a tan short sleeved shirt, however, both of her socks, and her left shoe were missing. Her right shoe was discovered forced into the front pocket of her blue jeans. \n\nClothesline and a thick, black, rubber coated electrical cord had been wound around Louise’s body. These restraints were tightly wrapped, one over the other, around her knees and torso, extending up her back and around her neck. A square knot was used to fasten the cord at her throat. Her arms were not bound. \n\nInvestigators determined that the ditch in which Louise’s body was found had been filled with approximately three feet of water on the night she disappeared, due to recent flooding in the area. By Sunday the water had receded enough to reveal her body. The area was located at the end of McKinley street which, at the time, was closed.\n\nLouise’s official cause of death was listed as asphyxiation, however, the medical examiner was unable to specify whether this resulted from drowning or strangulation. Further examination revealed no other external injuries, defensive wounds, or signs of sexual assault. Louise’s estimated time of death was noted as approximately 24 hours before her body was found.\n\nLacking a definitive cause of death, police began to interview members of the Crider family and their neighbors, in the hopes of gaining more insight into Louise’s life. Louise was described as quiet, introverted, and seemingly more “withdrawn” from conversations with family and neighbors as of late. They described her as a dedicated mother, adding that Louise had recently expressed concerns over her son's health. \n\nJohn Crider was also interviewed. He described he and Louise’s life as average, with him employed as a foreman at Arvin Industries Inc., (a major manufacturer of automotive parts, consumer goods, and military items) and Louise as a homemaker. He stated they had no known enemies. Following a polygraph examination, John was eliminated as a suspect.\n\nThe absence of a suspect or motive led to a division among law enforcement regarding Louise’s manner of death. This resulted in a formal hearing to establish whether Louise had taken her own life or been murdered. \n\nIndiana State Police Detective Harry McMillin, during the hearing, expressed strong doubts regarding the suicide theory in Louise’s death. He argued that the circumstances surrounding the body's location were highly improbable for suicide. He outlined the unlikely scenario of Louise, in the middle of the night, gathering restraints, walking over a mile across challenging terrain, removing her shoes and socks, binding herself, and then entering a shallow water filled ditch. He also noted that the water current could not have moved her body, suggesting she entered the water where she was found. He stressed the implausibility of this location for suicide, given the availability of deeper and more accessible water nearby.\n\nDetective McMillin continued his testimony by addressing the restraints found wrapped around Louise’s body. He argued that, despite her hands being free, the tightness of the clothesline and electrical cord indicated external involvement. Additionally, he emphasized the specific knot used, a “square” knot, stating it was uncommon and complicated. McMillin expressed his doubt that Louise would have selected such a knot.\n\nDetective McMillin also pointed out that despite family descriptions of Louise as withdrawn, the investigation revealed no significant life stressors, such as mental illness, financial problems, or marital conflict. He added, Louise’s concerns over her son's health issues, which were the result of allergies, a minor medical issue, would most likely not cause her to want to end her life. \n\nSheriff Earl Hogan offered a contrasting perspective, presenting evidence in favor of the suicide theory. He argued that there was no concrete evidence of foul play, pointing out the absence of injuries on Louise’s body. He directly refuted Detective McMillin's claims of improbability, stating that Louise had, in fact, left her home that night, traveling to the ditch on foot, and restrained herself to prevent her from changing her mind once in the water. He concluded by stating that John, the individual most likely to have knowledge of the night’s events, had been cleared via polygraph, leaving no viable suspects. \n\nDespite differing opinions among law enforcement, the official determination of Louise’s manner of death was ruled as suicide.\n\nLouise was laid to rest at Garland Brook Cemetery in Columbus, Indiana. Her husband, John Crider, later remarried. He passed away in 2002. Their son, Billy, passed in 1982. He was buried next to Louise. \n\nUnfortunately the circumstances surrounding Louise’s death will most likely forever remain unknown. \n\n*Please note that the majority of source material below refers to McKinley Road by its former name, which includes a deeply offensive racial slur.

      "text": "[Large law enforcement presence in Lincoln County tied to Asha Degree investigation: What we know]\n(https://www.wbtv.com/app/2025/04/04/large-law-enforcement-presence-cherryville-tied-asha-degree-investigation-what-we-know/)  \n\nAnother update in the case of Asha Degree, the 9 year old girl who left her home in Shelby, NC during the night of February 13-14, 2000 and has been missing since then.  \n\nWBTV is reporting that Lincoln County sheriff's police, the FBI, and state police have been searching a former school property near Cherryville, NC  today, April 4, in connection with the Asha Degree investigation. The property holds three buildings and was known as the North Brook Consolidated School. The Dedmons purchased the abandoned school in 1991 and sold it in 2004. It is near the junction of North Carolina 274 and North Carolina 182. As many as 30 officers were on the scene today.  \n\nBackground: Asha left her house during a heavy storm while her parents and brother were asleep. She was seen walking down Hwy. 18 wearing something white. A trucker who saw her turned around to pass her again, and she ran off into the woods at the side of the road. She has not been seen since.  \n\n17 months later, her backpack was found during construction about 30 miles from where she lived. It was wrapped in a plastic garbage bag and slightly hidden under brush and leaves. \n\nIn September 2024, police issued warrants for a property owned by a local family, the Dedmons, as a result of DNA found from a shirt that was in the backpack. A hair matched one of the daughters in the Dedmon family. Police retrieved multiple items from the Dedmons' property on Cherryville Rd. in Shelby, about 4 miles from where Asha was last seen.  One item was a 1970 green Rambler that has been mentioned in connection with the case. \n\nThere was also DNA from the backpack from Russell Underhill, who was a resident in two of the care facilities operated by the Dedmons. It has been alleged that the Dedmon daughters would sometimes transport residents back and forth in the Rambler. That might explain how Underhill's DNA came to be in the car. He died in 2004.  \n\nIn February police issued warrants for cellphones from daughters Lizzie Foster and Sarah Dedmon Caple, and Roy Dedmon. A series of damaging text messages among family members has been published. Police appear to think the sisters were involved in Asha's disappearance and had help from their parents. It was also revealed in February that a witness came forward who was at a party with Lizzie and Sarah, where an intoxicated and distraught Lizzie was overheard to say \"I killed Asha Degree.\" Her sister shushed her. This witness said he is sure of what he saw/heard. He passed a polygraph.  \n\n[New Asha Degree warrants: Text messages revealed, possible admission of fault, more\n](https://www.wbtv.com/2025/02/18/new-asha-degree-warrants-text-messages-revealed-possible-admission-fault-more/)",

      "text": "I know this is a big one for a lot of us. Has been some movement since the Florida Department of Law Enforcement took over the case. \n\nORLANDO, Fla. — Jennifer Kesse has been missing since January 2006 and on what would be her 44th birthday, Kesse’s parents are celebrating without her again.\n\nHowever, the Florida Department of Law Enforcement does not consider Kesse’s case a cold one.\n\nDetective told Eyewitness News that they have persons of interest.\n\nThat gives her parents hope in finding their daughter.\n\n“We feel at least the case is moving in the proper direction and who knows, who knows what can happen from here? It just takes working,” Drew Kesse said.\n\nThis news comes after FDLE said they have some persons of interest.\n\nWFTV asked FDLE: “Is it safe to say that you have narrowed down some persons of interest?”\n\n“I would say yes,” said the lead special agent.\n\nFDLE wouldn’t say who they are or how many they have, but this is no doubt progress.\n\nSpecial Agent Spears started looking into this case about 2 years ago. Since then, she has gone through thousands of pages of documents and has already talked to 45 people. She has ruled some people out that had been talked to in the beginning and has ruled now new people in. And evidence is being looked at again.\n\nWFTV asked: “Anything significant or you don’t know yet?”\n\n“In order to protect the integrity of the case, I would like to just leave it at that we are re-evaluating some evidence to test new and re-test some of the stuff that has previously been tested,” Spears said.\n\nThere is no telling yet where this case will lead, there is still a lot of work to be done, but there is movement on the case.\n\n“The case is not cold in the eyes of FDLE,” Spears added.\n\nhttps://www.wftv.com/news/local/fdle-pursuing-new-leads-persons-interest-2006-disappearance-case/OSSJVUOAX5F7LOMMFLR5ZKWDAE/?outputType=amp",

      "text": "I was just thinking about the Hinterkaifeck case from 1922 after commenting on another sub. The part of that horrific case that has stuck with me in the decades after I first read about it is the little girl pulling out her own hair due to the horror of what she was experiencing. \nIt gave me goosebumps all over, the first time I heard it and it's the first thing that comes to mind when I think of that case and it also just sometimes randomly pops into my head and upsets me.\n\nAnother part of a case which affects me in a similar way is during the Dardeen family murders. As if it wasn't brutal enough already, after Elaine Dardeen went into Labour during the attack, the killer/s beat the newborn baby to death. Ugh it makes me feel so sick.\n\nAnother example but in a different way is the murder and attempted murder of the Miller sisters. The driver of a parked car waved to them to indicate for them to cross the road and when they did the driver purposely drove right into them, killing one sister and seriously injuring the other. \nI think about that case every single time a driver waves me by to cross the road in front of them. \nI walk around 6 miles each day, Monday to Friday and don't drive so I cross many roads including driveways into businesses along my route. Guaranteed someone will slow down and politely wave me by so I can cross in front of them at least 3 times a week. Sometimes more often. And every single time, since reading about the April and Spring Miller case, a little sense of dread runs through me. My mind's automatic reaction is to wonder if they're doing that so they can run me down. I know it's irrational, I know it won't happen but that thought hits me every single time. Then I quickly push it away and cross and gesture to thank them etc but it's still always there. \n\n\nSo what are some elements of certain cases that have wedged themselves into your brain and keep coming back to haunt you every so often?\n\n\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hinterkaifeck_murders\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dardeen_family_homicides",

      "title": "The body of a man in possession of an array of trinkets is found; His collection includes jewelry, law enforcement memorabilia, and a modified WWI era medal- Who was the Montgomery County John Doe? (1985) ",
      "text": "Hello everyone! As always, thank you for all your comments and votes on my last post about Ella Saylor- I hope that she will be found soon, safe and sound.\n\n  \nToday I wanted to write about an intriguing Doe case.\n\n\n\nDISCOVERY\n\n  \nOn the 30th of April, a body was discovered in a drainage pipe under a manhole cover in a wooded area near the Baltimore Washington Beltway in Bethesda, Maryland, USA. \n\n  \nThere wasn't much that could be garnered from the remains due to advanced decomposition; The body belonged to a white man, who was about  5'-6\" (66 inch / 168 cm) and 150 lbs (68 kg). His hair was brown and medium length, and he was an adult, anywhere from 18 to 59; That's about it when it came to any physical characteristics that remained. It's estimated that John Doe had been dead for a few months- the cause and manner of his death either aren't known, or not given to the public. \n\n  \nHe was wearing a camoflage bandana, a black snap jacket, camoflage pants with blue cloth belt, a blue nylon undershirt, a blue cotton T-shirt, blue underpants, a cross necklace with blue stones, two rings: a silver one with a green stone and a silver one with a scroll design, and black cloth shoes. He was found with a large and eclectic trove of items: A black beret, a wristband with studs and \"Armed Forces Police\" sewn onto it, a jacket with faux fur hood and orange down lining, a badge with \"Special Officer\" written on it, a \"medallion with the design of a flying bird\", a yellow-metal necklace with pendant that said \"No Positively Not\", three pairs of glasses and two pairs of sunglasses (all different models), an old medal, and a digital watch with a metal band. Other than that, a folding knife in carrying case and one wallet with one large coin were found with him. There's also a military-style backpack shown in photos of items found with John, so all the trinkets were probably found inside. A comb, spools of different colored threads, a small clock, eating utensils, pens and a smoking pipe were also found. \n\n  \nThere isn't any official info from the police, but some people online tried to find out more about the peculiar items John was found with- for example, the wristband seems to be an actual wristband worn by law enforcement; One current online auction lists it as \"vintage\", but it's possible that it was timely for John. The badge was produced by a brand called rothco, an old (and still operating) brand that specializes in military and outdoor clothing. The coin in John's wallet was an Indian head cent, a one cent coin ($0.01) produced from 1859 to 1909. The bird medallion was manufactured by Sam Biern's shop in NYC between 1933 to 1961. The medal found with John is most likely a German honor cross from World War I, awarded for frontline service- it had, however, been altered; There was no ribbon that the medal would usually be suspended from, and the inner side had an engraving that said something like \"(inelligable) Joe's MCN, #128, BooB SUCKS\".\n\n  \nCONCLUSION\n\n  \nThis case is rather sparse with details- there's not much known about John Doe due to decomposition, and not much had been shared regarding any sort of investigation; However, I believe that the items he had been found with give us a lot of potential clues and insight into what kind of person John was in life.\n\n  \nIt's clear that John was a collector of sorts; Items found with him aren't just random trash, like if he was a hoarder for example, but trinkets that follow a certain logic and curation. It's safe to assume that he might've been interested in the military/law enforcement, given the WWI medal, security badge and armband. He might be interested in jewelry, coins, and similar items- he was found with two necklaces, a decorative pin, two rings, and a coin that could only have a sentimental or collector value. Just the sheer volume of items found with him is quite impressive- in most Doe cases, the deceased is found with the clothes on their back and perhaps two miscellaneous jewelry pieces or glasses; Here, we have someone's treasure stash of very specific items which formed a certain collection.\n\n\n\nWith so many items in his backpack, I wonder if John was some kind of a wanderer or traveler, perhaps using hitchiking? Other than his \"treasures\", he had a lot of more practical items like a comb, thread or a toothbrush, like he was planning to be away from home for a short time. What's noting is that he wasn't found with many clothes- many homeless Does have layers upon layers of clothes, but John was dressed pretty casually, like he thought that he will be home after a day or so. With all the various items that could be a part of someone's collection, perhaps he was going to/coming back from some kind of an auction or event where collectors can swap items?\n\n  \nOr maybe he was trying to attempt a bushcraft-style forest camping, given his seeming passion for military? Though, if that was the case, would he take so many bits and bobs that wouldn't be useful in a survival scenario? \n\n  \nOf course, there are other possibilities- suicide is always one. Perhaps John wanted to die with all of his beloved items with him? I'm not sure, however, if a suicide victim could be found in a drainage pipe, under a manhole- I mean, people commit suicide in the strangest ways, but I never heard of that paticular one. Did he accidentally fall in? Again, I don't know enough about drainage systems, but I doubt he pulled the manhole cover over himself. Finally, there's a possibility that he was concealed for some reason- perhaps he was murdered and hidden; But then why would the killer leave his backpack, with very specific items inside, with him? There's a big chance that items like these could lead to someone recognizing him, so why risk it? We don't know John's manner of death, so we can speculate all we want, and we still might be wrong- though I feel that if it was murder, police would say it and the case would have more urgency than it has. Of course, law enforcement might not know what happened to John either, as his decomposed state might've not helped with finding his cause and manner of death. \n\n  \nI'm not sure how big of a chance there is for John to be identified. His fingerprints aren't on file, which makes sense, as it was probably impossible to take them from him. His dentals aren't available either, which is weird, because it says that all of his parts were recovered- in my experience, the only cases with unavailable dentals are ones where the skull wasn't found. Finally, his DNA is also unavailable- a shame, but not that suprising given the age of the case. However, what caught my eye is that the photos of John's items seem to be done in full color and in pretty good resolution, so they must've been taken by a digital camera. That means that his belongings were in some kind of a police storage for a long time and had been taken out fairly recently- If we're lucky, John's items have been kept in secure conditions, and perhaps a small amount of DNA can be harvested from them; Maybe they even have a tooth or two? So yes, while this case is currently at a bit of a standstill, I think that there's still a chance that it can be moved forward if the right people will get involved. I hope that a DNA sample can be obtained and genetic genealogy can be performed on it, so that John will be able to get his name back after almost 40 years.\n\n  \nIf you believe that you have any info regarding John Doe's identity, contact the Montgomery County Police Department at (301) 279-8000 (case number B85-520754).\n\n  \nSOURCES:\n\n1.

      "text": "On April 5th, 1995, a group of children playing around near an abandoned house in Atlanta, Georgia, discovered a human body buried in a shallow grave in the backyard, dead only days at the time. The abandoned home was locally well-known for being the site of drug use, particularly crack cocaine. The body belonged to a Black girl, initially believed to be between twenty and twenty-five years old, with her hair worn in cornrows. Her age was later revised to be possibly as young as fifteen. Despite the suspicious circumstances around her discovery, medical examiners found no signs of violence on Jane Doe, and labeled her death the result of an overdose or natural causes. She had a large gap in her front teeth and a mole on her foot, but carried no form of identification.\n\nUnfortunately, nobody came forward to claim her. Locals in the area interviewed suggested that she might have been \"Wanda\", a woman from the Adamsville neighborhood of Atlanta, though law enforcement were unable to confirm this possible identity. In 2022, officials reached out to Othram in hopes of returning Jane Doe's name to her. Today, she was officially identified as fifteen-year-old [Kiyona Arnold](https://dnasolves.com/articles/img/d891e9c6-422e-11f0-be4e-0242ac140003.jpg). Born in 1980, Kiyona was the youngest of three daughters living in Atlanta. The last record I can find of her is in 1990, when her mother passed away. \n\n\\-\n\n[https://www.newspapers.com/newspage/403220476/?match=1&terms=%20%22Woman%20Found%20Dead%20Still%20Unidentified](https://www.newspapers.com/newspage/403220476/?match=1&terms=%20%22Woman%20Found%20Dead%20Still%20Unidentified)\n\n[https://www.newspapers.com/newspage/400065383/?article=15a26755-84e3-42c9-85f1-49d42b5ece01&focus=0.80619264,0.47569957,0.9686021,0.56861967&xid=3355&\\_gl=1\\*1sh76gg\\*\\_gcl\\_au\\*MTQ3NzE0MjEyNC4xNzQzNzQ1Njg5](https://www.newspapers.com/newspage/400065383/?article=15a26755-84e3-42c9-85f1-49d42b5ece01&focus=0.80619264,0.47569957,0.9686021,0.56861967&xid=3355&_gl=1*1sh76gg*_gcl_au*MTQ3NzE0MjEyNC4xNzQzNzQ1Njg5)\n\n[https://www.doenetwork.org/cases/134ufga.html](https://www.doenetwork.org/cases/134ufga.html)\n\n[https://dnasolves.com/articles/wanda-1995/](https://dnasolves.com/articles/wanda-1995/)",

      "text": "I am a forensic anthropology/criminology student. Lately, with all the stress of academics and major lab projects, I find myself thinking, \"Why do I pursue this?\"\n\nSo, I've been reminding myself of the case(es) that made me want to enter this field. The cases that changed my life to research/read about and made me *determined* to pursue this.\n\nFor me, the two cases that made me know for a fact that I need to be in this field were the Dozier School for Boys and the Sherry Leighty case.\n\nThe [Dozier School for Boys](https://www.npr.org/2012/10/15/162941770/floridas-dozier-school-for-boys-a-true-horror-story) is one of the most deeply horrifying and soul-crushing cases I've ever researched. This Florida \"school for troubled boys\" faced an uncountable number of abuse allegations, with a white shed on the property being the site of the most heinous and sickening beatings and torture of minors. An estimated 81 boys died on the property, though some reports argue that more may have passed off the record. Forensic anthropologists found multiple undocumented grave sites on the (now closed) property. Many of the boys are unidentified to this day. This case struck me primarily because of the bravery of the survivors and the fact that there are still the skeletal remains of boys sitting unidentified. \n\n[Sherry Leighty's](https://www.aetv.com/real-crime/sherry-leighty) disappearance was brushed off as a runaway for over fifteen years until her father-in-law suddenly confessed that her body was on his property. Forensic anthropologists were crucial to this case having closure and bringing her killer to justice. Thanks to anthropologists, Sherry's children now know that their mother didn't just run off with some unknown male; she had been cruelly murdered. \n\nWhat is the case (or cases) that made you want to study criminal justice?",

      "title": "Body found in Arches National Park in 1983 identified as missing teen Robby Peay. The case is now a murder investigation.",
      "text": "Robby Lynn Peay was born August 2, 1965, in Provo, Utah. He was adopted at 11 months of age by a couple who had only girls. His father died in a car accident, and his mother then had trouble keeping him out of trouble. He started skipping school and \"dabbling\" in some kind of drug, according to his sister. He had minor brushes with the law, and in September 1982, aged 17, his mother had him committed to the Youth Diagnostic Center, a lockdown facility in Salt Lake City, Utah. The following month, on October 7, he and another boy at the facility ran away. They split up, and Robby disappeared. Again according to the sister, he was going by the name  \"Bobbert Casper\" and had been seen in Boulder, CO.\n\nOn February 12, 1983, a hiker found body of a young man in the Gossips Corner area of Arches National Park in Utah. He had a bullet wound in the back of his head. He was estimated to be in his 20s and to have been dead for at least two months.  Authorities noted similarities to the description of Robby, but the body was too decomposed for a visual identification.  Dental records did not match Robby's. The unidentified body was buried in Moab in a grave marked John Doe. Months later, Robby's truck was found in the water at Lake Powell, 350 miles away on the Utah/Arizona border. However, this finding did not advance Robby's case. Robby's family petitioned to have him declared dead in 1990. They felt he had fallen victim to foul play.  \n\nIn 2018, a Utah police officer on light duty after surgery was reviewing old cases. He added Robby's case to Namus.  A forensic dentist looking at records on Namus saw that Robby's dental information had been entered upside-down. Once corrected, the records were a 90% match to the Utah Doe. Authorities now felt they were on track to identify him positively. However, there were roadblocks due Robby having been adopted in a sealed adoption. It took years to get the courts to unseal the records, but they finally succeeded in 2022.  Then there was difficulty in finding a relative to compare DNA. However, they eventually found a maternal relative through genealogical research. John Doe was exhumed, and the DNA proved to be a match.  \n\nRobby has been identified; now the investigation turns to how he died. A bullet wound to the head with no gun found seems to rule out suicide, as does his truck being found so far away. The steering wheel had been fixed in position when it was pushed into the water. The boy who ran away with him had been found shortly after the two escaped. The trail is cold, but hopefully the identification will open new avenues to pursue. Now Robby can be buried in the Provo cemetery where his family had already placed a headstone. \n\nEDIT: Be sure to read the [comment below](https://www.reddit.com/r/UnresolvedMysteries/comments/1jg4d1k/body_found_in_arches_national_park_in_1983/miwi552/) from u/UnnamedRealities, which includes important details I missed.\n\nSources  \n\nProbe continues into death of “John Doe\" - Salt Lake Tribune, 2/15/83   \nBody of probable murder victim discovered in Arches Natl.

      "text": "[https://imgur.com/a/085xaMn](https://imgur.com/a/085xaMn)\n\nIt’s been over 17 years since Andrew Gosden, a 14-year-old lad from Doncaster, went missing in 2007. For those unfamiliar, Andrew was a bright student, described as a bit of a quiet, introverted type. On 14th September 2007, instead of heading to school, Andrew withdrew £200 from his bank account, bought a one-way ticket to London, and was last seen on CCTV arriving at King's Cross Station that same morning. Since then, there’s been no confirmed sightings of him, and his case remains one of the most puzzling missing person cases in the UK.\n\nWhat’s particularly baffling is that Andrew left behind all his belongings, including his passport and charger for his PSP. It’s believed he travelled to London alone and had no known reason for going there. There’s been a lot of speculation over the years – from theories about him running away to more sinister suggestions, but no solid evidence has emerged to explain his disappearance.\n\nDespite appeals, public searches, and investigations, Andrew’s family have never given up hope, constantly advocating for more exposure to the case. They’ve even used social media to raise awareness in hopes of finding new information.\n\nHas anyone here followed the case closely or have any insights into recent developments? It’s tragic to think his family has gone nearly two decades without answers.",

      "text": "Martha McKenzie last saw her son, Christopher, while spending the morning together before they headed to work. McKenzie was a babysitter for her son’s boss. \n\nChristopher worked for survey crew in Elletslie, Georgia. He was with at least three other coworkers, moving through a wooded area, spaced about fifty feet apart. At some point in the early afternoon— some reports state it was noon, others that it was closer to one thirty,– a coworker states that he “looked away from Thompkins for a moment, and by the time he glanced at his area again, Thompkins had disappeared”. \n\nDespite the supposedly momentary vanishing, his mother claims that, “[The survey crew] called me about a few minutes to five to tell me that they couldn’t find him, and they found one of his boots.” Family, friends, volunteers, and law enforcement scoured the area shortly after. On a nearby barbed wired fence, a shred of blue fiber was found, believed to be from Christopher’s pants. His other boot was found five months later in an unspecified nearby area by GBI.\n\nChristopher’s boss has stated that he was supposedly “acting strange” in the days before his disappearance, and law enforcement speculates that drugs could have influenced his disappearance— though neither have any evidence or proof for either assertion.\n\nHis family doesn’t believe in either theory. They state that Christopher didn’t have a drug problem, nor was he behaving differently before he vanished.\n\n“I don’t believe that Chris walked away. I don’t believe he disappeared with one shoe. Who’s going to walk around with one boot on in the cold weather on a rural road? I just don’t believe that happened.

      "title": "Possible new information regarding Teekah Lewis, a two year old who vanished from a bowling alley in Tacoma, Washington in 1999.",
      "text": "While reading the Charley Project blog, I was made aware of new information surrounding the Teekah Lewis abduction which raises all new concerns about her kidnapping and circumstances surrounding it. If you’re unfamiliar with the case, a basic summary from the Charley Project describes it as such:\n\n*Teekah and nearly a dozen of her family spent the evening of January 23, 1999 at New Frontier Lanes bowling alley on Center Street in Tacoma, Washington. Teekah was last seen playing a race car video game in the arcade section of the alley between 10:00 and 10:15 p.m.*\n\n*She was a few feet from her family members and approximately six feet from the building's exit. Teekah's mother, Theresa English, said that she turned away for a moment and the child vanished. She has never been seen again. An extensive search of the area produced few clues as to her whereabouts.*\n\n*A witness at the bowling alley told authorities that an unidentified maroon Pontiac Grand Am sped out of the parking lot during the night Teekah disappeared. The vehicle may have had four doors and was possibly a late 1980s or early 1990s model with dark-tinted windows and a large spoiler.*\n\n*Another witness stated that an unidentified Caucasian man may have followed a child to one of the alley's exits during the night. The individual is described as being in his thirties with shoulder-length brown hair, facial pockmarks, a mustache and a large nose. Investigators do not know if the vehicle or the unidentified man are connected to Teekah's case.*\n\nIn the months and weeks before her abduction, an unknown man with curly brown hair had molested a boy at the same establishment, and later tried to abduct a young boy from the same place. Security guards believed they had seen the same man lurking around the property around the same time. On the day of Teekah’s abduction, a man with a similar description attempted to abduct children in a park that was less than a mile from the bowling alley; the father was able to chase him from the scene. The offender escaped in a blue 1995 Pontiac Grand Am.\n\nIn the ensuing years, the focus has been on this unknown male as being the primary suspect in the abduction of Teekah. Recently though, new information has come up that might point to an alternative suspect. I don’t know what to make of this story, but it seems worth sharing and discussing. \n\nAccording to a NBC Dateline article which included an interview with Teekah's mother, Theresa:\n\n*\"Backup came. I had my boyfriend at the time sit with my daughter, my baby Tamika, she was 10 months old at the time. She was in her car seat asleep,” Theresa said. “I went outside, and I was yelling for Teekah and I was talking to the officer.”*\n\n*That’s when Theresa says something strange happened. “I’m outside with the police and my sister-in-law ran to me and said, “Theresa, that woman has your baby.” But it wasn’t Teekah she was talking about.*\n\n*According to Theresa, earlier in the night, a woman who was with a group of men, was sitting next to them in the bowling alley asking to hold babies. “My brother let her hold his son, but they were right there watching her and then she gave him back,” she said. “She wanted him again. My brother said no because he thought it was odd.”*\n\n*It was the same woman who reportedly had Theresa’s youngest, Tamika. “I was like, ‘What?’ [My sister-in-law] said, ‘She has her in her car,’” Theresa recalled.*\n\n*Theresa told Dateline she ran up to the woman’s car and saw Tamika buckled into the seat, the woman ready to drive off. “I said, ‘You got my daughter,’” Theresa said. “She said, ‘This ain’t your baby.’”*\n\n*Theresa told Dateline she doesn’t know how the woman got her baby but she called over police officer who arrested the woman and gave Tamika back to her.*\n\nIf this information is accurate, then there is an alternate theory of Teekah’s abduction, completely different from the original, which involves a woman snatching a child for herself. Do you think this new information is credible, or relevant? Could this woman be responsible for Teekah’s abduction? Or is this merely a red herring?\n\nSources:\n[‘That was something I hadn’t heard before’](https://charleyross.wordpress.com/2025/02/13/that-was-something-i-hadnt-heard-before/), Charley Project blog\n\n[Teekah Lewis’s Disappearance from Tacoma, Washington, haunts family 26 years later](https://www.nbcnews.com/dateline/cold-case-spotlight/teekah-lewis-disappearance-tacoma-washington-1999-rcna190347)\n\n[Teekah Lewis | Charley Project](https://charleyproject.org/case/teekah-latres-lewis)",

      "text": "The Hoggle siblings went missing in Maryland 10 years ago last month. \n\nThey were 2 and 3 years old at the time of their disappearance. \n\n\"It's hard to even really put into words,\" their dad, Troy Turner says. \"I mean, you realize how long it's been and then you realize how little has really happened.\" \n\nThe National Center for Missing and Exploited Children released an age progression for the siblings at the 10 year mark since their disappearance. \n\nTurner last saw his kids Labor Day weekend in 2014. \n\n\"I remember we had.. a good day overall,\" he says of September 6th. \n\nThe kids' mother, Catherine, had been doing well overall, after a previous hospitalization for mental health. \n\nThe family had also made a plan together with the hospital, that she wouldn't be left alone with the kids. \n\nThe family had gotten together earlier in the day and then he dropped them off at Catherine's parents' house, waiting for Catherine's dad to arrive, before saying goodbye to the kids so he could go to work.   \n  \n\"\\[I\\] kissed the kids goodbye, told them I loved them.\" \n\nThat evening, at some point, Catherine had been left alone with the kids. She apparently took two-year-old Jacob to get some pizza. \n\nWhen Catherine's mother got home and Catherine returned without Jacob, she said she'd left the toddler at a friend's house for a sleepover. \n\n\"No one calls me when she comes back without my child,\" Turner says. \"Had I received that call, then Sarah would still be with us, because the second I got that call, I would have called the police.\" \n\nInstead, he gets home on the later side and decides not to wake the kids with a good night kiss. \n\n\"I say this with great regret,\" he says, \"it's the one that I didn't go in, when I got back later, to kiss my kids and you know, kneel by the bed.\" \n\n\"I was tired and perhaps it was selfish,\" he added. \"I said, if I wake them up, then I'm up too, so I went to sleep.\" \n\nBut the next morning, Catherine and the two kids are gone. \n\nHe's on the phone with police when Catherine pulls up without them. \n\nShe tells Troy that she took them and dropped them off at a daycare. He believed her, until later in the day when he asked her to tell him where to pick them up. Catherine leads Troy on a wild goose chase around Montgomery County from one daycare to another. At one point saying she didn't know the name, location or phone number of where she dropped them off. \n\nTroy eventually decides to go to the police station and Catherine asks to stop for some soda first. They do, because he knows she needs the caffeine with her meds, and she bails. \n\nHe goes without her, to report her missing as well, and Catherine's mother is there, which is when he learns Jacob had never returned home the night before. \n\nCatherine was at one point charged with murder in this case but was found incompetent to stand trial. After 5 years of being found incompetent to stand trial, the State's Attorney had to drop the charges, per Maryland law. \n\nTroy was asked if he thinks his children are still alive. \n\n\"Well, it depends on who you're asking,\" he says. \"If you're asking the logical side of my brain that looks at the facts, talks to the police and things like that, then I believe she probably killed them. If you're asking Sarah and Jacob's father, my job is to believe in my kids and try to find them.\" \n\n[https://www.wmar2news.com/marylandcoldcases/a-fathers-decade-long-fight-to-find-his-kids](https://www.wmar2news.com/marylandcoldcases/a-fathers-decade-long-fight-to-find-his-kids)",

      "title": "On March 2, 1987, 15 year old Mark Garvey left in tears to catch a bus home after an argument with his girlfriend. He was never seen again.",
      "text": "I noticed that Mark didn't have a proper write-up here yet, so I thought I would give it my best shot. The below is my summary of the unresolved mystery surrounding the disappearance of 15 year old British teenager Mark Garvey in 1987.\n\n**Mark Garvey's Background**\n\n*Picture of Mark:* [https://imgur.com/a/zj1nd9H](https://imgur.com/a/zj1nd9H)\n\nFifteen year old Mark Garvey grew up in Merseyside, near the suburban areas of Bootle and Walton just outside of Liverpool in the United Kingdom. In the 1980s, Walton was a largely residential suburb within the Liverpool metropolitan area, connected to Liverpool by public transit. Its most prominent feature is [Goodison park](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goodison_Park), the football stadium for Everton F.C, and Mark was a huge fan.\n\nMark Garvey was the third of four children of Dennis (a social worker) and Dorothy Garvey, who lived in Walton within walking distance of the stadium. He attended the [De La Salle RC Comprehensive Academy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dixons_Croxteth_Academy) (a Catholic school for boys), which is today known as the Dixons Croxteth Academy.\n\nAt school, Mark was among one of the top-performing students academically, and told his family he had dreams of going to law school and becoming a solicitor. By all accounts, he grew up in a loving home. According to his mother, he had a great relationship with her, was responsible, and was usually always home on time.\n\n**Mark Garvey's relationship and the events of March 2, 1987**\n\nIn 1987, Mark was dating a local girl. She was also approximately 15 years old, but was never publicly named as far as I can tell (perhaps because she was also a minor at the time). On March 2, 1987, Mark told his mother he had made plans to go out with her later that evening, and asked her to iron and set out his \"best trousers and shirt\" for his date.\n\nShe did so, and after getting changed, Mark said he would be back later that night by around 9:00 PM. According to Dorothy, the last words he said \"I'm going now, mum\" and left with the exact amount of money he needed to catch his bus home. He left behind a substantial amount of cash he had saved for a school trip.\n\nFor further context, March 3, 1987 was the birthday of Mark's younger brother, and he seemed very excited about it, as the family had a dinner and some excursions planned. According to the family, they had no reason to think Mark was depressed or going through tough times. He was, after all, a star student with big dreams of a future working as a solicitor.\n\nWhen 9:30 PM came around and Mark was not home, the family became somewhat concerned, as this was a little unusual for him to be home late, but thought perhaps he got caught up at his girlfriend's house. He would help his girlfriend babysit her younger siblings, and may have needed to stay later.\n\nBy midnight, Mark's mother Dot decided to drive to Mark's girlfriend's house in the West Derby area of Liverpool, because she was becoming highly alarmed that Mark had not yet come home. Upon arrival, Mark's girlfriend stated she had no idea why he would not have gotten home, and that he left around 9:30 PM to take the bus home from her house.\n\n**The Jolly Miller pub sighting**\n\nPolice would begin investigating, and later learned more about the events of that night from Mark's girlfriend, which I will get to momentarily. However, after tracing the bus route Mark would have taken home from his girlfriend's house, they quickly identified a confirmed sighting of Mark. Mark was seen by multiple witnesses just outside theJolly Miller Pub in West Derby, waiting near the bus stop at the intersection of Mill Lane and Queen's Drive.\n\nAccording to investigators and Mark's mother, this is the exact bus stop Mark would have needed to take in order to begin his commute back home. It would have been a 2.5 mile journey which took no longer than half an hour (meaning Mark should have been home, at the latest, by 10:00 PM). This is the last time anyone ever saw Mark. We have no idea if he ever actually got on a bus, because the only confirmed sighting the police were able to confirm was him waiting at the bus stop.\n\n**The fight between Mark and his girlfriend**\n\nAfter the police began their investigation, it was eventually revealed that Mark and his girlfriend had an argument that same night, just before he left to go home. According to the [Liverpool Echo](https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/news/liverpool-news/police-give-update-case-boy-25751907), after the police interviewed the girlfriend,\n\n>\"It emerged that Mark and his girlfriend had argued after he found her with his best friend. The teenager left in tears to catch a bus and has not been seen since. Police worked extensively on the case in the following months questioning everyone at Mark's school\".\n\n**Analysis, Questions, and Theories**\n\nAfter a life filled with repeated advocacy, as well as insistence that there is something off about Mark's disappearance and pleading to the public for information, Mark's mother Dorothy sadly passed away this year in January 2025 (source: Mark's sister).\n\nThe lack of information about Mark and his girlfriend's fight and the circumstances surrounding Mark's relationship is what surprises me the most about this case. I've seen a few people ask about this in the Facebook group for Mark, but the family, understandably, has not been forthcoming and has largely ignored these questions about what exactly happened between Mark and his girlfriend that night.\n\nAccording to the [Unseen Podcast](https://podcasts.apple.com/gb/podcast/mark-garvey/id1318473466?i=1000589739136), who covered this case, the argument was significant enough to cause the police to publicly speculate in the days following the search that Mark may have been depressed (but this was never spoken about again by the police, and was disagreed with by the family).\n\nSuicide seems the most likely answer, but I am skeptical. If he was upset following the fight with his girlfriend, why would he walk to the bus stop that he would need to take in order to get home? In addition, why didn't the witnesses describe Mark as having been crying or upset? I suppose it's possible he decided to walk away from the bus stop and take his own life while in a state of emotional distress, or take the bus elsewhere in the city instead of getting off at his stop.\n\nBut even if he did decide to take his own life in a state of distress that night, then why was his body never recovered? Could he have jumped into the River Mersey and his body was simply never recovered despite the extensive police search in March 1987?\n\nHopefully this is a mystery that can be solved, in order to honour Dorothy's legacy of passion and dedication to her missing son and bring closure to his family.\n\n**Sources**\n\n[https://podcasts.apple.com/gb/podcast/mark-garvey/id1318473466?i=1000589739136](https://podcasts.apple.com/gb/podcast/mark-garvey/id1318473466?i=1000589739136)\n\n[https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/news/liverpool-news/daughters-promise-dying-dad-find-22439605](https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/news/liverpool-news/daughters-promise-dying-dad-find-22439605)\n\n[https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/news/liverpool-news/man-walked-out-after-argument-20851041](https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/news/liverpool-news/man-walked-out-after-argument-20851041)\n\n[https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/daughter-promise-dying-dad-shell-25681968](https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/daughter-promise-dying-dad-shell-25681968)",

      "title": "[UPDATE] Anson County Jane Doe (2022) identified as Amber Rae Johnston",
      "text": "Hello everyone! I wanted to bring another update to a case I covered in the past, this one being the Anson County Jane Doe (2022). \n\n  \nI wrote about her case [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/UnresolvedMysteries/comments/199wuud/remains_of_a_woman_are_found_during_a_land_survey/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) a year ago, but to recap:\n\n  \nAnson County Jane Doe was a Jane Doe that had been found on the 12th of May in a wooded area behind a National Guard Armory, in Wadesboro, Anson County, North Carolina, USA. Her remains have decomposed significantly by the time she was found, and not a lot of info could've been gleamed from an autopsy, other than that she was White, 20-40 years old, and that she was wearing a black bra and leggings.\n\n  \nThe most notable part of this case is probably the fact that Jane Doe was actually caught on a trail cam (a type of motion-activated camera most commonly used for monitoring passing wildlife). The photos were taken on the 22nd of August 2021, at half past one and half past four AM. They show a woman fitting Jane's description and clothing, walking past what seems to be a deer feeder, using a stick as a sort of walking cane. It's widely believed that Jane and the woman that was caught on the camera are the same person.\n\n  \nEver since the case managed to garner the public's attention in January of 2024, when it was added to NamUS along with the photos, there have been two main candidates often suggested to be Jane's identity: April Michelle Reid and Amber Rae Johnston. April, however, managed to be quickly ruled out due to incompatible dental records. Thanks to a DNA test, it is now conclusive that the remains belong to Amber Rae Johnston. Her mother had shared the confirmation announcment on the 10th of March, five days ago.\n\n  \nAmber was last seen on the 17th of August at the Winston-Salem Greyhound bus station. She had recently broke up with her boyfriend, Jarett Ward. According to him, he left Amber in Bullhead, Arizona, where she lived alone, and he went to to Las Vegas in Nevada to get a greyhound bus ticket from Catholic Charities so that he could come back to his hometown near Myrtle Beach.\n\n  \nA rather strange incident occured on the 8th of August 2021, at around 8 AM. Allegedly, Amber went swimming with a man she had just met, and left all of her belongings, on the water's edge. The man went to get a floatation device, and when he returned, Amber was nowhere to be found. The man wasn't sure if Amber drowned, and contacted the law enforcement, showing her ID as \"proof\". Drones and water search groups were dispached, but Amber's landlady had called the police to tell them that she returned safely soon after. Amber's mother, Sharon Johnston, said that this incident is deeply strange, as she believes that Amber was very careful, and that she would never leave her clothes and ID with someone she barely knew.\n\n  \nAmber left Bullhead on the 16th of August 2021. Ward says that Amber was going to Myrtle Beach to come back to him, while Amber's friend showed Sharon a conversation she had with her, where Amber said that she wants to get away from Jarett, his alleged physical abuse and drugs, and to come back home to Pittsburgh, to be with her own family; Amber had also allegedly asked that friend to help her find a rehab close to where her family lived.\n\n  \nAnother time Amber (or rather, her phone) was traced, she was in Flagstaff in Arizona, on the 15th of August- she made a social media post where she said that she was ready to go back to Pittsburgh and turn herself in for a few warrants she had there. \n\n  \nAt some point in August, a video of someone travelling in a greyhound bus through Birmingham, Alabama, had been uploaded to Amber's social media account. The video is silent and doesn't show who recorded it- the police believe that it was uploaded by someone else than Amber. Amber's friend believes that the video had been recorded by her a long time ago and only uploaded online a long time later. \n\n  \nAmber's ticked purchases had been analyzed by law enforcement, and they learned that Amber bought a ticket to Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, when she was in Winston-Salem. It was paid for and issued, but never used.\n\n  \nJarett had shown a text conversation to Sharon, in which Amber told him that she was staying in a hotel \"One hour from the beach\", and that she wanted him to come and stay with her before they'll go to Myrtle Beach together. She didn't tell him if she's travelling with someone or how she's travelling. It's not specified when did that conversation take place or when it was shown to Sharon.\n\n  \nAmber's phone last pinged in Charlotte. Jarett says that Amber used his SNAP benefits card on a Flying J truck stop on the 19th of August. Since then, Amber's phone had either been shut off or had been discarded. \n\n  \nJarett also told Sharon that Amber had only left Arizona with a small bag with most important belongings, but her landlady claims that Amber took almost everything with her. It's worth noting that back when this Jane Doe was found, rabbit hunters said that they found a bag in the area (in February of 2022), but they claimed that they only took cash out of it- when the area was searched again, the bag has not been found again.\n\n  \nBefore Amber went out on her journey from Arizona, Sharon said that she was acting irrationally, and that she believed that someone was following her. She also told Sharon that she was afraid of Jarett and his mother, and that he'd often steal her phone to access her bank accounts and government benefits. \n\n  \nArizona law enforcement had confirmed that Amber's SNAP benefits and social security benefits had been drained since she disappeared to the day her account was shut off. At some point, Jarett sold Amber's SNAP benefits card to a man named Jerrett Leary, so that he could buy drugs. Amber's debit card has been used by Jarett, Leary, and numerous others to buy things online. \n\n  \nJarett had passed away due to a drug overdose. He was never questioned by police before his death.\n\n  \nSharon said that the identification of Amber's remains was an \"emotional breakdown\" for her, and that the \"horrific\" photos of Amber caught on the camera will \"never leave her\". Nevertheless, she is glad that the photos could be used as one of the tools for identifying Amber. She is also very grateful to all the people who helped and supported her in her search for Amber. \n\n  \nIt's unclear how the investigation into Amber's death will proceed now. Sharon hopes that the person that had been using Amber's SNAP card will be investigated, and that Amber's photos will be shown to the locals who live near where she was found, hoping that someone will recognize seeing her. \n\n  \nAmber will be buried next to her grandparents, with whom she was close. She was a mother of five.\n\n  \nRest easy, Amber.\n\n  \nSOURCES:\n\n1. [ansonrecord.com](https://ansonrecord.com/opinion/op-ed/140368/part-two-who-is-amber-rae-johnston)\n2.

      "title": "Man's partner recieves a phone alert saying that he was in a crash; When she gets to the alleged crashsite, there is no sign of him or a crash, and he is never seen again- What happened to David McAfee? (2022)",
      "text": "Hello everyone! As always, I'd like to thank you for all the comments and votes under my post about the Placer County John Doe- I hope that he will be identified soon.\n\n  \nToday I'd like to highlight a disappearance case.\n\n  \nBACKGROUND\n\n  \nDavid McAfee was 31 when he went missing from New Market, Tennessee, USA.\n\n  \nHe was a father of three sons. David was in a relationship, but the sources conflict on if the woman he was with was his girlfriend, fiance, or wife; I will use the word \"partner\" to refer to her in this write-up. He was the youngest son of his parents, but he also had a younger sister, Kadana, who had just given birth recently, which David was excited about- according to her, he was very supportive of her during her pregnancy. \n\n\n\nDavid's social media says that he was self-employed in Jefferson City (about 4 miles / 6 km away from New Market, and about 7 min by car), but the exact field he worked in isn't specified.\n\n  \nSadly, David had struggled with addiction in the past, but it's not clear if he was involed with any substances at the time of his disappearance.\n\n  \nOn the 6th of April 2021, David had commited a burglary, specified to be \"other than habitation\", which means that he broke into something other than a home, so something like a store or a buisness. He was sentenced on the 26th of April, and was on probation when he went missing- his current status is \"absconded\".\n\n  \nKadana said that she \"(doesn't) know why anyone would ever want to hurt him or anything\" and that David \"makes friends everywhere he goes\".\n\n\n\nDISAPPEARANCE\n\n  \nDavid had been seen at 07:15 AM of the 28th of October at his house off Old Dandridge Pike- his partner saw him sleeping beside her. Later in the day, he was working on a friend's truck, and was seen by a neighbor. Around 2:30 PM, David got a ride to a BP gas station off Asheville Highway, where he was caught by a security camera as he was buying a pack of cigarettes. When his partner returned home, at 3:45 PM, David was nowhere to be found, but his gaming console was still on. David's partner tried to call him, but he wasn't picking up; He finally did around 5:30 PM- he told her that he was still working on the truck. At 6:13 PM, he sent a text message to a friend. \n\n  \nAt 7:30 PM, David's girlfriend had recieved three notifications from David's phone; Because of a certain software feature, IPhone users can have their phone send a message about being in a crash to an emergency contact, and that is why she got the alert. When she called the Jefferson County dispatchers, where the crash allegedly occured, however, she was told that no crashes were reported that day. David's partner went to the alleged crash's location, but didn't find anything. \n\n  \nDavid's partner reported him missing on the next day. His phone had been found behind the Providence Church in Jefferson City; It looked like it was thrown against the wall, and it is likely that this is what caused the crash alert to be sent to David's partner. The phone also attempted to call 911, but the call didn't complete. The last location David's phone was tracked was Walnut Ave., about a minute away from the church.\n\n  \nDavid didn't have his jacket, wallet, and second phone with him when he went missing. His family also noted that he didn't have his hat with him, and he apparently always had it with him. \n\n\n\nCONCLUSION\n\n  \nThere isn't much info on David's case, and what we have doesn't really say much. It seems like his day was going fairly normal, as he was busy fixing his friend's car, but something happened between 5:30 and 7:30 PM, after which David had never been heard from again. \n\n  \nIt would be helpful to know what happened with the truck- was it found, did it went missing with David? Because I feel like that would really help with narrowing down what could've happened. If the truck went missing with David and hasn't been found, then I could see David getting into some sort of accident; Maybe he was testing out the car, crashed into the church and lost his phone, managed to back out and accidentally drove into a body of water? It is a bit farfetched though- I don't know if David could crash into the church unnoticed, as we know that no crash had been reported. \n\n  \nI wish we knew more about the friend David was fixing the truck for- Did they see David that day, were they interviewed, what kind of person they are (are they prone to anger etc)? Something could've happened between them, and David might've ended up hurt; His body was then hidden and the phone was tossed out, with the perpetrator hoping that the phone will break on impact. We don't know a lot about the friend, so it's hard to speculate on that. I'd assume that they were interviewed by the police and nothing conclusive was found. \n\n  \nIn cases like this one, it's hard not to consider that drugs might've played a role. David used to have drug problems in the past, and it's unclear if he was taking any at the time of his disappearance. It's possible that he relapsed for some reason and that he got high. He might've tossed his phone at the church for some reason (known only to him) and had an accident or died of exposure.\n\n  \nI mentioned that David had troubles with the law, because it's possible that he vanished out of his own volition. I don't know how likely that is, though- if this is what happened, then I doubt his family is in on it, given that they seem quite heartbroken about David's disappearance. \n\n  \nSuicide can never be fully crossed out in cases like this, but David's family says that they don't believe that he would commit suicide, and that he wouldn't leave his sons. \n\n  \nDavid Brett Mcafee was 31 when he went missing, and would be 33 now. He is a white male, 5' 11\" - 6' 2\" (71 - 74 Inch / 180 - 188 cm) and 210 - 230 lbs (96 - 104 kg). He has brown hair and blue eyes. He had multiple tattoos: \"CROCKETT\" vertically in light blue and black outline on his left arm, \"ACE\" in black cursive on his left pec, a small black \"cross\" on his right hand in between his thumb and pointer finger, a large black \"nautical star\" outlined blue and green on his left hand between his thumb and pointer finger, and an eagle with rifles and American flags that reads \"PAPAW\" in black cursive on his left bicep.\n\n  \nIf you have any info on David's wherabouts, contact the Jefferson County Sheriff's Office at (865) 765-6422 (case number 22102078).\n\n  \nSOURCES:\n\n1.

      "title": "24 years ago today 10-year-old Tionda and 3-year-old Diamond Bradley disappeared from their home. Their fate is unknown,",
      "text": "24 years ago today, 10-year-old Tionda and 3-year-old Diamond Bradley disappeared from their apartment on the south side of Chicago. Tionda had dreams of becoming a dancer. Diamond was quiet with a gentle smile. This is their story.  \n\nThere were four daughters in the Bradley home in Chicago's Oakland neighborhood: Rita, 12, Tionda, 10, Victoria, 9, and Diamond, 3. Mother Tracy herself was only 32. As the oldest of 9, Tracey had a large extended family in the neighborhood. Her daughters spent time between their mother's apartment and their grandmother's at the Robert Taylor Homes. The night of July 5-6, Rita and Victoria were staying at their grandmother's place, so Tionda and Diamond were alone once their mother left at 6:30 a.m. for her job serving breakfast at Robert Taylor Park. They were always told never to leave and never to answer the door when their mother was gone. Tracy was either picked up or taken to work by her boyfriend, who may have been staying overnight. She called home to check on the girls several times, getting no answer. She got home at 11:30 a.m. The four were supposed to go on an outing to Lake Shafer in Indiana, arranged by the boyfriend in a surprising move.  But the apartment was empty, and Tracey found a note written by Tionda saying that they were going to the store and to the school playground. Tracey started calling around to family and friends to see if they knew where Tionda and Diamond were. But no one did, and a neighborhood search began. By 7 p.m., with nothing found, Tracey called the police to report the disappearance.   \n\nThus began the Chicago Police Department's largest missing person investigation to date. Not only police, but also the FBI and volunteers were involved. Police mapped and searched thousands of empty buildings, looked in sewers, went through tons of garbage, and dredged lakes and rivers. The case received front-page news coverage and even national coverage, with dozens of tips coming in. Neighborhood kids reported seeing the girls at the school playground that morning, and others said they saw Tionda and Diamond playing at the apartment complex as late as 3 p.m. on the 6th. It transpired that Tionda was supposed to be in summer school at Doolittle Elementary that morning. She had perfect attendance up till that date. The school called her home to check, but got no answer. \n\nDespite all their efforts, police did not find the girls nor turn up substantial clues.  \n\nTracey and her boyfriend underwent 22 hours of questioning and took polygraphs. Both seem to have been satisfactory.  But the boyfriend attracted police attention for several reasons:  \n* It's alleged Tionda left a voicemail for her mother about 8:30 a.m., saying the boyfriend was at the door and asking if he should be let in. (Tracey always told the girls not to open the door to anyone when she wasn't there.) But Tracey didn't get the voicemail, or listen to it.   \n* This could have been a message from a neighbor with the same name, but she would likely have used their nickname for him.   \n* On July 7, the boyfriend purchased 42 gallon contractor bags, neoprene gloves, and gardening gloves. 5 bags were missing when police searched his home.    \n* Neighbors claimed to have seen him burning something in a 55 gallon drum. He then put the drum in his car. There were scorch marks on the roof of his garage.  \n* He had a blanket in his trunk with some of Tionda's hairs. He said it was from going to the drive-in.  \n* He made over 40 phone calls on July 6.  \n\nWhen Tracey became pregnant with Diamond, the boyfriend denied paternity. Tracey insisted on a paternity test just a month before the girls disappeared. The results came back in late July, showing that he was, indeed, Diamond's father.  \n\nGeorge has denied any involvement in the girls' disappearance. Even today, he says the police, media and family ganged up to accuse him. To the family's dismay, successive Cook County States Attorneys have failed to convene a grand jury or bring charges against him, as the evidence is all circumstantial and not considered sufficient to support a case.   \n\nNor have they charged anyone else. 100 sex offenders were among the many people interviewed. One of them had spent some time around the girls and dedicated a book to them. Police also looked at their neighbor with the boyfriend's name, who sometimes babysat for them. Kids from their school said the girls were on the playground and were approached by a light-skinned man in a trench coat.  But none of these have proved to be viable suspects.  \n\nTracey Bradley came under criticism by the police, who said she was not always cooperative, and even some neighbors, who thought she was not doing enough. It was alleged that she went to the grocery store to buy food before starting to search for the girls. People questioned why it took her so long to report the disappearance to the police. To this she had an answer, the fear that her other children would be taken away from her. She defended herself in a radio interview on WVON.  \n\nFamily were doubtful about the note the girls left for their mother. Although the FBI has determined that it was written by Tionda, and not written under duress, some family members feel the wording is too correct and advanced for a child of Tionda's age. They wonder if it was dictated by an adult. Family were also critical of the investigation, stating that too many peopel, from family and friends to law enforcement, were in and out of the apartment before fingerprints and other forensic materials were obtained.\n\nIn May 2023, a woman in Texas posted a TikTok purporting to be Diamond Bradley. She was fingerpinted and had DNA tested by the FBI. It proved to be a hoax, one of about a dozen that got the family's hopes up, only to be dashed again.  \n\nThe family and friends held vigils, first for 40 days after the disappearance, and now annually on the anniversary. The case has had lasting effects on loved ones. Mother Tracey has suffered panic attacks. Sister Victoria worried as a child about being abducted, and as a mother herself, is protective and worried about her own children. She turned 9 on July 9, 2001. She said she did not celebrate her birthday for 20 years, because it was in the shadow of losing her sisters. Aunt Shelia Bradley-Smith continued to search for clues and became active in the missing children community. Another aunt, April Jackson, has worked with schools and stores on programs related to kids' safety  from stranger danger.    \n\nAn unusual feature of this case is the extent of the police investigation and the widespread media coverage of the disappearance. This has not been the norm when a child of color goes missing, especially 24 years ago. More often they are considered to be runaways. It's to the credit of the Bradley extended family that the case received the attention it deserves. They advocated fiercely for Tionda and Diamond. Almost 25 years later, people still know about the case because of them. \n\nHowever, their advocacy has not brought about the desired results. It seems the case is little more advanced than it was in the summer of 2001. The current states attorney has stated that “We are open to reviewing any information that is brought to us by law enforcement, who is handling the investigation of this case.” So far, they have not been asked. The latest information I could find on the investigation is that it is in the hands of the Cold Case Unit. There are, however, officers who are determined to find the truth. This includes a private investigator who has been on the case since the beginning. Today, the CPD released this statement: \"(Area One) detectives have and will continue to follow up when tips are received. At this juncture, there are no new leads.\" - [Fox32 Chicago](https://www.fox32chicago.com/news/new-age-progressed-photos-revealed-24-years-missing-bradley-sisters)  \n\nTionda Bradley would now be 34 years old. Diamond would be 27. Anyone who has information about their disappearance should call Chicago Police at 312-745-5020 or the FBI at 312-421-6700.  \n\nSources  \n\n[Charley Project, Diamond Yvette Bradley](https://charleyproject.org/case/diamond-yvette-bradley)  \n[Charley Project, Tionda Bradley](https://charleyproject.org/case/tionda-z-bradley)     \n“Girls' Neighbors Turn to Prayer,” Chicago Tribune, Tue, Jul 10, 2001  \n“Two young sister missing since last week in Chicago,” The Morning Call, Thu, Jul 12, 2001  \n[Bradley sisters who ‘vanished into thin air’ still missing 15 years later](https://www.chicagotribune.com/2016/07/06/bradley-sisters-who-vanished-into-thin-air-still-missing-15-years-later/)  \n[Bradley Sisters Disappearance Remembered with Family Vigil](https://www.chicagotribune.com/2016/07/06/bradley-sisters-disappearance-remembered-with-family-vigil/)  \n[For 20 years, the family of Tionda and Diamond Bradley has asked: Where are our girls?\n](https://chicago.suntimes.com/news/2021/7/3/22561553/tionda-and-diamond-bradley-missing-for-20-years-family-asks-where-are-our-girls-chicago)  \n[Who is Diamond Bradley?

      "title": "I've been getting caught up on the Netflix remake of Unsolved Mysteries recently, and there are a couple cases (that are new to me, at least) that I'd love to hear people's thoughts about.",
      "text": "1. **Amanda Antoni:** Amanda died mysteriously in her home in October 2015. Her husband had been out of town visiting his mom several hours away (supposedly the first time they'd spent a night away from each other since being married); he was on the phone with Amanda that Saturday evening, I believe, when he heard the couple's dog squeel and then the phone suddenly went dead. He couldn't reach Amanda for the remainder of that weekend, then returned home on Monday to find Amanda dead in the home's basement from massive blood loss. It was reportedly an incredibly gruesome scene.\n\nThe investigation initially focused on the husband, but a combination of phone records and security cam footage from gas stations along his route proved conclusively that he was out of town the entire three days. There's also no evidence of a murder for hire, according to investigators. Amanda's sister-in-law, who had drug problems, and whose children had recently been taken away by Child Protective Services, she felt, because of Amanda and her husband, then came under suspicion, but there was nothing to connect her to the scene. The fact the apparent murder weapon, a broken ceramic piggy bank (shards of which were found embedded in Amanda's face), bore no foreign finger prints, and even had a layer of dust covering it that appeared to be undisturbed, eventually led investiagors to theorize that Amanda had accidentally stepped on (or tripped over) the dog, hence the loud yelp heard by Amanda's husband, causing her to fall down the basement steps and strike her head on the piggy bank, which was sitting on a shelf lining one wall, on the way down. An indentation in the wall behind where the bank was sitting supports this hypothesis.\n\nNot everyone buys this scenario, however, as a chair was found overturned in the kitchen, and Amanda's phone was found on the floor, broken, both several feet away from the stairwell. Here's a link to a [Newsweek article](https://www.newsweek.com/unsolved-mysteries-amanda-antoni-calgary-theories-1936665) about the case.\n\n2. **Tiffany Valiante:** In July 2015, Tiffany, a high school athlete looking forward to starting college, stormed out of her parents' home after being confronted about (admittedly) using a friend's credit card without permission. A few hours later Tiffany's body was found on / near a set of train tracks two or three miles away, partially dismembered; New Jersey Transit Authority police declared the death a suicide, but the family (and investigators they've hired) have questions, including why Tiffany apparently removed her shoes a mile into her nearly three-mile journey (they were found by the roadside along the route Tiffany would've taken), despite the fact the ground near the train tracks was allegedly covered with gravel and sharp rocks; and why the shorts she was wearing when she left the house that night have never been found. Here's a [link](https://www.newsweek.com/tiffany-valiante-unsolved-mysteries-volume-3-netflix-1753266).\n\n3. **Joshua Guimond:** In Nov. 2002, Josh disappeared after leaving a party at St. John's University in Collegeville, MN. It was initially assumed he'd fallen into the (at the time frozen) waters of a nearby lake -- a bridge spanning the lake was on his route home -- but there was no break in the ice, and Josh's body never surfaced after the thaw the following Spring. A search of the computer in Josh's dorm room revealed that someone had run a program to remove his internet search history AFTER Josh's disappearance (his room had been left unlocked and unattended until its contents were claimed by his father about two weeks later); later recovery efforts revealed that Josh had been speaking to other men online under the guise of two different (apparently female) accounts on a singles site, leading to speculation that he may have been exploring his sexuality or gender identity (though some close to him dispute this) and may have met his presumed killer online. Here's a [link](https://www.mprnews.org/story/2022/10/30/20-years-after-josh-guimonds-disappearance-stearns-county-releases-new-information).\n\nAnyone familiar with any of these cases? Have any theories?",

      "text": "Myra Lewis, age 2 at the time of her disappearance, has been missing from Mississippi since March 1, 2014.  She was last seen by family members, between 10:30 am and 11 am, playing outside her home in Camden, Mississippi.\n\nMyra was allegedly last seen by her mother, Ericka Lewis, at their home on Mount Pilgrim Road. Ericka Lewis said Myra and her sister were outside playing as she left to go shopping. Lewis said she told them to go inside, where Gregory Lewis, Ericka’s husband, was playing video games and looking after their 1-month-old.\n\nGregory Lewis told reporters at the time that he had set out to look for Myra on his ATV and that he had tried to track her with the family dogs. Once the family dogs, who were not tracking dogs, couldn’t find the scent, police tracking dogs were brought in after the fact and were unable to locate Myra.\n\nThe family told authorities they believed the child had been snatched from the rural road by a stranger.\n\nThe search began on the property at least four to five hours after Myra disappeared into thin air. Local, state, and federal law enforcement began combing the 4 square miles surrounding the child’s home, including a pond across the street.\n\nEricka and Greg Lewis, who could fairly be described as not very forthcoming with police, have moved out of the area. Efforts to find them by law enforcement and journalists have been unsuccessful. They have disappeared, though arguably not as completely as Myra.\n\nThe lead investigator Sheriff Tucker, thinks someone in the household knows what happened to Myra. He thinks one of or both of the parents are responsible for the disappearance. \n\nhttps://darkhorsepressnow.com/myra-lewis-missing-9-years-is-still-the-states-longest-standing-amber-alert/\n\nhttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disappearance_of_Myra_Lewis\n\nhttps://www.fbi.gov/wanted/kidnap/myra-lewis",

      "title": "Four siblings vanish one day along with their non-custodial parents; The family adopted 13 kids, with some of them disabled, and lived a devoutly christian life on their farm- Where are Perpetua, Ezekiel, Justice, and Ava Bushey? (2023)",
      "text": "Hello everyone! As always, thank you for all your comments and votes on my last post about Karl Klinge- I hope that he will be able to be buried under his own name soon.\n\n  \nThis case is quite unusual, as it involves four people- adopted siblings, all under 18- who went missing together.\n\n  \nBACKGROUND\n\n  \nWhen the Bushey kids went missing in 2023, they were all so very young- Perpetua was 15, Ezekiel was 13, Justice was 12, and the youngest, Ava, was just 6. They were last seen in Whitewater, Wisconsin, USA.\n\n  \nThey were members of a large adoptive family lead by Chad and Kim Busheys. The missing four weren't the Busheys' only children- their other siblings include Kari, Elizabeth (now 21), Jeremiah (now 20), Hannah, Ezra, and Emily. They had three other siblings, who have sadly passed away in late 2022/early 2023: Samuel, Grace (died at 16), and Joseph (died at 13). I do not know the ages of all the children, as I can't find them in any sources, but they are not considered missing; Kari, Elizabeth and Jeremiah seem to be adults, so I'm assuming they're probably living on their own, but Hannah, Ezra and Emily are listed after Ava in Grace's obituary- wouldn't that imply that they were younger than Ava? They aren't, however, listed as missing, so I'm assuming they're accounted for- it's possible that they were taken away by CPS, for example. \n\n  \nChad and Kim were open to adopting children with congenital diseases like Huntington's Disease, which is the cause of death of Grace and Joseph. Perpetua also has Huntington's, while Ava has cerebral palsy and has to use a wheelchair. \n\n  \nThe Busheys were a devout christian family who seemed to live a farming lifestyle- during an artisan fair, they were selling jewelry, knitted items, dog treats, wood work, goat milk soap, and other trinkets. An article about the family that was, admittedly, written about 12 years ago, said that they kept chickens, llamas and goats at the time. They also seem like big fans of a TV station called the Christian Broadcasting Network, and they made regular payments towards their Orphan's Promise charity. The Busheys ran a ministry for the children called \"The Carpenter's Flock\". By the time the siblings went missing, they were non-custodial parents of them.\n\n  \nWhen she was 11, Perpetua loved \"horses, gardening, art, piano, feeding her baby sister, singing, gymnastics\", and has been described as \"liking everything\".\n\n  \nWhen he was 9, Ezekiel loved \"sports, swimming, being a jokester, piano, lego\\`s, math, biking, and wrestling with brothers\".\n\n  \nWhen he was 7, Justice loved \"legos, piano, his little sister, sledding, math\". He was a fast runner and loved to run, plus he was very creative with cardboard boxes. \n\n  \nSadly, we don't know anything about little Ava, other than the fact that she suffered from cerebral palsy and used a wheelchair.\n\n\n\nDISAPPEARANCE\n\n  \nSadly, the only thing we know about the disappearance of the siblings is that they were reported missing on the 5th of September 2023. A welfare check was performed at the family's residence, only to discover that they were all gone. There's no info on any mode of transport, clothes anyone was wearing, just nothing. \n\n  \nChad had entered a civil tort in December of 2023, asking for a change of address, but the new address is just a UPS store in California. The house they owned was sold in January of this year.\n\n\n\nCONCLUSION\n\n  \nI'm sorry that this writeup is so short on the actual details of the disappearance, but I've been seeing this case brought up on websleuths for some time now and it bothered me every time, so I decided to write about it on the off chance that someone who might know anything will read it. \n\n  \nHow come four kids, and at least two of them heavily disabled and in need of extensive medical care, simply vanish like this, with seemingly nobody caring much? There are no articles on the case, nothing. If not for the NCMEC posters and a few social media posts by law enforcement, nobody would know they were even missing. Someone was clearly concerned about the quality of care the siblings were recieving if a welfare check was conducted. \n\n  \nEven without the disappearance, I find the whole situation troubling. Chad and Kim had 12 kids in total, with some of them disabled- there's no way that there was no parentification happening, and the older kids weren't forced to look after their younger siblings. It's simply impossible to provide all kids with adequate attention and care at that amount of children, with some of them requiring so much additional care. I also wonder if the kids had to work on the farm and help keep the family afloat to some degree. I saw cases like this one before, where a deeply religious christian family adopts many, many children as a form of faith affirmation, and then doesn't provide them with right conditions to grow up, makes them look after their younger siblings and work in some kind of family buisness. I'm not saying this is 100% the case here, but it's obvious to me that even if Chad and Kim were the world's most loving and caring parents, they simply wouldn't be able to look after that many kids without neglecting some of their emotional needs. The fact that there is reason to believe that the ill children aren't recieving the proper medical care is also saying a lot.\n\n\n\nI wonder what do the older siblings of Perpetua, Ezekiel, Justice, and Ava are thinking. I wonder if they know anything about where their siblings might be, or if they do know, but don't want to divulge it to law enforcement. \n\n\n\nI also wonder if Chad and Kim have any help from people who think they're right and are supporting their cause- a bit like it is assumed in the case of Tom Phillips in New Zealand, who is assumed to be living in the bush with his three children for three years now. They seemed to be quite close with the local community back in 2012, but I personally feel like they are probably hiding in another state.\n\n  \nPerpetua is biracial (hispanic/white), has brown hair and eyes, and wears glasses. She would be about 16 now. She has Huntington's disease. Ezekiel is Black, has black hair and brown eyes. He would be about 13. Justice is Black, has black hair and brown eyes. Ava is white and has brown hair and eyes. She would be about 7 now. She suffers from cerebral palsy and uses a wheelchair. The siblings might be accompanied by Chad Bushey (white male, long, brown hair, might have facial hair) and Kim Bushey (White female. Blond/brown hair, brown eyes. Her ears are pierced. She may use the last names \"Broome,\" \"Raatz,\" \"Urbanek,\" and/or \"Young\"). \n\n  \nIf you know anything about the wherabouts of any of the siblings, contact the Walworth County Sheriff's Office at 262-741-3200.\n\n\n\nSOURCES:\n\n1.

      "text": "On January 25, 2002, 18-year-old [Vincent Lamouris](https://i.redd.it/0y7aym8cezae1.jpeg) from Ghent, Belgium took a train by himself to the airport and got on a one-way flight to New York City with just a single backpack. The day before, he told his mother he'd be working at Pizza Hut that night, but after calling his workplace, she discovered he wasn't even scheduled to work that day. She reported him missing.\n\n\nOnce Vincent arrived in New York, immigration officials told him he had to purchase a return ticket to comply with immigration laws, which was booked for February 9. He never boarded that flight. Vincent's passport records show he crossed into Canada at Niagara Falls on January 25, then re-entered the United States on January 31.\n\n\nOn February 2, Vincent's backpack was found at Prospect Park in Niagara Falls, New York. It contained his passport, his return plane ticket, $25 in Canadian currency, $10 in American currency, and the classic novel The Catcher in the Rye. The book's protagonist, Holden Caulfield, is a teen misfit who runs away to New York City after he fails out of high school.\n\n\nTwo years prior, at age 16, Vincent had attempted suicide by jumping from a building. After 6 months in the hospital, he made a complete physical recovery and returned to school. Niagara Falls is a popular spot for suicides, but no eyewitness has ever come forward and Vincent's body was never found.\n\n\nStriving to find answers, police searched Vincent's computer, but he'd erased his hard drive. His mom has repeatedly asked American Airlines to tell her who her son was sitting next to on the flight to New York, but A.A. has refused to give the name, citing privacy concerns. Vincent's mom recalls they were once watching TV together and a news segment about the manhunt for Osama bin Laden came on. Vincent said: \"Mom, if I ever disappeared, they'd never find me.\"\n\n\nOn January 31, the day Vincent re-entered the United States, someone called Vincent's mother: \"The phone call came from far away, so it seemed. But nobody said anything. I suspect it was Vincent, when he stood at the edge of the falls.\" She still hopes her son didn't harm himself and instead began a new life in the United States or Canada. Nonetheless, she has told her daughters that her final wish is for her ashes to be scattered at Niagara Falls.\n\n\nSources:\n\n* https://charleyproject.org/case/vincent-s-lamouris\n* https://www.nieuwsblad.be/cnt/dmf20170125_02694633 (Dutch)\n* https://www.standaard.be/cnt/e82mgueb (Dutch)",

      "title": "In April of 1990, 17 year old Christopher Kerze left his home after feigning an illness, and never returned. Soon, a strange letter appeared at the home, strange calls placed to his friends, but Christopher had never been found. Where is he?  ",
      "text": "In April of 1990, seventeen year old [Christopher Matthew Kerze](https://www.missingkids.org/poster/NCMC/738703/1) lived with his parents Loni & Jimmy in Eagan, Minnesota, just southwest of Minneapolis. Christopher was known to be an excellent student, who was a part of the National Honors Society as well as being a National Merit Scholar semi-finalist, and when he wasn’t working on his studies, he swam on the high school’s swim team and played the clarinet in the high school band. Christopher had a handful of outdoor hobbies, including skiing and camping, as well as hobbies he enjoyed alone and indoors, like reading, and working on his computer. Christopher was known to be very intelligent and reliable, and since his studies were incredibly important to him, he rarely missed school unless it was for a serious reason. That’s why on April 20, 1990, his mother was confused that Christopher would ask to stay home from school due to a headache, but he insisted, and she agreed. Jim later said of his son’s reliability: \n\n> *“He was a guy who, when he decided to do something, he would do it. What you need to know is, he’s always been a very great kid. He was a smart kid, a good sense of humor.\"*\n\n\nOn the morning of April 20th, Christopher awoke and complained to his mother of a pounding headache, so she gave him so pain medication and they agreed that he should stay home and rest, instead of suffering throughout the school day. Since Loni had to go to work for the day at a local elementary school, and Jim was away on a business trip, Christopher would be left alone for the majority of the day, which was fine with him- he was 17 years old and could care for himself. Later that evening when Loni came home, she was confused to find that the family’s blue 1988 Dodge Caravan was missing from the driveway, and that the family dog, Bowser, was running loose in the front yard. When she entered the home, she expected to find Christopher, but instead, she found a note on the kitchen table, that read: \n\n> *”Mom, something important came up + feeling somewhat better. Back by six. (Unless I get lost.) Love, Chris.”*\n\nThe word lost has been underlined twice, which Loni attributed to the little joke between them about how Christopher always managed to get lost when he went out driving, as he was still a beginner. However, six o’clock rolled around with no sign of Christopher, and as the hours ticked by, Loni began to grow increasingly concerned. At some point in the evening, Loni called Jim to fill him in on what was going on, about the note left behind, and how Christopher hadn’t returned as planned. Jim left his business trip and immediately headed home, and around midnight, the couple called the local police to report Christopher as missing. In true 90’s fashion, the police told the parents that they had to wait at least 24 hours before reporting someone missing- it is important to note that this is no longer the case, and in current times, you can report someone missing as soon as you feel you need to. \n\nThe next day Christopher’s parents called the police department back, and officially filed a missing person’s report. That same day, a letter was delivered to the family home, which was post marked from Duluth, roughly two hours away. The letter was from Christopher- both parents had agreed that the handwriting looked similar to their son’s- but the contents of the letter were extremely troubling. The note stated that Christopher had faked his headache the day before in order to skip school and leave the home, and so that he could take the van and *“go to not even I know where.”* He claimed that he had intended to take his own life, and that he was deeply sorry for hurting his family with this decision. He ended off his letter saying: \n\n> *“Take heart, because if just one person is better off for having known me, my life will not have been wasted.”*\n\nLoni and Jim were devastated and confused at the letter, and while they had felt that Christopher may have been going through some personal struggles at the time, he didn’t show any signs of going as far as to end his life. Two other things were discovered on April 21st: the parents learned that Christopher had withdrawn $200 from his savings account, and disturbingly, Jim’s O.F. Mossberg & Sons 20-gauge shotgun was missing, however, the ammo which he stored separately was not touched. \n\nTwo days later, in the George Washington Forest outside of Grand Rapids, authorities discovered the Kerze’s vehicle- it had been left abandoned. Inside the caravan police discovered the keys, as well as a note stating who the vehicle had belonged to. Police and the Kerze family were puzzled as to why the van was found where it was- all the could think of was that Christopher’s grand parents had lived in Grand Rapids, but they claimed they hadn’t seen him at all over the last few days. Search dogs were brought in, and they did pick up a scent which led them about one mile into the forest, when it abruptly stopped. Sadly, nothing was able to be found. Jim said this, about the whole situation: \n\n> *“I tell you when people talk about their heart sinking, I used to think that was some metaphor. It is not. You can be so torn up that your heart actually feels like it is dropping. It weighs a lot. It’s a moment that I hope never to live through again.”*\n\nPolice began to branch out their investigation, and spoke to witnesses who may have seen something. An eyewitness came forward to law enforcement stating that he had picked up a man resembling Christopher, who was attempting to hitchhike. The witness had dropped his passenger off in Duluth, where the letter had been mailed from. Another witness came forward, a good friend of Christopher’s, who claimed he had begun to receive some strange calls in the wake of his friend’s disappearance. He received multiple calls from an unknown number, and when he answered, no one would say anything, but the friend stated that he could hear background noise, which sounded like a party was going on. Whenever the friend would try to engage with the person on the other line, the caller would abruptly hang up. These calls lasted for about 6 months, and Loni and Jim held on to this as a sign that their son was still alive. \n\nOther strange tips came in to law enforcement over a few months: one man claimed that he had seen Christopher in Old Orchard Beach, Maine, however, this tip could never be verified. Months after Christopher’s disappearance, a hunter stumbled upon a gun in the woods, which matched the description of the gun that Jim owned and had gone missing. While police believed that his gun found was one and the same as the gun Christopher had taken, it also could never be verified. \n\nIn 2004, a letter came into the  police department investigating the case, from an anonymous writer. This person claimed that Christopher was their “guardian angel,” and that he would come home when he sees fit. The letter urged the police department to stop searching for Christopher, because he was alive. With nothing else to go on, police would eventually consider this letter a hoax, but it was yet another instance that would spark hope in the heart’s of Loni and Jim.\n\nLoni and Jim eventually moved from the home that Christopher had left that spring morning of 1990, but they kept the same phone number in hopes that one day, Christopher might reach out to them. They are still extremely active in searching for their son, and as recent as 2016, they did an interview pleading for their son to come home, with Jimmy saying: \n\n>*“Resolution is a funny thing. We aren’t going to know anything about what happened to Christopher until one day when we’ll know everything that happened to Christopher. So the idea here is to generate enough noise so that we can begin to find resolution.”*\n\nIn 1993, the band Soul Asylum released a music video for their song “Runaway Train,” which originally featured the photos of 36 missing persons. A photo of Christopher Kerze is featured at the 3:26 mark. While 21 people featured on the video were eventually recovered, the music video led to some criticism when one of the missing girl’s featured on the video was identified, and made to return home to an abusive household. Four of the missing children on the Runaway Train videos were discovered to be deceased, while 11 are still currently missing, including Christopher Matthew Kerze. \n\n\nWhen last seen, Christopher was described as standing at 5’11, and weighing 135 pounds. He had brown hair, and brown eyes, and had cystic acne. Christopher was last seen wearing  “A mid-calf length acid-washed light blue denim trench coat that came down to between his knees and ankles, a size large black cotton sweatshirt, size 29M blue or black Bugle Boy jeans with pockets at the knees, a black leather belt, white crew sweatsocks, size 30 J.C. Penney underwear with a blue stripe and an elastic waistband, size 11 or 11 1/2 brown leather boat shoes, and a plastic Swatch watch with a black and white zebra-striped band. Carrying a black bi-fold leather wallet with his Minnesota driver's license.”\n\n© TaraCalicosBike 2024\n\n\n\n**Links** \n\n[Charley Project](https://charleyproject.org/case/christopher-matthew-kerze)\n\n[Missing Kids.org](https://www.missingkids.org/poster/NCMC/738703/1)",

Yesterday, a car matching the description of Tony’s Cutlass was seized from the home of Atlanta, Indiana’s utility superintendent/building commissioner, believed to be in relation to Tony’s case. ",
      "text": "**Case:**\n\nTony Bledsoe vanished on March 16, 1992. The 24-year-old husband and father left his Arcadia, Indiana home in route to nearby Noblesville, Indiana. He was last seen driving his black and gray 1971 Oldsmobile Cutlass, with a vanity license plate reading “TJSTOY,” on Indiana 19 at around 10am. Tony left behind all of his personal belongings. He had a total of eight dollars in cash, and his car had only an eighth of a tank of gas. No trace of Tony, nor his car, have ever been found.”\n\nIn January 2023, efforts were made to organize a search for Tony and his missing Cutlass in nearby lakes and quarry’s using sonar. Unfortunately, those plans fell through when the team was met with some unexpected obstacles. \n\n**Update:**\n\n“Yesterday, a large scale police investigation unfolded on a quiet street in a small Indiana town in Hamilton County. The home belongs to Andy Emmert, Utility Superintendent and Building Commissioner of Atlanta, Indiana. \n\nDetectives with Indiana State Police and other law enforcement agencies showed up in large numbers at Andy’s home located at the corner of Meridian and Walnut Street in Atlanta around 8:30 a.m. on Wednesday.\n\nISP detectives spent some eight hours on the property, which stirred quite a few questions for those living in the town of about 760 people.\n\nInvestigators loaded up two cars during the afternoon: one from the home and the other from the nearby garage. Both cars were Oldsmobile Cutlass vehicles. One of which was taken from the home, while the other was towed away from the garage across the street.”\n\nWhile law enforcement have not made any public statements in regards to the search, just hours ago, FOX59 reporter Angela Ganote confirmed it is believed the search was in relation to Tony’s case; \n\n“Utility Superintendent and Building Commissioner Andy Emmert placed on administrative leave while Indiana State Police continue their investigation that grabbed so much attention while at his home yesterday. \n\nMultiple sources confirm this investigation is tied to Tony Bledsoe, who was 24 years old at the time of his disappearance in 1992.\n\nTonight you will hear from one of Tony Bledsoe’s sons. He was only five when he last saw his dad. I know he hopes he has answers soon.”\n\nAndy Emmert has not been arrested nor has he been announced as a suspect. He has, however, been placed on administrative leave pending the outcome of the investigation. \n\nI would also like to extend my sincere gratitude to Tony's family for taking the time to reach out to provide me with this updated information. I offer my deepest condolences to you, and hope this new information will finally shed some light on the circumstances surrounding Tony’s disappearance. \n\nI will update this story as more information becomes available. \n\nETA: Just to clarify, Indiana State Police have yet to confirm the search was in relation to Tony’s case. Additionally, Andy Emmert has NOT been named as a suspect. \n\n**Sources**\n\nPer the rules of this sub, I cannot post links to FB.

      "title": "Around midnight on April 26, 2000 Star Palumbo was running along the tarmac at the Reno International Airport, searching for her sister that she didn’t have, before she disappeared. Eight months later, there was a possible strange sighting of Star 250 miles away. What happened to Star Palumbo? ",
      "text": "[Star Michelle Palumbo](https://imgur.com/a/rCUUHYx) was born on March 29, 1975, and she was born into a military family, who would often move around to different cities and states in her childhood. In 1999, Star was living with her mother, Gail, in Tucson, Arizona, but looking for a change in her life, Star decided she wanted to move to Reno, Nevada, and to live with her grandmother. Star’s grandmother lived about 10 miles east of Reno, in the town of Lockwood, and once there, Star secured employment at a local pawn shop in Sparks. This employment was short lived, however, and Star eventually either quit or lost her job working there. Shortly after her employment ended at the pawn shop, Star moved out of her grandmother’s home, and moved in with a roommate. Star’s friends would later recall that at some point, Star had become involved with drugs, specifically methamphetamines, and that her employment at the pawn shop was not enough to support her costly drug habit. Authorities believe that Star may have turned to sex work as a means to support this habit. \n\nStar had kept in touch with her mother often, and would call her weekly, usually in good spirits. However, on April 25, 2000, Star phoned her mother in Tucson telling her that there was a possibility that she wanted to move back to Tucson and start her life over. Her mother stated that Star seemed very on edge and paranoid during this phone conversation, with Star telling her that she believed she was being followed and that her phone was being tapped. She had also made cryptic comments about how she feared for her life, but when Gail pressed her for more information, Star said that she couldn’t say anything more than that. Star told her mother that she knows she had made some mistakes in her life, but that she was ready to start over and move back in with her mother, and her mother was happy to welcome her back with open arms. Sadly, Star would never make it back to her mother’s home in Tucson, and the two would never speak again. \n\nIn the early morning hours of April 26th, the day after the phone call with her mother, Star was spotted wandering around a restricted area at the Reno/Tahoe International Airport, seemingly disoriented and scared. Airport police went to the area she was seen walking, and found her cowering behind a truck behaving quite nervously. When spoken to, Star identified herself and told the officers that she was trying to find her younger sister who had been running around the tarmac. Strangely, Star did not have a younger sister, but without the airport police knowing that, they didn’t keep her. The airport police also performed a search for Star’s sister along the tarmac, but didn’t find anyone. The officer felt that while she was being dishonest, she didn’t seem to have any criminal intent, so they dropped Star off at a nearby hotel per her request, the Reno Hilton Hotel and Casino. Star was seen walking from the valet parking area to the entrance of the hotel at around 1:30 am. This was the last anyone would see of Star Palumbo. When the officer was spoken to after Star’s disappearance, he claimed that he believed that Star had been hallucinating, and while her behavior was strange, he had no reason to detain her. \n\nThe following day, Star’s car was discovered illegally parked and abandoned at the airport that she had been at the night prior, near the baggage claim area. The car was linked to Star through license plate records. When the car was impounded and searched, police discovered some disturbing items left behind. Inside Star’s car were her personal possessions- her purse which held $600 in cash, as well as her cell phone. However, there were also copies of three emails she had written and printed out, which had been sent to the White House where she had accused the government of trying to assassinate her for stumbling upon a dangerous investigation. There was also a drawing Star had made, of a woman who was bound and gagged, with the words “I didn’t know we were forced to have Jack in The Box” scribbled above the drawing. Additionally, there were two books about trying to change one’s identity. When Star never showed up at the impound lot to claim her vehicle, and was missing for over a week, her grandmother grew concerned and reported her as missing.  When authorities had learned about Star’s incident at the Reno/Taboe airport, they spoke to the airport policeman who has taken Star to the Hilton hotel. Once they checked the records of the hotel registration for the morning of April 26th, they learned that Star had never checked in there. \n\nOnce Gail and Star’s father learned of Star’s disappearance, they quickly packed their bags and travelled from Tucson to Reno to help in the search for her missing daughter. The family would place missing persons flyers all across the state, in hopes of learning new information about where Star may have ended up. When police dug into the case, they found numerous different men’s phone numbers in Star’s phone book, which led police to wonder if Star’s friends had been right, and that she had taken up sex work to supplement her income and afford her her drug habit. Combined with her new erratic behavior, and the fact that Star believed her new roommate was actually an undercover cop, police believed that Star’s disappearance may have been drug induced. Investigators were able to procure Star’s journal, where they found passages that read:\n\n>  *“I just found out that the world is made up of lies and deception, and I really feel robbed of my life. At this moment, I am alone and need help.”*\n\nInvestigators began to wonder if Star had either committed suicide, or left her life behind, and obtained a new identity to escape drug debts. The theory that Star may have overdosed and her body was dumped in the desert also was considered. Despite these conflicting theories, those in Star’s circle were spoken to, and the police chief stated to the media:\n\n> *“Thirty different people have been spoken to, and they all have conflicting stories. There are just so many unsubstantiated rumors. There is a good chance she is trying to change her identity and she has not met with foul play. We’re looking into it all.”*\n\nMonths went by, and without any solid leads to chase, police were beginning to feel as if they weren’t going to be able to solve Star’s case. In December of 2000, eight months after Star had disappeared, police were contacted by a woman named Linda Fields, who owned the Silver Dollar Casino, in Elko, Nevada, over 250 miles away from Reno. Linda told authorities that she had seen Star in her casino, and that she had even spoken to her. Linda went on to say that Star had seemed frightened, and she had told Linda that her name was Star and that she was being chased by a pimp. Linda claimed that Star looked out a window, and began to get nervous, and when Linda peered out the window to see what she was looking at, an unknown man was staring back at them.  Upon seeing the man staring at her, Star abruptly left the casino with an unknown woman. Linda was adamant that the woman she spoke to was Star Palumbo, and police began to feel as if there was merit to the theory that Star was involved in sex work, and may have been kidnapped or trafficked. Though unconfirmed, Linda’s interaction with Star was considered the last sighting of her.\n\nFoul play is considered in Star’s case. Unfortunately, there are a handful of theories that make this case difficult to solve. It’s either believed that Star went missing on her own accord, to escape a drug debt or a pimp, which is what many of Star’s friends believe, as Star had spoken to them about changing her identity. The theory that Star was in a drug induced psychosis and may have developed some sort of amnesia has been thrown around, as well as the theory that Star may have overdosed and her body was hidden in the Nevada desert. To shine a light on Star’s case, it was featured on the tv show Unsolved Mysteries on October 1st, 2001. Gail’s mother was interviewed on the segment, where she said this about her daughter: \n\n> *“She lived a very happy childhood. She’s very dependable, and she’s a very trusting person. She’s a very happy person, social person, and I guess she trusted people too much.”*\n\nGail expressed that she had hopes that Star had simply changed her identity and is living a happy, healthy life, and she stated to unsolved mysteries that if Star was watching, to please get in touch with someone to let them know she was okay. Sadly, this segment did not bring in any new leads for the family or law enforcement, and Gail has gone 24 years without answers in her daughter’s disappearance. \n\nWhen last seen, Star was described as standing at 5’4”, weighing 115 pounds, and had brown hair and brown eyes. Star has a birthmark on the right side of her neck, and at the time of her disappearance, her earlobes were triple pierced. She was last seen wearing a black leather jacket, a tank top, jeans, and boots. Despite authorities not initially believing that Star met with foul play, after 24 years, they have changed their stance and believe that Star is deceased. \n\n© TaraCalicosBike 2024\n\n**Links**\n\n[Star’s Charley Project Page](https://charleyproject.org/case/star-michelle-palumbo)\n\n[Reno Gazette](https://www.newspapers.com/newspage/149381582/)\n\n[The Doe Network](https://www.doenetwork.org/cases/3393dfnv.html)",

Her brother’s friend Kevin had said that he had picked her up from her grandparents house and dropped her off at what she said was her ex-boyfriend Miguel’s house on the 11th in Wausau. However the building she was dropped off at was actually vacant. She was officially reported missing six days later. \n\nThere is not much known about the circumstances regarding Kayla’s disappearance. The police have ruled out that she is a runaway. On the morning of the 12th, Kayla’s father became concerned when she hadn’t returned home. Her mother believed that Kayla would contact them soon as she would spend a lot of time at parties and staying with friends. (Her mother had previously tried reporting her missing in another instance but Kayla was fine that time).\n\nWhen her mother began to get worried, she tried to contact Kevin to no avail. She then contacted a friend of Kayla’s who said that on the night of the 11th Kayla and Kevin had spoken to her at a McDonald’s. Kayla had said that she was going for a night drive and was going to smoke marujana with Kevin. Kayla never called her friend later that night like she agreed to. \n\nSearch dogs became alert near a pond where Kayla went missing during a search but nothing was recovered from said pond. Kevin has told police he simply returned home after dropping Kayla off. Kevin was originally charged with reckless endangerment in relation to his behaviour on the night of Kayla disappearance (ie. smoking marujana) but these charges were dropped.\n\nThe police questioned Miguel but he said he hadn’t seen Kayla on the 11th. An old cellphone of Migeul’s pinged off a cell tower 40 miles from where Kayla disappeared. Miguel refused to discuss the matter further saying that he felt harassed.\n\nPossible sightings of Kayla that were debunked:\n\nA woman came forward saying that she believed that her daughter-in-law might be Kayla. She said that she was very quiet about her past and struck a striking resemblance to an age progression photo of Kayla. However the girl was confirmed not to be Kayla.\n\nA YouTube video named ‘’Hey Walter’’ became the focus of internet attention when many people began to believe a girl featured in the video was Kayla. The video showed a man gushing about his new girlfriend only to show a woman tied up and screaming in a dark room. Many people thought that this girl resembled Kayla, even Kayla’s mother. However this turned out to be a skit filmed by actors and was completely unrelated to Kayla’s case.\n\nWhere is Kayla? What happened to her?\n\nFurther Reading: \n\nhttps://storiesoftheunsolved.com/2019/04/22/the-disappearance-of-kayla-berg/",

      "text": "Twenty-seven-year-old Teresa JoAnn Peroni, known as Terry to friends, walked into the woods near Selma, Oregon, at a party on the Fourth of July in 1983 with her boyfriend, Mark Sanfratello, following an argument where he accused her of cheating on him, and she was never heard from again. Over forty years later, Teresa's remains have been officially identified, and Sanfratello, now in his seventies, has been arrested in Chico, California, for her murder. Sanfratello was later arrested and jailed for stabbing his ex-wife, years after Teresa disappeared.\n\nWhen Teresa never returned from her walk in the woods, her family quickly reported her missing. Unfortunately, the local District Attorney's Office declined to move forward with a criminal investigation into her disappearance, citing a lack of probable cause. In 1997, the skull of a woman, determined to be between twenty and thirty-five years old, was found in the woods less than a mile from where Teresa disappeared. Despite the use of cadaver dogs, no further remains were found in the area. Authorities long suspected the skull to be Teresa's, but were unable to confirm an identification until advanced DNA testing was performed in 2024, proving that \"Josephine County Jane Doe\" was Teresa Peroni. She is survived by multiple siblings.\n\n\\-\n\n[https://charleyproject.org/case/teresa-joann-peroni](https://charleyproject.org/case/teresa-joann-peroni)\n\n[https://www.sacbee.com/news/nation-world/national/article309775490.html](https://www.sacbee.com/news/nation-world/national/article309775490.html)\n\n[https://www.kajo.com/news/news\\_story.php?subaction=showfull&id=1751347221&ucat=2,4&template=KAJO17Local&](https://www.kajo.com/news/news_story.php?subaction=showfull&id=1751347221&ucat=2,4&template=KAJO17Local&)",

      "text": "MODS: Had posted earlier today under a different u/. Post was deleted as it had no summary which I added and then messaged mods to not have had a response therefore the new post. \n\nSummary of the case: The Isdal Woman  was the name given to an unidentified woman who was found dead at Isdalen in Bergen, Norway, on 29 November 1970. She had been travelling throughout Europe providing false names,/documentation, in possession of a peculiar array of items, including a notebook with some sort of code in it. She had been acting erratically the days leading up to her death and was seen with various unidentified men. It has been speculated that the Isdal woman might have been a spy, mentally ill or a sex worker, amongst other theories.\n\nI was going through this sub reading up on the most recent news re the Isdal woman's case. I decided to read the Wikipedia page and noticed that there seems to be new info under 'later developments': On June 12, 2023, an article in Neue Zürcher Zeitung suggested that the Isdal Woman may have had connections with the Swiss banker François Genoud, and that Norwegian Intelligence Service interfered with local police investigations. The newspaper sourced the suggestion to a \"professional fact-checker\".\n\nWhat do you think of this new development? \n\n\nWhen you Google Isdal woman and nzz you get to an article, written in German but it's behind a paywall. I speak German but don't necessarily want to pay to read the article, so thought it put this here in case anyone has access to it:\n https://www.nzz.ch/gesellschaft/seit-mehr-als-50-jahren-wird-ueber-das-geheimnis-der-toten-aus-dem-isdal-in-norwegen-geraetselt-jetzt-fuehrt-eine-neue-spur-in-die-schweiz-sie-birgt-sprengkraft-ld.1741261",

      "text": "On Halloween night in 1989, twenty-one-year-old [Wendy Jamie Abrams-Nishikai](https://whereaboutsstillunknown.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/20190731_232101.png) disappeared from Berkeley, California, and was never heard from again. At the time of her disappearance, Wendy was a student at the University of California in Berkeley and the mother of a young daughter, J, who was two years old. Born in Oakland, California, she attended Holy Names High School in her youth, before marrying John Nishikai, the father of her daughter. John initiated a divorce in 1993 after Wendy had been missing for almost three and a half years.\n\nLittle information is available about the circumstances of her disappearance, though today, law enforcement confirmed Wendy was found in February 1990 as a Jane Doe in [Colfax, California](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Yankee+Jims+Rd,+California/@39.0328506,-121.0291705,10.63z/data=!4m6!3m5!1s0x809ba765caa1e093:0xa54152db9aa13a43!8m2!3d39.0422765!4d-120.8863784!16s%2Fg%2F1tc_fj76?entry=ttu&g_ep=EgoyMDI1MDIwNS4xIKXMDSoASAFQAw%3D%3D). Colfax is a small town in Placer County, about an hour northeast of California's capital city, Sacramento, and 130 miles (209 km) away from Berkeley, where Wendy disappeared. Tipsters had suggested the match to local investigators in both Berkeley and Colfax as far back as December 2020 after one of her loved ones shared that she had the same tattoo as Jane Doe. However, Jane Doe had an insufficient DNA profile for them to make a proper identification - until now.\n\nHer remains had been noticed by a pair of target shooters practicing in the Sierra Foothills, where they spotted her clothing and became suspicious of the seemingly-abandoned new shoes. At the time of her death, Wendy wore a pair of blue shorts, a light-colored tank top, and size four sneakers. Insulin-type syringes were found at the scene, though it's unconfirmed if they belonged to her. No cause of death is listed, but her Doe Network page notes that authorities believe she may have been murdered.\n\n\\-\n\n[https://www.websleuths.com/forums/threads/ca-wendy-j-abrams-nishikai-21-berkeley-31-october-1989.373905/page-3#post-19272014](https://www.websleuths.com/forums/threads/ca-wendy-j-abrams-nishikai-21-berkeley-31-october-1989.373905/page-3#post-19272014)\n\n[https://trellis.law/case/c-712248/nishikai-vs-abrams-nishikai](https://trellis.law/case/c-712248/nishikai-vs-abrams-nishikai)\n\n[https://www.doenetwork.org/cases/114ufca.html](https://www.doenetwork.org/cases/114ufca.html)\n\n[https://whereaboutsstillunknown.wordpress.com/2013/03/19/wendy-abrams-nishikai/](https://whereaboutsstillunknown.wordpress.com/2013/03/19/wendy-abrams-nishikai/)\n\n[https://www.sfgate.com/bayarea/article/human-remains-identified-california-cold-case-20158952.php](https://www.sfgate.com/bayarea/article/human-remains-identified-california-cold-case-20158952.php)",

      "text": "In 2019, a student at the University of New Hampshire (UNH) presented her professor with a skull that had served as decoration in her father's Claremont law office for decades. Dr. Amy Michael, assistant professor of anthropology, brought the skull to the school's Forensic Anthropology Identification and Recovery (F.A.I.R.) lab, where students and professors used archival research and anthropological methods to try to identify the person from whom the skull originated. Eventually, they called in backup - researchers at the Ramapo College of New Jersey's Investigative Genetic Genealogy (IGG) Center. \n\nIn July 2024, the IGG center sent a fragment of the skull to Astrea Forensics in Santa Cruz, California, to develop a DNA profile. This profile was then uploaded to GEDmatch Pro, and students in the IGG certificate program began their research. By connecting genetic matches and poring over a chromosome browser, the students were able to develop a hypothesis as to the origins of the skull. It is believed to have belonged to a child of Samuel Matchette (1781-1854) and Sarah Shields (1800-1848), though they are unable to identify the exact identity of the individual. Both Samuel and Sarah died in Quebec, Canada, which has historic ties to Sullivan County, New Hampshire - the county in which Claremont is located. \n\n**SOURCES:**\n\n1.

      "text": "Ten years after the disappearance of Australian foster child William Tyrrell, more details have emerged of what the police's current theory is regarding his presumed death.\n\nWilliam disappeared at the age of 3 in September 2014 while staying at his foster grandma's house in rural New South Wales. He was in the care of his foster mother at the time his disappearance was reported and police have now explicitly stated that they think she covered up his death. \n\nThere have been competing theories and unresolved questions about William's fate ever since he vanished. The laws of Australia protect the identities of foster children and foster parents so it took years for it even to emerge that William was being raised outside his birth family. William's foster sister stayed in the care of their foster parents for many years following his disappearance but was eventually removed from them. William's foster mother later pled guilty to abusing her. \n\nIn 2020 and 2021, fresh searches around the area William was last seen failed to unearth any evidence of the toddler's remains or distinctive Spiderman suit. \n\nhttps://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2024/nov/09/william-tyrrell-case-takes-a-turn-after-10-years-as-inquest-hears-new-theory-of-his-death-ntwnfb\n\nhttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disappearance_of_William_Tyrrell\n\nhttps://www.kidspot.com.au/news/william-tyrrells-sister-removed-from-care-of-foster-parents/news-story/2bca46e37e48f990d0226af2969c5e01\n\nhttps://www.google.com/amp/s/amp.theguardian.com/australia-news/2023/sep/05/child-allegedly-assaulted-by-william-tyrrells-former-foster-parents-heard-sobbing-on-audio-played-in-court\n\nhttps://www.google.com/amp/s/www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-5846899/amp/William-Tyrrells-complicated-family-explained-amid-new-police-search.html",

      "text": "Details are scarce but there is an arrest\n\n[I-TEAM: Arrest made in connection to Aliza Sherman murder](https://www.yahoo.com/news/team-arrest-made-connection-aliza-203855211.html)\n\nTHEY INDICTED HER ATTORNEY!!!!! \n\n\n\nOld post on her case\n\nOn March 24, 2013 Aliza Sherman went to meet with her attorney. She was in the middle of a messy divorce from her husband, Sanford.\n\nAccording to her children there was a history of domestic abuse in the marriage.\n\n“I have memories from when I was three years old sitting on the carpet in the family room and covering my ears when they were fighting. The police were at our house numerous times throughout our childhood because me or one of my siblings just called the cops when they were fighting,” (her son) Jason told Cleveland Magazine in 2017.\n\nAliza filed for divorce on June 20, 2011. She hired attorney Joe Stafford of Stafford and Stafford on the advice of a longtime friend who had him preside over his own divorce. The Law Firm had a reputation for handling high-profile divorce cases and Aliza thought this would give her an edge.\n\nThe day after receiving the divorce papers from Aliza, Sanford filed a complaint against her.\n\nDespite his complaint, Sanford was still pushing Aliza to save the marriage and go to counseling with him. Aliza wasn’t having any of it. She told her lawyer that this was a ploy to get her back, but nothing in the relationship would change. Sanford would remain controlling and abusive.\n\nNeither Sanford, nor Aliza, were willing to leave the house for fear that action would be seen in court as abandonment, so Aliza moved into a bedroom downstairs.\n\nAliza would send emails to herself about her situation. In one from January of 2012, she wrote, “I’m really afraid he is going to have me killed.”\n\nSeveral people in her circle offered to let her stay in their homes until things were settled, but Aliza refused. Instead, she had a deadbolt installed on her bedroom door so she could lock it at night.\n\nWhile events were circling the drain up until this point, in March of 2012, they finally started to get sucked down. Joe Stafford’s law license was suspended for a year after the Ohio Supreme Court found that he violated six of the state’s rules of professional conduct for judges and attorneys. ( [Divorce attorney indicted in connection to Aliza Sherman murder investigation | Local News | clevelandjewishnews.com](https://www.clevelandjewishnews.com/news/local_news/divorce-attorney-indicted-in-connection-to-aliza-sherman-murder-investigation/article_66a390c6-c62d-11e5-864a-7f2cd1eb7fea.html) )\n\nThat’s when Aliza’s case was handed over to his senior associate, Gregory Moore.\n\nAliza didn’t like Moore. She complained to friends and family that he was late to meetings and wouldn’t respond to texts or emails. Within the first six months of taking on Aliza’s case, he filed several continuances because he wasn’t prepared to appear in court. This pushed her freedom from Sanford even farther back.\n\nAliza tried to find another lawyer to take on the case, but it was too far along, and she was running out of money. No one would touch it, leaving her trapped.\n\nMoore texted Aliza on Sunday, March 24. He wanted to see her in his office that afternoon. He told her to bring any documentation that she had so they could work on her case and prepare for the court proceedings that were to take place on the following Tuesday.\n\nAliza agreed and gathered everything she had.\n\nBefore leaving the house for the meeting, Aliza told her son, Jeremy that she was going to his grandmother, Doris’ house to get some medicine and run errands.\n\nDoris lived in Florida, but still kept a home in Cleveland for when she would come home to visit. In mid March, she was still down in Florida.\n\nShe also told Jeremy that she would bring home pizza for dinner, and she would be back in a couple of hours.\n\nAliza texted daughter Jennifer around 2:55 that afternoon to tell her she was meeting with Moore, but Jennifer was in the middle of a long study session for a pharmacology exam and had silenced her phone. It would be hours before Jennifer got the message.\n\nAliza had also called her friend from childhood, Jan Lash, to tell her that she was meeting Moore at his office around 5:00. Jan offered to go with her, but Aliza declined. She told Jan that she could handle it on her own.\n\nAliza arrived at Moore’s office at 55 Erieview Plaza around 5:30 pm. She carried the box of documents that he had requested. When she got to the door of the building, it was locked.\n\nFrustrated, she texted Moore and let him know she was downstairs, waiting. He texted back that he would be down shortly to open the door for her.\n\nAliza waited. Then, a few minutes later, she texted Moore again. She told him that it was cold outside, so she would wait for him in her car. Again, Moore texted her and told her that he would be down in a few minutes.\n\nThat’s when someone stepped up behind her and stabbed her eleven times. Eight times in the back, twice in the neck and once in the arm.\n\nA man working on the fourth floor of the building next door heard her screams. He rushed downstairs and found Aliza struggling to stand. Blood was all over her; it was even running out of her mouth.\n\nHe immediately called 911.\n\nHe tried to get her to lie down, but Aliza fought him. Eventually she didn’t have the strength to stand and laid down on the sidewalk.\n\nThe man stayed with her and begged her not to die. Aliza tried to tell him something, but he couldn’t understand what she was saying. She was coughing up blood, so he tried to roll her over on her stomach so she wouldn’t swallow it.\n\nHe was still on the phone with dispatch. In a desperate voice, he said, “There’s blood everywhere. I’ve never seen so much blood.”\n\nAbout a minute later, sirens could be heard. They were coming to the rescue.\n\n“I hear them. I hear them! Lady, stay with me, alright? They’re coming.”\n\nThe ambulance arrived and took Aliza to MetroHealth Medical Center. She was pronounced dead at 6:14 pm.\n\nBoth Aliza’s attorney Gregory Moore and Sanford Sherman were considered suspects in the beginning. Employees from other buildings were questioned. The police interviewed a lot of people, but no one had any information.\n\nin January of 2016, Aliza’s attorney, Gregory Moore, was indicted on one count of tampering with evidence, one count of obstructing official business, one count of falsification, one count of telecommunications fraud and two counts of forgery. These charges were all in connection with Aliza’s murder.\n\nDuring the investigation it was found that Moore had sent the texts to Aliza telling her to be at his office. In interviews, he also told police that he was at his office waiting for Aliza, but when police checked his cellphone data, it was found that he was never at his office. Electronic keycard data from the entrances to the building and witness statements corroborated this.\n\nWhile this was a good first step to solving Aliza’s murder, no further evidence could be found that Moore had anything more to do with it.\n\nMoore was also indicted on unrelated charges for inducing a panic after calling in bomb threats to courthouses.\n\nMoore eventually had his law license revoked and spent six months in jail on those charges.

      "title": "Arrest made in 1977 cold case murder of Jeanette Ralston",
      "text": "Shortly before midnight on Jan. 31, 1977, 24-year-old Jeanette Ralston left the Lion’s Den Bar in San Jose. As her friends watched her depart, they saw she was with a man they didn’t recognize. \n\nThe next morning, an apartment building owner on Graham Avenue, about a 5-minute drive from the bar, saw a Volkswagen Beetle parked in the carport. When she looked inside, she found a horrific scene: Ralston’s body was shoved in the back seat, and her blouse was tightly tied around her neck. She had been sexually assaulted and strangled. \n\nFor nearly half a century, Ralston’s last moments have been a mystery. But on Tuesday, prosecutors from the Santa Clara County District Attorney’s Office [announced](https://da.santaclaracounty.gov/da-cold-case-unit-charges-ohio-man-1977-murder) they’ve made an arrest in the case. \n\nUsing modern forensic technology, investigators from the DA’s cold case unit and the San Jose Police Department’s homicide division recently teamed up to take a fresh look at the evidence. They had several critical clues: a fingerprint on Ralston’s pack of Eve cigarettes and possible DNA on her fingernails and blouse. In August, the DA’s office said it matched the fingerprint to a name: Willie Eugene Sims.\n\nSims was a private in the U.S. Army at the time of Ralston’s death, the DA’s office said. He was stationed at Fort Ord in Monterey County, where a year after Ralston died, he was found guilty of assault with the intention to commit murder. When Sims was released from prison, he left California entirely, the DA’s office said, preventing law enforcement from putting his DNA on file in the Combined DNA Index System, or CODIS, a national DNA database.\n\n  \nOnce investigators homed in on Sims, who was living in Ashtabula County, Ohio, they traveled to get a DNA sample. Earlier this year, they obtained the sample, which they announced this week was a match for the profile found on Ralston’s body. Sims was arrested and attended an extradition hearing Tuesday, where he waived his right to contest the extradition order. He will be transported to Santa Clara County to face charges. If convicted, Sims, who is now 69, could be sentenced to 25 years to life in prison. \n\n  \nRalston was born in Germany and lived in Benicia and San Mateo in the years before her death. She was survived by her husband and young son. \n\n“Cases may grow old and be forgotten by the public,” Santa Clara County District Attorney Jeff Rosen said. “We don’t forget and we don’t give up.”\n\n  \n[https://www.sfgate.com/bayarea/article/key-clue-bay-area-mom-slaying-cigarettes-20315662.php](https://www.sfgate.com/bayarea/article/key-clue-bay-area-mom-slaying-cigarettes-20315662.php)",

      "title": "On June 7th, 1977, a seventeen year old girl was found strangled in her Boston apartment. Who killed Judy Belfrey- and was her murderer a serial killer?",
      "text": "In 1977, seventeen year old Judy Belfrey was a junior at Lincoln-Sudbury Regional High School in the Greater Boston town of Sudbury, Massachusetts. But instead of going to the high school every morning to take classes, Judy was taking a special academic program called \"Alternate Semester.\" To fulfill the education requirements of this program, she worked at a women's cooperative in the city of Cambridge and also volunteered at the Boston Children's Museum. During the Alternate Semester, Judy lived in Boston's South End with Joshua and Hollis Young, a trust officer and his wife. Judy lived with them until May 15th of 1977, and the semester ended on May 28th. The Youngs would later tell the Boston Globe that Judy was \"a very nice kid; a typical 17-year-old student, who liked knitting, sewing, and record playing.\"  \n\n \n\nAfter her time with the Youngs, Judy continued to live in Boston, on 59 Burbank Street, with a roommate, Carol McDonald. On June 7th, 1977, around 10:30 at night, Carol came home to find Judy dead in their apartment. The Boston Police arrived to investigate the death and determined Judy had been strangled to death. Her glasses and umbrella were broken nearby her body, her purse had been thrown on the floor, and she had no money on her. \n\n \n\nThe last time Judy had been seen alive, she was at the 663 Lounge on Washington Street, a club in Boston's Combat Zone. The Combat Zone was an area of town designated specifically for adult entertainment businesses by city planners who wanted to keep the city's strip clubs, porn theaters, x-rated bookstores, and other such businesses contained to one area. While many business owners and workers of the Combat Zone prided themselves on working within the law, there was a significant amount of illegal activity in the Zone, which gave it a not entirely unfounded reputation for danger. Detectives interviewing people in the Zone area determined that Judy had been last seen at around 8:30 on June 7, leaving the 663 Lounge with a man described as appearing to be in his 40s and who had an olive skin tone. It was determined that Judy died less than an hour later. A Zone sex worker told detectives that a man who fit the description of the man Judy was last seen with was a \"trick\" (john) who had assaulted her in the Back Bay on Wednesday, the day after Judy's murder. \n\n \n\nThe Boston Globe stated that unnamed \"sources\" - possibly witnesses or other people who lived or worked in the Zone, such as the woman whose assailant may have been Judy's killer- stated that Judy had met the killer in the 663 Lounge at 6:30 PM on the night of her death, he paid her fifty dollars, and then from there, they had gone to her apartment. As she left, Judy told another girl at the club that she would be back within an hour. In an attempt to retrace the steps of the crime, detectives determined that from the crime scene, it looked like Judy had walked into the apartment's living room, only to be attacked from behind by the killer, who then strangled her. Lieutenant McCallum of the Boston Police told the Globe that Judy had been involved with the Combat Zone's sex trade for less than a month. \n\n \n\nOn Sunday, June 12th of 1977, Detective Sergeant told the Boston Globe that \"We're putting pieces together in this case, granted it's slow. What we are hoping for is a break.\" \n\n \n\nWhile no connection to other murders was ever confirmed, Judy was theorized to be a victim of a serial killer. Melodie Stankiewicz, aged 26, had been last seen alive leaving the 663 Lounge with a man in 1975. Two days later, her body was found in a pond in Salem, New Hampshire- she had been stabbed to death. Also in 1975, Cathleen “Kathy” Williams, aged 16, was found by a state trooper in Andover- she had been strangled to death. On March 2nd, 1975, the body of Holly Davidson, aged 22, was found strangled at the side of the road in Methuen by a driver. Melodie, Kathy, and Holly had all worked the 663 Lounge, and all three of them were found within fifteen miles of Salem. Kathy and Holly had both been left at the side of the road, both were nude and posed similarly, and both had butterfly tattoos on their abdomens (although this last detail may be just a coincidence).\n\n \n\nIt has been theorized but never confirmed that there was a \"Combat Zone Strangler\" who killed some or all of the victims. Some theorize that Melodie's murder was unrelated as she was stabbed and the other victims were strangled. The murders of Melodie, Kathy, and Holly have never been solved. At the time, it was considered a possibility that another victim’s death, Anna Serrano, stabbed to death at 32 in 1975, and found dead in her car that had been parked in front of a church, could have been linked to these murders, as Anna was also last seen at a Combat Zone club.  Suspected serial killer Leonard Paradiso (died 2018 while imprisoned for murdering Marie Ianuzzi) has long been considered as a possibility for Melodie, Kathy, and Holly's murders.  \n\n \n\nJudy was the youngest child of her family and had three older siblings. Judy's mother Shirley remembered her as a girl who \"loved \\[...\\] the outdoors\" and \"planned to work with deaf children in the fall.\" Judy's devastated friends and family said she was \"a nice kid; a quiet, sweet girl.\" The Young family and William Schecter, Judy's teacher who worked with the Alternate Semester program, were also described as being \"broken up\" by her untimely death.\n\n \n\nOver forty years later, Judy’s murder - and the murders of other young women and girls who may have fell victim to the same killer-  is still unsolved.

      "title": "The Dawn Walker case - Kevin Nunn has been in prison for 20 years but could he really have done it?",
      "text": "I came across this case recently and it's bothering me. Kevin Nunn has been in prison since 2006 for murdering his ex-girlfriend Dawn Walker, but there are some serious issues with the conviction.\n\n**The basic facts**\n\nDawn Walker was found dead by the River Lark in February 2005. Her hair had been shaved off, body set on fire with petrol, and she was found naked from the waist down. The cause of death was never determined, and neither was the time or place of the murder.\n\nNunn was convicted despite there being no forensic evidence linking him to the crime. The most significant piece of evidence actually pointed away from him - sperm was found on Walker's body, but Nunn had a vasectomy and couldn't produce sperm. The prosecution argued this was \"secondary transfer\" from a gym changing room, which seems like a bit of a stretch.\n\n**Alternative suspects that weren't properly investigated**\n\nThere's one suspect in particular that stands out. A former boyfriend (let's call him \"X\") had a conviction for exposing himself to young girls. He told witnesses he knew how to commit the \"perfect murder\" - specifically mentioning putting fingers near the windpipe to leave no evidence and burning hair to destroy DNA. This matches what happened to Walker. He also regularly walked his dog near where her body was found and lived very nearby. He was also accused of being violent to her during their relationship (unconfirmed) and his alibi for the murder came from his new girlfriend. \n\nDespite all this, he was actually a prosecution witness and was never properly investigated.\n\nAnother suspect, Nigel Hill, was initially charged alongside Nunn. He drove a silver car matching witness descriptions and had a relationship history with Walker. But halfway through the trial, charges against him were dropped because the prosecution said the case was \"absurd.\" (The two didn't really know each other before the murder and the whole thing didn't make sense.) \n\nThe sperm sample was never tested against any of the other suspects' DNA.\n\n**Problems with the case against Nunn**\n\nThe evidence against him is mostly circumstantial:\n- He had made a secret copy of Walker's house key\n- He once followed her when she went for drinks with someone else\n- His ex-wife described him as possessive\n\nBut there are major issues with the prosecution's case:\n- CCTV timing was acknowledged to be 70 minutes off, which undermines their timeline\n- He was released on bail, which is unusual for such a serious charge\n- Two psychiatric assessments found no dangerous tendencies\n- The main witness initially said she saw nothing, then changed her story 10 days later\n\n**Current status**\n\nNunn's case has been with the Criminal Cases Review Commission for years. They rejected it once in 2019, claiming new testing showed the \"sperm\" might actually be yeast. This is controversial since the same forensics expert who originally identified it as sperm now works at the lab that questioned it.\n\nThe CCRC has been heavily criticized lately for inadequate investigations, particularly after the Andrew Malkinson case where a man spent 17 years in prison before DNA evidence cleared him.\n\n**My thoughts**\n\nWhether Nunn is guilty or innocent, this conviction seems shaky at best. The sperm evidence should have been thoroughly investigated, and the alternative suspects deserved proper examination. The fact that someone described committing the \"perfect murder\" using methods that match the actual crime, yet wasn't investigated, is particularly worrying.\n\nWhat do you think about this case? Does the conviction seem solid to you, or are there too many unanswered questions?\n\nInspired by this: https://www.theguardian.com/law/ng-interactive/2025/jul/06/kevin-nunn-20-years-prison-horrifying-murder-was-he-wrongly-convicted\n\nETA:\nhttps://www.eadt.co.uk/news/21307735.murder-trial-hears-carpet-evidence/\n\nETA2: The Guardian article is inconsistent on this point, but the court documents are clear that sperm cells (not semen) were found.\n\nETA3:\n- X had a dog and regularly walked the dog near where Walker's body was found. The spot was about a 35 minute walk from where they lived but less than a 5 minute drive.\n- Cause of death was not clear. Likely hypothermia/drowning while incapacitated but it's not clear. \n- Walker's body was in water (from a natural source) for a number of hours but the water didn't match the water in River Lark where she was found.\n- Walker's house didn't turn up signs of a struggle or a crime",

      "text": "(EDIT: Just noticed I forgot to say \"waiting\" in the title\n\nThanks to [ns042](https://www.reddit.com/user/jns042/) for suggesting this case via [this post](https://www.reddit.com/user/moondog151/comments/1g7vgdl/for_my_international_readers_or_anyone_interested/) asking for case suggestions from my international readers since I focus on international cases.\n\nThere is a decently compelling suspect in this case but I hope the guilt isn't obvious enough to render the case not really a mystery. After all, it's all circumstantial and there is another suspect. Because I don't like uploading to this sub if the case is a mystery in name only\n\nWell this is my first US case...kinda. I was always willing to make an exception for cases from the territories of Anglosphere countries and well, now I have one. And besides, even if it was a fully-fledged state, I'm sure there still aren't many cases from here regardless)\n\n[Faloma Luhk](https://imgur.com/UrUjX4i) was born on February 9, 2001, in a small village known as As Teo, which was located on Saipain Island, a part of The Northern Mariana Islands. On February 13, 2002, her sister [Maleina Quitugua Luhk](https://imgur.com/H4MySTo) would be born. Their father, a former police officer had left the Mariana Islands for work in Micronesia and never had much contact with his family. Meanwhile, their mother lived and worked in Guam before eventually moving to The United States.\n\nEven though both of their parents weren't even in the same region as them, they were still loved by their family and lived with their grandparents since 2007. The girl's aunts, uncles and cousins also played a part in raising her. The two also found themselves easily making many friends at school, which they attended in a neighbouring town.\n\nOn May 25, 2011, the two sisters woke up that morning and got ready for school. Conveniently, their bus stop, [a small pavilion](https://imgur.com/ROlKcTs) was situated only a few 100 meters from their home so it wasn't that long of a walk. The two sat at the bus stop and waited.\n\nAt 3:30 p.m. once school was out, the two should've been home relatively quickly due to the bus stop's proximity to their home. But they were nowhere to be seen. Their grandparents grew concerned. They managed to flag down [the school bus before it drove too far](https://imgur.com/LpkTO2r) and spoke with the driver. The driver didn't remember if the two had boarded but all of the children still aboard told their grandparents that neither had seen any of the two at all.\n\nAfter leaving the bus, they rushed home to call their school. According to the school, none of them attended any of their classes that day. The two had arrived at the bus stop at 6:10 a.m. and school ended at 3:30 p.m. Since the school didn't sound the alarm or even call Faloma and Maleina's guardians to ask where they were, the two had been missing for over 10-11 hours before the alarm was sounded.\n\nWhen that phone call ended, they wasted no time in heading to the police. The police, fortunately, took the case seriously from the very beginning. An island-wide alert was issued for the two and their family [began placing missing person flyers across the local area](https://imgur.com/gEbxC2K) and showed them to passersby at the Thursday market. Meanwhile, the police began conducting door-to-door searches and inquiries.\n\n[When the flyers got no results, they began hanging banners above the roadways which would be much harder to miss.](https://imgur.com/DLSkPYs) The police also read Faloma's school journal/diary but nothing was written in it that might provide some clues for her disappearance. Maleina's journal was missing.\n\nOfficers were also sent to the bus stop itself. Nothing at the pavilion was out of place nor left behind. The police couldn't find any signs of a struggle nor any signs that the two had run away such as footprints leading away from the bus stop. Whatever had happened to them, they wouldn't get any answers at the bus stop. But that didn't stop the police from concluding foul play must be involved. They investigated the case as an abduction.\n\nFrom their interviews, the police learned that Faloma had been wearing jeans and a white blouse while Maleina was wearing jeans and a light green shirt with a butterfly design. The police were quick to add this to their bulletins. The police also learned something that should make finding them easy as well. Their backpacks, which they had also been wearing, had their names and home phone number written on the straps.\n\nMaleina's backpack was Dora the Explorer themed while Faloma's was dark purple and also had \"Quitugua Luhk\" written on the straps. Faloma was 5'1 ft tall and weighing 90 pounds while Maleina was 4 ft tall and weighed 65 pounds. Maleina also had a birthmark on her left cheek.\n\nThe police also tracked down the children who were on the school bus that morning and spoke with them. According to them, Faloma and Maleina were not waiting at the bus stop when they arrived. The two were last seen at 6:10 a.m. sitting on a cement slab at the bus stop.\n\nThe school bus arrived at 6:30. Whatever caused their disappearance, took place within that 20-minute time frame. Unfortunately, while there were many houses nearby, the dense vegetation likely obscured what happened to the sisters from any potential witnesses.\n\nThe last avenune pursued by the local police on their own was to search the landfill. But being as small a department as they were, they didn't get far in the fairly difficult and strenuous process that is searching through a landfill.\n\nWhile the Northern Mariana Islands aren't a state, they are a commonwealth territory of the United States. That meant that the local police could not only contact Federal U.S law enforcement agencies for assistance, but they could assume jurisdiction and deploy their resources in full.\n\nOn May 27, after one day without having anything to show for it, the local police decided to make the call. Soon agents from the F.B.I., U.S. Customs and Border Protection and the U.S Marshall Service were dispatched to the Northern Mariana Islands at the local police's request. Some investigators from Homeland Security and the DEA also joined in.\n\nNow that all three agencies were involved, no expense was spared in finding the two girls. A search party consisting of various investigators and 500 volunteers were searching every nook and cranny the island had to offer, meanwhile underwater divers were deployed to search the beaches encircling Saipan. A helicopter from the U.S. Navy and a C-130 plane from the U.S. Airforce were flown over the dense jungles and speaking of those jungles.\n\n[A tracking dog, trained by Law Enforcement to specifically search in a thick jungle environment was flown in from Hawaii to aid in the search. The local police even waived their quarantine guidelines so the dog could get to searching as soon as possible.](https://imgur.com/QZRVBpb)\n\nWhen it came to suspects, where else to start but with their biological parents? Her mother was ruled out pretty quickly as she wasn't even on the island and flew in from Guam upon hearing the news. Meanwhile, an F.B.I agent from Hawaii was flown to Pohnpei, Micronesia to question their father. The agent returned from Micronesia with their father also ruled out as a suspect.\n\nThe alerts and bulletins were also issued to other islands such as Guam, Hawaii and even as far as Washington State and Oregon.\n\nOver 400 separate areas had been thoroughly looked over, twice for all 400 and 100 leads were followed up on. They also searched abandoned homes, and structures and obtained permission to search some private residences.\n\nOn June 8, [the F.B.I. then went to the northern tip of Saipan to visit the Marpi landfill themselves](https://imgur.com/qBcMsIE).[ Over 62 personnel, consisting of F.B.I agents, police and firefighters began sifting through all the garbage and waste deposited at the landfill to try and find any trace of the two](https://imgur.com/oxh8fqk). Over 30,000 cubic feet of trash had been excavated but this endeavour was still met with failure. They called off searching the landfill on June 11.\n\nThe F.B.I. though, said they were happy with this result. They believed there was a decent chance the two might be alive and failing to find their remains at the landfill only emboldened this belief.\n\nWhen all was said and done, their efforts made the search for Faloma and Maleina the largest, most expensive and most extensive missing persons investigation in the history of the Northern Mariana Islands.\n\nThey also did have some witnesses to question. Every Wednesday, the garbagemen and their trucks passed by the pavilion. May 25, 2011, just so happened to be a Wednesday. On that day, they stopped at the pavilion at 5:45 a.m. which meant they didn't see the two, but that's not to say they had nothing to say.\n\nExactly one week before and one week before that, on May 18 and May 11, the two garbagemen saw the same gray Nissan pickup truck in the immediate area. On May 11, in particular, the truck had been parked in front of the Santa Lourdes shrine, near the bus stop. Its headlights were on and it seemed to be lying in wait. Then on May 18, they saw the truck driving toward the pavilion. They merely thought the truck belonged to a local resident and didn't think much of it.\n\nThe police spoke to other garbagemen to see if they saw this truck on their own routes but they all said they didn't. The garbagemen in Saipan would take their time when collecting the trash so they could look around for any trace of the sisters.\n\nThe shrine would also come into focus once more regarding another suspect. On May 6, a witness saw an unfamiliar man parked in front of the shrine near the bus stop. When witnesses approached the man he said he was waiting for somebody and then left in a hurry.\n\nHe was driving a white four-door car with heavily tinted windows the front driver’s side of the vehicle was heavily damaged. As for the man himself, he was described as a Pacific Islander who was approximately 30 years of age and had short hair and a nondescript birthmark on his cheek. A sketch of this man was created and soon released to the press. In July, the police tracked this man down and he once more told his story that he had been waiting for someone that day.\n\nOn August 14, human remains, some with some flesh still attached were found at a vacant lot next to an abandoned shack in Kagman. The discovery came after a dog returned home to its owner's backyard with one of the leg bones in its mouth. The dog's owners then searched the immediate area and found the rest of the body.\n\nThe remains were estimated to have been there for three to four weeks. Also found were pieces of clothing, a young girl’s underwear and a pair of zorries. The presence of the clothing was said to be incidental as it was too old and big to belong to Faloma or Maleina. The bones themselves were severed but that was the result of animals scattering them and there were no signs that they had been buried.\n\nMany feared that these belonged to the missing girls. These fears didn't last long as a dental examination conducted on the lower jaw was indicative of an elderly male around 70 years old. [DNA testing revealed that they belonged to Faloma and Maleina's great grand-uncle, 72-year-old Ricardo Muna Quitugua who went missing after getting lost while out on a walk.](https://imgur.com/x4rbxUv)\n\nRicardo's ID card would later be found at the scene. He was described as a loner who lived alone and was last seen two weeks prior. His routine consisted of walking from his house to the CYC store to buy the newspaper. He would then proceed to Laolao Beach, sit under a tree and read the news before walking back to his home.\n\nThe police have never publicly stated what Ricardo's cause of death was but his family don't believe it was natural. According to them, he seemed healthy and was \"strong\" for his age so for them, natural causes were completely out of the question. They believed that perhaps he was attacked so that he could be robbed of his $674 monthly pension.\n\nThe next suspect was one a little closer to home. Alan Santos Aguon was a local firefighter and related to the family via his wife. Alan refused to submit to a polygraph and after his interview, he sold his 2003 Toyota Camry and resigned from the fire department to move to Washington State.\n\nSince polygraphs are unreliable his refusing to take one wasn't overtly incriminating. His car was also searched. Nothing of note was found in his vehicle and there were no signs of it having been cleaned either. He also had an excuse for why he moved to the continental United States. That was where the rest of his family lived and he wished to reunite with them. Unfortunately, this was the last lead they had at the time. The case gradually went cold and the search was called off.\n\nAlan might've escaped scrutiny from the media and public if not for what he did next. On May 8, 2012, Alan attacked the wife and child with a chair. The same wife and child that he left the Northern Mariana Islands to be with. For this, he was held in the King County jail in Washington.\n\nLocal police charged him with domestic violence and assault with the court setting his bail at $500,000. He was handed a no-contact order which he violated on numerous occasions. He was also slapped with additional felony charges for assault. He has never been arrested for anything concerning Faloma and Maleina's disappearance.\n\nIn 2014, the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children [produced some age-progressed photos of the two girls](https://imgur.com/3mOpu2g) which were then circulated across Saipan and even in Hawaii, Oregon and Washington State. The F.B.I. also publicized a photo captured by a CCTV camera of a girl at a Saipan grocery store who looked like one of the two. Eventually, the girl in this photo was found and she wasn't either of the missing sisters.\n\nThen in February 2018, the F.B.I. found themselves another suspect. They landed on a man named [Joseph Acosta Crisostomo.](https://imgur.com/BzZjtbR) [Joseph had a lengthy criminal record and was currently serving a life sentence](https://imgur.com/r5HKTO9) for raping and murdering a Filipino bartender in 2012. He pretended to be the taxi she had called to lure him into his vehicle. He then proceeded to leave her body in the bathroom of an abandoned and rundown mall.\n\nHe was also the suspect in the murder of two Chinese shopkeepers in 1995 and the murder of a Chinese woman whose body washed ashore on a beach in 2006. According to witnesses, she was last seen getting into a taxi that later turned out to be fraudulent. (There's much more to say but I plan on doing a complete write-up on Joseph Acosta Crisostomo at some point in the future)\n\nHis family owned a home in Koblerville a small village on the southern tip of Saipan. The F.B.I. believed the bodies of Faloma and Maleina may have been buried on the property. A judge felt their suspicions held water and signed a warrant to let them begin the search. [On February 17, 2018, F.B.I. agents and the local police spent hours digging up the yard with a backhoe](https://imgur.com/GV32FUl) but came up empty-handed.\n\nJoseph's attorney later pointed out that he was in jail at the time of their disappearance and wasn't released until December 17, 2011. But nonetheless, the F.B.I. still had something compelling enough for the excavation to be approved in spite of that relatively solid alibi. Joseph's family tried taking legal action against the F.B.I. through the courts over this search.\n\nIn Early March 2018, The police dug up and searched a WWII-era septic tank at an abandoned lot in Kagman. This followed after an anonymous tip which said their bodies had been buried in the disused septic tank.\n\nThis was the last development this case saw. This case is still considered open and the F.B.I. is offering a reward of $25,000 dollars for anyone with information. Those with information are also encouraged to contact the F.B.I. Field Office in The Northern Mariana Islands at this number 670-322-6934.\n\nIf Faloma and Maleina are still alive, which the police and F.B.I. have yet to completely rule out and in fact remain hopeful is the case, they would be 24 and 23 years old respectively.\n\n[A shrine dedicated to Faloma and Maleina has been erected directly across the bus stop.](https://imgur.com/4fwZEPK)\n\n***Sources***\n\n[***https://www.mvariety.com/news/local/have-you-seen-them/article\\_58d364b2-c88e-58bd-bf3d-4e5b6787ca1c.html***](https://www.mvariety.com/news/local/have-you-seen-them/article_58d364b2-c88e-58bd-bf3d-4e5b6787ca1c.html)\n\n[***https://www.mvariety.com/news/local/feds-join-search-for-2-kids/article\\_6be4d024-2e6d-5785-b768-32f978f8414f.html***](https://www.mvariety.com/news/local/feds-join-search-for-2-kids/article_6be4d024-2e6d-5785-b768-32f978f8414f.html)\n\n[***https://www.saipantribune.com/news/local/trash-collectors-did-not-see-luhk-sisters-at-bus-stop/article\\_997488b6-e9d8-506a-941f-00ec6df22ff6.html***](https://www.saipantribune.com/news/local/trash-collectors-did-not-see-luhk-sisters-at-bus-stop/article_997488b6-e9d8-506a-941f-00ec6df22ff6.html)\n\n[***https://www.mvariety.com/news/local/fbi-searches-landfill/article\\_cda15db5-f867-5edf-8f25-2680752c1950.html***](https://www.mvariety.com/news/local/fbi-searches-landfill/article_cda15db5-f867-5edf-8f25-2680752c1950.html)\n\n[***https://www.mvariety.com/news/local/stop-spreading-false-rumors/article\\_aa6eee52-e2f6-5e85-9677-6a4eca7377f3.html***](https://www.mvariety.com/news/local/stop-spreading-false-rumors/article_aa6eee52-e2f6-5e85-9677-6a4eca7377f3.html)\n\n[***https://www.saipantribune.com/news/local/tracking-expert-dog-to-search-strategic-sites/article\\_4514e837-db99-5377-a1bc-2543169170e4.html***](https://www.saipantribune.com/news/local/tracking-expert-dog-to-search-strategic-sites/article_4514e837-db99-5377-a1bc-2543169170e4.html)\n\n[***https://www.mvariety.com/news/local/investigators-looking-for-man-seen-in-as-teo-before-kids-disappearance/article\\_a64b1b31-52f8-5bdd-b942-d1bebb2e6e56.html***](https://www.mvariety.com/news/local/investigators-looking-for-man-seen-in-as-teo-before-kids-disappearance/article_a64b1b31-52f8-5bdd-b942-d1bebb2e6e56.html)\n\n[***https://www.hawaiinewsnow.com/story/14908851/parents-of-missing-saipan-girls-interviewed/?outputType=amp***](https://www.hawaiinewsnow.com/story/14908851/parents-of-missing-saipan-girls-interviewed/?outputType=amp)\n\n[***https://www.mvariety.com/news/local/human-bones-found-in-kagman/article\\_01a8e378-f4a7-5a53-9583-c151ebfe1005.html***](https://www.mvariety.com/news/local/human-bones-found-in-kagman/article_01a8e378-f4a7-5a53-9583-c151ebfe1005.html)\n\n[***https://www.mvariety.com/news/local/it-s-a-homicide-case/article\\_fe081be7-8768-511d-9eb1-1c11a9b9949e.html***](https://www.mvariety.com/news/local/it-s-a-homicide-case/article_fe081be7-8768-511d-9eb1-1c11a9b9949e.html)\n\n[***https://www.mvariety.com/news/local/news-update-family-member-says-remains-belonged-to-missing-sisters-great-granduncle/article\\_573d422f-ee9b-5d05-80c5-21cd93ea823b.html***](https://www.mvariety.com/news/local/news-update-family-member-says-remains-belonged-to-missing-sisters-great-granduncle/article_573d422f-ee9b-5d05-80c5-21cd93ea823b.html)\n\n[***https://www.hawaiinewsnow.com/story/18627667/young-saipan-sisters-still-missing-after-1-year/***](https://www.hawaiinewsnow.com/story/18627667/young-saipan-sisters-still-missing-after-1-year/)\n\n[***https://www.westsideseattle.com/highline-times/2012/05/21/lucky-burien-boy-tops-police-blotter***](https://www.westsideseattle.com/highline-times/2012/05/21/lucky-burien-boy-tops-police-blotter)\n\n[***https://mauinow.com/2014/10/07/age-enhanced-photos-released-in-2011-disappearance-of-saipan-sisters/***](https://mauinow.com/2014/10/07/age-enhanced-photos-released-in-2011-disappearance-of-saipan-sisters/)\n\n[***https://www.lcsun-news.com/story/news/2016/11/15/fbi-releases-photos-possibly-linked-missing-saipan-sisters/93935658/***](https://www.lcsun-news.com/story/news/2016/11/15/fbi-releases-photos-possibly-linked-missing-saipan-sisters/93935658/)\n\n[***https://www.saipantribune.com/featured/back-of-house-searched-for-luhk-sisters/article\\_6be612ea-e314-53ea-a65a-cef3198cfcff.html***](https://www.saipantribune.com/featured/back-of-house-searched-for-luhk-sisters/article_6be612ea-e314-53ea-a65a-cef3198cfcff.html)\n\n[***https://www.postguam.com/news/local/tv-show-to-feature-missing-sisters/article\\_256dbccc-44b4-11e9-95ef-4f80d6a7f12b.html***](https://www.postguam.com/news/local/tv-show-to-feature-missing-sisters/article_256dbccc-44b4-11e9-95ef-4f80d6a7f12b.html)\n\n[***https://www.postguam.com/news/local/fbi-offers-k-reward-in-missing-sisters-case/article\\_a6070492-7ce5-11e9-b268-534009929499.html***](https://www.postguam.com/news/local/fbi-offers-k-reward-in-missing-sisters-case/article_a6070492-7ce5-11e9-b268-534009929499.html)\n\n[***https://www.saipantribune.com/news/local/8-years-since-luhk-sisters-disappeared/article\\_ab14b381-36fd-5a3c-ae17-37dbc5c6f9d7.html***](https://www.saipantribune.com/news/local/8-years-since-luhk-sisters-disappeared/article_ab14b381-36fd-5a3c-ae17-37dbc5c6f9d7.html)\n\n[***https://www.saipantribune.com/news/local/luhk-sisters-mysterious-disappearance-marks-9th-year/arti

She was part of a blended family, having siblings from her father's (Raymond Cates?) previous marriage and his marriage to her mother Trudy Cates (now Currington). There is not much information publicly available about her early life, but it seems safe to say that it was unsettled. According to all published reports on the case, she lived in several other states including Texas and Georgia before coming back to Tennessee in her teens. She was placed in foster care in Tennessee for about a year, dates unknown. Since her mother was living in Tennessee, there must have been an issue, as she wasn't given custody. Amber's father died some time prior to the disappearance, possibly in 1999.  \n\nIn April 2004, Amber was 16, in high school, and according to half-sister Brenda Cates James, she was “funny, energetic, a typical teenager.” But she had started running with the wrong crowd, doing some drinking and possibly some drugs. Brenda was made Amber's legal guardian on or around April 7, 2004. Brenda was married and had at least one child of her own. Amber's mother Trudy lived in a mobile home park at 2381 Tracy Ln, Culleoka, TN 38451. This home appears to be on a dead-end lane off a rural road not far from Columbia, TN.  \n\nIn April 2004, Amber was dropped off at her mother's for her spring break. Amber was to visit a relative in Panama City, Florida for a few days, leaving on April 11. She was picked up at her mother's home by her boyfriend, James Gordon, and they went off in a gold Mazda with license plate PFB200. No one in her family has ever seen her again. \n\nThe family filed a missing persons report when she did not return from Florida and it was found she had never been there. Police at first believed Amber was a runaway, given her history. But when she didn't contact her family, and her cell phone was never used, they began to focus on the case as one of foul play. \n\nJames Gordon told police he took Amber to Columbia, where he dropped her off with another friend. This was 39-year-old Ronald Inzurriaga, nicknamed California. In 1992 Inzurriaga had been convicted of the rape of an adult female, and served in an Alabama prison from 1992-1998. When police located him in 2007 for questioning about Amber, he was doing time in federal prison in Talladega, AL. According to Inzurriaga, the two had lunch at the Waffle House on James Campbell Boulevard, then Amber bought some hair dye, and then he dropped her off at a garage in Columbia where she and a friend used to hang out. This is the last known sighting of Amber Cates.  \n\nBoth Gordon and Inzurriaga have been interviewed several times, with no results.  Police took cadaver dogs to the place where Amber was last seen, but no scent was picked up. Police have followed up tips from all over, people saying they saw Amber or know Amber. None of these have proven to be true.  In 2008, the FBI joined forces with local law enforcement to investigate the case. A $25,000 reward has been offered. The case didn't see much movement until 2023, when the Maury County sheriff''s police established a cold case unit and put Amber's case as the top priority. They published age progression photos of Amber as an adult. They got DNA from Amber' s mother, as well as a sample of Amber's hair from a hairbrush. These were sent to a lab in Texas to create a DNA profile that can be checked against records of missing persons. Results of the DNA investigation are unknown as of today.  \n\nA search of the Duck River, which flows through Columbia. was planned for March 2010. Members of the family had eerie feelings when crossing bridges over the river, and wanted the search done. If it took place, nothing notable was found.  \n\nSister Brenda has kept Amber's name in front of the public in Tennessee through vigils near the anniversary and appearances in the parade on Columbia's big festival, Mule Day. She says she is keeping a promise to their father before he died, to take care of Amber. She has organized fundraisers to help with the cost of billboards, T-shirts and signs with Amber's picture placed on the side of trucks. She keeps a Facebook page Bring Amber Elizabeth Cates Home. In 2017, she hired outside investigators to look into the case. Brenda has her thoughts about what happened, which she shared with investigators but not the public. She has said she believes Amber is deceased, and probably still in Maury County.  \n\nPer the True Crime Bullshit podcast (The NAMUS-45: Amber Cates episode), Amber's mother Trudy Cates Currington became the subject of criticism because she didn't speak publicly about the case and didn't come to the memorial vigils. A [petition](https://www.change.org/p/maury-county-police-department-give-the-missing-teen-amber-elizabeth-cates-mother-a-lie-detector-test-re-question-her-maybe-hand-this-case-over-to-a-bigger-department-if-necessary) was entered on Change.org in 2014 for police to give her a polygraph and re-question her; one of Amber's sisters signed it, one of only 40 signatures. It should go without saying that people grieve in their own ways and it doesn't mean anything nefarious. But it does point to a tension within the extended family. Trudy herself has stated that she and Amber were close, that Amber wouldn't have left without a word.  \n\n\nTheories about what happened to Amber include that she was trafficked, that she ran away from the people she was with in Columbia, that she changed her identity and started a new life elsewhere. That seems unlikely for a teenager with no money. She was hanging out with older friends, which is concerning for a 16 year old. Naturally the leading theory is that she met with foul play at the hands of the people she was with when she disappeared. Since she left with James Gordon, it seems like she never intended to go to Florida. Whether the rendezvous with Ronald Inzzuriaga was part of her plan is unknown. Everything about that trip to Columbia seems very suspicious – one man bringing her to meet another, the second man leaving her and claiming not to know what happened afterward. (And why was Amber “friends” with a 39-year-old ex-convict?) It is unclear who else was at the garage where he dropped her off.  Amber's life had not been smooth sailing. She had spent time in foster care, had lost her father, and couldn't/didn't live with her mother for some reason (though her mother said they were close). She was sent to live with an older half-sister's family. Maybe she preferred to be with her Mom. Maybe she was unhappy. Maybe she did make a plan to leave. There is so little information on this case that it's hard to come up with a theory. But after so long with Amber never appearing on public records – no driver's license, no job where her social security number was used – it does seem most likely that she is no longer alive.  \n\nIt's frustrating that police got a late start because they considered her a runaway. It's sad that her case seems relatively unknown. Lost among the many, many cases of teens who go missing. Still, the cold case unit and FBI have not given up. If anyone has information about Amber Cates's case, they should contact the Maury County Sheriff's Police at (931) 375-8602.

      "title": "A man leaves on a roadtrip one day to meet his \"buddy\", believed to be Kanye West; His car is found abandoned 1,600 miles away from his home, on a haul road used by mines, with no trace of where he could have gone- Where is Davante Richardson? (2020)",
      "text": "Hello everyone! As always, thank you for all your upvotes and comments under my post about Sacoya Cooper; I hope that she will be found soon and safe.\n\n\n\nToday I'd like to highlight another disappearance case.  \n\n\nBACKGROUND\n\n  \nDavante Richardson was 28 when he went missing from Washington D.C, USA.\n\n  \nHe was single and didn't have children, but he had a lot of other living family- parents, aunts, uncles and cousins, among others. Davante grew up with his mother in Washington D.C, but moved to Missouri at 13 to live with his father because he \"needed discipline\", and his father was in the military. He attended Lincoln University, where he studied fine arts, but he moved to Washington again before he gratuated. In 2020, Davante worked as a manager in a grocery store, which had closed during the pandemic. Davante later worked as an uber driver, but he contracted COVID shortly after.\n\n  \nDavante was very close with his mother, he lived with her at a home on Mississippi Avenue Southeast, and the two talked every day. Sadly, the Richardson family had suffered a loss before- Davante lost a sibling at some point in the past, which heavily impacted his mother. \n\n  \nHis biggest passion was music; Under the name D Rich, he described himself as the CEO of Big Blues Studio, a graphic design and multimedia company providing digital services for clientele in the music industry. Davante was a huge fan of Kanye West and he dreamed of becoming a music producer. He was also a tattoo artist, and loved to play basketball and football.\n\n  \nAccording to Marquita Richardson, Davante's aunt, he \"(...) always been a laid-back type of person, quiet, always doing his own thing. He had friends, but not too many close ones. What he liked best was being in his room, listening to music\". \n\n  \nDavante described himself by saing that he is \"a nice young man who wants to better himself in life. (He's) a Artist, Actor, Designer, Music Producer\".\n\n\n\nDISAPPEARANCE\n\n  \nDavante's friend last had a contact with him on the 20th of July. Davante sent them a late-night text in which he claimed that he was going to start his music career, and that he planned to go visit his \"buddy\"- the world-famous rapper Kanye West. Davante had never met Kanye in real life, according to his loved ones, but he had expressed a desire to meet him in a now deleted youtube video. In the few days before he disappeared, his family didn't notice that anything was amiss, but his ex girlfriend said that Davante was \"depressed due to losing his job\".  \n\n  \nDavante was last seen in the Unit block of Mississippi Avenue, Southeast, on the 22nd of July, as he left his grandparents' home, and was reported missing on the 22nd. His family didn't realize he was missing for a few days; When they realized it, they called hospitals and jails, but there was no record of Davante anywhere. According to his mother, Davante left his clothes and musical equipment, but his tattooing equipment wasn't home.\n\n  \nDavante's car, a blue 2016 Jeep Compass with D.C. tags, was found on the 27th, 6 miles (9.7 km) east of the Greybull area of Wyoming, in Big Horn County, over 1,600 miles (2575 km) away from where he was last seen, but Davante himself wasn't located- the discovery of the vehicle was reported on the 29th. The car was abandoned on an off-the-beaten-path bentonite haul road used by two local mines. The road itself is unmaintained and unpaved, and there are no homes in the 0.5 mile (0.8 km) radius from the car; The nearest settlement is a town of Greybull, about 6-8 miles (9.7-13 km) away. The jeep wasn't damaged, but it was out of gas. Davante's laptop, keys, charger and 2 cellphones were found inside. The person who found the car claimed that there were no footprints leading away from it. Davante used his laptop to make music and do graphic design, so it was suspicious that he left it behind. His family says that Davante had never been in Wyoming and doesn't know the area.  \n\n  \nAn alleged sigting of Davante took place on the 26th, on a gas station about 150 miles (241 km) south from where his vehicle was located. According to witnesses, Davante entered the passanger side of his jeep, while a white woman entered the driver's seat. \n\n\n\nAn investigator from Colorado was brought in to help with the searches, which involved drones and a helicopter, as well as people on horseback and on foot. Law enforcement is convinced that Davante wasn't in the 6 mile (9.7 km) radius around his car. A K9 sniffing dog was brought to help, but it failed to find Davante's scent. It was believed that Davante travelled through Nebraska, but new developments show that he actually went through the highline of South Dakota into Buffalo and through the Big Horn Mountains. Davante travelled non stop for over 24 hours.\n\n  \nIt's believed that Davante wanted to reach Kanye West's ranch property, which was around 15-20 miles (25-32 km) away from where his car was found. The ranch itself is near Greybull. Police contacted West's team to ask if anyone had any contact with Davante, but they denied ever seeing or talking to him. \n\n  \nThe car was later processed by police, and a few red flags have been noticed by them; For example, the fact that the jeep was in a remarkably good condition for a vehicle that allegedly travelled the distance it did. The inside was also very clean, with a notable lack of fast food wrappers and similar clutter which tends to build up during a long roadtrip. No form of ID was found, and neither were Davante's clothes, a travel bag, wallet or any bank cards. There had been no bank activity on Davante's account ever since he disappeared.\n\n\n\nCONCLUSION\n\n  \nI believe that Davante most likely became a victim of a manic episode or a similar form of mental breakdown. He had recently lost his job and was living on unemployment checks according to his mother, and caught COVID shortly after. The pandemic was already a difficult time on the psyches of many people due to isolation and fear of them or their loved ones getting sick, and it wouldn't be impossible that Davante was one of those people. The way he talked about Kanye West being \"his friend\" sets off alarms for me, especially since there's no proof that Davante and Kanye ever even met. \n\n\n\nI think that he might've developed a delusion that Kanye was a personal friend who would help him jumpstart his music career; On impulse, Davante got into his car and drove to Wyoming to meet West on his ranch. People in manic episodes tend to make extreme decisions that they would never make outside of them, which is why Davante left without contacting his loved ones. The fact that there were no food wrappers, while potentially a red herring, could also be explained- people in manic episodes might forget about eating or drinking. That's also why he drove for over 24 hours- he was so determined to get to Wyoming that he simply didn't feel exhaustion or hunger. When he finally got to Greybull, he started to look for the ranch and took the road his car was found on. The jeep ran out of gas, so Davante went out to find a gas station or anyone who can help, got lost and perished; Perhaps his tiredness, hunger and dehydration negatively impacted his ability to navigate or judge his situation- so he left his electronics thinking that he will be back soon. \n\n\n\nIt's possible that Davante got catfished by someone who claimed to be Kanye, but if that's the case, then this would have to be the worst catfishing attempt ever concieved, given that Davante's electronics and car weren't stolen and were just left on a road that was used, even if infrequently, in a place where a personal car would stick out like a sore thumb (since the only other cars that used it were transport trucks). \n\n\n\nDavante's family believes that he wouldn't run away to start a new life, mostly due to his close relationship with his mother. From what we know about him, Davante was a calm homebody with a small group of friends who would rather stay at home and listen to music- hardly the kind of person who'd want to escape from some problems like debts, dangerous people or abusive family. He also had no children and wasn't in a relationship, so no responsibilities in that area of life. \n\n\n\nThere is a chance that Davante had met with foul play, but I think that's unlikely. Neither his car nor electronics were stolen, and I don't see why someone would attack him, other than due to a completely random desire for a thrill kill, which are exceptionally rare. I think that the sighting on the gas station isn't very credible- people often think that they saw a missing person and report it (usually with good intentions), but it more often than not proves to be someone else, so unless Davante was recorded with the woman or anyone else on something like a security camera, I wouldn't believe it.  \n\n  \nKanye West was actually allegedly in his ranch in Wyoming in July. \n\n  \nAt the time of his disappearance, Davante Richardson was 28, making him about 32 now. He's Black, with black hair and brown eyes. He's 6'0\" to 6'1\" and 165 to 175 lbs. Davante has a mole on the right side of his face under his bottom lip, sleeve tattoos on both of his arms, and the word “BLUE” tattooed across his left knuckles. He was last seen wearing a blue shirt, gray sweatpants, multicolor new balance shoes, a blue durag, a brown/black bag with tattoo equipment and perscription sunglasses. \n\n  \nIf you believe you have any info on Davante's disappearance, contact the Big Horn County Sheriff at 307-568-2324. You can also send an anonymous tip to the Wyoming Division of Criminal Investigation [online](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfuqshQteYsWouQnnN0PdJ24fnUZ960VISHwELisvGp_kZnog/viewform) or by calling 307-777-7181. \n\n\n\nSOURCES:\n\n1.

      "title": "Strangulation in San Francisco: A pregnant teenage girl is seen leaving home, walking in the opposite direction as her stated destination. The next morning she is found strangled and stripped of all belongings. Who killed Yvonne Quilantang and her unborn baby in June 1973?",
      "text": "*Hello! This is part of my series on unsolved cases in California from the 1960s and 70s. If you are interested, the most recent post was on* [*the disappearance of Essie Hiett*](https://www.reddit.com/r/UnresolvedMysteries/comments/1lzz2dj/rained_out_in_oroville_a_woman_crashes_her_car/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)*. If you have any questions, comments, or feedback regarding these posts, please let me know.*\n\n*Warning: As indicated by the title, this case involves violence against a pregnant person, as well as the death of a mother and her seven month fetus. Reader discretion is advised.*\n\n[Yvonne Quilantang](https://cacoldcases.blogspot.com/2025/07/the-murder-of-yvonne-j-quilantang-june.html) was born on July 11, 1957 in San Francisco to parents Terezo Vincent Quilantang and Evelyn Marie Quilantang (nee Leroy). Yvonne and her siblings were biracial, half white, half Asian: their father, Terezo, was an immigrant from the Philippines. Some sources from the 1970s and 80s mistakenly list Yvonne as either solely Black, or as Black and Filipina. However, thorough research on Ancestry indicates that she was not Black at all, but instead Filipina and white.\n\nShe was baptized Catholic. She was the youngest of six children: her older siblings are Sharon, Vincente, Michael, Linda, and Thomas; the latter was only two years older than her.\n\nYvonne's father was a seaman. Her mother eventually grew unable to care for her, so Yvonne was \"taken into a foster home, where she had lived almost since she could remember.\" She seemed to still be in contact with her birth family.\n\nIn early June 1973, Yvonne was 15 years old and attending Opportunity II High School. She was living with the Brodericks, an Asian-American long-time foster family in the Visitacion Valley neighborhood of San Francisco. The family consisted of Joyce Jacqueline Broderick (nee Davies), William John Broderick, and their two biological children Tom (b. 1945) and Jacqueline (\"Jackie,\" b. 1954).\n\nIn 1958, encouraged by both their local priest as well as their daughter Jackie's longing for another child around her age in the house, the Brodericks began fostering through the Catholic Social Service. The Broderick couple, both half-white, half-Asian themselves, became semi-known for taking in children of all ethnicities: at one point, the family was caring for a Japanese orphan, a Mexican-American girl named Leilani, and three Spanish-German sisters all at the same time.\n\nWilliam Broderick passed away in 1965, though that did not deter his wife Joyce from continuing to foster children. Later, in December 1971, when she was 17 years old, daughter Jackie married a 21-year-old named Kenneth Tate; the couple continued to live with the Brodericks. By June 1973, Joyce was fostering at least two children: Yvonne Quilantang and another girl named Rita.\n\nAccording to Yvonne's friend Carla Bell, \"She had lots of friends. People liked her.\" Yvonne's sister-in-law said of her, \"She was very quiet, just starting to break out. She was popular, going to lots of parties. She was well-liked.\"\n\nOne of Yvonne's teachers stated, \"Yvonne was shy and tried to hide it by coming on hard. It didn't work, though. About halfway through any conversation, that smile would break through. It was a wonderful smile. She just couldn't help smiling.\"\n\nYvonne was six or seven months pregnant at the time of her disappearance; the father was reportedly a \"friend in San Francisco\" who was a \"local man.\" Yvonne also reportedly had a boyfriend in the Army at Fort Leonard Wood, Missouri. The implied age difference of at *least* three years in both relationships is troubling, to say the least.\n\nYvonne had apparently told her friends that, \"she hoped to marry the soldier in Missouri, \\[and\\] that the baby would make no difference.\"\n\nYvonne's friends noted that she wanted to keep her baby and seemed excited to be a mother. Prior to her death she had made plans to take training in how to care for an infant during the summer of 1973. The names of — or any further information regarding, for that matter — neither Yvonne's boyfriend nor the father of her child were made public.\n\nWhile Yvonne struggled with reading in school, she had been working hard to improve, and was apparently making \"excellent progress.\" She was talented in art and music, and her singing class was one of her favorites at school. As the end of the school year was nearing, Yvonne was looking forward to the recording session that the class planned as \"a sort of end-of-year ceremony.\"\n\nYvonne had promised to go to the recording session, which was held on the night of Saturday, June 9, 1973. However, she never arrived.\n\n**Death**\n\nEarlier that afternoon, Yvonne asked her foster sister Rita if she wanted anything from the Cala store, where she was reportedly going to purchase cigarettes. The store was down the hill from their home at 140 Delta St in Visitacion Valley. The home was directly adjacent to McLaren Park. Rita declined the offer.\n\nAs Yvonne was getting ready to leave, the telephone rang, and she picked it up. It is unknown who Yvonne spoke to. A later report stated that she was heard \"arguing with a male on the telephone.\" She reportedly ended the call by saying that she had to go to the store.\n\nYvonne took her purse, but not her coat, and left the house. She was seen walking in the opposite direction as the store. Authorities reportedly believed that the story about her intended location was a ruse, and that Yvonne was instead actually meeting someone. It is unknown if she did in fact intend to meet with anyone, let alone whom.\n\nYvonne's foster mother, Joyce Broderick, filed a missing persons report for the girl that afternoon, Saturday, June 9, 1973. Yvonne was 5'3 and 125 lbs with brown eyes, long black hair, and pierced ears. I could not find any description of what she was last seen wearing.\n\nThe next day, Sunday, June 10, 1973, the nude body of a young woman was found in some bushes in a trash-filled lot by two neighborhood children who were playing there. The lot was located in the 1300 block of Galvez Avenue in the Bay View District of San Francisco.\n\nFour days later, on June 14th, the San Francisco Coroner's Office officially identified the deceased as Yvonne after police matched the description of the body with the missing persons report that Joyce had made. At the time, police were uncertain as to the exact cause of death, and pathology tests were underway.\n\nIt was eventually determined that Yvonne had been strangled. Naturally, her baby unfortunately did not make it either. There were no signs of sexual assault, and Yvonne's clothes were not recovered. One clipping described her body as \"battered.\" There are few details about her death itself.\n\n**A Possible Series?**\n\nTen days before Yvonne's death, on May 29, 1973, the body of [Rosa Vasquez](https://cacoldcases.blogspot.com/2025/07/the-murder-of-rosa-maria-vasquez-may.html), a 20-year-old Latina woman, was found nude and strangled just inside Golden Gate Park. On June 24th, authorities stated that Rosa and Yvonne's murders were unrelated. Then on July 1, 1973, the nude body of Angela Thomas, a 16-year-old white girl, was found in the play yard of Benjamin Franklin Junior High School in San Francisco. She had been smothered, possibly with a pillow. Authorities again stated they believed the murders were unrelated.\n\nHowever, LE's opinions seem to have changed slightly two weeks later, after Nancy Gidley, a 24-year-old white woman, was found, nude and strangled, near the athletic field of George Washington High School in San Francisco on July 15, 1973. A spokesman for police stated at the time, \"We're treating these cases as individuals. However, the similarities are sufficient that we cannot exclude the possibility we have one person involved.\"\n\nAll four victims — Rosa Vasquez, Yvonne Quilantang, Angela Thomas, and Nancy Gidley — were young women and girls who were found in public places in San Francisco, nude and strangled or smothered. There were no clothing articles at any of the scenes, and LE believed they had all been killed at a different location before being dumped where they were found. Several of them had \"signs of minor injuries seemingly approximal to the time of death.\" All four also had connections to the military: in Yvonne's case, her boyfriend was an Army soldier stationed in Missouri.\n\nOn August 8, 1973, Chief of Police Donald M Scott of the San Francisco PD published an information bulletin regarding the four homicides, listing the similarities and summaries of each. The bulletin ordered that \"All patrol units should pay particular attention to schoolyard areas during night watches and special attention given during weekends and holidays.\" It also provided contact info for anyone with information.\n\nIt should be noted that the two adult victims, Rosa Vasquez and Nancy Gidley, were sexually assaulted, while no evidence of such exists in the cases of Yvonne Quilantang and Angela Thomas. Yvonne was the only pregnant victim. By November 1973, the head of the homicide detail stated that no suspects had been apprehended in any of the four cases, which were believed to be related at the time. None of the four San Francisco cases were ever solved.\n\n**Further Connections**\n\nIn February 1975 the California Department of Justice (CA DOJ) issued a special report titled \"Unsolved Female Homicides: An Analysis of a Series of Related Murders in California and Western America.\" The report indicated that, \"After evaluating more than one hundred murder cases involving female victims, it appears that thirteen of these crimes\" — with fourteen victims total — \"were committed by the same person. Each of the thirteen cases occurred in Northern California within the past five years. As of this writing, the suspect remains unknown and the cases unsolved\" (pp4 of pdf).\n\nThe four aforementioned 1973 San Francisco victims — including Yvonne — were included in the report. It is unknown if her death is still thought to be connected to the others by law enforcement. Six of the other crimes in the report are now known as the Santa Rosa Hitchhiker Murders. I have linked the 1975 CA DOJ report, as well as other police correspondence that were generated during the creation of the report, below.\n\nIn 1976, it was proposed by the press that Yvonne was a possible victim of a then-unidentified serial killer who strangled young Black women to death in San Francisco from 1975-1976. By 1982, the perpetrator  was identified as John Norris Hanks. However, he was never charged with Yvonne's death, and I could not find further reports on his possible connection to Yvonne's case after 1986. Furthermore, thorough research on Ancestry confirms that Yvonne was not Black, but instead a dark-skinned Filipina girl.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThere does not appear to be any named suspects at this time. She is not featured on the San Francisco Cold Cases page. After about 1986, the only mentions of Yvonne's death that I could find existed in online forums and true crime discussion spaces.\n\nBecause of this, on July 20, 2025, I submitted a public records request to the SFPD asking for any existing files regarding Yvonne's case. On July 29th I received the following response from SFPD:\n\n>OPEN CASE: This case remains an open investigation and disclosure of the requested information at this time may endanger successful completion of that investigation and/or adjudication. The SFPD declines to release records under Cal. Govt. Code § 7923.600, which exempts from disclosure records of complaints to, investigations conducted by, intelligence information or security procedures of, and investigatory or security files compiled by local police agencies and 67.24(d) of the SF Administrative code. \n\nThis is **official confirmation that Yvonne's case is still open and being investigated as of July 2025.**\n\nAnyone with information in Yvonne's case is urged to please contact the San Francisco Police Department’s Homicide Detail at (415) 553-1145. Tipsters can also submit information anonymously by calling the SFPD tip line at (415) 553-1166. The agency case number is 73-046374.\n\n**Questions**\n\nWhat do you think happened to Yvonne? Did she know her killer? Was she attacked by either of the two men she was involved with, or possibly a classmate or friend? Was she actually planning on meeting up with someone that afternoon? Or was she a random victim, possibly of a serial killer?\n\n**Sources** \n\n[FindAGrave](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/106578579/yvonne-quilantang) \n\n*Oakland Tribune* [6/15/73](https://www.newspapers.com/article/oakland-tribune-yvonne-quilantang-oakl/173003348/)\n\n*SF Examiner* [6/24/73](https://www.newspapers.com/article/the-san-francisco-examiner-quilantang/39348965/), [7/6/73](https://www.newspapers.com/article/the-san-francisco-examiner-the-tragic-en/143569351/), [7/16/73](https://www.newspapers.com/article/the-san-francisco-examiner-sf-examiner-7/173003742/), [7/18/73](https://www.newspapers.com/article/the-san-francisco-examiner-murdered-woma/143568891/)\n\n*Martinez News-Gazette* [7/19/73](https://www.newspapers.com/article/martinez-news-gazette/167833638/) \n\n[1973 SFPD Bulletin](https://cacoldcases.blogspot.com/p/1973-sfpd-police-bulletin.html) \n\n*SF Examiner* [11/8/73](https://www.newspapers.com/article/the-san-francisco-examiner-linda-odell-o/32644468/), [12/19/76](https://www.newspapers.com/article/the-san-francisco-examiner-murder-invest/129963285/), [10/21/82](https://www.newspapers.com/article/the-san-francisco-examiner-joetta-rodger/129958163/) \n\n[Sonoma County SO files sent to Seattle PD, Aug. 1974](https://cacoldcases.blogspot.com/p/sonoma-county-so-files-to-seattle-pd.html), pages 7 and 17\n\n[1975 CA DOJ Report](https://cacoldcases.blogspot.com/p/1975-ca-doj-report-on-unsolved-female.html) \n\n[List of Unsolved Female Homicides Compiled by NM State Police, March 1975](https://cacoldcases.blogspot.com/p/ufh-list-compiled-by-nm-state-police.html), page 1\n\n*SF Examiner* [4/23/75](https://www.newspapers.com/article/the-san-francisco-examiner-zodiac-theory/59017039/) \n\n[Broderick foster family, *SF Examiner* 10/31/62](https://www.newspapers.com/article/the-san-francisco-examiner-broderick-fos/173132886/)",

      "title": "A woman who escaped a violent domestic situation with her young son suddenly starts exhibiting weird behaviors; When her mother returns home after a few hours, all of her daughter's belongings are gone, and she and her son are nowhere to be found- Where are Sophia and Matteo van Dam? (2023)",
      "text": "Hello everyone! As always, I'd like to thank you for all your comments and votes under my last post about Joniah Walker- I hope that she will be found safe and soon. \n\n  \nToday I'd like to bring up a case of a double disappearance of a mother and her young son.\n\n\n\nBACKGROUND\n\n  \nSophia van Dam was 20 when she went missing with her son, Matteo (also spelled as Matayo) van Dam, who was 2, from Beaufort, Sumter County, South Carolina, USA. \n\n  \nSophia grew up in Beaufort as the youngest of 5. She graduated from Battery Creek High School a year early, when she was pregnant with her son, and then went on to obtain a welding certification. At 16, Sophia had ran away from home, but Desiree Pevey, her sister, said that she was free to return anytime she'd need or want. Theresa van Dam, Sophia's mother, said that ever since then her daughter had a tendency to spend time with the wrong crowd.\n\n  \nSophia lived in Sumter with her son and boyfriend, Jonas Jerry Washington Jr (24 yo), for a few months before she and her son went missing. The neighbours said that the van Dams were \"quiet\" and \"kept to themselves\"- they sometimes saw Sophia mowing the front lawn, while little Matteo would run around and play on the porch.\n\n  \nSophia's and Jonas Jr's relationship had allegedly gotten \"violent\" in the past. Jonas Jr is currently under arrest on unrelated charges.\n\n  \nTheresa described her daughter as \"very bright, very smart, very street smart\", \"bubbly\", \"a leader\", and said that she \"liked to make people laugh\"; Her grandson was \"very inquisitive\" and that he \"wants to be outside, wants to explore\".\n\n\n\nDISAPPEARANCE\n\n  \nOn the 4th of June, Sophia called Theresa to explain to her that \"something\" happened between her and her boyfriend, and that she wanted to stay at her family home in Beaufort with Matteo; There are also records that show that police responded to a domestic call that came from the Sumter home that day. Weeks before that, however, Sophia asked, during a phonecall with Theresa, if her parents would be okay if she called them in the middle of the night and said that she needs to come home. \n\n  \nTheresa last saw Sophia and Matteo on 1AM of the 21st of June; Sophia appeared confused, and she would do things like repeating what she just said multiple times. Theresa wanted to take her to a hospital on a suspicion of a psychotic breakdown, but Sophia refused. When Theresa came home at 3:30AM, both her daughter and grandson were gone- the doors were locked, and all of their items were gone, and the house was in \"disarray\".   \n\n\n\nThe last contact Theresa had with Sophia was a text conversation on the 24th of June. Theresa said that her daughter was saying \"crazy things\", which she attributed to the recend turbulence in her daughter's life; However, she also speculated that Sophia might've been been under the influence of drugs, as she was \"talking out of her mind\". In the conversation, Sophia said that she was coming back to her home in Sumter.\n\n  \nDesiree said that all the calls to her sister have been going to voicemail since the 26th of June. She noted that it was unusual, as Sophia was known to have a phone at hand. The last ping from Sophia's cellphone was registered \"near Santee Cooper Lake on Interstate 95\" (most likely refering to Lake Marion).\n\n  \nWhen the investigators arrived at Sophia's home on the 28th of June to perform a wellness check (requested by Theresa), they've discovered that her car was still in the driveway- it was taken into police custody for forensic testing. Matteo's car seat was also found in the car. When they knocked on the doors, however, nobody answered.\n\n  \nA neighbour said that the last time he saw anyone in Sophia's car, it was a group made up of \"two guys and a little kid\", but they noted that the child didn't look like Matteo. It's not clear when the sighting took place.\n\n\n\nJonas Jr was arrested on the 30th of June on unrelated charges- for fleeing to evade arrest, trespassing and being a fugitive from justice related to the 2021 charges in Beaufort County for possession of a weapon in the commission of a violent crime, kidnapping, larceny and burglary related to an alleged carjacking. He was out on bail for the 2021 charges.     \n\n  \nIn August, a property that belonged to Jonas' father was searched. Jonas Sr isn't considered a suspect, and he had no idea why his property was even searched. \n\n  \nCONCLUSION\n\n\n\nI feel like the way timeline was relayed for this case was very confusing, with dates changing between sources and different details being mixed up with eachother... I did my best to make sense of it, but please tell me if there's a mistake. Especially the day of last contact, the 21st of June- it kept changing between the 21st and 22nd, which I'm assuming is due to the events happening at night.\n\n\n\nSophia's poor mental state shortly before she went missing is worrying me. There hasn't been anything said about her having a mental illness, and Theresa seemed to be concerned for her well-being, which suggests that it was something that happened at random, and not something like an attack of a mental illness her family knew about. I wonder if something happened that triggered a decline of Sophia's mental health, like a phonecall with Jonas Jr- Theresa seems to believe he was involved. Of course, it's also possible that Sophia's sudden onset didn't have anything to do with a specific situation, and more just with the overall stress she was under at the time. \n\n\n\nPure speculation here, but I wonder if Sophia might've been a drug user, and that's what caused her to behave strangely. It was kind of implied by Theresa, but only when she was referring to Sophia after she went missing; It's possible she was taking drugs while she was still in her family home. I don't say this with an intent to judge Sophia, but to consider a scenario that might've taken place.\n\n\n\nIt's hard to not wonder if Jonas Jr didn't have anything to do with the disappearance of Sophia and Matteo. We know that their relationship got physical in the past, and some kind of conflict between them was the reason why Sophia and Matteo moved to Sophia's parents in the first place. There doesn't seem to be any specific details to link the disappearance and Jonas Jr, or at least none that we know about. I wonder if the sighting of strange people in Sophia's car after she went missing had anything to do with Jonas Jr- did he know these people?  \n\n\n\nThere's a chance that Sophia and Matteo died due to misadventure or suicide. Given Sophia's altered mental state at the time, perhaps she felt like Matteo and her were in danger, so they packed up and left, and then had an accident or commited suicide? There's also a chance that they were murdered, maybe by Jonas Jr or by a stranger who saw their opportunity when they saw a vulnerable mother and her child? There's also a chance that they are still alive, but where are they then? Why would Sophia not want to contact her loving and supportive family, especially when she probably has her young son with her?  \n\n\nThe house Sophia had been renting was officially \"released\" by the law enforcement; That will allow Theresa and other family members to retrieve Sophia's and Matteo's things and get a good look at the house to find any potential clues. It's unclear if anything came out of it.\n\n\n\nIf you have any information about the wherabouts of Sophia and/or Matteo, contact the Beaufort County Sheriff’s office at 843-524-2777. Crime Stoppers can be contacted annonymously at 1-888-CRIME-SC. Tips may also be submitted online to SLED at tips@sled.sc.gov.\n\nSORURCES:\n\n1.

      "title": "December 13, 2011: Couple in their 60s are murdered in their home, execution style. Who killed John and Geraldine Magee?",
      "text": "Andover, Massachusetts is a historic town of about 36,000, located twenty miles north of Boston. It was founded in 1642 and incorporated in 1647. Today it is an affluent town, quiet and considered a safe place to live. Yet in December 2011, the town was shocked when only the second murder in nine years occurred in  a million-dollar house in an exclusive subdivision.  \n\nJohn (Jack) and Geraldine (Jeri) Magee lived in the well-to-do Orchard Crossing neighborhood where John's firm had built many of the houses, including their own 5,500 square foot mansion on two acres. Jack, 69, was a former lawyer and now a successful real estate developer, having taken over his father's construction business in 1974. Jeri, 67, was a retired teacher and was involved with her grandchildren and with community activities. Jack and Jeri were high school sweethearts who had been married 39 years. They had two adult children, son John Jr., who worked in his father's business, and daughter Holly. They were grandparents to Holly's two children. They were well-known, respected, and liked in the area. To all outward appearances, a charmed life and unlikely victims.  \n\nOn Dec. 13, Jack told John Jr. to pick up some construction materials in Boston and bring them to a job site in Reading the following day. John went to his father's office in the basement of his parents' house to look for details of what he was to pick up, leaving for his own home in Somerville at about 4:30 pm. Around the same time, Jeri and Holly spoke on the phone to arrange babysitting for the next day. \n\nThe morning of Dec. 14, Holly came to drop off her kids with their grandmother. She found the front door unlocked (one article says locked), but on entering, she didn't see her mother. The TV was on and the dog was there. Holly's daughter soon discovered her grandparents dead in the living room. Holly grabbed her children and left the house, calling 911 about 9:20 am.\n\nPolice found the couple had been shot at close range with a .45 caliber weapon. Jack was shot in the head, neck and chest. Jeri was shot in the head. Their hands were bound. The house showed no evidence of forced entry or of being ransacked. Per Holly, the garage door was open. Jack and Jeri were still dressed in day clothes, so they had not yet gone to bed. The time of death was estimated to have been no later than 9:30 pm on Dec. 13. At 10:30 pm on the 13th, the Magees' SUV had been found burned out on a street in Boston's North End, about an hour's drive away. It had not been identified until the discovery of the bodies.\n\nThe crime scene yielded little information, no fingerprints or DNA. The couple did have a security system, but there had been no alarms and there was no security camera footage to give any clues. Police could not find usable information from the remains of the car. A witness saw a man of average height and build walking away from the car, but nothing came of this very generic lead.\n\nPolice ruled out robbery as a motive, since nothing obvious had been taken and the house was in order. They turned their attention to John's business dealings, but could find nothing nefarious, no apparent enemies or serious business disputes, no significant financial issues that might give cause for the killing.  John Jr. denied any problems with the business or its customers.  \n\nThe crime bore some elements of a professional job, with the bound hands, close-range shooting, and burning of the SUV. But no solid evidence of ties to organized crime could be found, and both Magee children denied that there was any such involvement. They knew of no connection with the area where their parents' burned-out car had been found.  \n\nPolice could not find any evidence of feuds, disagreements, or other issues of a personal nature between the Magees and their neighbors. Law enforcement conducted extensive interviews of persons associated with the Magees in business and in their personal lives. The Magees' homes in Andover and Jupiter, FL were searched multiple times, as were cars associated with the business and family members' cars. The investigation reached out to outside agencies including the State Police, the FBI, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives, even the Department of Homeland Security. Throughout, the police have remained tight-lipped about the investigation, and have maintained that the killings were targeted, with no threat to the public. Since the early days, very little has been printed about the case, most articles merely repeating the same basic facts. Police put out calls for tips or witnesses on the year, six-year and ten-year anniversaries of the crime.\n\nOn the ten-year anniversary, the Magee children released the following statement:\n\n“It’s been almost ten years since the tragic deaths of Jack and Jeri Magee. Our family has lost ten years of love, smiles, wisdom, support and happiness with them. For the past decade, we have hoped and prayed for answers and closure to this horrible crime.  \nWe hope that the ten-year commemoration of this terrible event will encourage those who have information on this crime to come forward. The time is now and this injustice should not continue. We support the authorities in their investigation, and hope that they will be able to bring this case to a clear conclusion soon.”  \n\nAs of now, the case remains cold. Anyone with information is encouraged to call the Massachusetts State Police assigned to the Essex County DA’s Office at: (978)-745-8908.   \n\nIt is hard to draw conclusions based on the little information in this case. We have an outside limit on time of death, but no earliest time. No details of forensic evidence have been released. My thought is that it was a robbery gone wrong, that was staged to look like a hit. After 13 years, I think law enforcement would have found out if there were ties to a criminal organization. Of course it is possible they did find such ties, but can't make a case without additional information. It is interesting how closed-mouthed they have been about the case for so many years. Personal or business vendettas seem unlikely, as colleagues and neighbors have all described Jack in terms such as “upstanding” and “the nicest guy you could meet.” The family were investigated and none were ever persons of interest.\n\nAfter 13 years, this case seems likely to remain unsolved. It is surprising for something so shocking and with no apparent motive.  \n\nSources:  \n[Boston Globe, 12/16/11: Andover couple found slain at home](https://www.newspapers.com/image/940346113/)  \n[The Daily Item, 12/16/2011: Developer, wife killed in Andover home; SUV torched](https://www.newspapers.com/image/940346113/)  \n[The Boston Globe, 12/8/2015: Police seek help in unsolved Andover slayings](https://www.newspapers.com/image/444552983/)  \n[John and Geraldine Magee Murder in Andover Massachusetts](https://citytowner.com/john-and-geraldine-magee-andover-ma/)  \n[New England Unsolved: New information in the murder of John and Geraldine Magee](https://www.boston25news.com/news/local/essex-county/new-englands-unsolved-new-information-murder-john-geraldine-magee/GNYSELA4PZAGLFMUKGZAWUUZCI/)      \n[Team 5 reveals new crime scene details in shocking double slaying\n](https://www.wcvb.com/article/team-5-reveals-new-crime-scene-details-in-shocking-double-slaying/8175123)   \n[Two years later, couple's murder remains a mystery](https://www.andovertownsman.com/news/local_news/two-years-later-couples-murder-remains-a-mystery/article_da8c543e-1073-51e9-b38f-cd02d3b532cc.html)  \n[Was the murder of the wealthy couple a \"professional\" hit?

      "title": "The strange disappearance of Jón Jónsson",
      "text": "Jón Jónsson was a 41 year old Icelandic man who vanished under strange circumstances in Dublin on February 9th 2019. Despite extensive searches and appeals, no trace of him has ever been found.\n\nJón flew to Ireland by himself on February 8th with the intention of playing in a poker tournament over the weekend and then spending the rest of the time there with his fiancé as a holiday. Jón arrived into Dublin by himself and checked into the Bonnington hotel in the north of the city, the same venue that was hosting the tournament. He played throughout the night and everything seemed well. According to an eyewitness who was at the tournament, he seemed to be happy and in good form but they did state that he lost €4000 that night. He was also described as drinking a huge amount, enough that people were surprised that he could still stand. The following morning, Jón's fiancé arrived in Dublin, a woman by the name of Jana Gudjonsdottir. She arrived at the hotel around 10am and found Jón asleep in their hotel room. They had a brief conversation and then Jana decided to go downstairs to get some coffee. In the short period of time that she was gone, Jón very suddenly and unexpectedly left the hotel at 11:05am. It has never been determined why he decided to leave but he left behind his phone, wallet and passport, taking only his hotel key card. His family stated that they believed he had a large sum of money on him when he left the hotel but this has never been confirmed and it's uncertain why they held this belief.\n\nAt 11:07am, Jón was captured on CCTV walking past a pub and a nursing home before exiting onto Swords Road, heading towards Collins Avenue. He was last captured on CCTV walking past Highfield health centre. After this, Jón was never seen again. After he didn't return to the hotel all day, his fiancé started to grow concerned. When he hadn't returned by the following morning, Jana reported him missing to the Garda. Members of Jón's family flew over to Dublin immediately and a large scale search was launched with his family, Gardaí and civil defence all looking but no trace of him was found. In the CCTV footage of Jón before he vanished, he appeared relaxed and leisurely, smoking a cigarette and sauntering along. He wasn't followed and wasn't with anyone else. Jón's family are adamant he didn't disappear deliberately as he had just renewed his taxi licence back in Iceland and had upcoming family arrangements that he was excited for. One of his brothers had also described him as \"a nice, caring, reliable and stable guy\" and stated that he was always open about his finances and that if he needed financial help, he would have just asked his family. \n\nIn 2020, a criminal who was incarcerated in an Icelandic prison contacted Jón's family and told them something interesting. He claimed that the €4000 that Jón lost on his first night belonged to an Icelandic criminal who was in Dublin at the time. Jón had allegedly gone to meet him to acquire more funds but things turned violent when the man got angry over his money being lost and accidentally killed Jón. His body was then allegedly buried in a nearby park. On an undisclosed date after his disappearance, both Garda and a local priest received letters that stated that he was killed after losing money and that his remains could be found buried in a park in Dublin. In 2024, an extensive search of Santry Park was conducted by Garda with the assistance of cadaver dogs but absolutely nothing was discovered. The search was subsequently called off. To date, no trace of Jón has been discovered and Garda now strongly suspect that he met foul play. However, with absolutely no sign of him or any solid information on what happened that day, this baffling case remains unsolved.\n\nIn March 2025, over 6 years since Jón vanished, it was announced that the Garda were enlisting the assistance of Europol to help them with the investigation. This development would seem to suggest that the Garda now suspect a criminal element to the case, with it being noted that they were following up on lots of new tips, including suggestions that Jón may have been killed by a hitman in a case of mistaken identity.\n\nSources:https://m.independent.ie/irish-news/watch-cctv-of-missing-icelandic-man-jon-jonsson-released/37855574.html\n\n https://www.rte.ie/news/2024/0209/1431288-missing-appeal/\n\nhttps://m.independent.ie/irish-news/no-results-from-dublin-park-search-for-missing-icelandic-man-jon-jonsson-gardai/a751807446.html\n\nhttps://www.irishmirror.ie/news/irish-news/gardai-fear-missing-icelandic-tourist-32118294\n\nhttps://www.irishtimes.com/crime-law/2025/03/13/gardai-enlist-europol-to-assist-in-case-of-missing-icelandic-man-jon-jonsson/",

      "title": "In Michigan in September of 1997, six year old Brittney Ann Beers was last seen talking to an unknown man in a red car, before she disappeared. Soon, reports of abuse in her own own household came to light, and another known murderer was investigated. What happened to Brittney? ",
      "text": "**Warning: This write up discusses the abuse of children, and it may be distressing to some readers. Please read at your own discretion.**\n\nIn September of 1997, six year old [Brittney Ann Beers](https://imgur.com/a/BNhER1W) was living with her mother, Tina Stetler, and her father’s brother, James Allen Beers, along with two siblings, at the Village Manor Apartments in Sturgis, Michigan. Brittney was described by her older sister, Dixie, as being a quiet and shy girl, who was *“so scared and skittish to talk to strangers,”* but a very loving child, who especially enjoyed the outdoors. In 1997, Brittney attended Fawn River Elementary school, where her favorite subject was art. One day, Brittney came home with an art piece that she was especially fond of- a collage of pasted oak leaves on a sheet on construction paper. The two girls shared a father, but since they had different mothers, the sisters lived in different homes. However, they enjoyed each other’s company, and would often make plans to meet at a nearby playground that was in close proximity to both homes. While it appeared that Brittney was living a ordinary life at home, under the surface, things were anything but normal, with Dixie stating: \n\n> *“I was not allowed to visit Brittney’s house. It’s a complicated situation. Brittney’s mother lived with my dad’s brother.”*\n\nOn the evening of September 16th, Brittney left her home dressed in a white, floral printed white shirt, pink tie dye shorts, and white sneakers, and went outside the apartment to play. When her mother left the home around 8:30 pm to run some errands, she spotted Brittney riding her bicycle around the apartment complex, alone. Five minutes after her mother saw Brittney, she was seen by a neighbor who was heading to a nearby Burger King- this time Brittney was sitting on a park bench near the front of the apartments, taking a break from her bike riding. This neighbor reported that Brittney was speaking to a man inside of a red or brown car, when Brittney approached the neighbor, telling them that she had made a “new friend.” Sadly, this would be the last time anyone would see Brittney Ann Beers. \n\nWhen Brittney’s mother returned home at about 9:05 pm, she told Brittney’s half brother to go outside and fetch her, because it was time for her to come home. When he returned back to the apartment, informing his mother that he couldn’t find Brittney around the property, Tina called the authorities to report her missing at 10:30 pm. A search party was immediately coordinated, starting at the apartment complex and branching outwards. The public safety director, Geoff Smith, was one of the first on scene- he stated that they searched all night, taking only four hours off to sleep, and then they resumed the search. Bloodhounds were brought in to track Brittney’s scent, which led them to the parking lot a nearby convenience store, but the scent had stopped there and they weren’t able to pick it back up. This convenience store was often used by truckers, as it was located along the main thoroughfare leading out of Sturgis. Authorities decided that they would next search areas that Brittney was known to play in or near, which included railroad tracks, nearby fields, and storage buildings, but they turned up empty handed. \n\nInvestigators did not believe that Brittney had simply run away, but concluded that she had most likely been abducted. A [composite sketch](https://imgur.com/a/TJZ0ecS ) of the man in the red or brown car, who was last seen talking to Brittney, was drawn up and distributed in the area. This man was in his late 20’s to early 30’s, with short, dark hair, a mustache, and driving either a red or brown midsized Renault. This man was never directly named a suspect, but they wanted to speak to him regarding the disappearance of Brittney, to see if he had any pertinent information. \n\nWhile police were searching for the unidentified man, they weren’t leaving any stone unturned. After hearing rumors about the family, they turned their attention towards Tina Stetler and James Allen Beers, next. Once Brittney went missing, the rumor mill began- and secrets about the Beers home began to emerge. Talk of neglect and even abuse began to circulate, with neighbors stating that they often saw Brittney playing outside unsupervised. A neighbor of the Beers, Gale Ashbrook, came forward with some new information, stating that one time she had seen Brittney playing in a sandbox quite a distance away from the Beer residence, and when Gale told her to head home, because it wasn’t safe, Brittney told her that her mother would often lock her out of the house. Even more disturbing, days before Brittney’s disappearance, James Allen Beer had been booked in jail on domestic violence charges, after hitting Tina with a glass bottle. A babysitter of Brittney came forward to police with a photo, as well- this photo was taken a few days before the disappearance, at the Children’s Day celebration that was held at the Joesph County Grange Fair, showing Brittney with very short hair. When police spoke to Dixie about the photo, she claimed that uncle James had chopped off Brittney’s hair, because she wasn’t taking care of it. \n\nThings became more sinister when in January of 1998, Brittney’s brother and sister, Joshua and Autumn, were removed from the Beer residence by CPS due to abuse allegations. For Tina to get custody of her children back, she was ordered to stay away from James, get a job, and find new residence, but Tina had refused to leave James. A year after Brittney’s disappearance, Joshua and Autumn were removed from Tina’s custody, and she gave up parental rights to both children. Joshua went to live with his father, and Autumn was sent to live with Tina’s brother and sister in law. Authorities stated that if Brittney were ever to be found, a separate petition would be filed to have her removed from the home, as well. \n\nSadly, even more alleged abuse came to light, this time centered around Brittney. In 1994, when Brittney was 3 years old, her babysitter attempted to give her a bath, but Brittney had strongly resisted. Concerned, the babysitter began to question Brittney about why she suddenly began to resist bath time, when Brittney confided in her that the father of her brother, Kevin Folsom, had been molesting her. In August of 1995, Folsom was interviewed by police about the alleged molestation, when he confessed that he had become aroused while bathing Brittney, and he began to touch her. Folsom was convinced on the sexual assault of Brittney, but he was released in 2008. The men in Brittney’s life had all failed her, horribly so, but she did have one man in her life who acted as a proper father figure to her: the father of her sister, Lonnie Garvie, who worked at a local restaurant. Lonnie was often seen caring for and feeding Brittney and her siblings. Sadly, Lonnie died a year before Brittney’s disappearance, and she had lost the one man in her life who had cared for and protected her. \n\n\nIn 2000, police in Sturgis were tipped off to an investigation unfolding in Detroit. A forty one year old man named Russell Tombs was arrested for having over 2,000 pornographic images of minors on his computer. A handful of these photos had depicted a young girl being assaulted, between the ages of 4- 6, who closely resembled Brittney Beers. The Macomb County prosecutor had stated that while most child sexual assault material comes from Europe, the furnishings and appearance of the home in the photos appears to be from America. Sturgis police worked with the Detroit police in order to determine if the girl in the photos were Brittney, but it soon turned out the girl in the photos was tracked down in Texas. The girl testified against her parents, and they were charged and convicted on charges related to the sexual assault and photographs. \n\nIn 2015, another suspect came on the radar of the Sturgis police, a man named [Daniel Kevin Furlong](https://imgur.com/a/aRInTrg). Furlong had been convicted of the 2007 murder of 11 year old Jodi Parrack. Jodi had been abducted while riding her bike, and had been sexually assaulted then strangled.  Furlong had been arrested when he had attempted to restrain another 10 year old in his garage, with electrical wire, and threatened her with a knife- thankfully, this girl was able to escape, and Furlong was soon arrested. When they took Furlong’s DNA after his arrest, it matched to the DNA from Jodi’s crime scene. Furlong soon confessed to the murder of Jodi, and claimed that he had intended to kill the 10 year old who he has abducted. Sturgis police investigated and questioned Furlong in the disappearance of Brittney Beers, however, police weren’t able to conclusively determine if he was involved. And investigator claimed that Furlong was in the area during Brittney’s disappearance, but, Furlong would be evasive and dishonest during every interview they had with them. This investigator stated that they are keeping him as a person of interest, but they cannot name him as a suspect, and they’re didn’t believe a word he said during his interviews. Furlong did, however, closely resemble the man in the composite sketch seen with Brittney prior to her abduction. Thankfully, Furlong was sentenced to 30-60 years for the murder of Jodi Parrack. \n\nYearly vigils were held for Brittney at the Village Manor apartments, and each year Brittney’s grandparents would travel from Texas to Michigan to attend. However, Brittney’s own mother, Tina, only attended one vigil. Tips into Brittney’s case have slowed down each year, until they came to a halt all together, but police are still actively working on the case, pouring over old tips to see if there’s anything they may have missed. Brittney Ann Beers is still missing, and her sister Dixie, still holds out hope that she may one day be found, or at the very least, that her questions about her sister’s disappearance may one day be answered. \n\nWhen last seen, Brittney was described as a Caucasian female, standing at 4’0 and weighing 45 pounds. She was wearing a white floral patterned tank top, pink tiedyed shorts, white sneakers with a pink design on the sides, and her shoelaces had a red stripe down the center of them. Brittney had blonde hair and blue eyes, and she was missing four upper baby teeth. She often wore her hair in a ponytail.

      "title": "In 1995,9-year-old Jack Phillips walked to a picnic area in San Bernardino National Forest near Big Bear Lake. He was never seen again.",
      "text": "This is another story of a child who went missing and the disquieting circumstances around his disappearance.  Jack Daniel Phillips, known as J.D., was just 9 years old in the summer of 1995. He lived with his mother Michelle, his 2 1/2 year old half-brother, and Michelle's boyfriend Rod Cate in Big Bear Lake, California. On August 6, 1995, Big Bear Lake was celebrating Old Miners Day, and Jack watched the parade with his family. What happened afterward is not entirely clear. Many online sources say the family picnicked at the [Aspen Glen picnic area in the Red Ant Hill area of the San Bernardino National Forest](https://www.fs.usda.gov/r05/sanbernardino/recreation/aspen-glen-picnic-area). There was an argument between either Jack and Rod, or between the adults, causing Jack to walk away. Newspapers of the time reported that his mother told police he left home around 5 p.m. to play at Aspen Glen picnic area, which was a distance of about a quarter mile from home. Whichever way it was, when he was still not home at 9 p.m. Michelle drove to the picnic area to look for him. She called police around 9:30 p.m., and a search started immediately.   \n\nThe intensive ground search on foot, ATV, horseback and by helicopter continued for a week with no results. 200 volunteers turned out to search on Aug. 12 alone. But no traces of Jack were found, not even footprints. Search dogs couldn't pick up a scent. There was nothing to indicate he had gone into the forest. The search covered the whole valley. A sheriff's policeman said “I can tell you where he's not. He's not above ground in this valley.” (Judi Bowers, Big Bear Grizzly, Aug 13, 1995).  \n\nThe case was turned over to the detective task force. Flyers were distributed. Police questioned all known sex offenders in the area. A relative in Bakersfield said she received a collect call and thought she heard Jack's voice, but when she accepted the call, there was no one at the other end. (This call is unconfirmed.) Police questioned Jack's father, who was in prison in Bakersfield and was Jack's only other acquaintance there. Police put out a call for photos and video of the Old Miners Day parade, hoping to find footage of anyone who might have been with Jack. They sent out questionnaires to people who stayed in the area that weekend. The Center for Missing and Exploited Children got involved in the case, bringing publicity with cable TV spots. Two private detectives agreed to work the case for $1 each, and a $5,000 reward was offered for information leading to a solution. A witness said they had seen Jack walking back toward home from the picnic area around 5:30 p.m. A friend said Jack told him he was tired of the arguing.   \n\nMichelle Phillips and her boyfriend Roderick “Ronny” Cate were questioned extensively and given polygraphs. A detective on the case would later say that Cate failed twice. Cate was arrested the night of the disappearance for a parole violation relating to a weapons charge, and later during the investigation for failure to appear. A local newspaper reported that there had been rumors in the valley of Jack being abused. Michelle made the following statement at a news conference:   \n\n“J. D. told a friend he was tired of the arguing,” she told reporters. “Jack, I love you. Ronny is not at the house. Please come home. You’re not in trouble. You won’t be on restriction. Just come home,” she pleaded. “I love you, J. D.” ( [Hunt Continues for Big Bear Lake Boy Missing 2 Weeks\n](https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1995-08-21-mn-37423-story.html) )\n\nHowever, even if he was a suspect, police had no evidence to charge Rod. Statements were made that neither he nor Michelle were suspects. In November, Michelle and her sister went to Hollywood to tape a segment on a show called Psychic Detectives, that used a person's possessions to try to solve the mystery of their case. The segment would only air if it helped law enforcement. In 1996, Michelle, Rod Cate and their son moved to West Virginia without telling the authorities. One investigator told the press that he was surprised by the little cooperation they gave.  \n\nMeanwhile another suspect had come to police attention. This was James Lee Crummel aka Jimmy Lee Savage, whose criminal history will make your blood boil, and who was in Big Bear at the time of Jack's disappearance. Crummel was a convicted kidnapper, murderer and child molester who had arrests and convictions in three states between 1967 and 1995. In one Wisconsin case, he molested a 14-year-old boy, then beat him unconscious and left him in a ditch. The boy was found two days later. For this Crummel was sentenced to 30 years but served only 5. In 1982, he was convicted of the 1967 abduction, molestation, and strangling death of a 9-year-old boy in Arizona. A year later, his life sentence was overturned on appeal for ineffective assistance of counsel, and the prosecutors allowed Crummel to plead to kidnapping. He served only a few months more.  \n\nCrummel was one of the registered sex offenders questioned by police in their investigation of Jack's disappearance. They got a warrant to search his house and car. He refused to take a polygraph, but admitted to being about half a mile away at the time Jack disappeared. His alibi was almost nonexistent, provided by a friend who later recanted it to the police. He said he was watching the friend build a doghouse. The friend told police he left at 4:30, giving him time to have come across Jack. The search of his house did turn up evidence that allowed police to arrest him on 15 counts of molesting three 14-year-old boys in Big Bear City in 1988.  Crummel moved up to being the prime suspect in Jack's disappearance, but police had only circumstantial evidence to tie him to the case. Although the investigation remained open, by the one year mark fewer and fewer tips came in, none leading to a solution.  \n\nMeanwhile Crummel was continuing his crimes. In a bold move in 1990, he reported finding a skull and other bones while hiking in the Santa Ana Mountains. The remains were identified in 1996 as those of 13-year-old Jamey Trotter, who had been missing from Costa Mesa, CA since 1979. Crummel was arrested in 1997 for Jamey's kidnapping, rape and murder. He allegedly offered to reveal the location of Jack Phillips' body if prosecutors took the death penalty off the table, but they declined to do so. In 2004, while serving a life sentence for yet another molestation, Crummel was convicted of Jamey's death and received the death penalty. Crummel hanged himself with an electric cord in his cell at San Quentin on May 27, 2012. Whether he killed Jack or knew anything about what happened to him will never be known for sure.  \n\nThe case has gone cold in subsequent years. Perhaps the police feel their prime suspect is beyond their reach. Their theory had been that Crummel, who was living in Newport Beach with a partner who had a boat, had taken Jack out on the ocean and disposed of his body there. The Riverside County attorneys in the Jamey Trotter case offered to prosecute Crummel jointly with San Bernardino. They had a statement from a former cellmate that Crummel had confessed in detail to murdering Jack. But the prosecution never happened.  \n\nAs of 2012, Michelle Phillips had reconciled with Jack's father, and they were living in West Virginia. Jack Phillips Sr. was interviewed at the time of Crummel's death; Michelle was hospitalized at the time. Although Jack Sr. wasn't sorry to hear Crummel died, he said it didn't bring closure to them. EDIT: Michelle died in July 2012.  \n\nAt a distance of 30 years, it seems certain that Jack Phillips has died. When first researching this case, I thought it might have been the classic case of a child getting lost in the wilderness. That is still a possibility, though the picnic grounds area is fairly well populated with cabins and is on a main road. It's always a possibility that a child will go too near a lake and drown. Again, though, the picnic area was not really close to Big Bear Lake. Going by newspaper reports, Rod Cate and James Crummel were the main suspects for the police. There is reason to suspect that Rod and Jack didn't get along, and live-in boyfriends have a poor track record in true crime cases when it comes to their partners' children. There are those rumors about abuse. But police did not have any evidence and never charged Cate. Michelle seems never to have been a suspect. So Jack's home life may have been troubled, but that is probably as far as it went.   \n\nThe presence on the scene of basically a serial killer and child molester really stands out as the likeliest answer to what happened to Jack Phillips. One article about Crummel said he couldn't control himself when it came to boys of a certain age, 9 to 14. His history certainly seems to bear this out. I didn't even include all the allegations and arrests. It makes for horrifying reading, especially when he was actually convicted on several occasions and yet got back on the streets to commit more crimes against children. We will never know if he was the perpetrator, but if I had to guess, I would say yes. Very frustrating for his family and for law enforcement though.  \n\nDespite the likelihood that he is no longer with us, I will close with the standard request from agencies in missing persons cases. If anyone has information about the disappearance of Jack J.D. Phillips, please contact San Bernardino County Sheriff's Office at 909-356-9652.    \n\nSources  \n\n[Charley Project](https://charleyproject.org/case/jack-daniel-phillips)    \n[Hunt Continues for Big Bear Lake Boy Missing 2 Weeks](https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1995-08-21-mn-37423-story.html)    \n[Jack Daniel Phillips -The Charley Project Blog](https://charleyross.wordpress.com/tag/jack-daniel-phillips/)  \n[Convicted killer James Lee Crummel commits suicide before disclosing info in San Bernardino cold case](https://abc7.com/archive/8684369/)  \n[James Lee Crummel, California Death Row Inmate, Hangs Self In San Quentin Prison Cell](https://www.ibtimes.com/james-lee-crummel-california-death-row-inmate-hangs-self-san-quentin-prison-cell-700704)   \n[O.C. child killer’s twisted road to death row](https://www.ocregister.com/2012/05/29/oc-child-killers-twisted-road-to-death-row/)  \n[Closure eludes parents of missing Big Bear Lake boy](https://www.sbsun.com/2012/06/03/closure-eludes-parents-of-missing-big-bear-lake-boy/)  \n[Search for child turns to criminal investigation](https://www.newspapers.com/article/big-bear-grizzly-search-turns-to-crimina/177506226/)  \n[Page 2](https://www.newspapers.com/article/big-bear-grizzly-search-turns-to-crimina/177556564/)  \n\n[Search continues for missing youth, clues slim, official say](https://www.newspapers.com/article/big-bear-grizzly/177509975/)  \n\n[“Please don't forget'](https://www.newspapers.com/article/big-bear-grizzly-please-dont-forget-big/177510519/)  \n[Page 2](https://www.newspapers.com/article/big-bear-grizzly-please-dont-forget-p-2/177510858/ )  \n\n[Searchers continue hunt for lost youth](https://www.newspapers.com/article/big-bear-grizzly-searchers-continue-bi/177511014/)  \n[Page 2](https://www.newspapers.com/article/big-bear-grizzly-search-continues-p2-b/177511198/)  \n\n[Police seek video of missing boy] (https://www.newspapers.com/article/big-bear-grizzly-police-seek-video-big/177511337/)  \n[Page 2](https://www.newspapers.com/article/big-bear-grizzly-p2-big-bear-grizzly-0/177512489/)  \n\n[Missing boy's Mom to tape TV show](https://www.newspapers.com/article/big-bear-grizzly-mom-to-tape-tv-show-b/177512821/ )  \n [Sex offender is arrested, held on $500,000 bail](https://www.newspapers.com/article/big-bear-grizzly-sex-offender-arrested/177510332/ )  \n\n[Newport child molester jailed on local charges](https://www.newspapers.com/article/big-bear-grizzly-newport-child-molester/177513071/)  \n[Page 2](https://www.newspapers.com/article/big-bear-grizzly-molesterp2-big-bear-g/177554775/)  \n\n[Officials concerned molester may return](https://www.newspapers.com/article/big-bear-grizzly-officials-concerned-bi/177513530/)",

      "text": "*Hello! This is part of my ongoing series on cold cases from California from the 1960s and 70s. If you are interested, the previous post was on the unsolved murder of* [*Rosa Linda Zuniga*](https://www.reddit.com/r/UnresolvedMysteries/comments/1lav5gk/stabbing_in_santa_cruz_an_18yearold_girl/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)*. If you have any questions, comments, or feedback regarding these posts, please let me know.*\n\n**The Scene**\n\nOn Saturday, September 17, 1977, two employees of the Pickwick Hotel in San Diego, San Diego County, CA noticed a peculiar smell after parking in the hotel's basement parking lot. They reported it to hotel officials, who stated that the foul odor was coming from a vent in the garage. The two employees — a hotel bellman and his brother — accepted this explanation at the time.\n\nHowever, after noticing the foul odor again the following day — Sunday, September 18, 1977 — the two brothers decided to investigate it themselves. They pinpointed the smell as coming from the area of a van that was parked in a remote spot of the basement garage.\n\nShortly after noon, the brothers peered into the back of the van, where they spotted a decomposing body partially covered by bedding. They promptly notified the night manager, who then reported the discovery to the police.\n\n\\[Note: The Sept. 19, 1977 edition of the *San Diego Union* specifically states that Jane Doe was discovered by the brothers \"shortly after noon\" on the 18th. That same clipping does not mention the brothers having smelled the foul odor the previous day; that information is from the Sept. 21, 1977 edition of the same paper, which also specifies that the brothers reported the find to the hotel's night manager on the 18th. It is unclear which one of these timings is accurate: either the brothers discovered the body shortly after noon, but didn't notify anyone until the night manager was on duty, or one of the two editions of the paper got the timing wrong.\\]\n\nThe Pickwick Hotel — which was later renamed the Sofia Hotel — was located at 134 W Broadway in downtown San Diego. The seven-floor hotel was owned by Greyhound and had a bus depot on its first floor. At the time of the discovery, doors to the hotel's basement garage were closed every night from 10pm to 6am.\n\n**The Van**\n\nDetails about the van are sparse. Investigators at the scene noted that the interior had been paneled. Food and bedding were also found inside, leading investigators to believe that someone may have been living inside the vehicle.\n\nAccording to WebSleuths, when Jane Doe's case was added to NamUs in December 2019, it was stated that the van she was found in was blue in color, and its 1976 Alabama license plate was number 1P2503. The same source also noted that, \"There w\\[ere\\] no signs of struggle in the van.\"\n\nThe van had reportedly been parked in the basement garage for some time: one paper reported \"nearly a year,\" while an earlier clipping stated \"approximately two years.\" Hotel officials were reportedly \"unable to provide police with the name of the owner\" of the van.\n\n**The Decedent**\n\nThe body was determined to be that of a young woman or teenager. She was found lying on her back on a mattress in the rear portion of the van. The first mention of Jane Doe in the *San Diego Union*, from the day after she was found, reported that, \"the body appeared to have been in the van for at least two weeks,\" putting her death at about Sunday, September 4th at the latest. In the September 21st edition of the same newspaper, however, Homicide Lt. Charles Schilder is quoted as saying that, \"the woman may have been dead for five days to a week,\" which would put her death anywhere from Saturday, September 10th to Tuesday, September 13th, depending on which date — when the brothers first reported the foul odor, or when LE was notified of the discovery — is being used in comparison.\n\nMeanwhile, NamUs does not provide an estimated PMI, though her estimated year of death is 1977. The Doe Network lists the estimated PMI as several weeks. Jane Doe's body was partially decomposed at the time of recovery, causing her face to be unrecognizable, yet features like eye color could still be made out.\n\nThe body was that of a white female who was measured to be 5'4 and 114 lbs. She had hazel eyes, and she was missing a front tooth. NamUs — as well as the Doe Network and Unidentified wiki, which use NamUs as a source — states that Jane Doe's hair color was brown, while the Sept. 21, 1977 edition of the *San Diego Union* indicates that she was blonde.\n\nSources differ regarding Jane Doe's age. The broadest age range is the one currently provided by NamUs, at an estimated 13 to 20 years old. The estimated age group provided by the same source is \"Adult - Pre 30,\" which seems a bit incongruent with the aforementioned estimated range to me, but I digress. The Sept. 21, 1977 edition of the *San Diego Union* indicates that Jane Doe was 18 to 20 years old. Meanwhile, the age range listed by the Doe Network and Unidentified wiki is 18 to 22 years old; this is also the range initially listed when Jane Doe's case was added to NamUs, according to WebSleuths. The reason behind the change on NamUs is unknown.\n\nJane Doe was found wearing \"bikini-type\" underpants, a blue tank top, and blue Levi-type slacks. She was also wearing a \"fine linked chain yellow metallic necklace with large bead-like links.\" It was noted that Jane Doe was not wearing a bra, and it seems that one wasn't found in the vehicle either. On the floor of the van, next to its right-side double doors, lay a torn, green, plaid shirt. A pair of rubber thongs — flip flops — were also found inside the van.\n\nA green plaid rag was around Jane Doe's neck, knotted on the left side. Based off of the provided descriptions, it seems that the rag was a piece torn from the shirt found on the floor of the van.\n\nBecause of the rag around Jane Doe's neck, investigators initially believed that she had been garroted. However, this belief was called into question after an autopsy was performed on about September 20th. As stated by the Sept. 21st edition of the *San Diego Union*, \"According to Coroner Robert Creason, 'The usual findings for strangulation death were not found during an autopsy,'\" indicating that she \"may not have died of strangulation as previously thought.\"\n\nIn the same newspaper article the coroner goes on to say that, \"further toxicological and microscopic slides have been ordered.\" From what I could find online, the findings of these tests have never been released to the public. Jane Doe's cause of death is categorized as unknown on the Doe Network. It seems that the manner of Jane Doe's death is also unknown, though by at least September 21, 1977 the case was still being handled by homicide investigators.\n\nDetective Lori Adams is currently listed as the case contributor and contact point for the San Diego PD in the Contacts section of Jane Doe's NamUs profile. Among other achievements, Adams was a Detective for the SDPD's Cold Case Homicides Unit for at least ten years until she retired in about January 2025. Adams has worked on cases such as that of Arminda Ribeiro, who was murdered and went unidentified from 1973 to late 2023.\n\nBecause of Detective Adams's involvement in the case, it seems to me that Jane Doe's death is still considered a homicide. However, it should be noted that Jane Doe's case is listed among neither the [City of San Diego Cold Cases](https://www.sandiego.gov/police/news-center/cold-cases?cold-search=&field_event_type_target_id_selective=5005&page=9) nor the [San Diego County Sheriff's Office's Cold Case Homicides](https://www.sdsheriff.gov/bureaus/law-enforcement-services-bureau/support-services/homicide/cold-case-homicides/-npage-2).\n\n**Further Info**\n\nAccording to the Doe Network, Jane Doe's dental records are available for comparison, while the status of her fingerprints and DNA is unknown. It should be noted that in the Sept. 21, 1977 edition of the *San Diego Union* it was stated that, \"The coroner's office said a fingerprint check will be made to determine the identity.\" It is unknown if these fingerprint records are still available.\n\nJane Doe has only one MP exclusion on NamUs: she is not Julie Soracco. I could not find any information regarding whether Jane Doe was buried, cremated, etc.\n\nJane Doe's NamUs profile is case number UP62410, and was created and last updated on December 11, 2019 and April 18, 2025, respectively. The NCMEC case number is 1198398; however, I could not find a NCMEC profile for Jane Doe.\n\nIf you have any information about Jane Doe, please call the San Diego PD at (619) 531-2000. The agency case number is 77-64827. You can also call the San Diego County ME's Office at (858) 694-2895, agency case number 77-02034. Any little piece of information helps.\n\n**Thoughts, Questions, and Discussion**\n\nBecause of how little information is publicly available about Jane Doe, there are a lot of questions about this case. I have collected some of my thoughts here, and encourage readers to pose their own questions and discuss these points as well.\n\n* First, just some things about the van: What was the make and model? Did LE run the plates to see who the original owner was? Did any dust on the outside of the van seem disturbed recently beyond the brothers possibly wiping a window to look in?\n   * \\[Also shoutout to user u/JamesRUstlerIV for pointing out a couple details about the van that I initially missed in my [original write-up](https://cacoldcases.blogspot.com/2025/07/the-possible-homicide-of-san-diego-jane.html) of this case on my blog!\\]\n* How long did LE believe someone had been living in the van? Did they believe its occupier had been Jane Doe? I wonder what other personal items could have been found in there, such as further clothing, a toothbrush, or a wallet or money. If things such as menstrual products or birth control were present, that would lend credence to the idea that a woman (likely Jane Doe), had been living there.\n   * Was the food that was found inside the van spoiled at all? Did LE try to use that as an indicator for how long someone had been living inside the vehicle?\n      * Based on the weight of the body, as well as the food available in the van, it seems that Jane Doe didn't starve to death.\n* How did no one notice someone putting a mattress inside the van? Or if someone did in fact notice, then when? Or perhaps the mattress and bedding had already been placed inside by the van's original owner. I wonder if the van was often used by homeless people, and Jane Doe just so happened to be the last person to occupy it (if she did at all).\n* Did the rag around Jane Doe's neck actually have anything to do with her death, or was she instead using it as a fashion accessory? I can't imagine anyone — let alone someone possibly using a van as shelter — ripping up a piece of clothing in order to make an accessory, unless the article of clothing was no longer of use. Perhaps there was some other damage to the shirt that simply wasn't mentioned?\n   * The coroner stated that, \"The usual findings for strangulation death were not found during an autopsy.\" Which signs? Is it possible something was missed? From my reading of the full article, it seems that strangulation wasn't completely ruled out, but it also wasn't conclusive either. And what were the results of the toxicological tests that were run? Could Jane Doe have died from an overdose of any kind?\n* Jane Doe's outfit seems fitting for summer weather, so I doubt she had been living inside the van for long, if she was in fact the van's (sole) occupant at the time. A few months at most.\n   * San Diego gets very hot. Looking at [the temperatures in San Diego in 1977](https://weatherspark.com/h/y/1816/1977/Historical-Weather-during-1977-in-San-Diego-California-United-States#Figures-Temperature), September that year averaged in the mid 70s (about 21 to 23 Celsius). July and August also averaged around high 70s to low 90s (about 23 to 32 Celsius). I highly doubt a van inside an enclosed garage offered much in the way of reprieve from the heat (though perhaps the fact that the garage was in the basement could have helped cool things down, especially at night). But is it possible Jane Doe could have died from overheating? She was underneath bedding, which would not have helped, though on the other hand that could instead indicate she may have died in the night, when it was cooler.\n* How long would it take for a corpse to start to smell when inside a van, in a parking garage, in the late summer/early fall heat of San Diego? I imagine LE took this into account when creating the PMI estimates, but also those vary like crazy across sources. Could she have been killed a while before, but then not placed inside the van until somewhat recently?  Could that then explain why she wasn’t detected for so long when she supposedly died weeks prior, according to the Doe Network?\n* Do investigators believe Jane Doe died inside the van, or that she was placed there after death? Because the latter would necessitate a second party involved. I understand that details such as how blood pooled in the body could indicate the position she died in and things like that, but there were no mentions of anything of the sort in any of the sources.\n* Who had access to the parking garage? Was it directly connected to the hotel, or would guests and employees have to walk through the main garage doors again to then get to the first floor? Was it accessible through the Greyhound Bus Depot? Was it possible for someone to go from the bus station down to the garage without being noticed or stopped by hotel staff? Because if so, that would support the idea that Jane Doe could have come from anywhere on a Greyhound bus, then used the van as shelter.\n* And perhaps most pressingly, who was she?\n\n**Sources**  \n[NamUs](https://www.namus.gov/UnidentifiedPersons/Case#/62410) \n\n[Doe Network](https://www.doenetwork.org/cases/1616ufca.html) \n\n[Unidentified wiki](https://unidentified-awareness.fandom.com/wiki/San_Diego_Jane_Doe_(1977))\n\n[WebSleuths](https://websleuths.com/threads/ca-san-diego-co-whtfem-up62410-18-22-found-in-van-in-san-diego-sep77.490054/)\n\n*San Diego Union* [9/19/77](https://www.namus.gov/api/CaseSets/NamUs/UnidentifiedPersons/Cases/62410/Documents/8242)  \\[From Images & Documents section of NamUs\\]\n\n*San Diego Union* [9/21/77](https://cacoldcases.blogspot.com/p/san-diego-union-sept-21-1977.html) \n\n\\[Note: the following sources primarily concern the Pickwick Hotel\\]\n\n[The Lost and Found forum](https://theunidentified.createaforum.com/california-95/san-diego-jane-doe-(1977)-wf-18-22-found-deceased-in-vehicle-at-the-pickwick-hot/), with a photo of a [c.1962 postcard](https://ebay.us/m/8fa8jt) of the hotel\n\n*Daily Times-Advocate* [5/9/86](https://www.newspapers.com/article/daily-times-advocate-pickwick-hotel-grey/176326053/)\n\n*North County Times* [12/22/86](https://www.newspapers.com/article/north-county-times-pickwick-hotel-greyh/176325764/)\n\n[History of the Pickwick Hotel up to 1950](https://thesofiahotel.com/history/)\n\n[Pickwick Corporation, Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Pickwick_Corporation)",

The daughters were Amys pride and joy, and vice versa, they spent every moment possible with each other. \n\nMarch 7th 2012(early morning), Brigham Young Landing, Girard, Georgia. Amy is staying at a trailer home with her 3 biological daughters. Around midnight Amy answers the door and is shot in the spleen by an unidentified suspect with a handgun. At 5:53 officers respond to 911 calls by Amys oldest daughter who had woken up to find her body. Amy and her unborn child were declared dead when first responders arrived. The Georgia.gov website names her time of death at 12:00 am, but other sites such as her obituary give a conflicting time of death. One says police refused to name how long she had been dead. The daughters were unharmed and didn't witness the suspect or attack.\n\nPolice theorize that Amy knew her attacker and that it was not a burglary or random incident. There was no sign of forced entrance and likely no items stolen from the house. I say likely because for some reason police chose to withhold information on whether the trailer home was burglarized from the public. The police did release that they ran a DNA test confirming who the father of Amys unborn child was and investigated the father. The unnamed biological father lead was looked into but he was never arrested. Because of Georgia's Feticide laws, the murderer can be charged with not only the death of Amy but of her unborn child as well, punishable by 20 years in jail.\n\nIt has been 13 years since Amy was murdered, and still no updates in the case have been made. 6 daughters have yet to see their mothers killer face justice. \n\nsources:\n\nhttps://www.wrbl.com/news/georgia-news/case-of-pregnant-georgia-woman-murdered-in-2012-remains-unsolved/\n\nhttps://gbi.georgia.gov/cases/unsolved-homicide/amy-ellison\n\nhttps://www.wrdw.com/content/news/SPECIAL-ASSIGNMENT-Reviving-a-cold-case-murder-of-a-pregnant-mother-422051984.html\n\nhttps://www.legacy.com/us/obituaries/augustachronicle/name/amy-nichols-obituary?id=25636213\n\nhttps://www.thetruecitizen.com/articles/in-murder-of-pregnant-mother/\n\nIn memory of Amy Ellison Nichols, she loved to laugh.",

In 2010 the Skelton’s were in the middle of a contentious divorce. Tanya had full custody of the boys her soon to be ex-husband John had visitation. John wasn’t happy about this arrangement and weeks earlier he’d used his visitation to try and kidnap the boys, driving them to Florida. When pressed by police he brought the boys back and returned them to their mother as legally required, but he deeply resented that Tanya, who he was very angry with, had custody of the children, had custody of “his boys”.\n\nIn November, with the Thanksgiving holiday approaching, the couple again discussed visitation. John wanted to spend the holiday with his sons. It was agreed that the boys could spend Thanksgiving with John and sleep over at his home. It was agreed that John would bring the three boys back on Friday, the day after the holiday.\n\nWhen John didn’t return the boys and didn’t respond to calls, Tanya notified the police. When neither John nor the boys could be located, an Amber Alert was released by law enforcement in Lenawee County. Meanwhile, John Skelton appeared in a local emergency room with minor injuries. He told staff that he’d tried to take his own life and that’s how he’d hurt himself.\n\nWhen asked about his children, he revealed that he’d turned them over on Friday afternoon to Joanne Taylor. He didn’t have much information about her. They gleaned that Taylor, who supposedly lives near Jackson or Hillsdale Michigan drives a silver van. Investigators were not able to locate anyone matching this description.\n\nJohn Skelton said that his children were safe, that Taylor would take the boys to an underground network, and that they’d grow up on a nice farm, where no one would find them. No evidence of this so-called network was found. When they searched his online footprint, nothing on John’s cell phone or computers showed him talking with anyone who could be involved in the disappearance of Andrew, Alexander, and Tanner.\n\nA search was done of John’s cell phone records. They tracked his movements from Michigan to Ohio, where the phone stopped. A massive days long search was done of the area, both where John stopped in Ohio and the route that he traveled to get there. There was no sign of the boys.\n\nIn 2011 John Skelton was charged with parental kidnapping, but he took a plea. He pled guilty to three charges of unlawful imprisonment and was sentenced to 10-15 years in prison. While John Skelton sits behind bars, claiming that the boys are finally safe, the family and friends of the three children wait for answers.\n\nAs of this writing, there has been no sight or sign of the boys since Thanksgiving of 2010. All three boys, if they are still alive, are now teenagers or early 20s. If you have information on the case, please contact the Morenci Police Department 517-458-7104 or the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children.\n\nadditional reading - [Tragic Twist in Missing Skelton Brothers Case: Mom Wants Sons Declared Dead - Newsweek](https://www.newsweek.com/skelton-brothers-missing-child-michigan-declare-dead-1916563)\n\n[Disappearance of 3 Skelton brothers has haunted Morenci, Michigan, for more than a decade](https://www.clickondetroit.com/news/michigan/2022/11/25/disappearance-of-3-skelton-brothers-has-haunted-morenci-michigan-for-more-than-a-decade/)",

      "title": "[Update] Jimmie \"Jay\" Lee's remains have most likely been found",
      "text": "Hello everyone! I wanted to bring a recent update to a case I've covered quite a long time ago- the disappearance of a 20-year old student of the University of Mississippi, Jimmie \"Jay\" Lee. The write-up I made can be found [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/UnresolvedMysteries/comments/18lmxa6/a_queer_black_student_of_the_university_of/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button), though it was written about a year ago, so please excuse me if it didn't hold up.\n\nIn short: In 2022, Jimmie had recently graduated the University of Mississippi and was about to start graduate school. He was interested in social work (he was a public policy major and worked on a baby formula and toddler hygiene drive with the Lafayette County Child Protective Services) and politics. Jimmie was known for his open, friendly personality, and tended to be the \"life of the party\" wherever he went. He was also an outspoken member of the local LGBTQ+ community (he identified as a gay man) and was the director of school's LGBTQ Outreach and an active member of UM’s student government association.\n\nJimmie was last seen on 6 AM of the 8th of July, as he was leaving Campus Walk Apartments in Oxford. Witnesses said that he appeared to be wearing his pajamas. His last contact with family was a message he sent to his mother at 2 AM, wishing her a happy birthday and saying that he loved her. His vanishing was noticed in the evening, when Jimmie's parents and sister couldn't reach him via phone.\n\nJimmie's car had been found two days later, about 2,5 miles (4 km) away from campus, at Molly Barr Trails apartment complex. It was suspected that Jimmie had visited someone who lived at the complex- sniffer dogs were brought, but nothing was found.\n\nOn the 22nd of July, a man named Shelton Timothy Herrington Jr. (22) from Grenada, MS, had been arrested and charged with Jimmie's murder. It was established that Jimmie was killed around the 8th of July; He and Herrington were involved in the same Black organizations at campus, and the two were in a sexual relationship. The two had sex \"before sunrise\", then got into an argument, and Jimmie left. Herrington then lured Jimmie back to his house by promising him \"something they never did before\". Jimmie was seen walking down the stairs of campus Walk Apartments around 5:58 AM, and parking at the Molly Barr Trails apartment complex around 7:25 AM, with a man identified as Herrington walking by a few seconds later.\n\nHerrington then allegedly strangled Jimmie and hid his body somewhere between Grenada and Oxford. Herrington also retrieved a shovel and a wheelbarrow from his parent’s house in Grenada on the 8th of July.\n\nSince then, the trial related to Jimmie's murder had been held. It was declared a mistrial after nine hours of deliberation. A big reason for it was insufficient evidence to charge Timothy with murder.\n\nWell, yesterday, on the 3rd of February, news broke out that human remains have been found by deer hunters in Carroll County. They haven't been officially identified by DNA (the results are pending), but a gold necklace with Jimmie's name had been found along with the body- Jimmie uploaded a photo with an identical one only two days before he was killed. The Carrol County sheriff's office is being evasive, but the sheriff, Clint Walker, has acknowledged the photo of the necklace that the reporters of Mississippi Today had sent him. Once the DNA results are in, I'll update this post.\n\n  \nEDIT: As of 5th of February, the day after this post was released, the remains have been confirmed as those of Jimmie's through DNA. His cause of death, or any other details, have not been released.\n\nI feel like a necklace with Jimmie's name that we know he had is as good of an evidence that we can have at this moment. I would say that it's, for now, pretty safe to assume that the remains are, in fact, Jimmie's. It's been such a long story, from Jimmie's disappearance, to finding evidence of his murder, the arrest of Herrington and the trial. Everyone knew that Jimmie was gone (he was even declared legally dead), and yet this is such a sad end to it all. Still, I hope that now that his body had been found, some evidence can be collected, justice served, and Jimmie can be laid to rest properly. A new date for Herrington's second trial is being scheduled.\n\nMy condolences to Jimmie's loved ones and his community as a whole. He seemed like such a bright spot who was an important and beloved part of many people's lives. I have no doubt that Jimmie did a lot of good in his short life, and his passion and kindness for caring after the vulnerable is very admirable. It's awful that his life was taken from him in such a brutal manner, and so early to boot- I hope that he'll rest easy and that his story will continue to inspire people to look after eachother.\n\nRest easy, Jimmie.\n\nSOURCES:\n\n1.

      "title": "Alessia Rosati, 21, literature student. On the morning of 23 July 1994, she leaves her house telling her brother she was going to attend her best friend final exams. She was seen walking quickly around the neighbor by some acquaintances in the afternoon. Then, never again.",
      "text": "[Alessia Rosati](https://imgur.com/a/FmH9fRl) was an italian literature student at La Sapienza, Rome and used to live in Conca D'Oro neighborhood with her family: her dad, Antonio, worked as municipal policeman, her mum Anna as a regional employee and her brother Danilo was a student.\n\nOn the morning of 23 July 1994, she leaves her house telling her brother she would have been back home by lunch, as the family had to leave for their usual vacation in her father’s hometown, Bazzano, a small hamlet of Spoleto in Umbria. In previous years, Alessia had always expressed reluctance about going to a place she found lacking in stimulation for someone her age and with her lively personality. However, this year she seemed to accept the trip willingly, which surprised her parents.\n\nShe had to meet Claudia to go attend at her high school final exams.\n\nLater that day, she was allegedly seen quickly walking around the neighborhood with a walkman and headphones on her head, was said to be somewhat agitated.\n\nAlessia never returns for lunch. From that moment on, there is no further trace of Alessia. Her parents immediately go to file a missing person report, but it is only accepted the following Monday, two days after her disappearance.\n\nIn the days immediately following Alessia’s disappearance, the search continues without success. The only clue comes from a friend of Alessia’s brother, who claims to have seen her in a white Peugeot 205 with the word “Rally” written on both sides. He states that when she noticed him, she tried to hide her face. Investigations reveal that the car comes from Northern Italy and is owned by the Prison Police. Alessia had been regurarly corresponding by letter with a young man from Bazzano, a cadet in the prison guard training program. However, inquiries into this individual yield no significant results.\n\nAlthough the letters reveal nothing beyond a simple friendship, her parents notice that Alessia described to this friend a life very different from reality. Alessia claimed she had already run away from home, which was not true. These revelations lead her parents to realize that Alessia was living a double life, making up stories and situations that did not reflect her actual existence.\n\nThe following Monday, Claudia is questioned at the police station. Upon returning home, she finds a letter, supposedly sent by Alessia on the day she went missing. The letter is handed over to Alessia’s parents and later to law enforcement. Its content suggests that Alessia’s departure was voluntary, which leads to the official search being called off, as Alessia was of legal age.\n\nThis is [the letter](https://imgur.com/a/f61Wnu4) content. It has been confirmed to be her calligraphy:\n\n>*Dear Claudia,*  \n*I know I always told you everything but this time it all happened so suddenly...*  \n*I met a boy in Conca D'oro street which has been very important for me in the past,*  \n*He was about to leave and if I didn't do it now I wouldn't have done it anymore...*  \n*I couldn't handle it anymore... I had to run away from this shit year... Also Monday I'd have to go in that shitty town and you know how much I hate it...*  \n*We're about to travel Europe and I don't know when I'll come back... I need to evade...*  \n*Now I feel like I'm born again especially because I really wanted to travel.*  \n*I don't feel like telling my parents... Please tell them yourself...*  \n*I'm sorry we won't see each other but it would have been only Sunday*  \n*Alessia*\n\n>*Now that I think of it, inform my father. You know how he's like.*\n\n>*Kisses, Alessia.*\n\nThis letter, initially not examined with the necessary attention, led the authorities to prematurely conclude the investigation, assuming a voluntary disappearance. However, it raises concerns that not even Claudia, Alessia’s usual confidante, knew the identity of the mysterious boy mentioned in the letter.\n\nThe mailing date of the letter is a key element: it appears to have been sent on the very morning of the disappearance, if not earlier. Processed at Rome Tiburtina, the letter was neither priority nor registered mail, suggesting a carefully planned action. This raises important questions: why did Alessia choose to communicate through a letter that would only arrive after her disappearance, instead of speaking directly to Claudia?\n\nOnly later do Alessia’s parents notice significant errors both in the letter and on the envelope. The address was incorrect—an unlikely mistake given how frequently Alessia and Claudia exchanged correspondence. These details, initially overlooked, suggest that the error may have been intentional. Additionally, the letter contains stylistic and grammatical inconsistencies that do not align with Alessia’s educational level as a literature student.\n\nAlessia’s father, unable to find satisfactory answers, begins his own investigation. He searches his daughter’s room and discovers that she had been involved with social centers and far-left groups—an aspect of her life previously unknown to him. He contacts members of the editorial committee of a [Marxist pamphlet that Alessia was involved with](https://roma.corriere.it/methode_image/2019/07/17/Roma/Foto%20Roma%20-%20Trattate/COMBO%20due%20pagine%20opuscolo-kMQD-U31306926864667VE-593x443@Corriere-Web-Roma.jpg?v=20190718190326), but none of them provide any useful information.\n\nNot only do the collaborators of the magazine *Avanzi di Scienza*—prominent figures such as Gianluca Peciola, Fabio Ciabatti, Alessio Gagliardi, Luca Nutarelli, Simone Turchetti, and Davide Vender—deny having any useful information when summoned to the family home, but some even respond with hostility, accusing Antonio of being a fascist.\n\nAntonio’s concern grows when a particular event, which occurred in the early hours following the disappearance, raises alarm for Alessia’s mother. When she suggests to Claudia that she look for Alessia in Via dei Volsci, at the headquarters of Radio Onda Rossa \\[Radio Red Wave\\], Claudia strongly objects, insisting that she will check herself. This unusually firm response fuels further suspicion.\n\nAlessia’s father, Antonio, revealed that shortly before her disappearance, he had received a disturbing phone call. A male voice told him that Alessia “*would do well to stop beating people up and having others beat people up*.” This episode seemed to suggest a connection to the world of political extremism, but no concrete evidence ever emerged to support this lead.\n\nAccording to the family's account, shortly before her disappearance, Alessia sold her whole collection of Agatha Christie mystery novels. Although it was her mother who had passed on the passion for these books, Alessia had built the collection entirely on her own. However, it remains unknown who sold the collection and for how much. This gesture remains unexplained and was never properly investigated.\n\nAbout a year after Alessia’s disappearance, on July 6, 1995, a disturbing message was left on her parents’ answering machine. “[...to track you down because it’s going (so?) badly](https://streamable.com/9gbprb)” a woman said in an agitated tone. When filing a report at the local police station, Alessia’s father noted that the voice was “*likely foreign, possibly Yugoslavian, with an unclear tone.*”\n\n**Monica Manzini**, graphologist, conducted a detailed analysis of the only real piece of evidence in the Alessia Rosati case: the letter Alessia sent to Claudia shortly before her disappearance. In the letter, Alessia announced her decision to leave suddenly with “a boy who was very important to me,” to go “to Europe” without knowing “when I will return.” Alessia’s parents, Antonio and Anna Rosati, had always believed the letter was a cry for help written under duress, as it contained a mistaken temporal reference that only they would understand: **Alessia placed the departure for the village in Umbria on the following Monday, while the correct date was Saturday, the day she disappeared.** They thought the kidnappers forced her to mislead and reassure everyone with a fake trip to Europe, inserting a wrong detail to alert the family.\n\nHowever, Manzini’s analysis suggests otherwise.\n\nManzini, who has also worked on famous cases states that there is no objective evidence supporting the hypothesis of a voluntary departure or a letter written under threat. **Alessia’s handwriting lacks signs of terror such as trembling, hesitation, or sudden angularity. However, emotional fragility and anxiety clearly emerge. These are shown by the overlapping of letters and the hurried movement of the script toward the right, which expresses a desire to escape and flee. The strong aggressiveness in the sharp crossing of the “t”s suggests inner tension, while the expanding left margin reflects a need to break free.**\n\nDuring the investigation, Monica Manzini actively participated in field searches. In 2019, the authorities reopened the case, which was soon closed again, and Manzini collaborated using sniffer dogs trained to detect specific scents in search of any traces of Alessia in Montesacro Park, where the young woman used to go and where two aerial photographs from that time show ground disturbance. [These dogs detected some trails, but unfortunately none led to a decisive discovery, as the lack of institutional support prevented the carrying out of proper excavations. During the searches, a bone was found which, after careful examination, appear not to belong to Alessia, but an animal.](https://video.corriere.it/roma/alessia-rosati-ecco-il-video-al-parco-delle-valli-il-corpo-va-cercato-qui/17087c16-a213-4f12-978a-e2c0146c4xlk)\n\nIn 2022 (Not sure but in very recent years) Claudia, questioned again, told police that Alessia was dating a man nicknamed \"Il Bugia\" (Mr. Liar) and at the time, upon asking him if he knew about Alessia disapperance, he shrugged it off and allegedly never talked about it again. They all hanged out at the same community center near their house, \"Hai visto Quinto?\" now closed.\n\nIt is unknown to public if he has been questioned by police or even identified.\n\nSources:\n\n[https://lagiustizia.net/caso-orlandi-rosati-terza-via/](https://lagiustizia.net/caso-orlandi-rosati-terza-via/) Here there is an in-depth analisys if everything that doesn't add up\n\n[https://roma.corriere.it/notizie/cronaca/23\\_dicembre\\_09/alessia-rosati-scomparsa-a-roma-nel-1994-l-osso-del-parco-delle-valli-non-e-umano-ma-le-mappe-aeree-evidenziano-tracce-di-scavo-dacff410-a627-4ded-8e6e-9a8a64149xlk.shtml](https://roma.corriere.it/notizie/cronaca/23_dicembre_09/alessia-rosati-scomparsa-a-roma-nel-1994-l-osso-del-parco-delle-valli-non-e-umano-ma-le-mappe-aeree-evidenziano-tracce-di-scavo-dacff410-a627-4ded-8e6e-9a8a64149xlk.shtml)\n\n[https://storiaglocale.com/la-scomparsa-di-alessia-rosati/](https://storiaglocale.com/la-scomparsa-di-alessia-rosati/)\n\n[https://ilbiondino.org/caso-alessia-rosati/](https://ilbiondino.org/caso-alessia-rosati/)",

      "title": "The disturbing case of the Batman Rapist",
      "text": "The 'Batman Rapist' is the name given to an unidentified serial rapist in England who commited at least 17 sexual attacks against women in the city of Bath between 1991 and 2000. Dubbed Operation Eagle, his case is the longest running serial-rape investigation in Britain, but as of today, he has never been caught or identified and has eluded law enforcement for over 30 years. The nickname 'Batman Rapist' was chosen as a result of a baseball cap, featuring the batman logo, being left behind at the scene of one of his crimes. \n\nIt's commonly believed by police that the attacker has intimate geographical knowledge due to almost all of his attacks taking place in a very specific 'hunting ground' within the city of Bath, with the only exception being the abduction and rape of a 19 year old near Bristol in 1996. His crimes were always carried out in the dark winter months, with women of all ages being targeted. However, in May 2000, he attempted to carjack a 26 year old woman while her 7 year old daughter was in the vehicle.\n\nHe would target lone women who had just returned to their cars, abducting them at knifepoint and making them drive to secluded areas in the south of the city, before raping them. In almost every instance, he would remove his victims underwear and rip their tights during the assault but then force them to get dressed again afterwards and drive back to the area from which he abducted them. Numerous victims described the man as wearing completely black clothing and a baseball cap, being of slim build and around 5'9 tall. He was clean shaven, had blue eyes and a recognisable scar above below his bottom lip. \n\nInterestingly, he had long periods of apparent inactivity between assaults, including a 3 year gap between October 1991 and November 1994 and then a further two years of no activity until June 1996. However, police strongly suspect that he continued to attack women during those periods. It was theorised that the perpetrator might be someone who only visited the city occasionally, such as for work or that he was in a relationship during these periods of inactivity. His attacks predominantly took place between 6-8pm or 1-3am and it was considered that he could have convictions for car-related crimes \"because of the ease with which he breaks into vehicles.\"\n\nThe case was featured on the BBC show, Crimewatch, in January 2000 and featured an appeal from Avon and Somerset police for information. This appeal was successful as 6 previously unknown victims would come forward. Callers also provided the names of four potential suspects, including the son of a British diplomat. In October 2000, over 25,000 leaflets were distributed to households in Bath, asking women to complete a checklist for potential suspects who met the physical description of the attacker as well as those with a tight fetish or people who aroused suspicion by unexplained absences early in the morning. \n\nIn January 2001, improved forensic techniques were able to isolate the attackers DNA fingerprint, and this was then run against over 2000 men who's names had come up during the investigation, but this yielded no matches. \n\nWhilst the Batman Rapist was known for sexual assaults, it was considered that he might have been involved in the 1996 murder of Melanie Hall, a 25 year old British woman who vanished after a night out in Bath on June 9th 1996. Her skeletal remains were discovered on October 5th 2009 by a motorway worker who was clearing a patch of vegetation and stumbled upon a bin bag containing a skull, pelvis and thigh bone. Additional searches found the remainder of her body, buried and spread around different areas of the field beside the motorway. A few hours before Melanie was abducted, the Batman Rapist had attempted but failed to abduct a woman at knifepoint in the same part of the city, leaving her wounded after she fought back and escaped. Police haven't ruled out his involvement in Melanie's case due to his violent nature and the proximity of the two events. \n\nAs of today, the case has never been solved and the identity of the Batman Rapist remains unknown. The investigation is still ongoing and remains active, however after 30 years of evading capture, it has effectively gone cold and was described by DI Paul James as \"one of the most complicated and protracted investigations that the force has undertaken\". Unfortunately, it seems that unless a DNA match is found or other new evidence comes to light, this case will remain unsolved.\n\nSources: https://www.somersetlive.co.uk/in-your-area/batman-rapist-what-know-shocking-3210972\n\nhttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batman_rapist\n\nhttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder_of_Melanie_Hall",

      "title": "The brutal murder of Mark Burke",
      "text": "Mark Burke was a 37 year old Irish man who disappeared on July 28th 2014. His body was found 3 days later on July 31st, but despite a huge police investigation and campaigning from his family, his case remains unsolved with very few leads.\n\nMark was born to parents Bernie and Noel Burke, the second youngest of 7 siblings. Very little is known about Mark's early life but he was from Sandyford, County Dublin and would grow up to have a partner and 7 children of his own. Mark worked as a painter and decorator and by all accounts, seemed to be a happy and loving family man. However, in 1998, things would change. Around this time, Mark started drinking excessively and became more reclusive, eventually becoming homeless. His father, Noel, described the changes in his son, stating \"From a happy-go-lucky young fella, pleasant, lovely personality, he started going into himself, wouldn’t talk to anybody.\" Mark was living in and out of homeless shelters at this stage and would sometimes disappear, often for weeks at a time, but this caused his family no concern as they later explained that \"We’d always know where to find him.\" However, nobody knew what had sparked such extreme changes in Mark and sadly, it would never be known what caused his behaviour to deteriorate so quickly. His father spoke of this, stating \"To this day, we don’t know.\"\n\nIn 2009, Mark was robbed of €40 in the coastal town of Dún Laoghaire. He was severely beaten during this encounter and ended up in hospital, needing metal plates in his skull. Thankfully, the culprit was caught and sentenced to 5 years in prison. Noel spoke of this incident, explaining \"They put him into Beaumont Hospital – nearly killed him. That's when the plates were put in his head in an operation.\" Sadly, however, Mark was beaten again in 2010 and required more plates in his skull.\n\nOn Sunday 27th July 2014, Mark was arrested and held overnight in Dún Laoghaire Garda station for an unspecified offence. Noel spoke of this incident, stating \"He was known to the guards, but for nothing bad. The guards openly say that. And he wasn’t a well man.\" The following day, Mark was taken to the district court where the judge granted him his own bail. Mark Burke left the courtroom at around 2:30pm and this was the last confirmed sighting of him. \n\nOn Thursday 31st July 2014, partial human remains were discovered in a skip at Thornton's recycling plant in Ballyfermont, Western Dublin. The body had been dismembered and was badly damaged by acid, to the extent that it was impossible to tell who the victim was. Several weeks after the body was found, and with no sign of Mark anywhere, his family started to feel uneasy about the situation. Whilst Mark had frequently gone missing in the past, they always knew where to find him. This time, they could find no trace of him anywhere and with news of the discovery lingering in the back of Noel's mind, he reported Mark missing. He also enquired about the body that had been found, due to physical similarities between it and Mark and the timeframe in which he was last seen and the body was discovered. DNA was taken from Mark's mother, Bernie, and forensic testing confirmed that the remains were, tragically, Mark Burke.\n\nThe inquest into Mark's death took place about 1.5 years after the remains were confirmed to be him. While the specifics are vague, some disturbing details came out about the discovery of Mark's body during this time. His internal organs had been removed and he had been dismembered with a chisel, the pieces strewn throughout the surrounding area. Searches recovered around 60% of his body but his face, jaw, teeth, hands and internal organs were never recovered. Additionally, his remains had been soaked with acid, to the extent that distinguishing tattoos were completely gone and physical identification was completely impossible. It was concluded that Mark had been murdered elsewhere and then his body dumped in the recycling plant, with organ harvesting a possible motive for the killing.\n\nUnfortunately, it was around this stage that the case effectively went cold. Despite a huge police investigation, there was absolutely no evidence found that could identity a perpetrator such as DNA or CCTV footage. Additionally, despite numerous appeals, absolutely no witnesses came forward to say that they'd seen Mark after his last confirmed sighting in court. In fact, the investigation simply raised more questions than answers as it revealed that Mark wasn't a troublemaker and wasn't involved in any form of organised crime. A Garda spokesperson would later state \"It’s a complete mystery as to who would want to kill Mark and why the perpetrators went to such extraordinary lengths to conceal his identity.\"\n\nIn July 2024, ten years after Mark's murder, the Garda revealed that they suspected Mark may have been murdered in Goatstown, County Dublin and his body transported by lorry to the recycling plant where it was dumped. They told the family that they were aware that this was an area where Mark was known to frequent and hoped it could offer further clues to his last known movements or possibly even a murder site. However, this has been the only update in over 10 years and there is still no evidence or knowledge of what happened to Mark Burke after he was last seen leaving the courthouse in July 2014, over a decade ago. Sadly, unless fresh evidence is unearthed or someone makes a confession, Mark's brutal murder remains unsolved.\n\nSources: https://www.rte.ie/news/regional/2024/0726/1461919-mark-burke-appeal/\n https://www.irishtimes.com/news/crime-and-law/a-family-tortured-the-mysterious-disappearance-of-mark-burke-1.3581118\n\nhttps://www.thesun.ie/news/7357174/dublin-skip-victim-mark-burke-garda-justice/\n\nhttps://www.dublinlive.ie/news/dublin-news/breakthrough-2014-unsolved-murder-mark-29600057",

      "title": "The disappearance of Annie McCarrick",
      "text": "Annie McCarrick was a 26 year old American woman who was living in Dublin when she disappeared in strange circumstances on 26th March 1993. Despite numerous investigations, absolutely no trace of Annie has ever been found.\n\nBorn to parents John and Nancy McCarrick on March 21st 1967, Annie was originally from Bayport in Long Island, NY. Annie first visted Ireland on a school trip, where she completely fell in love with the country. In fact, her experience was so influential, that she later moved to Ireland in the late 1980's to study at St Patrick's College in both Drumcondra and Maynooth. After this time abroad, she returned to New York in 1991 where she began studying at Stony Brook University. However, Annie was so enthralled with the emerald isle that she couldn't stay away and in January 1993, she moved permanently to Sandymount in Dublin where she rented accommodation with two other tenants.\n\nThe morning of Friday 26th March 1993 started normally. Annie called her friend Anne O’Dwyer, to see if she would like to go hiking with her in the Dublin and Wicklow mountains later that day. Unfortunately, Anne had recently injured her foot and was unable to accompany Annie that day. Annie's housemates had returned to their respective homes in the countryside for the weekend at this point and so she was in the apartment alone. It's believed that she knitted until around 9am, as an account from one of her housemates stated that Annie was sitting upright in her bed knitting earlier that morning. She also recalled that Annie had purchased two tickets to a theatre performance as her mother was coming to visit her the following week and she was reportedly very excited about this reunion.\n\nAt some stage that morning, Annie decided to run some errands in the town. She visited the AIB bank on Sandymount road just before 11am, where she was allegedly seen on CCTV, and then purchased groceries before heading home, as she had promised to do some baking for her workplace the following day, the Café Java in Lesson street. Annie arrived home at approximately 3pm and was then seen leaving again shortly after, at around 3:15pm. This sighting was confirmed by a plumber, Bernard Sheeran, who was working there at the time.\n\nAnnie was reportedly spotted by a fast food restaurant owner, walking along Newgrove Avenue towards a bus stop. She then boarded the number 18 bus heading towards the upmarket Dublin suburb of Ranelagh. Here, she would board the number 44 bus that would bring her to the picturesque village of Enniskerry in the Dublin and Wicklow Mountains. Annie was allegedly spotted by an ex co-worker by the name of Eimear O'Grady, who was also queueing for the 44 bus. Eimear would later tell Garda that she had called out to say hello to Annie but that she was ignored, while the woman she believed to be Annie would ascend the stairs to sit in the upper area of the bus and disappear from view. She noted this was out of character for Annie who was normally outgoing and very friendly but didn't think much of it. Eimear exited the bus before Annie and this was the last credible sighting of her. \n\nCuriously, the bus that Annie allegedly took would have arrived in Enniskerry at around 5pm which would have been very late to visit, as sunset that day would have been at around 6:15pm. Additionally, the weather that night was very poor, with incredibly heavy rain and Annie had been woefully underdressed for such conditions. Another strange element of this alleged sighting on the bus is that absolutely nobody in the small, quaint town of Enniskerry remembers seeing anyone who matched Annie's description that evening. She was a 5'8 woman with long, curly hair, a recognizable tweed coat and a distinctive American accent. Annie should have stood out quite considerably, had she been there, but absolutely nobody saw her. A local who worked in the post office believed that she had sold stamps to a woman who she later believed was Annie but couldn't be certain. The post office didn't have CCTV cameras so no footage exists that could support this claim.\n\nA security guard at the popular Johnnie Fox's pub in Glencullen came forward later on to state that he saw Annie with an unidentified male in the pub that evening. He described the man as roughly 5’9, between the ages of 24 to 28, clean shaven, athletic build, brown hair and square jawed, but he had never seen the man in the pub before. Another guard, Paul O'Reilly, told Garda that he believed he had seen Annie there at 9:30pm that night, in the lounge. This has been brought into question, however, as it's 5 miles from Enniskerry to Glencullen and that night was extremely wet with torrential rain. It seems highly unlikely that she would have travelled the distance there on foot, in adverse weather, with little to no protection from the elements.\n\nAnnie's housemates grew concerned when they couldn't reach her via phone the following day, on Saturday 27th. They had been attempting to ask Annie if she would like to join them for dinner that night in the apartment but couldn't get a response. When they arrived back at the flat, they found Annie's grocery bags still sitting untouched on the counter, with nothing unpacked or put away. The receipt confirmed that they had been purchased at 11:03am the previous morning, just after she'd been spotted on CCTV at the bank. One of Annie's friend called to the apartment later that night also, as she was concerned that Annie hadn't shown up to work that day. When Annie didn't show up for work again the following day, she was reported missing at Irishtown Garda station. On Tuesday 30th, Nancy McCarrick landed in Dublin after learning that her daughter was missing and confirmed the missing persons report. At this point, an investigation was launched and a search for Annie began.\n\nThe investigation turned up absolutely no clues as to what might have happened to Annie and the case ran cold fairly quickly. The Garda were working on the theory that she travelled to Eniskerry that day and took all the possible sightings very seriously, considering that she might have become lost in the mountains at night or something similar. However, her friends and family disputed this version of events as they pointed out that Annie was not dressed appropriately for the weather conditions and neither did she have an umbrella. She was widely considered to be an intelligent and organised young woman who was street smart and well-prepared. The belief that she would get up, abandon her groceries, leave heavily underdressed for the weather and travel to Enniskerry to then walk 5 miles to a rural pub in the dark and the rain seems fairly unfounded. Interestingly, her friends and family had reportedly sent several faxes to the Garda in the leadup to her disappearance, explaining that she was allegedly having \"Quite a bit of difficulty with a male that she knew\" and that this individual had reportedly struck her several times while in an intoxicated state. To their dismay, they never received any response from the detectives investigating the case, but it was later revealed in 2023 by former Garda detective Tom Rook that the task force assigned to Annie's case had never received any fax messages. He also expressed his frustration, stating that these would have led the investigation in an entirely different direction had they received them in 1993. With no leads and no evidence, the case ran cold very quickly.\n\nIn 2021, almost 30 years after Annie vanished, a woman contacted Gardaí with screenshots of messages from a social media platform. In the messages, a man claimed that he had discovered a brown leather handbag behind the popular Kiely's pub in Donnybrook back in 1993. When he looked inside the bag in an effort to identify the owner, he discovered ID and bank cards belonging to Annie. He then claimed he handed the bag into a Garda station in South Dublin, but no records exist of any bag ever being handed in. Regardless, the Garda launched an internal investigation in an effort to understand if this bag was ever received at any stage.\n\nOn March 26th 2023, on the 30th anniversary of her disappearance, the Garda announced that they were upgrading the case from missing person to a murder enquiry following a review of the case and the receiving of new information. As a result, they elaborated that they're now following a new line of investigation, with the theory that Annie never actually left Sandymount that day and was murdered by someone known to her in the area. Most interestingly of all, they revealed that they now have suspects in her disappearance, two brothers who lived in the area at the time and to whom Annie was acquainted. These men are now middle aged and no longer live in the area, but it's been reported that they have built successful property businesses and are now under close scrutiny from the Garda. It's also reported that one of the men was suspected of stalking and violently assaulting Annie shortly before her disappearance in 1993. \n\nIn March 2024, it was revealed that the CCTV image of Annie in the bank, widely regarded as the last credible sighting of her, wasn't from the day she vanished, but rather from 11 days prior. This changed the timeline somewhat, as it would appear that she never went to the bank that day after all and consequently, some of her movements from that day are unknown.\n\nIn April 2025, it was revealed that Gardaí had interviewed a man in France who is believed to be one of the brothers and a joint prime suspect. He has reportedly lived in France for quite some time now, but is currently in hospital due to serious, long-term health issues. They reportedly interviewed him twice in hospital, but it's not clear where his brother is currently living or if they're even still in contact. However, the Garda continue to build a case against the men in the hopes that, someday soon, Annie will receive justice and that her friends and remaining family will finally get the closure they deserve after 32 long, painful years.\n\n\nSources: https://www.irishexaminer.com/news/arid-41608546.html\n\nhttps://www.irelandsvanishingtriangle.com/annie-mccarrick\n\nhttps://www.irishtimes.com/crime-law/2023/05/11/two-men-now-being-examined-as-suspects-in-annie-mccarrick-murder-inquiry/\n\nhttps://www.thejournal.ie/annie-mccarrick-missing-vanishing-triangle-rte-6062773-May2023/\n\nhttps://www.irishtimes.com/crime-law/2023/05/12/internal-review-will-seek-to-establish-if-annie-mccarricks-bag-handed-in-to-garda-station-in-1993/\n\nhttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annie_McCarrick\n\nhttps://www.dublinlive.ie/news/dublin-news/annie-mccarrick-exact-timeline-events-28889295\n\nhttps://www.irishtimes.com/podcasts/in-the-news/gardai-reassess-murder-of-annie-mccarrick-as-doubts-cast-over-original-timeline/\n\n'Missing' by Barry Cummins",

      "title": "New UPDATE on Branson Perry, missing from Skidmore, Missouri",
      "text": "# Branson\n\nBranson Perry was a 20 year old kid, well-liked in the community of Skidmore (a town with a fascinating history on its own). Branson lived with his dad (parents were divorced) who was in the hospital at the time. Since he was coming home soon, Branson - being the good son he was - decided to have his close friend over to clean the house before his dad came home. He also had 2 men over fixing his dad's car as well. He was supposedly walking to the shed in his backyard when he just disappeared off the face of the earth.  Branson was a weightlifter, an outdoors enthusiast, and he has a black belt in hapkido. After graduating from Nodaway High School in 1999, he had worked for both a roofing company and a petting zoo. However, Perry was unemployed at the time he vanished. His disappearance has been a mystery since 2001.\n\nSadly, the Perry family was destined to deal with an additional devasating tragedy. In 2004, 3 years after Branson vanished, his pregnant 23 year old cousin [Bobbie Jo Stinnett ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder_of_Bobbie_Jo_Stinnett)was strangled to death by a woman (a mom with two teenage sons, oddly enough) who then cut her child out of her womb to kidnap the newborn. Thankfully, the baby survived this absolutely brutal event and was returned to the father. The killer was tried and found guilty in 2007; she was then executed by lethal injection in January 2021. Branson's father died in 2004 and his mother died in 2011, both left this planet still feeling heartbroken and confused about their son's sudden disappearance. His mom's obituary listed her son as predeceasing her. His grandmother, Jo Ann Stinnett, died in 2015. As most of the people who were closest to Branson Perry have died, maintaining public interest in achieving justice for him is imperative.\n\nIt is also important to mention that Branson and his friend group had recently started experimenting with drugs. Jena Crawford is the friend who was with him that day and she told police they had used methamphetamines in the hours before he disappeared.\n\nBranson's mom, Becky Klino, searched for her son relentlessly. She detailed the following on her blog (Bring Branson Home, linked below) before she passed away:\n\n*“At one point, (Crawford) saw Branson run into the kitchen and take something out of one of the cabinets, then run out the back door. When he returned, she said he wouldn’t tell her what he was doing and acted like nothing happened. Later, she said she had taken a shower and when she came out of the bathroom she saw one of the men that were working on the car going through the cabinets in the kitchen \\[also\\]. She said she asked him what he was looking for and he told her nothing and went back outside. Then at approximately 3 PM she had been upstairs when she heard the front porch door shut. She looked out the window and saw Branson. She asked him where he was going and he told her he was going to put the jumper cables in the storage shed and would be right back. She never saw him again. The men that had been working on the car claim to have never seen him. No one saw him.”*\n\nInteresting side note on the jumper cables: when police checked the storage shed, they were not in the shed. In a search 2 weeks later, the cables turned up in the shed. Who put the cables in the shed, and why?\n\nAccording to his mother, all of Perry’s belongings were still at home when investigators arrived, including his wallet. A week after Perry's disappearance, Sheriff Ben Espey organized a search party in a 15-mile radius to try and find the missing young man, but turned up nothing.\n\n# Presently...\n\nThe latest developments come revealing that, indeed, drugs could have been a factor in Perry's case. **Authorities got tips that after leaving his home that day, Perry was sighted at a particular house a mile east of Quitman, Missouri, a house known at the time as a popular place to buy drugs. This house was destroyed by fire less than a week after Perry's disappearance, before he was reported missing.**\n\n*“There was a lot of activity that went on out there,”* said Darren White, a Nodaway County Sheriff’s deputy in 2001 and later sheriff from 2009 to 2017. But by the time of the fire, *“they had all abandoned the place — and this was, in retrospect, after Branson went missing but before that was reported.”* On that Friday or Saturday night, White said he responded to the fire at the house.\n\n*“By the time that we got the call and got there, there was absolutely nothing left,”* he said. *“It had burned to the ground.”* Quitman is about 7 miles from Skidmore, about a 10 minute drive. I question how Perry got to this location since the car was being worked on at the time of his disappearance. That is a *very* long and arduous walk that I doubt he took despite the fact he loved the outdoors.\n\nIn 2022, an investigator told the News-Press that [his agency had a suspect in the case](https://www.newspressnow.com/news/local_news/public_safety/officers-have-suspect-still-need-evidence-in-21-year-missing-person-case/article_736e0bde-1a7b-11ed-812e-43c8153ca490.html), but lacked the evidence to bring charges without Perry’s body. There has been silence from 2022-2024, for the most part.\n\n**This summer, the police announced that two individuals were being questioned about Perry's disappearance and they** ***both*** **identified a particular spot in the rural Quitman area where they claimed his remains were.** Police dug up the location and didn't find Branson's body, but they did find that the earth was disturbed and that something had definitely been buried there sometime prior.\n\nStrangely enough, there was a tip given to the sheriff's office previously that he was buried and then dug up and reburied multiple times. Perhaps Perry was buried at this location after dying of an overdose, or maybe he owed his dealers money since he was unemployed at the time of his disappearance, then he was moved when the perpetrators were worried law enforcement was getting too close to finding him.\n\n*“This is still an open case,”* Capt. Austin Hann of the sheriff’s office said. *“So, the investigation portion of this never really stops for us. We are still gonna take every single tip in. We’re going to follow up on every single tip that’s provided and if we believe that that tip is credible, we’re going to pour resources into following up.”*\n\nFoul play is suspected due to these circumstances. They are dedicated to finding justice for Branson Perry and are continuing their criminal investigation.\n\n# Links\n\n[Bring Branson Home](https://bringbransonhome.wordpress.com)\n\n[Charley Project](https://charleyproject.org/case/branson-kayne-perry)\n\n[Law enforcement seeking leads in Branson Perry case](https://www.newspressnow.com/news/local_news/public_safety/law-enforcement-seeking-potential-leads-in-branson-perry-case/article_b2f6ae88-13ca-11ef-866a-f3a4b73cafc9.html)\n\n[Maryville Forum](https://www.maryvilleforum.com/features/laying-out-the-evidence-after-renewed-interest-in-branson-perry-case/article_178fa996-23af-11ef-b0d9-cf8d16406566.html)",

      "title": "The tragic disappearance of Fiona Pender",
      "text": "Fiona Pender was a 25 year old Irish woman who vanished from her home in Tullamore, Ireland on August 23rd 1996. At the time of her disappearance, Fiona was 7 months pregnant. Despite an enormous police investigation and numerous campaigns for information, she has never been found. \n\nFiona was the only daughter of Sean and Josephine Pender, born on July 13th 1971. She also had two brothers, Mark and John. Tragically, however, Mark was killed in a motorbike accident in June 1995, after his bike hit a verge and swerved into oncoming traffic. Not much is known about Fiona's early life, but her brother John would later recall \"I've nothing but good memories of childhood with her. She was bright and bubbly and she always had a smile on her face.\" \n\nBy August 1996, Fiona was sharing a small apartment with her boyfriend John Thompson. The couple were living on Church Street in the small town of Tullamore, having returned to Ireland from London in the winter of 1995. At this stage, Fiona was working as a hairdresser and part-time model. On the surface, her relationship seemed normal and happy; she was 7 months pregnant, had her own little home and lived with her partner. However, under the surface, things were not as perfect as they seemed. It's alleged that in early 1996, while in the initial stages of pregnancy, John had strangled Fiona to the extent that she lost consciousness and had blood vessels burst in her eye. She later confided the details of this event to her brother John but swore him to silence, stating that she didn't want to worry her parents. She believed that her partner had changed his ways and thus, had forgiven him for attacking her.\n\nOn Thursday 22nd August, Fiona and her mother Josephine went out shopping, hoping to buy clothes for her baby that was due in a little over 2 months time. During the course of the day, they made two trips to the Bridge shopping centre in Tullamore, with Fiona being described as \"in good form\". She had also told her mother that she was looking for a bigger house to live in, as their current apartment wouldn't be big enough for the couple and their new child. After they'd finished shopping, Fiona and Josephine got a taxi back to the Pender home, approximately 10 minutes away. Josephine fondly recalls how Fiona started flicking through a copy of Hello magazine and showed her father a photo of the singer Eric Clapton holding up a salmon that he'd caught. Sean was getting his own fishing gear together that afternoon in preparation for an upcoming trip and the two had fallen about laughing and joking at the image. After having lunch and catching up for a few hours, Fiona was walked home by her parents and brother John. Josephine vividly remembered this moment, stating \"My son John joined us, and the three of us walked Fiona back to her flat at Church Street. We walked into the flat with her. It was around 7 o'clock and I gave her a kiss. I remember clearly, as myself and John walked across the road I waved back at her. And that's the last memory I have of Fiona; her little face at the door.\"\n\nOn Friday 23rd August, Josephine called round to Fiona's flat and knocked on the door but she got no response. She noticed that the blinds were still down, and assuming that Fiona might have been sleeping, she decided to leave. She also remembered that some of Fiona's friends had returned home from America and figured that she could have been out with them, catching up. With little cause for concern, Josephine headed home. The following evening, on Saturday 24th August, Josephine and John decided to go and say hello to Fiona and the two made their way to her flat. Worryingly, there was still no response and the flat was in darkness with the blinds still drawn. Josephine immediately knew that something was horribly wrong and hurried home to call Fiona's partner, John Thompson. John explained that he hadn't seen Fiona since the morning of the 23rd at around 6am, when he'd left the flat to go and work on his family's farm, which is where he'd been ever since. However, he agreed to meet the Pender family and they all went to the local Garda station to report Fiona missing that night.\n\nAlthough Fiona was reported missing on Saturday 24th, it was Monday 26th before an appeal was made and an investigation was launched. By then, it was obvious that Fiona wasn't in any of her usual spots and nobody had seen or spoken to her since the 22nd. With the knowledge that she was 7 months pregnant, a nationwide appeal was made by midday on Monday and a huge investigation was immediately launched. A thorough examination of the flat revealed absolutely nothing, with no signs of a disturbance or break in. In fact, Josephine noted that Fiona's shopping bags were in exactly the same spot as they had been on the 22nd and that nothing had been unpacked. Ponds, bogland, forests and mountains were all searched over the following weeks but they were eventually called off, having uncovered absolutely nothing. Fiona's due date eventually passed and it was at this stage that reality began to sink in for her family as they realised that Fiona wouldn't be coming home.\n\nMonths passed with seemingly very little progress but then, in April 1997, John Thompson, his father and his 3 sisters were arrested and taken to Tullamore Garda station. They were interviewed for 12 hours straight but eventually released and returned back to their respective homes, with no charges pressed. However, it was later revealed that Garda considered John a suspect in Fiona's disappearance. Also around this time, some interesting information came to light by two different witnesses. One man, who had been walking home from a pub on Church Street at around 2am on Friday 23rd, had observed two men loading a \"Large, bulky item that was wrapped in carpet\" into the back of a large 4x4 type vehicle. A short time later, another man had been driving along a small country road in the Slieve Bloom mountains, approximately 20 miles from Tullamore, when a large 4x4 type vehicle came driving towards at him at extremely high speed and in an erratic manner, almost forcing him off the road. He didn't get a good look at the driver but he could recall that the car had a large sticker on the windscreen that said \"Keep her lit\". Whilst neither the vehicle, nor the two men have been identified, it was alleged that John Thompson owned a large 4x4 that also had an identical window sticker.\n\nSeveral years passed with no updates in the case but tragically, on March 31st 2000, Sean Pender took his own life, his body being discovered by his son John. Josephine would go on to say that Fiona's disappearance is what killed Sean, stating \"My husband cried every night for his children. He looked like a man with cancer: he was fading away, he looked so weak. He become so sick because of what happened to our family, he went so low and he just couldn't take any more. He's at peace now. I believe he's in heaven because he already suffered and went through hell here on earth.\"\n\nIn May 2008, a small cross was found in Monicknew Woods, in the Slieve Bloom mountains, reading \"Fiona Pender. Buried here August 22nd 1996.\" Searches were carried out in the area but these revealed nothing. However, Garda don't believe that this was a hoax and they have stated that they find it interesting that the cross says she was buried on the 22nd whenever she was allegedly last seen by John on the morning of the 23rd. John Thompson left Ireland for Canada in 2012 but in 2014, was arrested and charged with numerous offences, including sexual assault and making death threats to his wife. Video footage had been found on various laptops that depicted the couple engaged in sexual activities, but John's wife had no memory or recollection of the events and believed that John had drugged and then raped her, recording himself committing the act. She also told investigators that she had found a similar tape several years earlier when they were still living in Ireland. She had confronted John and he had reportedly stormed off, vanishing for a week. When he returned, he told her that he wanted to move to Canada as they didn't have an extradition treaty with Ireland. Most interestingly, she told police that one night, while in a terrible rage, John had told her \"You know I've done it before. They'll never find you. You'll end up like her.\" The only reason she hadn't spoken out sooner was because she was so scared for her safety, noting John's bad temper and violent tendencies. Shockingly, in October 2015, John walked free from court after the judge ruled that it couldn't be determined that he had actually commited nonconsensual acts against his wife and the case was thrown out. However, John's wife filed for divorce and the couple separated.\n\nUsing information given to them by John's wife before the trial, Garda began a fresh dig at a new location in the Slieve Bloom mountains in December 2014. She had told investigators that John had taken her there over 10 years before and told her that Fiona was buried there, reminding her that she would end up in the same place if she stepped out of line. However, the dig revealed nothing and Garda later determined that John must have deliberately misled her in an effort to throw investigators off the scent. \n\nDevastatingly, in September 2017, Josephine Pender passed away after a battle with cancer, never seeing her daughters case solved or anyone brought to justice for her disappearance. John Pender has now taken up the mantle, campaigning tirelessly for information that might see his sister and her child brought home so that they can be laid to rest with their parents and brother. Sadly, the only suspect in her case is walking free on the other side of the world and there has been absolutely no evidence that could help investigators. Unfortunately, because of this, her final resting place is still unknown and her case tragically remains unsolved.\n\nSources: https://www.irishtimes.com/news/crime-and-law/fiona-pender-case-has-a-suspect-and-a-motive-but-no-justice-1.3221455\n\nhttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disappearance_of_Fiona_Pender\n\nhttps://m.independent.ie/irish-news/fiona-pender-suspect-misled-witness-about-burial-site/30865528.html\n\nhttps://www.irelandsvanishingtriangle.com/fiona-pender\n\nhttps://www.thejournal.ie/josephine-fiona-pender-3596151-Sep2017/\n\nMissing by Barry Cummins",

      "title": "Who Killed Them in Broad Daylight? 5 Explanations for the Kate Brown & Carnell Sledge Case",
      "text": "**UPDATED SUMMARY:**\n\n**Per request, here's my best attempt at a summary.**\n\nOn June 4, 2019, longtime friends Kate Brown and Carnell “Nell” Sledge met at Rocky River Reservation park near Cleveland, Ohio. Nell arranged the meeting on short notice, texting Kate around 4:00 p.m. to meet before a family dinner he had organized for 5:00–5:30 p.m.\n\nThe two sat together on a park bench, surrounded by people walking, jogging, and biking.\n\nShortly after 5:00 pm, an unknown assailant shot and killed both Kate and Nell in broad daylight.\n\nNell was found near the bench, shot multiple times in the head; Kate was found face-down in a shallow creek a few feet away, as if trying to escape.\n\nTheir bodies were discovered at 5:18 pm by a couple out for a walk.\n\nStrikingly, no one, including a man sitting in a nearby truck, reported seeing or hearing anything unusual.\n\nNo valuables were taken from the victims (phones, wallets, jewelry, laptops, and cars were left untouched), indicating that robbery was not a motive.\n\nThe attack appeared targeted: police theorize that the killer was lying in wait and knew the park well enough to act quickly and escape undetected, despite the presence of other park visitors.\n\nDespite extensive investigation, community outreach, and renewed attention from a Netflix “Unsolved Mysteries” episode, no arrests have been made, and the case remains unsolved.\n\nFrom what I read, I wanted to try some alternative explanations, and here's what I came up with.\n\n1. Targeted Personal Attack (Jealous/Obsessed Lover or Acquaintance)- Both victims had recently been in romantic relationships that ended poorly.\n\nNell's willingness to meet Kate close to a family dinner suggests urgency or importance.\n\nThe killer seemed to know their meeting time and place, and executed the attack quickly and efficiently, which could indicate a personal motive and prior knowledge.\n\n2. Hate Crime\n\n\\- Kate and Nell were an interracial pair sitting in a public park area marked by gang graffiti.\n\nWhile they were friends, their appearance as a couple could have attracted the attention of someone with racial animus.\n\nThe brutality and public nature of the crime could reflect a hate-motivated attack.\n\n3. Gang Initiation or Retaliation\n\n\\- The area contained gang graffiti, and the murder occurred in broad daylight without theft, suggesting a possible gang initiation or message.\n\nHowever, neither victim is described as having gang involvement, which weakens this theory unless they were randomly selected or mistaken for someone else.\n\n4. Random Act by a Professional/Contract Killer\n\n\\- The killer lay in wait, struck quickly and cleanly, and left without taking valuables, even with bystanders nearby.\n\nThis level of confidence and efficiency could suggest a professional hit, possibly for reasons not yet uncovered (e.g., a mistaken identity or a hidden connection).\n\n5. Random Act of Violence by a Severely Disturbed Individual\n\n\\- Although less likely given the planning involved, there remains the possibility that the killer was a mentally unstable individual who selected victims at random and fled undetected.\n\nSummary of Patterns and Inconsistencies:\n\n\\- No robbery or theft, suggesting motive was not financial.\n\n\\- Crime executed in daylight, suggesting boldness or a desire to send a message.\n\n\\- No one reported hearing or seeing anything, even with a bystander in a nearby truck.\n\n\\- The killer appeared to know the park layout and timing.\n\n\\- Both victims had recently experienced relationship turmoil.\n\n**Targeted Personal Attack (Jealous/Obsessed Lover or Acquaintance)**\n\n**Reasoning:**\n\n* The killer seemed to have knowledge of the victims’ meeting time and location.\n* The attack was quick, efficient, and occurred in broad daylight, suggesting confidence and intent rather than randomness.\n* No valuables were taken, indicating the motive was not robbery.\n* Both victims had recently ended romantic relationships on difficult terms, raising the possibility of jealousy, anger, or obsession as a motive.\n* The lack of noise or struggle suggests the victims may have trusted or at least recognized their attacker.\n\nI would bet that law enforcement is going deep into these areas:\n\n* Deep dive into the victims' recent personal relationships and communications.\n* Analysis of park surveillance, witness re-interviews, and electronic forensics.\n* Review of hate crime and gang activity in the area during that timeframe.\n* Follow-up on the anonymous letter sent to Fox8 and the FBI.\n\nSources:\n\n* [https://www.today.com/popculture/tv/unsolved-mysteries-park-bench-murders-true-story-rcna173605](https://www.today.com/popculture/tv/unsolved-mysteries-park-bench-murders-true-story-rcna173605)\n* [https://www.fbi.gov/wanted/seeking-info/carnell-e-sledge-and-katherine-c-brown](https://www.fbi.gov/wanted/seeking-info/carnell-e-sledge-and-katherine-c-brown)\n* [https://www.wkyc.com/article/news/crime/true-crime/carnell-sledge-kate-brown-cold-case-murders-rocky-river-reservation-unsolved-mysteries-netflix-updates/95-10a70e48-8cdb-427e-821f-02c9f05b5fd1](https://www.wkyc.com/article/news/crime/true-crime/carnell-sledge-kate-brown-cold-case-murders-rocky-river-reservation-unsolved-mysteries-netflix-updates/95-10a70e48-8cdb-427e-821f-02c9f05b5fd1)\n* [coldcaseai.app/cases/carnell-sledge-kate-brown](http://coldcaseai.app/cases/carnell-sledge-kate-brown)\n* [https://youtu.be/u7FagxP4sLI?si=gqDGxHyGSsvmUoS7](https://youtu.be/u7FagxP4sLI?si=gqDGxHyGSsvmUoS7)\n* [https://www.wkyc.com/article/news/crime/unsolved-cleveland-metroparks-double-murder-featured-netflix/95-def08f1f-7408-4d83-8410-ae475cae7e54](https://www.wkyc.com/article/news/crime/unsolved-cleveland-metroparks-double-murder-featured-netflix/95-def08f1f-7408-4d83-8410-ae475cae7e54)\n* [https://www.news5cleveland.com/news/rocky-river-reservation-murders/5-years-later-still-no-arrests-in-rocky-river-double-homicide](https://www.news5cleveland.com/news/rocky-river-reservation-murders/5-years-later-still-no-arrests-in-rocky-river-double-homicide)\n* [https://unsolved.com/gallery/park-bench-murders/](https://unsolved.com/gallery/park-bench-murders/)\n* [https://youtu.be/GJcl7Vfma30?si=L6dhhTI6ydOIARfz](https://youtu.be/GJcl7Vfma30?si=L6dhhTI6ydOIARfz)\n* [https://www.bustle.com/entertainment/who-killed-carnell-sledge-kate-brown-unsolved-mysteries-netflix](https://www.bustle.com/entertainment/who-killed-carnell-sledge-kate-brown-unsolved-mysteries-netflix)\n* [https://www.today.com/popculture/tv/unsolved-mysteries-park-bench-murders-true-story-rcna173605](https://www.today.com/popculture/tv/unsolved-mysteries-park-bench-murders-true-story-rcna173605)\n* [https://www.wkyc.com/article/news/local/cuyahoga-county/cleveland-metroparks-murders-kate-brownand-carnell-sledge-police-investigate-possible-link-6-years/95-baeb6502-685a-45bf-9c2a-e6b07db57a34](https://www.wkyc.com/article/news/local/cuyahoga-county/cleveland-metroparks-murders-kate-brownand-carnell-sledge-police-investigate-possible-link-6-years/95-baeb6502-685a-45bf-9c2a-e6b07db57a34)",

      "text": "On December 30, 2023, 14-year-old Kaden Moses was found dead from a gunshot wound to the head in his Clinton, South Carolina home. Earlier that evening, Kaden had been playing video games with his friend, referred to as “James,” who was staying over. Family members reported hearing a muffled gunshot, after which James emerged from Kaden’s room, stating that Kaden had shot himself.  \n\nThe Laurens County Coroner’s Office ruled Kaden Moses’ death a homicide, contradicting initial claims that he had died by suicide. The coroner’s report highlighted inconsistencies with the self-inflicted gunshot theory, particularly the fact that Kaden was right-handed, but the fatal wound was located on the left side of his head. Additionally, forensic evidence did not align with a typical self-inflicted gunshot wound, further raising doubts about the initial account given by “James,” the friend who was present at the time of the shooting. Despite this ruling, law enforcement agencies have not charged anyone in connection with Kaden’s death, citing a lack of prosecutable evidence.\n\nDespite these findings, no charges have been filed. The South Carolina Law Enforcement Division (SLED) and the Laurens County Sheriff’s Office cited insufficient evidence for prosecution. Kaden’s family continues to seek justice, questioning the thoroughness of the investigation and the decision not to pursue charges against those present during the incident.\n\n[https://www.foxcarolina.com/2025/03/02/laurens-county-family-seeks-justice-teen-killed-2023/](https://www.foxcarolina.com/2025/03/02/laurens-county-family-seeks-justice-teen-killed-2023/)  \n[https://www.fitsnews.com/2024/12/13/unsolved-carolinas-the-death-of-kaden-moses/](https://www.fitsnews.com/2024/12/13/unsolved-carolinas-the-death-of-kaden-moses/)\n\n[https://crimeandcask.com/how-to-prosecute-for-the-death-of-kaden-moses-14/](https://crimeandcask.com/how-to-prosecute-for-the-death-of-kaden-moses-14/)",

Finally her family can hopefully find some peace in knowing.\n\nFrom Charley Project….Missing since 9/14/2014 from Melbourne Florida. Belaya was last seen near her home on Rock Springs Drive in Melbourne, Florida on September 28, 2014. She was driving a white 2003 Honda Odyssey with the Florida license plate number A43-1CR and peeling paint around the windshield. That evening, she told her daughter she was going to the store and would return in half an hour. She never returned and has never been heard from again.\n\nAt the time of her disappearance, Belaya was a science professor at East Florida State College.\n\nFrom Click Orlando…. BREVARD COUNTY, Fla. – Yekaterina “Katya” Belaya went to a store on Sept. 28, 2014, and was never seen again. Ten years later, investigators say the body of the mother of three was found at the bottom of a retention pond not far from her Melbourne home. The Brevard County Sheriff’s Office confirmed that remains found on Dec. 20 in a pond off Viera Boulevard have been identified as Belaya, whose case went cold after investigators said they followed all possible leads. “We] started doing some investigation with some cell phone information and stuff. Looked in the several areas where we were getting tower hits, but didn’t come up with anything,” Brevard County Sheriff Public Information Officer Tod Goodyear explained. “A lot of the information we were getting was that she did have some depression problems or some issues within the family. There was also some thought that she might have left on her own, possibly even have left the country.” The case was cold until Sunshine State Sonar got involved. “We’re a private company that works with families of missing people and we assist law enforcement and families, specializing in cases where people are missing in the water. We specialize in cold cases,” Sunshine State Sonar Owner Michael Sullivan said.\n\nSources:\n\nhttps://charleyproject.org/case/yekaterina-gennadyevna-belaya\n\nhttps://www.clickorlando.com/news/local/2025/01/02/sonar-team-finds-body-of-brevard-county-woman-who-disappeared-10-years-ago/",

      "title": "Cynthia D. Bulmer went missing in 1998. Was she found in Iran ?",
      "text": "Cynthia “Cindy” D. Bulmer was 40 when she disappeared from Lockport, NY in March 1998. She was last seen visiting a local bar named Kendzies on Main Street, last seen leaving at 10:30 PM with two men. While she only lived a few blocks away, she never made it home. Her family became concerned from not hearing from her and reported her missing April 10th, 1998. This was about two weeks from when she was last seen. As a person from the area, her case was always in the back of my mind. \nEventually, the investigators identified the two men she was spotted with that night. Both were known to police, and suspected to be involved in the local drug scene in Lockport. One of the men was described as a boyfriend, and the other died in 2001. Early witnesses describe her as involved in drugs and prostitution. However, in 2015, Lockport police claimed there was no evidence of linking her to prostitution. Regardless of this, police have suspected foul play in this case. \nTwo decades later, her name appeared on the Doe Network  “solved” cases section. In early 2025, this volunteer-run missing persons database (which I check often), added her to “located/identified”, with the statement “passed away in Iran on May 19th, 2000”. It said that they were notified by family members. However, this proves to be confusing, as the WNY facebook group and Reddit are confused as to how the Doe Network came to this Iran conclusion. A cousin of hers, on Reddit said they have never heard of no such family member. How could a woman from a small town in NY end up in Iran? \nSo, I have some questions\nIt is unusual for a non-Iranian American citizen to travel to Iran. My Iranian friends (who are citizens) have told me that it is difficult for even them to enter Iran and visit their family. The obvious answer is trafficking (even though was refuted by Lockport police), but it just doesn’t make any sense. How would she even get into such a country, and what would be the purpose of trafficking her there? \nWas she actually found? While her missing persons page is still available on the doe network, the only indications that she is missing are found on the aforementioned Doe Network page, and a facebook group. The Namus and NY police websites are still active. Was she formerly on the Doe Network unidentified section? They don’t even have a section for Iran so how was this conclusion made possible? Does Iran themselves have a public database for unidentified persons? In other words how did a family member connect her to a body in Iran? It just doesn’t make sense to me. \nWhy did law enforcement seem to downplay her involvement in drugs/prostitution? If witnesses said this, why wasn’t it pursued or addressed publicly? Lockport has always been a high-crime area, and it doesn’t explain her involvement with these men. \nThis is my first post here, I hope this is coherent enough. If anyone has any general thoughts on this case or answers to my questions, please discuss. While this case hasn’t been discussed much here, I’d like to know your thoughts on these discrepancies. \nLinks: \nhttps://www.doenetwork.org/closedmain.php\nhttps://namus.nij.ojp.gov/case/MP8031\nhttps://troopers.ny.gov/missing-bulmer-cynthia-d\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/UnresolvedMysteries/comments/htjayp/cynthia_bulmer_was_40yearsold_when_she/",

      "text": "On June the 5th 2022 Casey Bokslag, then 29 years old, was playing an online game with his younger brother. He at some point told his brother his rice was done and he had to disconnect their call. This was the last time a family member has spoken to Casey, and this was the day before he vanished. The brother had latter stated Casey seemed perfectly normal during this conversation. It was later discovered that on the same day of this gaming session (June 5th) Casey bought a 2022 SIG 9 mm pistol.\n\nCornelis Bokslag was born in the Netherlands. His family moved to the United States in 2001. Casey, who even his parents referred to him as this nickname, loved skiing and all sorts of outdoor activities. He was described by loved ones as being very active especially outdoors.\n\nCasey had graduated from Jordan High School in Sandy, Utah in 2010 and joined the Marines that same year. He had served out his contract and was discharged from the military honorably in 2014.\n\nCasey became employed at the Salt Lake City Watershed in 2019 and was still employed there when he vanished. By 2022 Casey was living in South Salt Lake, Utah. \n\nOn Wednesday June the 8th, 2022 the Salt Lake City Watershed actually reached out to Robert Bokslag, Casey's father, to inform the family that Casey had not shown up for work and had not called in. This is where the first red flag was raised and the family search began.\n\nSources conflict as they usually do here whenever I research something with this little coverage. But for the most part it seems the last sighting of Casey in person was when he left his apartment on June 6th 2022 around 11:40 a.m. (by who ?) somewhere in the Southwest Temple area of Utah. He was last recorded at his ATM withdrawing $100. Not long after he leaves that ATM his cell phone is subsequently turned off and does not ping ever again.\n\nWhen the Salt Lake City Watershed called Robert Bokslag, it wasn't very much longer before the parents contacted the authorities to report their son Casey missing. Casey was supposed to log in online that morning for a virtual job training session and then go to work, but he did neither of those things.\n\nIt sounds like on the very same day that Casey's parents reported him missing his vehicle was located. Casey's vehicle, a 2012 silver and black Suzuki SX4 hatchback, was located in a remote area of Summit County, Utah said to be very near to the Wyoming border.\n\n Some reports say the vehicle was completely wiped clean of any type of finger prints. It didn't appear that anyone had tried to hide the vehicle but the license plate had been removed and the keys were not with the vehicle. There was no direct sign of foul play and no sign of Casey at the scene. \n\nNow 3 years later and the family still does not know what became of their loved one. The gun purchase by Casey seemed to have been discovered until after his disappearance and that gun has never been located. His father stated it was not unusual as Casey had wanted to buy that particular type of pistol for some time. \n\nCasey was said to carry a backpack with him everyday for work that also vanished with him. Inside the backpack was generally his binoculars, a first aid kit, a gerber multi-tool, and a bottle of water, and possibly even the gun.\n\nThe circumstances surrounding Casey's case remain unclear. \n\nThe South Salt Lake City Utah PD are investigating at 801-412-3600. \n\nHis family all stated he was behaving normally and a 5,000 dollar reward is being offered in any leads to find Casey. His father Robert stated in an interview, \"someone doesn't just vaporize someone doesn't just \"poof gone\"...\n\nWho left Casey's truck close to the Wyoming border? Was it Casey himself? And why did that person remove the license plate and clean out all the fingerprints from the vehicle?\n\nhttps://charleyproject.org/case/cornelis-frederik-bokslag\n\nhttps://www.nbcnews.com/dateline/father-determined-find-son-casey-bokslag-who-disappeared-salt-lake-n1297567\n\n https://kutv.com/news/local/family-of-missing-man-offering-5000-reward-to-help-bring-him-home-cornelis-casey-bokslag-ncic-wyoming-utah-south-salt-lake-police-bank-disapperance-suspicious\n\nI really hope this family gets the answers they are seeking and in one way or another they can bring Casey home.\n\nWas this misadventure or possible self harm? His loved ones don't seem to think so. \n\nI question why the removal of the license plate because law enforcement was still able to easily identify the vehicle as belonging to Casey? Did someone else harm him and take his vehicle and plan to throw the tags on to another vehicle? So many unanswered questions.",

      "title": "The vanishing of the yacht Ouzo and the death of her crewmen: a clear cut case of negligence, or a mystery with no clear answer?",
      "text": "On the 22nd August, 2006 a dead body was found floating in the English Channel 10 miles from Nab Tower, a distinctive navigational mark just off the Isle of Wight that marks the entrance to the Solent. This is a busy waterway, connecting the cities of Portsmouth and Southampton to the Channel, with many cargo ships, cruise vessels, ferries, and recreational vessels passing through every day. \n\nThe body had no identification, but after an appeal from the police he was identified as James Meaby, a sailor who had left the small village of Bembridge located on the Isle of Wight on the 20th August aboard the sailing yacht Ouzo, alongside his crewmates Jason Downer and Rupert Sanders. They had planned to sail to Dartmouth, around a hundred miles west, to take part in an upcoming sailing regatta. Unfortunately, just a day later on the 23rd the bodies of Downer and Sanders were recovered around 10 miles from where Meaby had been found. Their yacht Ouzo was nowhere to be seen. The three men were experienced sailors and had worked together frequently on the Ouzo, and always took their voyages seriously. Indeed, they had been recovered from the water wearing proper lifejackets and yachting clothes, but this had not been enough to save them. Evidence suggested they had been in the water for at least twelve hours, and had passed away from a combination of drowning and hypothermia.\n\n[The crewmen of the Ouzo](https://preview.redd.it/0brzmshgn58f1.jpg?width=500&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=85afb8abedfa69113e361635b77d87670d8c924f)\n\n  \nWith no distress calls received or reports of vessels in distress, the Marine Accident Investigation Branch (MAIB) launched a thorough search for the remains of the yacht and analyzed radar information from Southampton VTS, who controlled vessel traffic in the area. \n\nAt 20:30 on the 20th, a radar target was picked up leaving Bembridge harbour. Eyewitnesses reported that the men had planned to leave around this time, and were getting ready to do so at around 19:30, and it has been accepted that this radar target was almost certainly the Ouzo. \n\nIt was possible to track the yacht for the next couple of hours as she made her way into the Solent. She passed the Bembridge Ledge East Cardinal Bouy at around 21:30, and passed the West Princess West Cardinal Bouy at 21:38. After she passed the Princess Bouy, she continued on a southwesterly heading out into the Channel, with the last radar image being at around 22:45 around one nautical mile away from the Princess buoy. \n\n[Ouzo's probable route](https://preview.redd.it/mzr5rpvyo58f1.jpg?width=1277&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ad68044815024f4b4f44e70c06bfdd9cfcad5d52)\n\n  \n\n\nHowever, at approximately 23:00 one of the crew members phoned home. He was in good spirits, and described the sea as being calm. Investigators were able to triangulate the signal and discovered the yacht was within the Sanddown bay, exactly where the yacht would be if she had followed a southwesterly course after passing the Princess buoy. This confirmed to investigators that the radar target picked up by Southampton VTS was almost certainly the Ouzo. This phone call was the last confirmed contact with the yacht. \n\nSo what happened after the yacht vanished from radar?\n\n# The primary suspect: Pride of Bilbao\n\n  \nYachts are not easy to detect on radar, being small targets that can easily be obscured by wave and rain interference, so although Ouzo disappeared quickly from Southampton VTS’s radar the vessel likely carried on unimpeded for some time after the phone call was placed. The MAIB then located the vessels in the area on the night of the 20th-21st and pulled information from their black boxes, the vessel data recorder (VDR) to see if the yacht had been picked up on any other vessel’s radar. They found that the ferry Pride of Bilbao had been in the area that night, and that the vessel had been in a close quarters situation with a yacht.\n\nPride of Bilbao was operated by P&O ferries from Portsmouth on the route to, perhaps unsurprisingly, Bilbao in Spain. At 176m long, she was one of the largest ferries operating in UK waters at the time. On the 20th August, she departed Portsmouth at 2325, two hours late to depart due to technical issues. The Captain was on the bridge until 0022, along with the second officer Michael Hubble. At 61 years old, Hubble had worked for P&O ferries for nearly a decade , but had since mostly retired and was onboard Pride of Bilbao as second officer on a temporary basis. He had been working at sea since he was 16, and had a good record at the company.\n\n[Pride of Bilbao at the time](https://preview.redd.it/wc2bq5btn58f1.jpg?width=450&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=754c1138e98ad6f5f4a459153db617151bc4b3d5)\n\n  \nAt 00:30, the Captain handed over control of the vessel to Hubble as per usual and left the navigational bridge. Also with Hubble were two lookouts, however one was always patrolling the vessel as part of the usual safety rounds meaning one lookout was stationed on the port side of the bridge keeping watch. \n\nHubble went about his watch as usual, checking the radar and acquiring targets on the radar, but none concerned him. There was no target that appeared to be a small yacht. He then entered the chartroom, a closed off area in the centre of the bridge that contained the physical navigational charts used to plot the vessel’s position. Here, he removed the red night filter from the light as he felt it irritated his eyes. \n\nAt 00:57, the lookouts changed roles and Hubble emerged from the chartroom to greet him. They made friendly conversation as Hubble adjusted the vessel’s autopilot course from 221 degrees to 243 degrees, an alteration to the west. He did this slowly, adjusting in small increments, and the lookout did not realise he had done so. At 01:04 Hubble returned to the chartroom and the lookout positioned himself on the port side of the bridge.\n\nA few minutes later, at 01:07, the lookout spotted a dim white light on Pride of Bilbao’s starboard bow. Picking up his binoculars, he then noticed a second, brighter red light. He called out to Hubble that he had spotted lights on the starboard bow, but Hubble remained in the chartroom as he assumed the lookout was talking about one of the distant vessels nearby. Only when the lookout realised the lights were incredibly close to Pride of Bilbao did he go to the chartroom and say they were ‘pretty close.’ \n\nHubble left the chartroom and went to the starboard side, where he saw a cluster of bright white lights on the starboard bow. Quickly, he went to the autopilot controls and directed the vessel to port. As the vessel came into view the lookout saw it was a small yacht with two white sails, a description which matched the Ouzo. It then disappeared from view along the starboard side, which prompted the lookout to run over to see if she passed here. Hubble then adjusted course to starboard, back towards the yacht, believing the turn to port would cause the stern of the vessel to swing out and contact the yacht if he didn’t. \n\nThe lookout, joined by Hubble after a few moments, searched for a sign of the yacht on the starboard side. The lookout saw a red light close to starboard on the stern (referred to as the starboard quarter), but Hubble did not. He went inside to turn off deck lights he believed were obscuring his vision before returning. The lookout spotted the same light again, but did not show Hubble where it was. Hubble himself spotted a different red light much further off the starboard quarter than the one the lookout had. However, they both believed this was the yacht and they returned to the centre of the bridge, Hubble adjusting course to port to bring the vessel back onto her planned course.\n\nAfter this, Hubble went to the port side and looked down the port quarter. He saw a white light, which he believed was the white stern light of the yacht and suggested that it had continued unharmed on its original course. Satisfied he had dodged the yacht, he returned and talked to the lookout about yachts, commenting that they often sailed around relying on larger vessel’s radars to detect them. The rest of his watch was normal. \n\n[Reconstruction of Bilbao's actions from the MAIB report](https://preview.redd.it/vgg9w2vdo58f1.png?width=820&format=png&auto=webp&s=994bffb23e1d66b69a73a19197f1184eaf6dd69c)\n\n\n\n# Hubble’s guilt\n\nAfter discovering this information, and after taking into account the direction Ouzo had been heading and the relative speeds of both vessels, it was determined that the yacht Pride of Bilbao had encountered was likely the Ouzo. Simulations were also conducted to determine how the bodies of Ouzo’s crew may have traveled, and it was found their likely point of entry into the water was incredibly close to where the incident had occurred. \n\nMr. Hubble was charged with Gross Negligence Manslaughter under the Merchant Shipping Act 1995, primarily for his neglect to properly determine if the yacht was indeed safe after the near miss. \n\nThe prosecution found numerous issues with the bridge watch that night, in particular the issue of light pollution. During a night watch, it is imperative the navigational bridge remain in complete darkness in order for the watchkeepers’ eyes to adapt to the dark. If the lights remain on, it becomes impossible to spot the vessel lights in the darkness. It is considered good practise to allow at least ten minutes before a navigational watch to adjust your eyes to the darkness. By removing the red filter of the chartroom light, Hubble had essentially removed the ability for his eyes to adapt to the dark. Furthermore, the blackout curtains which kept the chartroom lights from entering the bridge were not fully closed. This, alongside the fact the lookout had only just returned from his safety rounds, meant both watchkeeper’s eyes were not adjusted for the darkness. Had they been, it is possible the yacht’s lights could have been spotted far earlier. \n\nAs well as this, Hubble also engaged in practices that could be considered complacent; His incremental adjustment of Pride of Bilbao’s course is advised against, as multiple small adjustments to a vessel’s heading makes their change of direction hard to see for other vessels. It is possible that Ouzo did not realise Pride of Bilbao had made such a large alteration when approaching the ferry. As well as this, considering he had just experienced a close quarters situation it would have been best practice and almost certainly specified in the standing orders to call the Captain, who could have assessed the situation differently and decided to return and aid the yacht. However, Hubble remained unphased by the incident and did not notify the Captain at the time. \n\nFrom the MAIB’s point of view, it appeared clear that Hubble was guilty of colliding with the yacht. However, the situation was not as clear as it seemed. Not only was there no direct evidence the yacht involved had been the Ouzo, but there was also the fact that despite searches the wreckage of the yacht itself had vanished from the face of the earth.\n\n\n\n# The numerous unanswered questions. \n\nAs posited by Hubble’s defence, there was no evidence the yacht was the Ouzo despite their similarities. Recreational sailing is extremely popular in the Solent and yachts are a common sight, and also frequent navigational nuisances. Indeed, the Pride of Bilbao had come close to collision with a yacht in the same area a few years beforehand, and it is not uncommon to pass close by yachts when navigating in the area. Indeed, the defence visited the pride of Bilbao and described the number of vessels seen that lacked lights or were otherwise difficult to spot. \n\nIn regards to his actions, while Hubble’s assessment of the yacht’s condition immediately after was not thorough, as he had been sailing on P&O ferries and likely encountered similar situations before, the lights observed may have seemed a completely reasonable piece of evidence that the yacht had passed unscathed. Although some of his actions were negligent, moving into the chartroom was a normal and expected part of navigation with paper charts, and he was keeping a close eye on the radar screen. With his lookout on the bridge, he was meeting the requirements laid out in law. \n\nWorse still, is that there was no yacht wreckage to analyse. The MAIB’s research indicated a sailing vessel of that type would have floundered quickly, so it is unlikely the men simply fell overboard and the yacht drifted free. She would have almost certainly been spotted adrift in the channel due to the volume of traffic. No floating debris was ever recovered, and despite a large search area being created and the seafloor searched by a naval minesweeper no wreck was located. The MAIB could not offer an explanation for this, their only suggestion being that the yacht had managed to drift out of the search area before sinking. The only evidence the yacht had been out that night were the crewmember’s bodies. \n\nStrangely enough, there was also no evidence that the yacht had made contact with the Pride of Bilbao at all. The vessel’s paintwork was examined soon after and no damage suggesting contact with a yacht was found, nor did any crew member report hearing a collision with the hull. While some passengers reported a large banging and vibration in the night, both I and the defence lawyer of Hubble believe this is a red herring. The large bang and resulting vibration is typical of a vessel moving at speed rising on a wave and slamming her bow into the water. The yacht’s contact would have been more localised and sounded more like a scraping noise. \n\nAs well as this, P&O’s safety manager, a master mariner, calculated the distances from where Hubble had witnessed the cluster of lights from the bridge and determined that they were likely further than Hubble believed, around 0.2 miles away compared to being virtually on the bow. This was likely due to Hubble’s lack of proper night vision adjustment. Considering this information, it appears probable the Ouzo, if that was indeed the yacht the Pride of Bilbao encountered, did not make contact with the ferry. Instead, it may have been swamped by the large wake left by the Pride of Bilbao as she was moving at a large speed of 19 knots. \n\nHowever, the mystery deepens further. The MAIB had also examined other vessels in the area, and the Pride of Bilbao was far from the only one acting in negligence. \n\n# The Crescent Beaune \n\nAlso in the area that night was the Crescent Beaune, a small oil product tanker on her way to Portland. At only 88m long, she is what is called a bunker barge, a small tanker dedicated to refuelling other vessels. The crew was only small, and it was revealed that the Captain of that vessel had stood his lookouts down for the night, at the same time the Crescent Beaune had passed through the area. This vessel was on a similar course to the Bilbao and only 2.5 miles behind her at the time of the incident, and it is entirely possible that if the Ouzo had been slower than estimated by the MAIB she would have made contact. The MAIB had only considered the Ouzo’s speed as being fast enough to reach the Bilbao and collide, not that she had been slower. \n\nWhile nothing untoward was recorded on the Crescent Beaune, it is possible the officer of the watch was fatigued, had poor night vision, or simply did not see the Ouzo if they collided. Indeed, there have been many prior incidents of small sailing vessels colliding with large vessels and the incident going entirely unnoticed by the officer of the watch. Further, more accurate simulation also shifted the initial point of entry into the water of the bodies away from the Bilbao incident. \n\n# Conclusions\n\nAfter hearing the evidence, the jury decided there was simply not enough evidence to convict Mr Hubble. The only evidence making the Ouzo the yacht encountered by Pride of Bilbao was circumstantial, with no concrete evidence the two had even made physical contact. The lack of debris or wreck also complicated matters, as it is entirely possible the yacht could have sunk for a reason other than collision, such as flooding or a possible butane explosion caused by the tanks stored onboard for cooking. Hubble was declared not guilty around a year after the loss of the Ouzo and the deaths of her crew members. \n\nJames Meaby, Jason Downer and Rupert Sanders were all described by their families as having a ‘zest for life, following testing professional careers along with a love for sports, including sailing. They were all competent, qualified sailors’ and are dearly missed. \n\nI was unable to find any information on Michael Hubble after the verdict, but I would assume he retired after and would be well into his 80’s today. \n\nThe Pride of Bilbao was eventually sold by P&O and changed hands several times, and at the time of writing currently sails as Moby Orli with the ferry company Moby Lines. She is 39 years old. \n\nCrescent Beaune has since been sold and renamed to LIBERTAD 6 and operates as a bunker barge Ecaudor. She is 20 years old. \n\nI hope this breakdown was understandable to those not involved in the maritime industry! I personally believe the Ouzo was swamped by the Pride of Bilbao’s wash or made contact with another vessel in the area. \n\n**Sources:**   \n[https://www.gov.uk/maib-reports/sinking-of-sailing-yacht-ouzo-after-encounter-with-ro-ro-passenger-ferry-pride-of-bilbao-off-isle-of-wight-england-with-loss-of-3-lives](https://www.gov.uk/maib-reports/sinking-of-sailing-yacht-ouzo-after-encounter-with-ro-ro-passenger-ferry-pride-of-bilbao-off-isle-of-wight-england-with-loss-of-3-lives)  \n  \n[https://6pumpcourt.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Bilbaofinal.pdf](https://6pumpcourt.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Bilbaofinal.pdf)\n\n[https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2006/sep/02/stevenmorris.uknews2](https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2006/sep/02/stevenmorris.uknews2)\n\n[https://www.kentonline.co.uk/kent/news/investigation-continues-into-yac-a25742/](https://www.kentonline.co.uk/kent/news/investigation-continues-into-yac-a25742/)",

      "text": "[Part 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/UnresolvedMysteries/comments/1j7cjor/23yearold_mother_stacy_peterson_disappeared_oct/) | Part 2 \n\nWhen police arrived the next morning, Drew's story was that he got home the morning of the 28th, after his shift, and briefly talked to Stacy. She told him she was visiting her father later in the morning. When he woke about 10, she was gone. He called off work for that night to use up some of his sick time prior to retirement. The day was spent at home and doing errands. At 9 p.m., Stacy had called him to say she was leaving with another man, and her car was at Clow Airport (small airfield near the Petersons' house). He went out searching for her, returning about 11 p.m. Later he walked to Clow Airport to pick up her car. Police searched the house and Drew's car, but he would not let them search Stacy's car.  \n\nOn Oct. 30, Thomas Morphey came into the picture. Thomas was Drew's step-brother. He suffered from bipolar disorder and alcoholism. He was usually hard-up and Drew had frequently helped him with money and gotten him jobs. On this day, police had a visit from Walter Martinek and Sheryl Alcox. Sheryl was Thomas's partner; Walter was a friend of Thomas. They told police that Thomas had a story about helping Drew to move what he thought might be Stacy's body from his house to his car. Thomas, in remorse, had overdosed on pills and alcohol, and was currently in the hospital. \n\nThomas was interviewed by Will County State's Attorney James Glasgow, and offered immunity for his testimony. Here is Thomas's story:  \n\nOn Oct. 27, Thomas got a call from Drew asking to meet. They went to a local park, and Drew told Thomas that Stacy was cheating on him, and he had to take care of it.  He asked if Thomas loved him enough to kill for him. Thomas said he couldn't live with himself. He then asked if Thomas could live with knowing about it. Thomas said yes. They went to a storage facility and Thomas was to rent a unit. But he didn't have ID on him, so they had to go home. Later, Thomas called Drew and said he couldn't be involved in whatever Drew was planning.  \n\nOn Oct. 28, Drew took Thomas for coffee (caught on camera) and to a park, where he asked Thomas to hold his phone and wait. He said not to answer the phone no matter what. Then he left. The phone rang around 9 p.m. with “Stacy Cell” on the caller ID. Drew was gone for about two hours, and then asked Thomas to help him move something out of the house. They went to the Petersons' bedroom and picked up a large container. Most accounts say it was a blue plastic barrel, but contemporary newspaper accounts say it was a rectangular container. They moved it from the house to Drew's SUV. Thomas said it weighed about 120 pounds and was warm to the touch. Drew gave Thomas cash and told him “This never happened.” \n\nAfterward, Thomas had qualms. He went to see his friend Walter and blurted out that he may have just helped dispose of Stacy's body. He had been drinking heavily and continued drinking at home.\nOn the 29th, he called Drew and said he wanted to hang himself.  Later that night, he started drinking again and took several Xanax. He overdosed and woke up in the hospital. \n\nWhen police next visited the Peterson residence on Nov. 1, they had warrants for the house and both cars. They took computers and 11 guns from the house. In even worse news for Drew, Stacy's disappearance had caused the State's Attorney's office to reopen the Kathleen Savio case.  At a grand jury convened Nov. 7, Drew took the fifth amendment. Two days later, police named him as a suspect in Stacy's disappearance. Around this time, Rev. Neil Schori also spoke to police about what Stacy had told him about Kathleen Savio's death.  \n\nDrew resigned from the Bolingbrook Police on Nov. 12, thus avoiding an internal affairs investigation unrelated to Stacy's disappearance. In a few weeks, he would have reached his thirtieth anniversary. \n\nKathleen's family were overjoyed that Kathleen's case would be reviewed. Her remains were exhumed on Nov. 13. The family hired Dr. Michael Baden, renowned New York medical examiner, to perform an autopsy. Both his and the state's medical examiner agreed that the cause of death was drowning during a struggle, manner of death homicide. \n\nMeanwhile searches had been going on for Stacy. Texas EquuSearch, national search company was involved, and the FBI joined the search by the end of November. One area police targeted was the Sanitary and Ship Canal around Romeoville (town south of Bolingbrook). One reason for this was that Scott Rossetto lived nearby, and Stacy's phone had pinged in the area on Oct. 28. Police reasoned that Drew might have disposed of the body near Scott's residence to throw suspicion on him. Police searched the ground around the canal, also using aerial photography and dogs. They searched the canal waters using hi-res camera equipment,  but they didn't find any remains. Inspite of many volunteers, none of the searches turned up anything. Drew continued to maintain that Stacy had left and was in Jamaica or somewhere similar. Friends and family didn't believe this. First, because some of them knew about his threats to Stacy. Second, because they said she would never have left the children. And last, because they couldn't believe that possessive, jealous Drew Peterson would be so nonchalant about Stacy leaving him for another man. \n\nThe story of a cop whose young wife had disappeared, and whose previous wife had died in suspicious circumstances, soon went national. Media descended on Peterson's house, at first to his dismay. He sent the children to stay with his family. After that, he started to bask in the media attention, making wisecracks and talking to anyone with a microphone. One interviewer, Shepard Smith, got him riled by asking about neighbors seeing him carrying a barrel out of his house. The interview was quickly cut short. \n\nDrew appeared on television programs like Larry King Live and The Today Show, where he put out a call for a defense lawyer. The call was answered by Chicago attorney Joel Brodsky, a publicity hound to rival Drew. The two made the rounds of TV and radio shows. Drew maintained his innocence and said things like Stacy wanted to divorce him every month based on her menstrual cycle. He said she always liked the attention of men. His callous attitude had its peak when he and Brodsky called in to a Chicago radio show and a Dating Game segment was proposed. Apparently a segment was actually recorded, with Drew asking the contestants questions like “Do you take baths or showers?” Fortunately for all, higher-ups at the station put a stop to the segment.  \n\nThe fun and games came to an end on May 7, 2009, when Drew was arrested and charged with the murder of Kathleen Savio. He pleaded not guilty. His bail was set at $20 million. \n\nIn 2008 a new law was passed by the Illinois legislature, which was nicknamed “Drew's Law.” Essentially it allowed the introduction of hearsay testimony into evidence if it could be shown by preponderance of the evidence that the defendant killed the witness to prevent them from testifying. This would allow statements from Kathleen and Stacy to be admissible. Since the case against Drew was circumstantial, their words would significantly affect the strength of the prosecution case. An evidentiary hearing was held before the actual trial to determine which statements would be admissible. Drew's lawyers tried to get this hearing closed, but the judge ruled that it would be open to the public. Among the witnesses who testified at this hearing and not at the full trial were Vicki Connolly, Thomas Morphew, and Sharon Bychowski. Sharon tearfully told of finding Stacy crying out in front of the house after she had told Drew she was divorcing him. She told Stacy to write down all the things she was telling Sharon about Drew. Stacy replied, “It doesn't matter. He'll kill me. I'm already dead.” The statements were ruled inadmissible, and the prosecution took their case to the Illinois Supreme Court, which ordered the lower court to reconsider allowing 8 out of 14 statements. The Appellate Court reversed their decision on 8 statements. Ironically, the basis of the reversal was that a common law exception to the hearsay rules, which was broader in scope, took precedence over the legislative rule, the restrictions of which had cause these 8 statements to be excluded. In other words, Drew's Law ultimately wasn't what allowed the hearsay statements to be allowed. These procedures as well as other filings occupied most of 2010 and 2011. Trial was set for July 23, 2012, and opening arguments started on July 31 before a jury of 7 men and 5 women.\n\nAmong the witnesses at trial were the divorce attorney whom Stacy had consulted, two of Drew's sons, Kathleen's sister, Rev. Schori, and Jeff Pachter, who worked with Drew at a cable company. Jeff testified that Drew had offered him $25,000 to find someone to “take care of” Kathleen. Jeff thought he was joking.  Months later, Drew told him he didn't need that job done. Drew himself never took the stand. \t\n\nThe jury started deliberations on Sept. 5, and on Sept. 6, Drew was found guilty of first degree murder. He was later sentenced to 38 years in prison and would be eligible for parole in 2047. Allowed to speak to the court, Drew made a statement ending with a loud outburst of “I did not kill Kathleen!”  \n\nHe was sent to Menard Correctional Center in downstate Chester, Illinois. While there, in 2014, Drew got friendly with another inmate, a former gang member, and offered him $10,000 to arrange a hit on State's Attorney James Glasgow. The inmate went to the police and made a deal to wear a wire. Peterson made incriminating statements that were caught on wire, including how if he could get booze into the prison, they'd celebrate when the hit was brought off.  He was charged and ultimately convicted of solicitation of murder for hire. It took the jury only an hour to reach a verdict. This added 40 years to his sentence, to be served consecutively.  \n\nDrew's team filed for a new trial on the basis of ineffective assistance of counsel and conflict of interest by his attorney Brodsky. It was denied. In 2014, his defense filed an appeal. The conviction was upheld at the Appellate and State Supreme Court levels. However, he has still not given up. As of 2024, he is seeking a new trial on grounds that his attorney did not allow him to speak in his own defense.  \n\nDrew's son Stephen, who suffered from anxiety and substance abuse problems after losing his law enforcement job for accepting firearms and $200,000 from his father during the investigation, moved into the Bolingbrook house and has raised the Peterson children. Stephen staunchly defended Drew for a long time, but has stated that he believes his father probably killed both Kathleen and Stacy.  \n\nI previously stated that “Drew's Law” was repealed. Apparently this is not so. As mentioned above, in the end, it didn't come into play, as other exceptions were used to permit the introduction of the 8 statements that were originally excluded. Jurors said the hearsay statements, especially from the divorce lawyer, were a major factor in arriving at a guilty verdict.  \n\nAfter all this, Stacy's body has never been found, and although she is presumed dead, no one has been charged with her murder. Her sister Cassandra has not given up. Cassandra feels the police searches of the canal were done poorly. She believes she found a full body at the bottom of the canal within weeks of Stacy's disappearance, and has followed its course as it move down the channel.  In 2021, she said she found what looks to be a skull. Police were informed, but they waited 5 months before performing another search with sonar and hi-res cameras. They said the area was clear and the only thing found was a rock. Cassandra made a public statement about this in 2024. She is trying to raise funds to have divers perform a search using a hand-held sonar HD device, but the cost is over $100,000 for equipment rental and training of the dive team. She says she is not giving up. As she says, if it is not Stacy, it is someone else who deserves to get their identity back. [Photo of the canal bed where alleged skull was seen; may be disturbing](https://www.courttv.com/news/stacy-petersons-sister-believes-her-remains-have-been-found/)  \n\nIn 2022, Drew's former layer Joel Brodsky gave an interview where he hinted that he might tell what he knows about Stacy.  \n“I know everything about both of his wives – everything,” Brodsky said. “I feel bad about Drew still not taking responsibility and Stacy still being missing.  I’m thinking about maybe revealing what happened to Stacy and where she is.”  \n\nBrodsky was not practicing at the time and had come off a two-year suspension of his law license, which he felt was unfair. The judge from his initial trial ordered him not to reveal anything, but he suggested he might continue to pursue the option. In 2024, he was charged with violating the gag order during an interview on NewsNation.    \n\nLike most people, I believe Stacy is dead. She would have contacted someone if she were still alive. Sightings were reported in the early years – she was seen in Peoria, in Thailand. None were reliable reports. It is almost certain that Drew is responsible for Stacy's disappearance. He had means, motive, and opportunity. Besides the machismo of not wanting to let Stacy leave him, she knew he had killed Kathleen. No one else who was suspected had any real motive. But he is not confessing anything. He says he wouldn't want his children to think he killed their mothers. He says Stacy ran away just like her mother did. Finding Stacy's body would be of material help in building a case against him. Even though Drew Peterson isn't ever getting out of jail, and an additional sentence wouldn't change his circumstances, Stacy deserves justice, and her family deserve to lay her to rest. \n\n[Part 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/UnresolvedMysteries/comments/1j7cjor/23yearold_mother_stacy_peterson_disappeared_oct/)  \n\nSources  \n\nThere is so much about this case online; much more than a write-up can cover.

      "title": "In 1977, Trenton State College student Sigrid Stevenson was pursing her Master's Degree. Sigrid was a talented pianist, who often snuck into Kendall Hall to play piano after hours. On Sept. 4, a security guard entered the hall and found Sigrid's badly beaten body. Who killed Sigrid Stevenson?",
      "text": "[Sigrid Miller Stevenson](https://imgur.com/a/pQcZaTx) was born to her parents Peter and Barbara Stevenson on January 24, 1952, in Alameda county, California. Sigrid was the first child born to the couple, and she was raised along her younger sister Sylvia in Livermore, California, 40 miles east of San Francisco. Sigrid’s father, who was a lieutenant in the Marine Corps and went on to be a nuclear chemist, had a love for music, which he happily passed onto his young daughter. Peter taught Sigrid how to play the guitar at a young age, which sparked a love for music and the arts, just like her father had, and she would take this passion and move onto the instrument she would come to love the most: the piano. Sigrid began to take piano lessons at an early age and that talent developed and blossomed into her deepest passion, and something that she would continue with for the rest of her life. In Sigrid’s school years, she would perform in piano recitals and volunteered for the school’s drama department, playing the piano in the school plays. This love of the arts wasn’t just restricted to the piano, however, as Sigrid also was a writer as well as a medium artist.  Sigrid, or “Siggy,” as she was called by friends, stated that Sigrid was fiercely independent, a free thinker, and a bit of an introvert. Though she had many friends, Sigrid was known to keep people at arm’s length, and much more preferred to spend time on her own. One of Sigrid’s favorite activities was to take long walks by herself in the scenic spots of Livermore, where she would find somewhere secluded, sit down, and either write in her journal, or sketch. Her teachers at Livermore High School described Sigrid as unique, artistic, eccentric, and one professor even went as far as to call her “weird.” While Sigrid preferred to focus on the artistic side of life, she was also a very good student, and graduated from Livermore High School in the spring of 1970\n\n In the fall of 1970, Sigrid began attending classes at the University of California at Riverside, where she had wanted to pursue a degree in music and education. At the time, Sigrid’s main goal was to become a concert pianist, but this dream began to shift and change during her time at college. When Sigrid wasn’t attending classes at the college, she was teaching at her side job, where she taught the piano to special needs children, which sparked something inside of her. Sigrid had a deep love for children, and during her time teaching, she realized that she wanted to pursue a degree in education so she could become a music teacher. While away at college, Sigrid’s parents would often call her and try to persuade her to become more involved with college activities- whether it be making friends, going to dances, or even date- but, Sigrid had no interest in anything other than her love for music and pursing her passion in education. Fellow students said that Sigrid would practice the piano for hours every morning and every night, and if there was an unoccupied piano around, Sigrid was on it. Her peers had admired her passion for music and the arts, but they would also acknowledge that it was an obsession, and one that could not be derailed or broken.\n\nSigrid graduated from University of California at Riverside in 1974, when she was 22 years old. After graduation Sigrid, following her wanderlust, took some time to travel, when she wasn’t teaching children how to play the piano. In 1976, Sigrid made a life altering decision: She wanted to pursue her master’s degree in musical education, and she knew exactly where she wanted to study at. Sigrid applied to Trenton State in New Jersey, which was located forty miles northeast of Philadelphia. Sigrid had chosen this particular school because at the time, it was well known for being one of the best music instruction schools in the country. Sigrid enrolled at Trenton when she was 24 years old in the fall of 1976, where she was registered in advanced music classes as a graduate student. Sigrid did exceedingly well in her classes and managed to impress her professors in her studies and her gift in music, and things seemed to be going well for her. One sticking point for Sigrid was her relationship with her dorm roommate, who she didn’t seem to get along with, as her roommate found her to be bothersome. This roommate stated that Sigrid did a lot of solo travel and hitchhiking, which worried her, and that Sigrid seemed to be far too trusting and friendly with strangers.\n\n One of Sigrid’s favorite places to be on the Trenton campus was Kendall Hall, a theatre that was constructed in 1932 which housed two theatres, one larger and one smaller, offices, classrooms, and a costume shop. Sigrid would often ride her green bike to Kendall Hall and sneak into the building after it was already closed, in order to play the piano for as long as she liked. People who knew Sigrid stated that she would stay on the main stage of Kendall Hall playing the piano for hours, often times into the late hours of the night, or early hours of the morning, and then sleep underneath the stage or crash in the costume department. Kendall Hall was notorious for being easy to sneak into at the time, because the locks of the building didn’t lock properly, and security would routinely search the hall for students who may have snuck in there, and give them a fair but firm warning to leave. Sigrid herself was caught in Kendall Hall many times after hours, and she was ordered to go, much to her dismay.\n\nAfter Sigrid had completed her first year of schooling at Trenton State, Sigrid did a bit of travelling around, but it’s unknown exactly where these travels had taken her. After some time, Sigrid returned back to the area and began to rent a room with a Professor from Trenton until August of 1977, when she moved out. After this, she began to rent a room from in local firefighter’s home that he shared with his family, however, this man nor his family has ever been identified publicly. Things were looking good for Sigrid, as she had just gotten a job teaching music at Fisher Junior High and would be scheduled to start that fall. In her free time, Sigrid continued teaching music to special needs children and began singing in the choir at the local Presbyterian church. At the end of August, Sigrid, following the deep wanderlust in her soul, decided to take an extended hitchhiking trip throughout New England, through Canada, and as far as Nova Scotia. Though funds were limited, Sigrid kept her trip going by selling sketches of the landscapes she was visiting to locals in the area. When Sigrid returned to New Jersey on Friday, September 2, Sigrid suddenly found herself without any place to stay, as the firefighter and his family were out of town and their return had gotten delayed. With nowhere else to go, Sigrid began to sneak back into Kendall Hall and spend her evenings playing the piano before sleeping in the costume room once again.\n\nClasses were scheduled to begin on September 7, where over 5000 grad students were enrolled, but the week leading up to classes beginning, the campus was like a ghost town. The weekend prior to the start of the fall semester, only 50 students and staff members were on the campus grounds, and that number dwindled when Labor Day was beginning to approach. Over the summer, Kendall Hall was being used frequently, as local theatre groups would put on plays and the school’s theatre workshop used the stage, but the final play of the season was put on on Saturday, September 3^(rd). The play that day had 16 cast members, 30 people were in attendance in the audience, and a few of the cast members had personally invited Sigrid to be in the audience and watch the final production. Later, when speaking to police, many cast members had confirmed that Sigrid had attended, and afterwards she had joined the cast and crew downstairs in the basement dressing room for an after party. At the party, Sigrid had spent time talking to the cast members about the predicament of her host family being out of town, and how she would be sleeping at Kendall Hall for the next few nights. Sigrid left the party at 12:30 am and went to sleep in the costume shop, while the party continued. Before she went to sleep, Sigrid had written in her journal how annoyed she was that the cast members were being so loud when she wanted to turn in for the night, and how she wanted to wake up early and leave the building before she was caught by security who make their patrol of the hall around 11 am. Sigrid wrote about how she was nervous about being caught, because she had already been warned numerous times by security in the past about sleeping in the building.\n\n Sigrid was spotted the next day in the afternoon, where an acquaintance had seen her at a movie theatre about 15 miles away from Trenton State. It’s never been verified which movie theatre this actually was, however, that was the last confirmed sighting of the 25 year old. At 11:30 pm on Sunday night, 22 year old security guard Thomas Kokotajilo was doing his normal round around the campus, and as he approached the south entrance of Kendall hall, he saw a familiar sight: a green bicycle parked in the bike rack outside the doors. This caught Thomas’ attention as the building should have been completely unoccupied at that time of night, so Thomas made his way around to the front entrance, assuming he would come upon a student trespasser inside and need to escort them out. The front entrance was locked, Thomas took out his keys and opened the doors and made his way inside the dark building. All the lights were off except for the red lights of the emergency exit signs that lit up the hallway, and he recalled having a very eerie feeling as he travelled down the hallways towards the main stage entrance. As he approached the stage, Thomas spotted what looked to be a white canvas sheet lying in the middle of the stage next to the piano, surrounded by pools of blood. Thomas climbed onto the stage, and using his flashlight, he could see that underneath the sheet was a nude human body. He drew his weapon fearing the killer was still inside and called for backup. When authorities arrived, they discovered that the body was of a woman, and she had been hit about the head, with the damage to her face being so extensive that they could not immediately identify her by features alone. The woman’s head had been covered by either her own blood-soaked shirt, with police theorizing this might have been done to muffle her screams, and some reports state that her wrists had at one point been bound. Blood was everywhere, from the floors, to the piano and music sheets, and there had been a trail of blood from the piano to where the body was left in the middle of the stage, as if she had been dragged to that spot. The bottoms of the woman’s feet were bloody and caked with mud.\n\n At the scene, the police collected a few of the woman’s personal effects, and through this, they were able to identify her as Sigrid Stevenson. They found her backpack which contained her journal, sketchbook, and a large amount of clothing. Inside the backpack they also found her wallet which held Sigrid’s ID, $7 in cash, and a handful of traveler’s checks, and a can of beans. Due to the money and the traveler’s checks being left at the scene, a robbery gone wrong was quickly ruled out. Dr. Stanley Austin, the supervisor of the graduate music program, was brought in as a second confirmation that the woman lying dead on the stage was in fact Sigrid Stevenson, according to the ID, but he was only able to identify her as Sigrid based on her hair, as the damage done to her face was too extensive.\n\nThe murder weapon, which has only ever been described as a blunt instrument, was missing from the scene, and authorities speculated that it could have been a heavy piece of wood that had been under the piano to balance it, as it was missing after the murder. They believed that Sigrid had been playing the piano when the attacker snuck up behind her, surprising her. Unfortunately, no evidence leading to who the killer might be was left behind at the scene: surprisingly, there were no fingerprints, footprints, fibers, or hair left behind.\n\nPolice read through every entry of Sigrid’s diary, and while they acknowledged it as thorough and well written, none of the entries had provided any clues as to who may have wanted to harm Sigrid. They turned to faculty and staff in order to see if they had any information about what may have happened, and Dr. Stanley Austin told them a very important piece of information: that they white canvas sheet covering Sigrid was a piano cover, and it hadn’t belonged to the piano that Sigrid was playing that night. In fact, it hadn’t belonged in that building, at all. The piano Sigrid was playing was old and essentially worthless, so they didn’t feel the need to cover it, however, a $10,000 piano located in Bray Hall across campus had a white canvas piano cover, and Dr. Austin confirmed that the cover lain across Sigrid’s body was the one from Bray Hall. Another staff member came forward to state that he had seen the white cover on the $10,000 piano only a week prior. Unlike Kendall Hall, Bray Hall was newer and had functioning locks, and in order to get into the concert hall where the cover had been, one would need exactly three keys to enter. One key to enter Bray Hall, another key to enter the concert hall, and a final key to get into Kendall Hall. There were no windows at Bray Hall that one could break and enter the building. The question was who had all three keys in order to enter and retrieve the piano cover? And why? Police theorized that the killer had retrieved the piano cover in order to use it to remove Sigrid’s body, but had changed his mind.\n\nDr. Austin had only two keys, and the janitors on staff also only had two keys. The only people in possession of all three keys were the 12 campus police officers and the 7 security officers. Dr. Austin was adamant that no one could enter Bray Hall without a key, and stated to authorities:\n\n> *“Believe me, if there was a way that anyone could have gotten access to the concert room and the piano, Sigrid would have found it.”*\n\nCampus law enforcement was being looked at closely, for two reasons. One, for the fact that they were the only ones who had all three keys in order to get the piano cover, and two, because the marks around Sigrid’s wrists that had left a deep symmetrical furrow appeared to possibly be from handcuffs. Behind Sigrid’s back were two arm width spots free from blood, which some investigators feel could have been due to her being handcuffed from behind. Ewing township police ordered that all members of the campus police and security, as well as all officers from Ewing township themselves, turn in their handcuffs and batons for testing, to see if any trace evidence such as blood could be found. They did find blood on one pair of handcuffs from one officer, but it was determined to have from an arrest incident prior to Sigrid’s murder.  Many officers were given polygraph tests, and a handful came back as inconclusive, while the rest came back as truthful. The two officers on duty at Trenton the night of the murder participated in the polygraphs, and both had passed. However, one of the officers on duty that day later was speaking to another officer in the locker room at the police station and this man told the other officer that he had killed Sigrid. The officer that this was told to thought he was kidding, but following his duties, he went to the detectives on the case and reported what he had heard. This officer who had claimed to have been involved in the murder had incidents come to light that he had been drinking a lot and had gone to parties often where he had been harassing women. When spoken to, the officer stated that he hadn’t ever met or spoken to Sigrid, and they hadn’t pressed him further.\n\nWhile police were beginning their investigation, Sigrid’s body was taken to the Mercer County Medical office for an autopsy. There they discovered the extent of her wounds: she had suffered multiple lacerations to the face and scalp, and had a fractured skull. In total, Sigrid had 15 deep scalp wounds, and her cause of death were blood clots due to the excessive bleeding. In addition, Sigrid had two broken ribs, a broken nose, and bruising on her chest and elbows. They performed a vaginal swab on Sigrid, which showed that there were sperm cells present, but there were dead heads of sperm, and this indicated that she most likely had been sexually assaulted. They estimated Sigrid’s time of death to be anywhere between 7:30 to 10 pm.\n\nAuthorities began to interview friends and acquaintances of Sigrid, to dive deeper into her life and background, however, very few people had any insight to share. Dr. Austin had told the police that he knew Sigrid decently well, and all the time he had known her she had never expressed to him any worries about her safety or wellbeing. Police were quick to interview the cast of the play as well as all those who had attended the play on the day of her death. Still, no one was able to offer much. However, a man by the name of Sydney Porcelain came forward, stating that he may be able to help. Sydney was a part of the cast of the play and had loosely known Sigrid, as he had met her the prior July during play rehearsals and had been impressed by her talents on the piano. Sydney had asked Sigrid if she would play the piano for some songs he had wanted to record, and she had agreed, however, she had left town for her hitchhiking vacation shortly afterward and hadn’t had a chance to follow through. Sydney had stated that Sigrid was very friendly and had often told her business to anyone and everyone, and he could understand how she would be “taken advantage of” and how she was “the natural victim type.”\n\n Sydney went on to tell investigators that he was a self-proclaimed psychic, and that he had even helped the police in prior cases using his psychic skill. He had assisted the police in the John List case at one point, but he got his “visions” embarrassingly wrong. He had told authorities in the List case how John was dead and somewhere nearby, but as it turned out, John was alive and well and later arrested for the murders of his entire family.\n\n During questioning for Sigrid’s murder, Sydney did produce an alibi, and had offered his “psychic services” in the case, and surprisingly, authorities agreed. He asked to hold Sigrid’s personal possessions in order to pick up “vibrations” from them, and police offered him her backpack. They literally handed over their physical evidence to be touched by someone they were questioning. Sydney held the backpack and stated that he had no prior knowledge of the killing, which seemed impossible, as the facts of the cases were reported on heavily in the papers at the time, but claimed that he sensed she had met a violent death by being beaten and that he kept seeing the letter “S” in his mind. He stated that he couldn’t be sure if the letter S referred to the killer or Sigrid herself. He went on to say that the killer was someone who worked with wire, and that on the day of Sigrid’s death he had a bad “premonition,” but he hadn’t known what it meant, and didn’t elaborate further.\n\n Another cast member of the play was interviewed, and she stated that she had seen Sigrid on the day of the play and had spoken to her. She claimed that during the first act of the play, Sigrid was in good spirits and was happy and vivacious, but later, after the play was over, Sigrid’s mood had soured and she seemed to be feeling down. Sigrid told the woman that she had gotten into an argument with a man, and that she more or less had “lost the argument.” It couldn’t be determined who this man was who had argued with Sigrid, but it is believed that he was a member of the cast or crew of the play.\n\n A member of the play named Chuck came on police’s radar years after the murder, and he was seriously considered as a suspect. Chuck’s role in the play was of a police officer, and part of his costume was handcuffs and a baton, which had never been taken in for testing around the time of Sigrid’s death. However, when Sigrid’s personal belongings were inventoried, they discovered a playbill, and inside the playbill under the names of cast and crew, Chuck’s name was circled, and underneath she had written “nice man, gave me a beer.” It is known that Chuck and Sigrid had at least one prior interaction with one another. When the cast was getting ready for the play one evening, chuck had walked into the dressing room Sigrid had been sleeping in, and when he entered, he startled her awake. The two had a lengthy conversation, however, police don’t know the nature of the conversation or what was said. Some officers had wondered if the man that Sigrid had a confrontation with on the last night she was alive could have been Chuck.\n\n In 2011, an ex-girlfriend of Chuck’s came forward claiming that she believed he had something to do with the murder in 1977. This ex-girlfriend claimed that when she had dated Chuck in the 1980’s he had been incredibly abusive towards her, and one night after a particularly brutal beating, chuck had said to her that he could “kill her and get away with it, because I’ve done it before.” However, Chuck had passed a polygraph around the time of the murder. Furthermore, around the time of this claim, investigators were still working on the case of Sigrid’s murder, and had recovered a partial DNA from the vaginal swabs from the autopsy. This DNA wasn’t enough to test against any suspect profile, however, but, they had another idea. They unknotted the knots in the blouse that had been tied around Sigrid’s head, and they were able to gather a better DNA profile from skin cells left behind. As this was going on, Chuck happened to die in 2016, and eager to get a sample of his DNA to test against, they had to think fast. Authorities contacted Chuck’s brother to see if they could run the DNA profile against his own DNA, and he had agreed. When the results came back, the sample from the knots did not match Chuck and he was quickly ruled out as a suspect.\n\n In recent years, other suspects have come to the forefront of the investigation. Namely, two suspects who happened to work for Trenton State College. One was a lighting technician, whose mood had abruptly changed after the murder. He is being considered for a handful of reasons: one, being that when Sigrid was playing the piano the night that she died, the lights of the stage must have been turned on for her to see the keys of the piano and read her sheet music. When her body was found, all the lights had been turned off, and only an experienced lighting technician would have been able to work the lights in the theatre as they were complex. Two, because he had the keys to the theatres, and when he was initially interviewed and asked about the keys, he had claimed that he didn’t believe he had them. When police reminded him that he did in fact have keys to the building as part of his job, he suddenly remembered having them, and handed them over to authorities. This man was also polygraphed, and passed, and he had provided a statement to police. While he was initially ruled out as a suspect due to passing the polygraph, detectives in recent years aren’t so keen to disregard him and would like him to be reinterviewed again.\n\n Another possible suspect being considered as a good candidate as the killer was a maintenance worker for Trenton State College in 1977. He also had keys to the building, and he was known to have frequent interactions with Sigrid and had often let her into the building after hours to sleep or play the piano. He had been spotted with Sigrid many times in the months leading up to the murder, by both students and campus police officers alike. When investigators searched through Sigrid’s belongings shortly after her death, they had discovered his name, address, and phone number written down in her diary, and it was believed the two had some form of a relationship, though the nature of the relationship is unknown. Soon after Sigrid was killed, the maintenance worker, who was known to have substance abuse problems, was fired from Trenton, and shortly after was admitted to a detox program. While he also was polygraphed and passed, he was not investigated thoroughly back in the 1970’s, and recent detectives would like to investigate this man further.\n\n Sigrid Miller Stevenson was laid to rest in Princeton Cemetery, under a headstone with the simple inscription that read: “Sigrid M Stevenson, 1952-1977.” In the aftermath of her death, an entry was placed in the school yearbook to memorialize her, however, sadly, her name was misspelled. A scholarship in her name was also put into effect, but it doesn’t seem to exist anymore. It seems like Trenton State College more or less forgot Sigrid, with her murder transforming from a real-life story of an innocent brutally murdered woman taken to soon, to a sort of vague ghost story told year after year about a haunted theatre and eerie happenings within the Kendall Hall building. Each year the story changes a little bit more, and new students who hear the tale of the haunted theatre no longer even associated it with a living, breathing, human who had died at the hands of a heartless perpetrator, but rather a tale to share to spook their friends and peers. It’s been 47 years since Sigrid was murdered, and she has never received the justice that she deserves.\n\n  \n**Links**\n\n[Find a Grave](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/246353061/sigrid\\_miller-stevenson)\n\n[New Jersey.com](https://www.nj.com/mercer/2024/09/cold-case-squad-investigating-perplexing-1977-murder-of-nj-grad-student-sources-say.html)",

      "title": "Missing In Delaware: Who kidnapped Nefertiti \"Neffie\" Trader in 2014? Where is she now and what became of her car?",
      "text": "This is one of Delaware's more recent missing person's cases that has grown cold. It was covered on this sub about 4/5 years ago. It still remains unsolved and it really feels like a lot of information is missing for the public's consumption in perhaps finding out who kidnapped her and dragged her from her front porch that summer night in June.\n\nNefertiri Trader was a 33 year old mother of 3 children ages 8, 12 and 18 in 2014. She worked in the housekeeping department of Christiana Hospital at that time. She lived in New Castle Delaware in the Saddlebrook area described as just off of Christiana road. So it sounds like she lived fairly close to her place of employment.\n\nNefertiri was the oldest of her siblings and \"Neffie\" was the nickname given to her from her friends and family. She was described as a loving mother who worked hard and provided for her family.\n\nOn June 29th 2014 Neffie was supposed to get off work at 6p.m. and arrive home shortly after. But when her mother, Denise Trader arrived there that evening expecting to see Nefertiri she found a troubling and bizarre scene. \n\nOn the front porch of her daughter's home there was a pack of cigarettes and a coffee. There was an unopened condom on a chair on the front porch and Neffie's flip flops were by the front door. A loaf of bread layed out in the front yard and it had been stepped on. Nefertiri's car, a 2000 Acura RL with the Delaware license plate 404893 was not in the yard and the house was deserted. Denise contacted the police and reported her daughter missing.\n\nWhen Law enforcement canvassed the area on June 30th they discovered a key witness. This witness lived somewhat adjacent and across from Nefertiri's home, and on a second floor. This witness looked outside at 4:00 a.m. (some reports say the witness heard a scream first and this is why they looked out the window) and witnessed a man dragging a woman to a car and putting her into the backseat. The witness stated they initially did not call police because they thought perhaps this man was taking this woman to the hospital...? The woman was then identified as Nefertiri. The witness account varies very much from source to source. \n\nI want to say that all the sources information seems to lack key elements. Maybe I am wrong and did not dig far enough or know which source was most accurate but there is almost NO description of the man dragging her to the car. In one source I thought I had read of him described that he perhaps had on sweatpants, but before posting this evening when I looked for that link again I could not find that particular description. Still no mention of how tall he was or how short he was what race he was, what kind of hair he had, etc. \nNefertiri Trader nor her car that she was dragged into have ever been seen again. \n\nA couple of the sources seem to agree that Neffie was in the habit of frequenting a nearby 7-11 convenience store, her mother had most likely stated this, and reportedly on the morning she was abducted she had just come back from that 7-11 getting her cigarettes and coffee (maybe even that bread) found on scene. It is believed she was abducted shortly after arriving home when the witness then saw the abduction.\n\nIn 2017 the announced that they deemed Nefertiri most likely deceased. A reward of  a combination of up to 30,000 dollars with the FBI offering a $20,000 reward for information that leads to any arrests and the county Police Department is offering $10,000. But as of this time no one has come forward, almost 11 years later and her children and family still have no answers.\n\nhttps://charleyproject.org/case/nefertiri-trader\n\nhttps://www.doenetwork.org/cases/4624dfde.html\n\nhttps://www.google.com/amp/s/www.nbcphiladelphia.com/news/local/nefertiri-trader-missing-persons-new-castle-delaware/116307/%3famp=1\n\nhttps://6abc.com/delaware-news-new-castle-missing-woman-nefertiri-trader/1824488/\n\nThe Doe Network mentions a pending court case shortly before Neffie disappeared where she was perhaps a witness. There was a lot of dodgy details about this as well. But foul play is suspected in her case.\n\nExcept in every interview with Denise Trader that I saw she will never give up hope that her daughter Nefertiri is alive, and believes her daughter may someday come home to her loved ones. I hope that someday they do get the answers they seek.\n\nThe New Castle Police Department is investigating at 302-395-2781\n\nEditing this to add that I do realize after the fact that unfortunately my phone autocorrected her name several times and I am not able to change it in the title but did change it everywhere within the write-up. The correct spelling of her name is Nefertiri.",

      "text": "# Theresa Elizabeth Insana\n\nTheresa Insana was born in Niagara Falls, New York, on January 20, 1978, to Joe and Ann-Marie Insana. Like many teenage girls, she loved beauty and fashion, shopping, dance, and Starbucks; her favorite treat was Swedish Fish. She graduated from Niagara Falls High School in 1996 and was in the Top 10 of her class and a cheerleader, as well as a member of the Honor Society, Key Club, and Ski Club.  After high school, Theresa studied Psychology at State University of New York (SUNY) Binghamton where she continued cheerleading and became a member of the Delta Phi Upsilon Sorority. She graduated in 2000 and moved back home to Niagara Falls to figure out next steps of her life.\n\n# Las Vegas and Jeff Fenton\n\nTheresa decided to move to Las Vegas with one of her best friends.. They found a 2-bedroom apartment and began working right away. After working briefly at an accessories store, Theresa worked at Harrah’s Casino as a sales rep. She was later promoted to a sales job at the Rio Hotel and Casino and it was here, where she met Jeff Fenton, a market analyst for Caesars Entertainment (the parent company for the Rio).\n\nJeff and Theresa’s romance blossomed. They started dating in 2002. After three months of dating, they were engaged and living together. Unfortunately, their April 2004 wedding was called off just five weeks before their intended nuptials. While initial reports say Jeff was the one who called it off, subsequent interviews have indicated it was something Jeff did that could have made Theresa wanting to call off the wedding. \n\nIn July 2004, Theresa traveled back to Niagara Falls for the wedding of a friend. During her visit, Theresa contemplated moving back home and leaving Vegas behind. During these contemplations, the Rio offered her a promotion to Sales Manager and a raise. Proud of her career and excited to keep climbing the corporate ladder, Theresa accepted the promotion and after her friend’s wedding, Theresa flew back to Las Vegas.\n\n# Months before the murder\n\nIn the five months preceding her murder, Theresa told friends and co-workers that she felt like she was being followed, so much that she also wrote about these instances in her diary. When she came home, the TV would be on a different channel than the one she had left it on or the DVD player would be on. \n\nThe only people that had access to her house were Theresa herself, her best friend that she originally lived with, and her ex-fiancé, Jeff Fenton. Before Jeff and Theresa’s breakup, they got a dog together named Frankie (after Frank Sinatra). After their breakup, Theresa retained custody of the dog but would ask Jeff to dog sit and feed Frankie on occasion when she was out of town. Jeff’s new girlfriend, who also worked at the Rio with Jeff and Theresa, was not a fan of this happening and preferred Jeff had nothing to do with “that woman” (as she would refer to Theresa during a police interview).\n\n# Theresa's final moments\n\nOn Tuesday October 26, 2004, Theresa told a co-worker at the Rio that she and Jeff got into an argument that day. Theresa left work early at 4:30pm to go vote in the election at a local church. At 5:30pm, Theresa called her friend, leaving a voicemail saying she voted and would be heading home. At 5:45pm, Theresa called her mother to talk. She mentioned being tired, and told her mom she was going to eat her dinner (mac and cheese) and go to bed. They hang up at 6:30pm. This is the last time anyone hears from Theresa. At 7:30pm, a close family member calls Theresa, but no answer.\n\n# Disappearance\n\nOn October 27, 2004, Theresa didn’t show up to work. A co-worker of Theresa’s, stopped by her house and knocked. In police reports, the co-worker stated the house was completely dark and she did not hear Frankie (the dog) barking.\n\nOn the morning of October 28,  Theresa once again does not show up for work and her coworkers notify Jeff. Jeff, another male, and Theresa’s best friend go to Theresa’s house.\n\nJeff reportedly did not have a key and after realizing the front door was locked, they went over the wall into the backyard to the sliding glass door that was unlocked. After taking a few steps in the house, Jeff did not want to proceed or touch anything in case he “found something”. All three exited Theresa’s house and called 911.\n\nPolice arrived and found Theresa’s keys, cell phone, purse, wallet and Frankie (with dog feces all throughout) inside the house and her 4-door 2003 Hyundai Sonata in the garage, but no Theresa. Police decided to then contact homicide and began canvassing the neighbors as the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department (LVMPD) brought in bloodhounds and started a volunteer and mounted search party. Theresa’s parents were notified of Theresa’s disappearance and traveled to Las Vegas to help with the search.\n\n# Discovery of Theresa\n\nOn Monday November 1, 2004, while construction workers used an excavator to remove dirt and debris from a culvert, they discovered an unidentified and unfamiliar object, wrapped up in blankets and towels. After cutting open a small portion to see what it was, they called 911. Theresa had finally been found.\n\nTheresa’s body was found in standing water in a culvert 3.5 miles from her Summerlin house (Peace Way and Hualapai), near a golf course. Theresa’s parents were notified by the coroner’s office to verify Theresa’s tattoos (moon and stars on her left shoulder). Once verified, her father went to personally ID the body on the behalf of the family.\n\nAccording to autopsy reports, Theresa’s cause of death was ligature strangulation and blunt force trauma. She was also sexually assaulted and beaten all over her body with extensive injuries and lacerations to her face, torso, and genitalia, as well as a bloody nose, collapsed lungs, and hyoid bone fracture. Moreover, there were skin burns across her body signifying she had been dragged across the carpet. There were no broken bones, but there was bleeding in the brain and trachea. Autopsy reports further suggested that there weren’t any injuries consistent with a fall, indicating that she was carried down to the culvert instead of dumped.\n\n# Evidence\n\nTheresa’s car had blood on the right bumper and blood/mud was also found in the trunk. It was determined this was Theresa’s blood. The front seat was pushed all the way back and adjusted much lower than what Theresa would have needed to drive (she was 4’11”). Lastly, the garage door opener in her car was missing and the garage door light itself was unscrewed.\n\nInside the house, police found 2 spots of blood in Theresa’s downstairs half bathroom on the lower part of the mirror and baseboard behind the toilet. This DNA was confirmed NOT to be Theresa’s, but that of her killer’s. The bathroom mat, towel rack (pulled off the wall), and towels were gone; one of Theresa’s friends confirmed that those items were there 3 days before Theresa had disappeared.\n\nIn the kitchen, spray bottles and cleaning supplies were found on the countertop. The sliding door next to the kitchen was unlocked and glove prints from gardening gloves were found all over the sliding door, sink, light bulb in the garage and outer car door. Trash bags also had gardening glove prints, indicating the killer used bags for his cleanup.\n\nWhen discovered at the culvert, Theresa’s body was wrapped in a tan blanket heavily soiled with dirt and blood, and with pieces of duct tape (not Theresa’s) stuck to it. The blanket was secured with woven synthetic rope (also not Theresa’s) with a second portion tied off in knots and loops. Her face was covered in a blue piece of cloth and her body was wrapped with the blankets and towels that had gone missing from her bathroom. Blood on her matched the same blood from the bathroom mirror and baseboard. \n\nThe location of Theresa’s body was also of concern because it was not visible from the roadway, indicating that her killer was someone with knowledge of this culvert’s location. There were footprints found in the mud around her body, as well. The culvert was also near Theresa’s original house where she lived with her friend Melissa Maj when they first moved to Las Vegas.\n\nPolice ran the DNA from the blood found in the bathroom within the Combined DNA Index System (also known as CODIS), but did not get a match, indicating that whoever’s blood they discovered at the crime scene, that they had never had another run-in with the law (at least in the United States). While disheartening, the DNA analysis at least confirmed the unknown DNA belonged to a male.\n\nEvidence indicates this unknown male not only killed Theresa and drove her body to a culvert 3.5 miles away in her own car, but that he drove back to her house and cleaned up.\n\n# Investigation\n\nDuring the investigation, police interviewed and swabbed both Jeff Fenton and his then pregnant girlfriend. Although both showed inconsistencies in their polygraph exam, especially on the question “Did you cause Theresa’s death and did you know she was dead before her body was found”, DNA cleared both and with their alibi checking out; they were out shopping for a new car on the day Theresa was killed. It was here that the case would go cold until 2017. Jeff and his girlfriend would marry a month later.\n\nIn 2017, Parabon NanoLabs, a company that specializes in DNA Phenotyping, was able to scan the killer’s DNA and generate a photo of the killer, as well as list attributes of said person, such as their race/ethnicity. Per Parabon’s DNA testing, the person that killed Theresa is a male of most likely of Filipino descent (The composite profile states ancestry is “admixed South East Asian, European, and African descent.”).  \n\nHowever, since then, there have been no new leads. Theresa Insana’s case remains unsolved and cold.\n\n# Suspects\n\nBased off what we know (and since Jeff and girlfriend were cleared by police), current possible suspects are extremely limited. There is a possibility that someone was paid to kill Theresa, but there is no evidence to support this theory.\n\nBefore her death, Theresa mentioned being watched, being followed, someone knowing her routine enough to know when she would be home and having time to dispose of the body and clean. This may suggest a stalker that kept eyes on Theresa. \n\nBecause of the evidence including an unscrewed light bulb, cleaning supplies and location where Theresa was found, another possible scenario could be a serial killer. There are 6 cold case files similar to Theresa in the Las Vegas area from 1993 up to her death in 2004.\n\n# Questions\n\nJeff’s alibi was car shopping that day. Did they end up purchasing? Any test drives? Did they talk about purchasing a car with friends or loved ones? \n\nJeff had just dog sat Frankie, but did not have a house key at the time they went to go check on Theresa – why not? Why did it take two days for people to check in on Theresa, who was not the kind of person that would miss one, let alone two days of work, without notice? \n\nTheresa’s body was driven 3.5 miles away to a culvert with a hidden area operated by a construction company. Who was that company and who had the permits to that culvert?\n\nDo any of her friends or co-workers have any clues or remember a particular man hanging around? Are there any details Theresa mentioned that people have never mentioned to law enforcement because they felt they were unimportant?\n\n\\-----\n\n**Sources:**\n\n\\-Bartells, J., & Long, D.

      "text": "On November 19, 1978 18 year old Theresa Marcoux and 20 year old  Mark Harnish were found shot to death just outside of Mark's car on a pull off of US 5 in West Springfield, MA.  A fingerprint was found in blood on the passenger side of the window but was not able to be matched using AFIS.  There was not enough blood to run further tests.\n\n  \nIn October 2024 a tip was called into the Hampden County DA's office who named a suspect, Timothy Joley.  The caller claimed that a deceased friend told them Joley was the killer.  The DA was then able to ask Springfield, MA law enforcement for a copy of Joley's prints which they had on hand because Joley had applied for a taxicab license in the past.  The finger prints were found to match and Joley, who is now living in Clearwater, FL, was arrested and charged with the shootings on November 5, 2024.\n\n  \nI know I've read about this case on the subreddit in the past, but it was not one regularly talked about on the news until fairly recently with a push by the Hampden County DA to reinvigorate cold cases.  Goes to show the importance of keeping these very cold old cases in the news as people die, relationships change, etc. and time can produce new tips that can be verified with updated forensic techniques.  So keep posting and adding awareness to these old cases!\n\n[https://www.wwlp.com/news/local-news/hampden-county/hampden-district-attorney-gulluni-to-provide-updates-on-decades-old-homicide-case/](https://www.wwlp.com/news/local-news/hampden-county/hampden-district-attorney-gulluni-to-provide-updates-on-decades-old-homicide-case/)",

      "title": "[UPDATE] Arrest Made in Murder of Trudy Appleby, Last Seen Entering A Vehicle With Unidentified Man on August 21, 1996",
      "text": "Nearly 29 years to the day that Trudy Appleby, then 11 years old, disappeared from her hometown of Moline, Illinois, an arrest has finally been made. This Wednesday, a Henry County grand jury indicted Jamison A. \"Jamie\" Fisher, 50, on three counts of first degree murder and one count of concealment of homicide. Fisher has been accused of kidnapping, strangling, and concealing the death of the young girl.\n\nOn the day of her disappearance, Trudy was last seen wearing black biker shorts, white socks, and blue Nikes and was known to have been carrying a swimsuit and towel, and entering a gray four door sedan similar to a Chevrolet Celebrity (similar car seen [here](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chevrolet_Celebrity)). Police quickly suspected an abduction when they realized she had left the new clothes and $200 she had saved for a family vacation behind.\n\nThe prime suspect, William \"Ed\" Smith, was identified in 2017. Smith was a close friend of the family, and Trudy was known to have been close to one of Smith's grandchildren; he owned a boat on which Trudy was frequently invited as a guest along with the grandchildren. The morning of Trudy's disappearance, she had asked her father if she could go out swimming. Her father said no. A witness, alleged to be Smith's son-in-law, David Whipple (who was the second person of interest in the case and lived down the street from Smith), stated that Trudy had entered Smith's vehicle. This vehicle was scrapped 4 days following Trudy's disappearance. Smith reportedly exhibited odd behavior after Trudy's disappearance. The witness reported seeing Trudy as a passenger in Smith's vehicle in Campbell's Island, an island community connected to East Moline by bridge (seen [here](http://www.johnweeks.com/river_mississippi/pagesB/umissB21.html)). Whipple, who was convicted of sexually abusing a 10 year old girl in Rock Island County, refused to cooperate with authorities and died on August 1, 2022.\n\nJamison Fisher was named as the third person of interest in 2020. He was a close friend of the Smith family. The only living suspect in the case, in May 2021 Fisher was sentenced on an unrelated charge to two years of prison for auto theft; he was initially set to be released next year, 2026, prior to the grand jury hearing this past week. This week's charges are in direct contrast to what the Applebys initially believed: that Trudy accompanied the Smith family on the boat in defiance of his wishes, and that she drowned in an accident that was covered up.\n\nI highly recommend listening to Trudy's father's August 2017 interview with WQAD, cited in source 2 (it starts around the 22 minute mark). Not only is it emotional, but it provides insight into the families' relationships to one another as well as his suspicions on what happened that morning.\n\nTrudy's body has still not been recovered. If you have any information regarding the location of Trudy's remains, please contact the Moline Police Department at 309-797-0401.\n\n[Source 1](https://www.cbsnews.com/chicago/news/trudy-appleby-murder-1996-cold-case-jamison-fisher-arrest-moline/)\n\n[Source 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WU1lINajvk)\n\n[Source 3](https://charleyproject.org/case/trudy-leann-appleby)\n\n[Source 4](https://www.ourquadcities.com/news/local-news/breakthrough-in-appleby-case-reveals-checkered-pasts-of-men-possibly-involved/)\n\n[Source 5](https://www.schrodermortuary.com/obituaries/david-whipple)",

      "title": "In January 1954, the remains of a woman, identified as 32-year-old Mary Grimes Wallace, were discovered on a set of railroad tracks in Xenia, Ohio. When doubts were raised about the victim’s identity, authorities were unable to locate the victim’s body. What happened to Mary? ",
      "text": "Shortly before 8 a.m. on January 10, 1954, the Xenia, Ohio Police Department received a distressed call from the engineer of a westbound Pennsylvania Railroad locomotive. The engineer reported that as the train approached the Jasper Street crossing, he had observed a man hastily departing from the east side of the railway. Seconds later, he spotted a woman’s horribly disfigured body lying between the tracks. \n\nUpon arrival at the scene, officers discovered the deceased woman lying face down, next to the east bound set of railway tracks. Her injuries, including severe facial and skull trauma, as well as partial decapitation, were consistent with being struck by a train, however little blood was found at the scene. The coroner was unable to definitively determine the woman’s manner of death, listing it as either suicide or homicide.\n\nThe deceased woman was tentatively identified as 32-year-old Mary Grimes Wallace, an employee at a local supper club. Her father, Oliver Wallace, was summoned to the morgue for positive identification, however that proved challenging due to the significant facial trauma sustained by the victim. Ultimately, Oliver reluctantly agreed that the woman was most likely his daughter, Mary.\n\nInvestigators learned that Mary was married, but separated from her husband. He had recently abandoned her and their two young children, James and Butch, before relocating to Oklahoma. Facing insurmountable challenges in providing for the children alone, Mary made the difficult decision to relinquish their custody to the state. Subsequently, James and Butch were separated and placed in state operated orphanages. \n\nDuring the investigation detectives also learned Mary was dating a man named William Byrd. Neighbors reported that William, 46, oftentimes exhibited a volatile temper and had made repeated threats to kill Mary during these outbursts. These accounts were corroborated by Mary’s close acquaintances, who revealed that she had confided in them about her desire to end the relationship, while simultaneously expressing concerns for her personal safety if she did so. \n\nLaw enforcement promptly apprehended William and escorted him to the police station for questioning. During the interview, William denied any involvement in Mary’s death. He stated that he had last seen her briefly at approximately 3AM when she returned home from work, but claimed to have fallen asleep on the sofa, and awoken to detectives knocking on the door hours later. Lacking an alibi, William was detained on suspicion of murder and confined to the county jail. One month later, due to the lack of conclusive proof that Mary was murdered, and with nothing linking him to her death, William was released. \n\nDetectives uncovered one other potential lead during their investigation. Just nine days prior to her demise, Mary had apparently witnessed a homicide. Reports indicate that during a domestic dispute, an individual fatally shot their partner. While Mary was an eyewitness to the crime, the nature of her relationship, if any, with the individuals involved was never undisclosed. Unfortunately, this lead ultimately resulted in a dead end. \n\nMary was interred in Silvercreek Cemetery two days after the discovery of her body. Despite the coroner's inability to determine her manner of death, no autopsy was performed, and neither blood nor fingerprint samples were collected. The case was subsequently closed.\n\nFive years later, William Byrd unexpectedly paid a visit to the local police station to request a meeting with the Sheriff. William informed Sheriff Bradley of persistent rumors circulating within the community that Mary was, in fact, alive. William implored Sheriff Bradly to investigate these rumors to definitively clear his name in connection with her death. \n\nMary’s family also sought an audience with the Sheriff after hearing similar rumors. They relayed information from a close friend of Mary, now residing in Cincinnati, who claimed to have spoken with Mary recently. This friend reported that Mary was living in Cincinnati, married, and had told her, \"Remember, you never saw me,” when she spotted Mary at a local bar. \n\nAfter showing Mary’s family several post-mortem photographs of the deceased woman discovered on the railway tracks, all of them expressed their opinion that the deceased individual in the photographs was not Mary after all. With the deceased woman's identity now in question, Sheriff Bradley traveled to Cincinnati to investigate the reported sightings of Mary. \n\nThere, he met with her friend, who reiterated the account previously provided to the family, stating that Mary was living in the city and had instructed her friend to deny any knowledge of her whereabouts. During his search, Sheriff Bradley encountered several individuals in local establishments who claimed to recognize Mary, but, despite these possible leads, his efforts to locate her proved unsuccessful.\n\nSkeptical yet still determined to close the case, Bradly acquired a set of Mary’s  fingerprints from her previous employment records at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base. He hoped that despite the passage of time, fingerprint analysis would prove that the train victim was indeed Mary. \n\nThe exhumation of the presumed remains of Mary quickly commenced. However, upon opening the coffin designated by the gravestone inscribed with the last name “Grimes,” investigators discovered the remains of a different woman. Baffled by this discrepancy, they sought assistance from the church maintaining the burial records. Guided by these records, a second exhumation was conducted beneath a second stone also reading “Grimes.” Again, the remains of an individual other than Mary were found, this time a man. \n\nSuspecting Mary was buried in an unmarked grave, cemetery workers, equipped with steel rods, meticulously probed the surrounding empty plots. This systematic search led to the discovery of an unmarked coffin, and Mary’s family agreed it was the correct location. The dig resulted in finding a coffin consistent with the type Mary had been buried in, however, upon opening it, they were met with the remains of an unidentified male. Following the exhumation of the third incorrect body, investigators suspended their search. \n\nUnfortunately, despite their extensive efforts, the investigation failed to come to a definitive resolution. Mary was never seen again, however the location of her remains, if they were indeed Mary’s, is still unknown. \n\nMy sources for this case are severely limited. Below you will find my usual newspaper clippings related to the incident, however, I failed to locate even one single photo of Mary. The second link directs you to the cemetery where Mary’s remains were purportedly interred, but for obvious reasons is not linked to a specific grave. \n\n**Sources**\n\n[Newspaper Clippings](https://imgur.com/a/000FUJB)\n\n[Find a Grave; Silvercreek Cemetery](https://www.findagrave.com/cemetery/43445/silvercreek-cemetery)",

      "title": "Missing In Utah: A 55 year old geologist, Robert Marvin, vanishes in 1984. Was his disappearance connected to the murder of his wife 5 years earlier?",
      "text": "I am kicking off Utah with an unsolved murder and an unsolved disappearance. No concrete connection has been made between the two cases by law enforcement. However both things happened, both were investigated and a lot of time has passed. We may never find the answers. But perhaps this little spotlight helps, if for nothing else any possible John Does. The Marvin family was left with many unanswered questions years ago.\n\nRobert and Lola Marvin got married in 1952 in Logan, Utah. They had 2 sons together, George and Robert Marvin Jr. By 1979 their sons were young adults. Robert Senior was a successful geologist, and Lola also had her own successful career. In 1979 Lola was 49 years old and Robert was 50. The marriage was a long one, and I see no account of it being an unhappy one and they raised their sons together.\n\nOn July, 13th 1979 Lola was scheduled to fly out of the Albuquerque New Mexico airport to Oklahoma City for work. Her flight was scheduled for 5:00 p.m. that evening, and by what reports I could find she did arrive at the airport at 4:36 p.m. just before her flight. But Lola Marvin never got on that flight. During this time period it is reported that Robert Marvin senior was in Canada on a business trip. \n\nIt seems that sometime around 4 days after the flight was supposed to take place it had come to Robert Sr and both his son's attention that their mom had not made the flight or the business trip and she was missing. The sons went looking for their mother and did end up at the Albuquerque, New Mexico airport.\n\nReportedly the sons were relieved at first to see their mother's car in a parking spot at the airport. But upon closer inspection of the car itself they found their mother dead inside. It is reported that the car was locked and the windows were rolled up. \nLola Marvin lay inside the car slumped over. She had been shot three times at close range with a .38 caliber gun. Law enforcement believes she was shot by somebody that was sitting in the passenger seat. Because Lola's purse was missing with her wallet, law enforcement called this robbery from the beginning. It seems Robert Sr was not even really a suspect at the time because he was in Canada. Lola's case went cold.\n\n5 years after the murder at the airport Robert Marvin was 55 years old, and was employed by the Santa Fe Mining Company. During this time period in 1984 Robert was known to travel back and forth between Moab Utah and Albuquerque New Mexico. In 1984 he was dating a woman by the name of Betty Farrow. \n\nAccording to Betty, on the weekend of August 31st 1984 Robert had come to spend the weekend with her in Moab, Utah.  On the morning of September 4th according to Betty, Robert had told her that he was going to travel to either Telluride Colorado or Durango Colorado in search of condominiums. He reportedly left around 9:30 a.m. that morning. Some reports say that Betty and Robert had a minor argument that morning and he was last seen at a gas station nearby. Robert Marvin Sr was never seen again. According to Betty just before his disappearance Robert had been depressed and he had cashed out $20,000 worth of stock. This report never has seemed to have been confirmed. \n\nOn September the 6th 1984 Robert's family were contacted by the Santa Fe Mining company and they had called looking for him. His employers were concerned. The family had assumed he had been out of town on business and filed a missing person report right away. At times law enforcement in Utah, Colorado, and New Mexico were involved in the search for Robert Marvin senior.\n\nAround 1 month after his disappearance, his 1974 Volkswagen convertible was found. Most reports say it was found abandoned at the Albuquerque airport. The very same airport Lola Marvin's body was found in her car with 3 gunshots five years previously. There is some conflict on the actual location as others sources state it was a parking lot somewhere else...... But almost all the articles from back then do lead to it being found at the Albuquerque airport. \n\nInside of the car was Robert's tobacco pouch and several other things that belong to him. Robert was not found with the vehicle. There were traces of blood found on the tobacco pouch but not enough to determine back then in testing, if the blood actually belonged to Robert. Robert had left behind an uncashed check and has never touched his bank account since he disappeared. Law enforcement has gone as far as to say that they believe foul play was involved in Robert's disappearance but they do not know if it was connected to the murder of his wife. \n\nIn some of the sources I saw speculation that Robert's girlfriend was responsible for both of these instances. When she was interviewed in the past after Robert's disappearance she spoke as if their relationship began before Lola vanished. But that is no proof as obviously it's only speculation as no one has been charged with anything in regards to either case.\n\nThe sons of the Marvin's claim that 6 years after their mother's murder, and one year after the disappearance of their father they had found one of her event calendars. It is said that Lola was set to meet someone the night before her flight at the hotel at the Albuquerque airport. It seems this person was investigated. But I could not find out who the suspect was or find the name... And again no one has answered for her murder. The sons believe that Law Enforcement did not investigate their mother's murder enough. \n\nWhat happened to the geologist Robert Marvin? Who murdered Lola Marvin? Will their children ever find the answers? \n \nMoab Utah Police Department is investigating at 435-259-8938 \n\nhttps://charleyproject.org/case/robert-g-marvin-sr\n\nhttps://www.doenetwork.org/cases/1903dmut.html\n\nhttps://www.newspapers.com/article/the-salt-lake-tribune-obituary-for-lola/40698430/\n\nhttps://lostnfoundblogs.com/f/paul-hibbard-the-marvins---absent-anonymous\n\nI really haven't found any new articles and both  of these cases are ice cold. \nDid Robert Marvin know what happened to his wife? \nIt seems so much time has passed but maybe there is someone left that holds those answers.",

      "text": "From The Union Leader https://www.unionleader.com/news/safety/remains-found-near-derry-golf-course-identified-as-missing-woman-amanda-grazewski/article_e198f82e-34e2-42b0-aa73-53c385ecd9c5.html\n\n\n\nNearly five years to the day she went missing, Amanda Grazewski’s remains were positively identified after being found in the wetlands near a Derry golf course, state officials said Tuesday.\n\nIt’s been 1,8834 days since March 17, 2020, when she was last seen. Since those early days of the COVID-19 shutdown, family, friends and police had held out hope there would be a break in the case.\n\nThat break came last week when a drone operator from Hudson took high-resolution pictures of what appeared to be a body in the marsh area near the green of one of the Fourth Hole at Hoodkroft Country Club.\n\n“Our thoughts are with Amanda Grazewski’s family during this incredibly difficult time. We extend our deepest sympathy to them,” New Hampshire Attorney General John Formella said in a written news release Tuesday morning, just five days after Grazewski’s skeletal remains were discovered by Derry Police, the State Police Major Crimes Unit and Fish and Game officers on March 20.\n\nGrazewski was 23 at the time of her disappearance from a friend’s home at the corner of Birch and Grove streets, less than a mile from the wetlands where her remains were found.\n\nThe Office of the Chief Medical Examiner confirmed the identity but has not released a cause of death. The Derry Police Department’s investigation is ongoing.\n\n“I also want to express my gratitude to the dedicated law enforcement and forensic professionals involved in this case, as well as to the community members who have provided valuable tips throughout this investigation,” Formella said.\n\nGrazewski grew up in Nashua and moved around frequently. According to family and friends, she came to Derry on March 16, 2020, seeking a place to stay after running out of money. The next morning, friends found her purse, cellphone and other belongings in the home on Birch Street, but there was no sign of Grazewski.\n\n“Amanda has a history of substance abuse,” Derry Police said at the time. She was known to frequent locations in Nashua, Salem, Manchester and Hooksett.\n\nJenness Keller of Hudson, owner of Sky Dog Aerial Thermal Imaging, helped pinpoint six areas of interest near the golf course after donating his time and expertise to the search efforts.\n\nAn admin for a Facebook group originally called Finding Amanda Grazewski changed the title to Justice for Amanda Grazewski Tuesday morning, and an outpouring of support and relief for family and friends came in the form of dozens of messages.\n\nThe case drew national attention in May 2021 when a popular Wondery podcast called The Vanishing aired an episode with interviews from Grazewski’s mother, aunt, friends and Derry Police.\n\nDetectives spent more than 1,000 hours investigating the case, including interviews, area searches, online searches and following up on tips, according to Derry Police, who could not be reached Tuesday.\n\nDerry Police posted the press release from the Attorney General’s Office on Facebook with a 15-word statement but offered no further comment. Most of the comments on the post were critical of the department’s handling of the investigation, as has much of the commentary on other online forums.",

      "title": "Mom of 2 Lisa Stebic last seen by husband in 2007. Her case is stalled.",
      "text": "This is a case that came up repeatedly when I was researching the disappearance of Stacy Peterson.  There are eerie similarities. The two cases happened within months and miles of each other, and both involve the disappearance of a mother in a troubled marriage.   \n\nLisa Michelle Ruttenberg was born May 19, 1969 in the Chicago suburb of Park Ridge, IL. She graduated from Kendall College, a Chicago-area culinary arts college, with a degree in hotel and restaurant management. She met Craig Stebic at a party, and the two eloped to Jamaica on April 6, 1993. They had two children (10 and 12 at the time of the disappearance). \n\nThe marriage had problems early on. Lisa filed for divorce in 1995 on grounds of “extreme and repeated mental cruelty.” She was pregnant at the time. After their daughter was born, the couple reconciled, but bad feeling remained between Craig and his in-laws. In 2000, Craig's job took them from the far north of the Chicago metro area to a house at 13244 Red Star Drive,  Plainfield, in the southwest suburbs. It was a big house with an in-ground pool in the back yard. [Map of area, Aug. 2007](https://imgur.com/a/D4LmCbt)   \n\nBut their marital troubles continued. According to Craig, in October 2006 Lisa told him that she didn't want to be married to him any more. Police were called to the house in December 2006 over a “non-violent argument.”  Craig says Lisa came home drunk after being out all night; Lisa's side is that he locked her out of the house and met her at the door with a bag of her clothes, telling her to get out. Papers later filed by her parents said he told her “it wouldn't be pretty” if she tried to come inside the house. Craig filed for divorce on January 16, 2007, citing irreconcilable differences. Lisa's filing said Craig was careless with his collection of guns and had once let their son hold a gun. Lisa sought joint custody, child support and alimony. Craig sought joint custody and each party being self-supporting. (He made $80,000 a year; she made $10,000.) Since then, they were living separate lives in the same house and rarely speaking. “Not more than 5 words in 5 months,” according to Craig. Additionally, they were reportedly underwater on their mortgage.\n\nOn April 11, Lisa posted on two fitness and exercise websites looking for a female workout companion, expressing the wish to meet people, to spend more time outdoors in nature, and to include her children in her health routine. Lisa was looking for a fresh start.  She had lost more than 30 pounds, significant for her 5'2” frame. She was looking after her fitness, physical and mental. \n\nOn April 28, Lisa's sister Debbie had a long phone conversation with her for what would be the last time. Lisa seemed cheerful and like her usual self. On April 29, the Stebics invited their neighbors over to enjoy the warm weather in their backyard. Neighbor Laurri Bingenheimer later said everything seemed normal, Lisa speaking positively about the future after the divorce went through.  \n\nThe next day, April 30, Lisa was confirmed to be at work and was seen at Jimmy John's picking up a sandwich around 2:30 p.m. She was home when her children got back from school, and may in fact have picked up her son from school. Craig got home around 5:40, and went to work in the back yard. When he came back inside, Lisa was gone.  Several times a week, she would go to a local high school around 6 p.m. to work out. He assumed she had walked or been picked up, because her car was in the garage. Craig gave the kids money to buy candy and they went off to a local drug store on their bikes, time uncertain. Lisa was there when they left, but not when they came back. When the kids returned around 6:45, Craig took them to Target to pick up a birthday present.  \n\nCraig said it wasn't unusual for Lisa to go out in the evening and return around 10-11 p.m. But when Lisa wasn't back home the next morning, and her car was still in the garage, Craig wondered. First he called her workplace at 8:50 a.m. and then neighbor Laurri Bingenheimer around 10. Laurri called the police to report a missing person that morning. She said the house didn't look normal, with all the blinds closed. Something seemed wrong. Craig went to work, and later in the afternoon also reported Lisa missing. She had taken only her phone and her wallet (some sources say a small black purse).    \n\nPolice did a cursory search of the house and briefly questioned both Craig and the children, whose account “seemed to confirm” their father's according to Police Chief Don Bennett. It was also confirmed that Lisa didn't show up at Plainfield North for a workout the previous evening. Law enforcement agencies conducted searches in parks, trails, and other forested areas in Plainfield. They solicited help from the public and coordinated volunteer searches. Divers searched retention ponds and nearby Lake Renwick (5 miles). Lisa's family were very involved. They distributed fliers and organized a Mother's Day campaign to distribute carnations with a photo of Lisa and police contact information at churches and  businesses around town. They launched a website, findlisastebic.com (no longer in existence). The family offered a reward of $20,000, which eventually increased to $75,000. At this point, police said they did not suspect foul play.   \n\nIn the days following the disappearance, Craig maintained that Lisa would never willingly leave the children. He described her as a good mother. He initially cooperated with the police, including giving the home computer to investigators. About a week later, things changed. When police stated that they might be asking family members to take polygraphs, he called them to decline on the advice of his lawyer. He stopped speaking to the police and would not allow access to the children. On May 9, he filed an emergency petition for temporary sole custody of the children, stating that this was in case Lisa came back and tried to disappear with them. It came out in a subsequent hearing that on April 30, Lisa had mailed her lawyer a signed petition to evict Craig from the home. This was due to his verbal abuse affecting the physical and mental well-being of herself and the children. He was, in her words, \"unnecessarily relentless, cruel, inconsiderate, domineering and verbally abusive.\"  ([Charley Project](https://charleyproject.org/case/lisa-michelle-stebic) ) When asked about the petition, Craig said he did not know about it.  \n\nOn May 14, police, assisted by the Joliet Police Department's Special Operations Squad and the FBI Evidence Response Team, conducted a late-night raid on the Stebic home. They were there for 4 and a half hours, during which time the kids had to sleep in the family car.  They took away household items, 24 firearms, and both cars. The local Naperville Sun newspaper reported as an exclusive that blood found on a tarp during a previous search was tested for DNA, and was a match for Lisa's, providing probable cause for the search. Police declined to confirm or deny, and no arrest was made. [The Naperville Sun story has not been corroborated in any source I have found though it was repeated in online articles and podcasts.] Craig was a frequent hunter, and he said the family had been rabbit hunting the previous weekend. His father had a cabin on acreage near Iron Mountain, Michigan, where they hunted. This property was also searched. Craig had a large collection of legal firearms. In January 1995 he had been charged with two felony counts of possession of a weapon within 1000 feet of a school. He had a shotgun, semi-automatic pistol, and two semi-automatic rifles in his truck. He pled guilty to a lesser charge, got supervision, and paid a fine. Craig and his father were both arrested in Michigan in Oct. 1995 during an investigation of poaching. \n\nIn the wake of Lisa's disappearance, her friends made allegations about Craig's treatment of her. It was said that Lisa was afraid of Craig, that she slept on the couch with her purse and phone next to her so he wouldn't take them while she was sleeping. Also that she was getting counseling at the Guardian Angel Home in Joliet, an organization that aids victims of domestic violence. Her neighbor said Lisa told her to call the police if anything happened. A co-worker was told to “look at Craig” in such a situation. Craig denied that Lisa was afraid of him or was in counseling. Guardian Angel Home made no comment, as would be expected. These comments are hearsay, but certainly a damning picture of Craig was building up. He compounded it by not taking part in any of the searches, and not attending a vigil held on what would have been Lisa's 38th birthday on May 19. Craig maintained that he was protecting his kids from the media. \n\nAs the case went national, there was a bit of a media blitz in May. Both Lisa's sisters and Police Chief Bennett appeared on Greta Van Susteren's show.  Bennett also appeared on Nancy Grace's show on CNN on May 16. Transcript](https://transcripts.cnn.com/show/ng/date/2007-05-16/segment/01) Lisa's cousin Melanie Greenberg, who was the family spokesperson, appeared on Kimberly Guilfoyle's show “The Line Up” on Fox News and called for Craig to take a polygraph. The Greenbergs also went on Larry King; Craig's father Joe called in to the show. [Transcript, scroll to last segment](https://transcripts.cnn.com/show/lkl/date/2007-05-23/segment/01). The case was featured on America's Most Wanted on May 18. Meanwhile, Craig was not speaking to anyone.  \n\nIn July, investigators held a press conference where they stated their belief that Lisa did not leave on her own, had not met with an accident, and was not abducted from the home. Her phone and credit card had not been used since her disappearance. They believed she had met with foul play, and they named Craig Stebic as a person of interest. They did not specifically accuse Craig, but stated that he knew something about what had happened. They also cited his “minimal assistance” in the case and refusal to allow his kids to be interviewed. Throughout all of this, Craig maintained his both innocence and his ignorance of where Lisa might have gone.  \n\nA story that always gets mentioned in this case is about a Chicago TV news reporter who was taped talking to Craig in the Stebic back yard, wearing a bikini top and a towel around her waist. Her kids were with her, as was Craig's sister. The reporter said she was on her way to a Chicago swim club with the kids when Craig's sister called and invited her to come and talk to him. As a reporter on the case, she wasn't going to pass up the chance for an interview.  A rival station broadcast the tape, there was a furore, and the reporter lost her job. She had also been feeding information to the police, which was another reason for the dismissal. She unsuccessfully sued her employer later. Personally, I think this is irrelevant to the case, but some people find it suspect.  \n\nIn addition to many searches, including the use of cadaver dogs, there were billboards set up along major roads and even an ad on the Chicago Cubs' electronic scoreboard.  Friends consulted psychics, and were led to a cemetery where the body of a man was found, and to a state park where they found animal bones. Craig complained about two cameras that police had set up and trained on his front door and back yard. He said the billboards and fliers were upsetting to the kids. Lisa's family went to Michigan to post fliers in the area around the Stebic property.  \n\nTips from the public had dwindled. Some family members feel that when 23-year-old Stacy Peterson disappeared from nearby Bolingbrook in October, attention and resources shifted to the new case.  Police were growing frustrated by Craig's refusal to let the children be interviewed, saying it was thwarting their ability to move the case forward. Craig's attorney had twice refused to let them be interviewed at the Will County Children's Advocacy Center. He cited a pending lawsuit against the Center relating to a child in another case. Eventually a grand jury was convened in November  2007, and the children were subpoenaed. Their testimony is of course sealed. Whatever they said did not give the police enough to charge Craig, even though he was their one person of interest.  \n\nAt some point Craig had cut off contact with Lisa's sisters, including contact with the kids. This may have been because a Department of Children and Family Services case had been opened in late summer, and he believed the sisters were the instigators. The relationship with her parents and grandparents was already minimal. Craig had allegedly forbidden them to talk to Lisa or the children for two years. On Nov. 19, Lisa's parents and grandparents filed a petition seeking visitation rights. It was stated that they had not seen the children for 2 years. [Note: Lisa's parents lived in Florida.] Their petition called Craig an unfit parent and included sensational claims: Craig had told Lawrence Ruttenberg that if they ever came on his property again, he would cut Lisa into a million pieces and she would never be found, that he would also kill Lawrence and his wife. [The date of this conversation is not stated.] He allegedly told Lisa her face would someday be on the back of a milk carton. They said he frequently mixed alcohol and drugs, had been intoxicated while supervising his children with his guns. They also said he made moonshine and allowed the children to taste it. This case went on for 17 months but eventually settled out of court. However, the damaging statements about Craig had already become public record. Still he maintained his innocence in Lisa's disappearance.  \n\nCraig petitioned for the return of his cars and guns. The sedan was returned to him in April 2008, but the judge ruled that the pick-up and guns should not be returned, because prosecutors felt it would be detrimental to the case to return them when the cause of death was unknown. A blanket that was found in the sedan was not returned as it was being tested at a crime lab. He got the pickup back in September, but the guns had to be held by a friend, because Craig's gun card had been revoked.    \n\nOver the first few years, at least two bodies were found in the  area. Neither was Lisa's. In 2008, police turned to a California psychic who had been used by other police departments and the FBI and had helped find missing persons. Police Chief Bennett told the press in June that “short term progress has been favorable,” but did not say what leads the psychic provided. In April 2009, the state's attorney's office said there had been new developments in the case, though none that would break it open. In May 2010, a new police chief brought the Will/Grundy County Major Crimes Task Force into the investigation with 80 new detectives bringing a fresh perspective. None of these efforts have led to an arrest. In 2017, the state's attorney's office said the case was presented each month to a monthly grand jury in order to keep it active. According to the Plainfield Police Department, it is still active today.\n\nCraig raised his and Lisa's children; they would now be in their 20s-30s. Little is known about them over the past decade and a half, which is as it should be. Craig has continued to have some issues. On Oct. 25, 2009, he was arrested for making a threat to a neighbor, witnessed by a police officer responding to a fireworks complaint. His lawyer in the visitation case sued him in 2011 for $10,000 in legal fees. The house at 13244 Red Star Drive was put up for sale in July 2016. The last information I can find is that Craig was living in Joliet, IL as of 2021.  \n\nLisa Stebic would be 56 years old today. She has brown hair and brown eyes, is 5'2” tall and has two tattoos: a rose and a butterfly. I used present tense, but it is most likely that she is deceased.  \n\nTheories  \n\nThere is really one theory, but I will go through a few possibilities just in case. If Lisa actually did walk to her exercise session at Plainfield North High School, she might have been preyed upon by a random stranger. It was about an hour walk from her house. Likewise if she accepted a ride home, when it would have been dark. (Unlikely for any woman to do this, unless she knew the person.) \n\nShe could have met up with someone who targeted her from her postings for exercise partners on fitness websites and fallen victim to them.  \n\nShe had reportedly been on a few dates with a man in his 40s. He was questioned by police and seems not to have been a suspect, but maybe she dated someone else unknown to her friends and thus, unknown to the police.  \n\nOne theory I definitely do not believe: She didn't leave to start a new life somewhere; her divorce was going through and she would be able to move on with her kids. She would not have left them with a man she considered cruel. And there was no need to leave. In fact, she had already made a move to get her husband out of the house by filing a petition.  \n\nThe theory held by most, including the police since July 2007, is that Craig is responsible for Lisa's disappearance and probable death. After all their searches and interviews with people connected to the case, they honed in on him as the only person of interest. What makes Craig the prime suspect? A spouse or partner is always a top suspect in a disappearance or death, more so if the couple are going through a divorce. In this case, it was their second time, and both times, Lisa had complained of cruelty. Craig's history included hostility to her parents, threats of violence to them and to her. There were fights. Ill-feeling alone could have led to an argument that turned violent.  He was the last person to see her, and the timeline of that afternoon/evening is primarily based on his statements. There was blood found in one of their cars.  \n\nThen there is the financial motive. The house had a second mortgage and was worth less than they owed. Now Craig was faced with having to pay alimony, child support, and the cost of a second residence. In fact, his wife was already trying to get him out the door. He said he didn't know about the eviction papers, but Lisa had them at home prior to mailing, and he may have seen them. She disappeared the very day she signed and mailed them.  \n\nHowever...Craig hasn't been charged in 17 years of investigation. Blood samples were allegedly tested. The house was searched at least three times. Their children testified about the day their mother disappeared. None of this has provided police probable cause to arrest him. And he still claims his innocence. In addition, the time frame for a murder is narrow. The kids were home after school up until Craig sent them to buy candy. Even if he sent them when he got home (5:40), there's about an hour till they are reported to have come back (6:45). In that time he would have to kill her and hide the body such that no evidence was left. Possibly in her car? There wasn't time to go anywhere, with the kids due back at any moment. Then he would have to dispose of the body before an investigation started. In other words, before he reported her missing. Most likely overnight. There is a theory that his father helped him and that Lisa was disposed of in Michigan. The area near the cabin is supposedly full of old mining pits. It is a ~~3 and a half~~ 6 hour drive hour drive from Plainfield to the general area of the cabin (Alpha, MI). Such a place would be difficult, if not impossible, to search adequately. ~~I suppose Craig could have driven there and back overnight, or during the school day.~~ I don't see when Craig would have had time for a round trip. An accomplice would have been necessary. Craig's father has publicly stated that he doesn't believe Craig did anything and he doesn't know where Lisa is. He passed away in 2021.  \n\nSetting aside Michigan, it is hard to say where Lisa might be. Although divers searched the nearby bodies of water, she could have been taken anywhere. In the Stacy Peterson case, not far from Plainfield, there was mention of a river and two canals as places where a body might be dumped. Lake Michigan is nearby in Chicago. It runs along the western shores of Michigan and up through the Upper Peninsula where Joe Stebic had his cabin. It's mostly a matter of time, and there wasn't much time. The land around the Stebic residence was subdivisions and a good bit of open land. [Google Earth historical imagery from 2007](https://imgur.com/a/D4LmCbt ) But it appears to be open,  and not forested. At this stage, unless someone stumbles across remains somewhere outdoors, we probably have to rely on the perpetrator to reveal where she is.  \n\nThe year 2007 was  grim for Will County, Illinois. In February, Lisa Stebic, missing and presumed murdered. In June, the horrific murder of his wife and children by Christopher Vaughn.  In October, Stacy Peterson, also missing and presumed murdered. Two of which crimes remain unsolved.

      "title": "In April 1972, a room in South London saw a murder. The murder led to three unfair convictions and one, perhaps two suicides, and major reforms in the criminal justice system. The murder of Michelle/Maxwell Confait, London, UK.",
      "text": "(The original multi-part version of this write up was removed. I hope this rewrite will past muster...)\n\n**Summary**\n\n In 1972, Maxwell Confait, commonly known as Michelle, was murdered. Three men, two of them teenagers and the other being mentally disabled, were arrested and convicted, but would later be released and found innocent. The murderer has never been found. \n\nLast week, waiting for a train at Catford Bridge railway station, I thought about a house I could see from the platform, and thought I would write up this case. It is still the most famous recent unsolved murder in this area of South London. This house is 27 Doggett Road, in Catford. At 1.21 am on Saturday 22nd April 1972, the emergency services were called by telephone to a fire at the house. While the fire was being put under control, a body was found: that of a 27 year-old, whose cis male identity was Maxwell Confait, but who was known to her intimates as Michelle (notably, the murder squad also used Michelle to refer to her after death). Confait had been strangled before the fire began. \n\n**Confait and Goode**\n\nMichelle Confait was born Maxwell Thomas Barty Confait in the Seychelles in 1945, of mixed-race heritage. After being brought up in the Seychelles and Kenya, Confait migrated to the UK in 1963. On reaching adulthood, Confait undertook sexual relationships with men, wore wigs and women's clothing frequently, and used the name Michelle. \n\nIn 1969, after a suicidal episode, Confait became a sex worker in the West End, and was convicted thrice as a result, with a prison sentence arising from the third conviction in December 1971. A fourth trial was in the offing when Confait was killed. In this period, Michelle seems to have been a recognised local figure, acquiring the nickname “Handbag”. \n\nAround 1970, Michelle met a man named Winston Goode, in a pub called the Black Bull in Lewisham. (The pub is now the Fox & Firkin; it is a very lively venue today.) Winston Goode, a migrant from Jamaica who was 31 in 1970, was a steelworker who owned 27 Doggett Road. Winston lived with his wife, Lillian Goode (also orginally Jamaican) and their children - there were five by 1972. Michelle and Winston struck up a friendship, Winston, who was bisexual, began to show this more openly. \n\nWinston's relationship with Lillian broke down over 1971; they still lived in the same house, but Winston lived separately in a room of his own, and only spent time with the children at weekends.Winston had his own circle of friends and casual sexual partners, whom he would let into his room and entertain separately from the rest of the household. The house is arranged on three floors: lower ground, upper ground and first. Winston lived in the front room on the lower ground floor, where there was also a kitchen used by the whole household, whereas his wife and children occupied the two rooms on the upper ground floor. The first floor was let to lodgers. \n\n**Confait lives in Doggett Road**\n\nAfter release in January 1972, Confait moved into 27 Doggett Road as a lodger of Winston on the first floor of the building. Winston, at this point, began to dress as a woman openly. Michelle and Winston would cook and eat meals together, or go out to pubs such as the Black Bull or the Castle (a local pub which had a reputation as a gay-friendly place - Covid killed off its latest incarnation, and it's now a sushi restaurant), gay-friendly pubs and clubs in the local area or the West End, or private parties, sometimes in trans guise. Confait received many visitors, mainly white men. When I was inspired to write this, I took a photo of the rear of the house from the station: https://imgur.com/a/G4I7ej3 - the dot marks Confait's room.\n\nHowever, in the run-up to the 21st April, a coolness had developed between Michelle and Winston. There had allegedly been an argument when Confait had taken offence at being described at Winston's paid lover. Confait had used racist terms against Winston. Confait had a sexual relationship with another member of their circle. This figure was referred to as Mr A X in the official inquiry. His brother was known as Mr B X. A X and B X would frequently meet up with Michelle for sex, sometimes involving other men.\n\n**The last week of Confait's life**\n\nIn the week leading up to the 21st, various witnesses gave information about Confait's movements but they are conflciting. Michelle and Winston, as well as the X brothers, had met up over the weekend, but Winston had not seen Confait by his own account since Tuesday 18th April. On the evening of Wednesday 19th April, Lillian Goode saw Confait come in with a white man. She did not know who the white man was, but she had seen him with Confait before. On Friday 21st April, between 3pm and 3.30pm, Confait was seen at a restaurant and at the Castle pub, according to witnesses. At 4pm, she was visited by a female friend, K Smith, who said Confait was ironing a trouser suit and preparing to go out with a man to a pub in Deptford. It is worth pointing out that the post-mortem found no evidence of food in Confait’s stomach, but there was evidence that Confait had drunk, and there was no sign of any alcohol in her room. \n\nMeanwhile, on the same day, Winston had left work at 4.30, shopped until then, and returned home at 6. By his own account, he washed in the bathroom around 6.30pm, and then went to bed around 7.30pm, being tired, and also being in a low mood because of his estrangement from Confait. Mr A X spent Friday 21st, on his own account, in a house containing a doctor's surgery, where he was employed and had a room to sleep in. \n\nLillian and the children had tea in the course of the evening, and then watched television until closedown, with the children falling asleep, and Lilian switching off the TV at closedown. \n\n**The murder; the fire** \n\nAt some point before 1am on Saturday, 22nd April, Confait was strangled in Confait's room. The opinion of the pathologists was that the act was committed with a length of electrical flex; they judged this by the marks left on Confait's neck. A length of flex whicn could have been so used was found in Confait's room, during a police search on the morning of Monday 24th April. It had been placed underneath papers in a drawer in a cupboard in the room. Winston identified the flex as one he had given to Confait, and appeared distressed when shown the item. \n\nAt some point around 1am on the morning of Saturday 22nd April, a fire was started on the lower ground floor of 27 Doggett Road. The fire was begun in a cupboard where Lilian stored clothing and curtains for the house. The fuel used was paraffin from an old paraffin heater which was out of order. Winston stated to police that he was awakened around 1am by the sound of crackling. He got up, discovered the fire, and called out to Confait: hearing no response, he assumed Confait was out. Winston then alerted his family; his wife was already up. She told him to call the fire brigade. Lilian thought that Winston's distress was unusual, given that all that had happened was that a fire had broken out. It was also notable that, despite saying that he had been asleep before being awoken by the fire, Winston was fully dressed. Winston passed down the road to Catford Bridge railway station, where there were (and indeed still are) phone booths for public use. But he did not use the phone: his neighbour, who had followed him to the booth, found him inside the booth, still in deep distress. The neighbour made the call. The fire service responded to the call at 1.25am. Firemen wearing breathing appliances discovered Confait's body 10 minutes later, and the fire was finally extinguished around 2am. \n\n**The police: intitial activity** \n\nAfter the fire was put out, matters passed into the hands of the local police: firstly, Detective Inspector Stockwell, and then Detective Chief Superintendent Jones, the senior detective for the Met Police division which covered the area. When Dr Bain, the police surgeon, and then Professor Cameron (the senior pathologist who was called in) examined the body, the police, having gained some idea of Confait’s life, advised the doctors not to carry out any examination of rectal temperature at the scene, as it was thought possible at this stage that there could be valuable evidence in Confait’s rectum. This was a serious error and a departure from sensible forensic practice. It could have been possible to take swabs and read the temperature without a serious issue. But the lack of a rectal temperature made it harder to determine an accurate time of death. \n\nIn addition, the firemen who first discovered Confait's body saw clear signs of rigor. But both Bain, and Professor Cameron to a greater extent, suggested thaf rigor was just setting in at the time of examination. This suggested that the death took place later than it actually did. \n\nDCS Jones’ first target on arrival was Winston, and he subjected him to sustained questioning over what remained of the night and the early morning. Jones reached the conclusion that Winston was a physically and mentally weak character who would have been easily pressured to admit to the murder had he really carried it out. Jones may well have been motivated by a contempt for Winston's sexuality. Nevertheless, he decided to look further afield. \n\n**The Catford Three**\n\nIn Catford, at this time, there were three young men: Colin Lattimore, Ronald Leighton, and Ahmet Salih. Colin was the oldest, at 18, but he had been diagnosed as “subnormal” in the jargon of the time. Colin had received most of his schooling at special schools and had held down a variety of different jobs, holding only one for very young. He was seen to be mentally considerably younger than his age. Ronald Leighton was 16: he had spent long periods of his childhood in care. Ahmet Salih had just turned 14: he had migrated with his family to the UK at the age of six (at that time, increasingly brutal crackdowns by the Nicosia government on the Turkish minority caused many Turkish Cypriots to flee to the UK). He had not been a regular attender of school. \n\nAll three of them were known to the police for various acts of petty crime - but none of the crimes involved violence against other people. Leighton split his living arrangements between his grandparents, who lived in Doggett Road, and his mother, who lived in Westdown Road a short distance away. Salih and Lattimore both lived in Nelgarde Road, which is the road to the east of Doggett Road. These three young men were friends. \n\n**The Catford Three: activities on 21st/22nd April**\n\nOn the evening of Friday 21st April, Colin Lattimore spent most of his time at a Salvation Army youth club in Brownhill Road, alongside his brother; Leighton and Salih spent most of the evening at either Leighton's house or Salih's house, partly in the company of Salih's sister and a 13-year old girl, and then they sought, between 12:30 and 1.30am, to rob a local shoe repair shop in Plassy Road. Leighton and Salih had briefly been as far as Catford Bus Garage; but, apart from that, all the locations were they had been are within easy walking distance of 27 Doggett Road. \n\nAround the time when the first responders were arriving at Doggett Road, Leighton and Salih were arrested near the shoe shop for the burglary. They were released into the care of their mothers around 4am. On Monday 24th April, Leighton and Salih met up, and broke into 1 Nelgarde Road, setting the coal bunker on fire. During this time, Colin Lattimore met up with them. The three then made their way to the nearby Ladywell Fields, where they set a sports hut on fire, before moving on to Catford Bridge station and setting another fire there. The three were seen running away from the Ladywell fire, and their presence was reported to police. \n\n**Police arrest the Catford Three**\n\nA police officer spotted Lattimore shortly afterwards in Nelgarde Road. He took Lattimore to his grandparents’ house, where he found the other two boys, and questioned all three of them about the three fires. The police constable then asked Lattimore about the Doggett Road. According to the constable's notes, Lattimore replied “I was with Ronnie, we lit it, but we put it out, but it was smoking when we left”. The three were taken to Lewisham police station. During the questioning session, a trainee detective constable, Peter Woledge, pursued the Doggett Road angle with all three boys. Each boy later alleged that Woledge assaulted them and threatened them with “porridge” unless they admitted involvement in the Doggett Road fire. \n\nThey were then taken to Lee Green police station, where DCS Jones and the squad overseeing the murder inquiry were based, and questioning continued. Questioning by Jones and his team was sustained and vigorous. After three hours, he secure oral confessions from all three, which were then formalised in writing. It is notable that there were several departures from the established Judges’ Rules on police interrogation. For instance, the three were not offered the opportunity of legal representation, and their parents were involved fairly late in the process. Lattimore, in particular, was given no latitude given his disabilities. \n\nThis was despite the fact that none of the boys knew Confait before the murder. Ronald Leighton's mother knew all the inhabitants of 27 Doggett Road by sight, and occaisonally talked to Lillian Goode. Ronald Leighton's sister had been at school with one of Winston and Lilian's daughters, and the two girls and had visited each others’ houses. But, apart from that, the three boys had only gained their knowledge of Confait when Ronald's mother had talked about the death over the weekend of 22nd/23rd April. \n\nThe police did not explain why the three had decided to target 27 Doggett Road, or why they would murder Michelle. It was suggested that Michelle might have made a sexual proposition to one of the three, who then sought revenge; but there was no evidence that Michelle ever made such suggestions to young men. \n\n**Trial; conviction; appeal**\n\nIn November 1972, the three were convicted at the Old Bailey, despite their alibis. In his summing up, Mr. Justice Chapman described Michelle as “an odd creature, and indeed it may be your view that he has been no great loss to this world”. Appeals by the three intitially failed at the first hurdle, despite the efforts of Lattimore's family in particular. However, in 1974, a change of government led to a change in official attitude. Lewisham West was recaptured for Labour by Chris Price, an experienced politician who was also a journalist and someone who had an interest in civil liberties. The new Labour Home Secretary, Roy Jenkins, had been a great liberal reformer as Home Secretary before, and wanted to maintain his reputation. As a result of this, media attention on the case was maintained; the Home Office referred the case to the Court of Appeal, which quashed the convictions in October 1975; and an inquiry into the affair was called by Jenkins. \n\n**Winston Goode: aftermath**\n\nOn 27th April 1972, Winston Goode, Confait's landlord and possible lover, was found wandering in a dazed condition in Doggett Road. He was taken to hospital, and was sectioned shortly after. In May 1974, Winston committed suicide with cyanide. \n\n**Aftermath: the Fisher Inquiry**\n\nThe Inquiry called by the Home Secretary was headed by Sir Henry Fisher, a barrister and former judge with a reputation for being a liberal. The inquiry findings were severe on the police and the pathologists. This would, in turn, lead to two great changes in criminal and judicial practice. A Royal Commission was brought in to examine the whole area of police evidence, and the Judges’ Rules were replaced by the Police and Cirminal Evidence Act 1984. The following year, the various avenues police forces used to prosecute were replaced by one single organisation, the Crown Prosecution Service. \n\nBut Fisher, notably, still indicated that he considered Leighton and Salih to be guilty of the murder, although he considered that Lattimore was, at most, guilty of starting the fire.\n\n**Further investigation: dead end**\n\nAs a result of the inquiry, a further investigation was opened by the Met, under an experienced detective, John George. This uncovered a very different line of inquiry. When Confait had been imprisoned in Wormwood Scrubs, Confait had been protected by another prisoner,,Douglas Franklin, who also became her lover. Franklin had another friend, Paul Pooley. After Franklin and Pooley had been sentenced for another crime in 1976, Paul Pooley claimed that Confait and Franklin had continued their relationship after their release. In April 1972, according to Pooley, they had been with Confait in Confait's room, and Confait had been dancing with Franklin. Franklin had then taken things too far and strangled Confait in Pooley's presence. However, Franklin committed suicide shortly aftef initial questioning by police officers, and nothing could be taken further. It is notable that the inquiry concluded that Confait might have been dead 48 hours before the beginning of the inquiry. \n\n\nFor what it is worth, my own private assumption is that the three had nothing to do with the murder. Confait was murdered by someone in Confait's circles - probably Franklin, maybe Mr A X.. But the murderer did not start the fire: this was set by Winston Goode, who found the body, and was overtaken by panic and distress. \n\n**Points of interest**\n\n- Who are Mr A X and Mr B X? Even after so many years, they could still add value to the investigation. \n\n- There were three adults apart from Michelle resident in 27 Doggett Road on 21st April 1972, but only one was ever seen as a suspect. There appears to be no consensus about Confait's movements from the 18th onwards.\n\n- DCS Jones did originally think the solution to the murder would be found in Michelle's social circle. It is still perplexing that he abandoned this line of inquiry as soon as the three were brought to his attention. \n\n-  There was an underlying current of racial tension in the area, including accusations of police brutality. This would come to the fore in the late 1970s and early 1980s. But this, interestingly, does not seem to have been a major factor in this case\n\n-  It is clear that Sir Henry Fisher was convinced that the three had something to do with the crime by two factors: Colin Lattimore's admission when he was first questioned; and the possibility that the three boys could have met up at Doggett Road on Friday evening, despite their alibis. But it does seem hardly likely that the three of them would be able to come up with such a plan, given the rather obvious criminal scheme two of them did carry out on the morning of the 22nd.\n\n- There has been no further information about the Franklin allegations. The pathologists argued that two people must have been involved in the murder: one restraining Michelle, and the other strangling her with the flex. This would have made Pooley an accomplice. \n\n**Links**  \n https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/report-of-an-inquiry-into-the-death-of-maxwell-confait (Report of the Fisher Inquiry)  \n  https://zagria.blogspot.com/2020/01/michelle-confait-1945-1972-sex-worker.html?m=1 (Essay on the murder)  \n https://londonnewsonline.co.uk/lifestyle/memories/murder-that-changed-the-way-police-operated/ (South London Press retrospective)  \n https://archive.org/details/Catching_Britains_Killers_The_Crimes_That_Changed_Us_Series_1_-_03._Interrogatio (BBC documentary, 2019)",

Photos and information from NamUs.](https://preview.redd.it/jdo2gibtdq1e1.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=4f013d17b2e7ea45ad09e319cbd0852a9c3c2081)\n\n**Note**: I am just a web sleuth/criminal justice college student; I have no insider knowledge or involvement in the cases I write up on. I write these write-ups in the hope of engaging the community with these cases. And bear with any grammatical inaccuracies. I do my best.\n\nI wanted to begin showcasing some niche Jane/John Doe cases on this subreddit, as well as making some sharable posters, so I began with one that has stuck in my mind since I found it on NamUs.\n\n**Basic Background**\n\nOn November 17, 2023, a hunter in Decatur, Georgia found fully skeletal remains in a wooded area. The remains were located just under ten feet within a brushy area located at the dead end of 4535 Highland Road. They were fully skeletal, though some clothing, jewelry, and a wig were found in the vicinity. The remains became the custody of the DeKalb County Medical Examiner's office, and a NamUs page was created a few days later.\n\n**Physical Description**\n\nUnfortunately, a facial reconstruction estimation has not been produced as of this post going up. Given that the remains are fully skeletal, it will take a skilled reconstruction and forensic artist team to produce a composite sketch. (ETA: I am a silly goose and somehow totally skimmed the reconstruction image online. My bad! You can find exact location details and a composite sketch [here.](https://www.dekalbcountyga.gov/medical-examiner/unidentified-cases))\n\nWhat we do know is that the remains were those of a black female. She was between 5'1\" and 5'4\" in height, though her weight could not be estimated. It is assumed and estimated that she was between 30 and 50 years of age at the time of death. Eye and natural hair color are unknown.\n\nHer exact time of death is unknown, and if a manner of death has been determined, it has not been released publicly. But given that her remains were skeletal, it could be presumed that she had been dead for at least three months, if not longer. On average, it takes a year for full decomposition, though it all depends on temperature and environment.\n\nShe had two distinct antemortem skeletal injuries. Her fifth and sixth right ribs had healed fractures, and her first lumbar vertebra appeared compressed with bone growth around it. I am not an expert or a doctor, but it could be possible that this lumbar injury happened along with the rib fractures, such as a car accident or workplace incident.\n\nPerhaps the most distinct identifying markers are the clothes and jewelry that was found at the scene. She wore a battered shirt (exact details not released) and children's size 14 Wonder Nation Brand jeans. At the time of death, she wore a red and black wig (style/length unknown). Her jewelry included gold heart earrings, a beaded \"besties\" bracelet, a jade link-style bracelet, and a beaded woven bracelet. No information about shoes or undergarments has been publicly disclosed.\n\n**Closing Thoughts**\n\nThough we know so little about this Jane Doe, we can infer some things from her belongings and remains.\n\nWe know that she had some sort of rib/back injury, which likely caused chronic pain. The \"besties\" bracelet implies that, somewhere, there is another person with a matching bracelet. Maybe they're searching for her. Maybe they don't even realize that she's missing. She wore bright colors and fun jewelry; I can only imagine how vibrant she was in life. Yet, somehow, she ended up deceased in a fairly secluded brush in the Atlanta area. How? What happened?\n\nYou can find all of the available information on the NamUs page [here.](https://www.namus.gov/UnidentifiedPersons/Case#/111977/details?nav)\n\n**If you have any information that could lead to the identification of this Jane Doe, please contact with the Decatur Police Department at 404-373-6551. Or, contact the DeKalb County Medical Examiner's Office at 404-508-3524.**",

      "title": "Autistic Indigenous girl goes to bed one night, and when her family wants to wake her up in the morning, they discover her missing; There are no clues as to what happened to her- Where is Sa'Wade BirdinGround? (2024)",
      "text": "Hello everyone! As always, thank you for all your comments and upvotes on my last post about Calvin Jones- I hope that he will be found soon.\n\n  \nToday I wanted to highlight another disappearance.\n\n\n\nBACKGROUND\n\n  \nSa'Wade BirdinGround was 13 when she went missing from Garryowen, Montana, USA.\n\n  \nHer name is also sometimes spelled as \"Sawade\".\n\n  \nSa'Wade had a learning disability, but her uncle, Levi Black Eagle, said that she was \"just like a regular teenager\". Later on it was revealed that she was autistic- I'm not sure if that's the extent diagnosis, or if there's something more at play in her case. \n\n  \nIt's noted that she allegedly got along well with her peers and teachers. \n\n  \nBefore she went missing, Sa'Wade was \"thriving\" at school and was excited to try out basketball.\n\n  \nShe was a member of the Mandan, Hidatsa and Arikara Nation and of Crow and Hidatsa heritage, and lived within the boundaries of the Crow Indian Reservation.\n\n  \nAfter Sa'Wade disappeared, she was described as possibly \"in danger\" due to \"mental health concerns\", but wasn't specified if she was diagnosed with anything more specific before she went missing.\n\n  \nSa'Wade had been described as a \"quiet, kind and artistic child who likes to laugh\".\n\n\n\nLevi described his niece as \"pretty quiet. (He) would say (Sa'Wade's) pretty shy and reserved. But she's a sweet girl\".\n\n  \nHer father, Wade Birdinground, said that Sa'Wade \"('s) got a great heart. She's like the most awesome person ever\".\n\n\n\nDISAPPEARANCE\n\n  \nSa'Wade was last seen on the 6th of October, around 11PM. On the next morning, when her family went to wake her up, they discovered that her bed was empty. Sa'Wade left her phone and headphones (which were noted to be very important to her) behind.\n\n  \nThe disappearance was said to be out of character for her, as she never ran from home or got into any serious trouble before.\n\n  \nSearch for Sa'Wade was extensive- sniffer dogs, a helicopter, drones, horseback searchers and many local volunteers would scour the local countryside to find any clues regarding where she might've gone to, but nothing was found.\n\n  \nSa'Wade's family handed her phone over to FBI agents, who had managed to recover recently deleted messages and a phone call that might've been with the last person the girl spoke to before her disappearance. In March of this year, however, it has been revealed that the phone didn't yield any useful clues.\n\n  \nThere has been no contact from Sa'Wade ever since the 6th of October.\n\n\n\nCONCLUSION\n\n  \nThere has been no updates on Sa'Wade's case since she was reported missing. There are seemingly no leads, but the case remains open. The BirdinGround family went from being afraid to being frustrated with the lack of progress. Wade believes that his daughter was abducted.  \n\n  \nGarryowen is a private town with population of only 2. It consists mostly of a building that's technically the \"Town Hall\", but it serves multiple functions. Inside, there is a a Conoco petrol station and convenience store, a Subway sandwich franchise, an arts & crafts store called \"The Trading Post,\" and the Custer Battlefield Museum- a private museum focused on the Battle Of The Little Bighorn and the Indian Wars period of US history. I'm mentioning this because of how unusual of a place it is- it's very secluded, with no towns and almost no homes around.  \n\n  \nSa'Wade is technically a part of the Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women, or the MMIW. In one of the sources, Nicci Wagy with Warrior Women for Justice (an Indigenous group working in Montana, focusing on reforming the justice system, with a focus on Indigenous rights and systemic reform) echoes the family's frustration over a lack of updates on Sa'wade's case.\n\n\n\nThere is an up to 5000$ reward for information leading to Sa'Wade's recovery.\n\n  \nSa'Wade BirdinGround was 13 when she went missing. She is a Native American girl, 5'4\" to 5'5\" (64 to 65 inch / 163 to 165 cm) and 130 to 140 pounds (59 to 64 kg). She has brown, curly hair and brown eyes. She was last seen wearing a black hoodie with mushrooms on it, an anime t-shirt, basketball shorts, and purple slip-on Skechers-brand shoes. She may have a black and purple Adidas backpack with her. She is known to wear an elk tooth necklace.\n\n  \nIf you have any info about her whereabouts, contact the FBI tipline at (801) 579-6195.\n\n  \nSOURCES:\n\n1.

She carried no identification, and the exact circumstances of her death are undetermined. Who is the Hudson Pier Jane Doe? (Write-up)",
      "text": "[Poster made by me. Photos from Google Images and NamUs. Feel free to share!](https://preview.redd.it/0upk4fqi256e1.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=ba818bc559b296606b22e82c498d47468d1c68ba)\n\nI am back with another write-up and poster for a Doe case! I will start sharing these posters on the Grateful Doe subreddit as well, as several commenters have suggested.\n\nI have given this Doe the name of the Hudson Pier Jane Doe. This name is not official; I will refer to her as Doe for this write-up.\n\n**Note**: I am just a web sleuth/criminal justice college student; I have no insider knowledge or involvement in the cases I write up on. I write these write-ups in the hope of engaging the community with these cases. And bear with any grammatical inaccuracies. I do my best.\n\n**Basic Background**\n\nOn September 30, 2014, boaters on the Hudson River found the decomposing body of a young woman floating near a pier. I have provided a map with the coordinates listed on NamUs (see below). The medical examiner determined that she likely died in 2014, potentially mere days before discovery.\n\nHer remains were pretty heavily decomposed, which unfortunately means that a facial reconstruction is unavailable. All that is available is the NamUs case page.\n\n[The pinpoint of roughly where Doe was located. She was on the New York side of the river.](https://preview.redd.it/a48zevhe456e1.png?width=1262&format=png&auto=webp&s=4bd90e37fc0dcde2a6906b52fbcb39baf7c8c569)\n\n**Identifying Information**\n\nDoe was a Caucasian female, estimated to be between 20 and 35 years old. Her hair was brown, sitting at a medium length. Her eye color was unknown due to decomposition. When measured, she was about 5'3\" in height and roughly 117 pounds.\n\nDoe was wearing layered clothing, definitely the style of 2014. These clothes (pictured with sizes above) featured: a black GAP \"Favorites\" style shirt, a gray polka-dot Wet Seal brand tank top, a black and lace Aeropostale camisole, Blue Asphalt brand jeans, black Converse brand sneakers, and blue polka-dot Aerie \"Boy Briefs\" brand underwear. There were two brown hair elastics on her right wrist, and her toenails were painted blue.\n\nUnfortunately, that is all of the public information given.\n\n**Closing Thoughts**\n\nIt is worth noting that her cause and manner of death are technically undetermined. Given the circumstances, the chances of this being a suicide are high, but it is worth keeping all possibilities open.\n\nThis case connected with me as I read her NamUs page, and I knew I had to do a write-up. Doe wore clothes that I was wearing in 2014; the layered tank top look was super in-fashion. I always wear two elastics on my right wrist. She seemed young, vibrant, and very \"in\" with trends. Which is why I wonder: why does no one know who she is? Why did no one notice when a young woman suddenly vanished? I feel that someone in the city (whether New York or New Jersey) remembers her. Maybe she was someone you went to school with. Maybe she was a neighbor. Or, perhaps, a daughter, sister, or friend.\n\nAll information can be viewed [on this NamUs page.](https://www.namus.gov/UnidentifiedPersons/Case#/14585)\n\nETA: I've been getting several comments on this thread regarding my choice of fashion description, even going as far as to say I used an AI generator for this title. Let me clear the air here: I have never, and will never, use AI for a case write-up. By \"chic\" clothing, I more so meant that the brands were very middle-class American mall, indicating (to me at least) that she was more in tune with trends of the era. No, wearing less \"trendy\" clothes does not mean you do not have a vibrant personality. I made this write-up after completing a major final exam; forgive me if my words aren't the 100% best. Please focus on the write-up and the victim as opposed to my thesaurus slip-up.\n\n**If you have any information about the Hudson Pier Jane Doe, please call the Office of Chief Medical Examiner at (212)447-2030 (Case #M14-05816).**",

      "title": "Who killed loving mother Kathi Kennedy while her two children slept nearby? No motive has been established, and thirty years later the case is still unsolved.",
      "text": "This is an updated post.  You may have seen a previously deleted version of this post.  Thanks for reading guys!\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nKathi Leigh Goff was born on April 9, 1959, in Winston-Salem, North Carolina, to Delmer and Gladys Goff.  Kathi had one sister, Diane.\n\n[Kathi Kennedy](https://preview.redd.it/e0jx6dbu50ye1.png?width=572&format=png&auto=webp&s=71609430c468a7703219aa8ae38cf3c8c2d5bda2)\n\nKathi graduated from East Forsyth High School, where she was a popular student.  She played softball, and attended a local Baptist church.  \n\nShe married her husband David Kennedy in 1985.  They were said to be a loving couple.  They both enjoyed watching Kansas City Chiefs games together.  “She loved to laugh and have a good time and joke around with people. She was a lot of fun to be around,” said David in 1995.  He would echo the same sentiment still thirty years later.\n\nThe couple had two daughters, Jordan and Taylor.  Kathi doted on the girls.  Later on the girls would cherish the countless home movies that Kathi made of them all, laughing and giggling with her young daughters.  “That was her mission in life to be a mother,” said Kathi’s own mother Gladys.\n\n[From home movie of Kathi and her daughter](https://preview.redd.it/c3qgjwqw50ye1.png?width=964&format=png&auto=webp&s=5629b56bb5daa52bbdd59960fcd9733973afa5f6)\n\nOn October 17, 1994 Kathi was watching her two girls by herself at the Springbrook Apartments in Kernersville, NC.  Jordan was four years old, and Taylor was about one. The family had only moved into the apartment the month before, as they were planning to build a house.  The area was known to be safe, there hadn’t been a single homicide in the quiet suburb that year.  David was a few hours away at the Outer Banks fishing with some friends that night.  \n\nKathi was last seen at about 7:00-8:00 p.m, depending on the source.  Early reports stated that two men, one white and one black, were seen outside Kathi’s apartment at about 9:00-9:30.  Neighbors reported they heard screams around this time, but no one called police.  The girls were already in bed, and did not witness any of the violence.  Jordan would find Kathi in the night on the living room floor.  She didn’t understand why her mother wouldn’t get up.\n\nKathi was supposed to take her daughter's to her own mother Glady's house the next morning.  Gladys called Kathi, but no one answered.  Growing concerned Gladys drove to her daughter's apartment.  She found her daughter lying dead inside.  \"I just remember her sitting down on the couch and just weeping and crying,” Jordan said. “I was just standing there with her just watching her, knowing something bad was happening but not really knowing how to process it.\"\n\nKathi had been strangled, beaten, and stabbed with her own steak knife fifteen times.  There was no sign of sexual assault or robbery.   No sign of forced entry was found, and investigators believed Kathi likely had allowed the attacker into the apartment.\n\nInvestigators had some leads to start with.  They were able to clear David, as multiple people, including a hotel employee, confirmed that he was hours away at the time.  David initially named some individuals he thought could have some motive, but nothing seemingly came of this.  Despite frequent media publicity and a reward of 20k dollars the case went cold.  \n\nIn a case like this it is easy to suspect the spouse.  However, investigators have continually discounted the possibility that David was involved.  Kathi had no life insurance.  There was no sign of an affair for either of them.  Everyone says they had a loving marriage, and every indication is that was the case.  David has continued to advocate for justice for his wife for decades, while raising his two daughters by himself.\n\n[News clip on David Kennedy as a suspect](https://preview.redd.it/vrmennhg80ye1.png?width=369&format=png&auto=webp&s=cfb2f26dafa46a221fba53d91b22556c647ae650)\n\nIn 2001, it was reported that investigators tested a suspect’s DNA in the case, but no arrest ever came.  This was the first indication that investigators possibly had some DNA evidence from the assailant.  While officials haven’t confirmed this officially, a retired detective has said they do have DNA.  The veracity of this evidence is unknown.  It is not clear what type of DNA evidence this would be.  There was no sign of sexual assault.  Did the offender injure himself? Do they have touch DNA and if so how strong is it? Can it be tested against databases? \n\nI am from the area and realized I have some connections to the Kennedy family. A source familiar with them presented to me the only theory that I have ever seen mentioned.  Supposedly, Kathi was helping a friend leave an abusive marriage, and this could be the motivation for her murder.  This theory aligns well with the facts of the case.  However, it is unknown whether this potential suspect has been ruled out.\n\nThe family has gone on in a state of limbo for decades.  Last October, a local news station aired an extensive segment on the family today.  Both daughters have kids of their own today.  Taylor has started to explain to her son that his grandmother is no longer with us.\n\n\"He said, 'What happened to her?' and I said, 'She's in heaven with Jesus, we don't have to worry about that, she's great, she's fine, she's happy.' And he said, 'But I love her, I haven't met her yet' and so that just broke my heart because, me neither buddy.”\n\nWhen a fire burnt down their family home recently the family was relieved to find that Kathy’s wedding photo and their precious home videos survived.\n\n[Kathi Kennedy's wedding photo saved from the fire](https://preview.redd.it/jul2kosl80ye1.png?width=654&format=png&auto=webp&s=85cc649bb01daf04c4b02954ee620714c89ca22b)\n\nRest in Peace Kathi.  You and your family deserve justice.\n\n[Recent News Segment](https://www.wfmynews2.com/article/news/local/thirty-years-kathi-kennedy-kernersville-nc-family-mother-unsolved-murder-legacy/83-5a3f7c3a-8ad2-45f0-9fc7-3b0cdcea69fb)\n\n[Newspaper Clip](https://www.newspapers.com/article/winston-salem-journal-kennedy-5/170741062/)\n\n[Newspaper Clip II](https://www.newspapers.com/article/winston-salem-journal-kennedy-11/170743047/)",

      "title": "[UPDATE] The remains of Aubrey Dameron have been found",
      "text": "Hello everyone! It seems like this week is one of major developments in many cases- first, we heard about the [discovery of remains of Jimmie \"Jay\" Lee](https://www.reddit.com/r/UnresolvedMysteries/comments/1ihpsjx/update_jimmie_jay_lees_remains_have_most_likely/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) (DNA tests have since confirmed that the remains have indeed belonged to him), and today we've heard of another sad update in another missing person's case. My original write-up about Aubrey's case can be read [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/UnresolvedMysteries/comments/18ifca6/transgender_cherokee_woman_goes_missing_extortion/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) (trigger warning for transphobia)\n\n  \nTo recap: Aubrey went missing in 2019, when she was 25, from Grove, Oklahoma, USA. She was a transgender woman, and a member of the Cherokee Nation; She also used to label herself as two-spirit, which is a label used by Indigenous Americans as an umbrella term for gender-variant people that references many pre-colonization identities.\n\n  \nAubrey had experienced a lot of bigotry and predjudice in her life, from peers at school and strangers. Despite that, she kept her head high and always looked out for other vulnerable people in her life. Aubrey was especially close with her uncle, Christian Fencer (though he was only six months older than her)- he's gay, and the two always had eachother's backs. \n\n  \nOn the 18th of August 2018, Aubrey went back to Grove to live with her mother and stepfather after she broke up with her boyfriend- the couple lived together in New Mexico. Jay Pierson, Aubrey's ex-boyfriend, said that she moved to Oklahoma to fight her alcohol and drug addiction, but Pam Smith, Aubrey's aunt, claimed that Aubrey was afraid of her ex, and that he threaten to kill her if she leaves the relationship. \n\n\n\nAubrey was last seen on the 9th of March, at around 3:30 AM, as she was leaving her mother's residence. She sent a message for her friends asking for a ride, but nobody replied. Her GPS reportedly last “pinged” at 3:42 a.m. on March 9, about 100 yards from her mother’s house. Her mother reported her missing on the 11th of March. Aubrey left the house without her purse and seizure medications, and told her family that she was \"meeting with a friend\". Her phone last pinged at 3:42 AM on March 9, about 100 yards from her mother’s house. Aubrey's social media have been silent since.\n\n\n\nThere were multiple items of interest found during searches, like a bloody sock or a leather jacket identical to the one Aubrey was seen wearing when she left the house on the 9th of March, but none of the items had any genetic maches for Aubrey. One of Aubrey's aunts, most likely Pam Smith mentioned above, said that Aubrey's stepfather told Aubrey's mother that he had killed her on the 6th of April, but Aubrey's mother denied that when she was asked about it by the police. On the 21st of November, sniffer dogs were brought to the pond where Aubrey was last seen around, and they hit positive in four spots around it- they've also found scent on a tarp with possible bloodstains and a movable pool in a shed belonging to Aubrey's family. \n\n\n\nSadly, remains belonging to Aubrey have been found near South 565 Road and East 30 Road, in the ghost town of Cardin, Ottawa County, Oklahoma, on the 31st of January 2025. A comparison of anti-mortem and post-morten dental and medical x-rays was used to identify Aubrey. No further info about her death has been released, but the investigation is said to continue. \n\n\n\nMy condolences for Aubrey's loved ones, especially her uncle Christian and her aunt Pam, who seemed to be the main driving forces behind the investigation into Aubrey's disappearance. She seemed like a sweet, incredibly kind woman, who had sadly been through a lot just because of who she was. I feel that Aubrey had a chance to become an important and beloved person in lives of so many people, if only she got the time she deserved. Aubrey was a vibrant, caring soul, and the world is a sadder place without her. Still, I'm glad that she has been found, and that she can be properly laid to rest; I also hope that the cause of her death was able to be determined, and that if anyone was involved in it, they will be brought to justice. \n\n\n\nRest easy, Aubrey.\n\n\n\nSOURCES:\n\n1.

      "text": "The Great North Innocence Project and the Ramapo College Investigative Genetic Genealogy Center are delighted to share that Robert and David Bintz have been exonerated of charges in relation to the 1987 sexual assault and homicide of Sandra Lison.\n\nSandra Lison was abducted and murdered while working as a bartender at the Good Times Bar in Green Bay, Wisconsin in 1987. A day later, her body was discovered in a forest region north of Green Bay.\n\nMore than ten years later, David Bintz and his brother Robert Bintz were accused of the crime after David Bintz's cellmate reported that David confessed to the crime in his sleep. The brothers were convicted in 2000 and sentenced to life in prison despite the fact that no physical evidence connected them to the crime scene and there was semen and blood present on Lison's dress which did not match the brothers.\n\nIn 2019, the state of Wisconsin cooperated with the Great North Innocence Project to allow for investigative genetic genealogy to be conducted to identify the source of the crime scene DNA. A genotype profile was successfully developed and IGG research began in 2021.\n\nIn 2023, the case was transferred to the Ramapo College Investigative Genetic Genealogy Center for a fresh look at the genetic genealogy research. Students and staff in the Ramapo College IGG Bootcamp worked on the case in July of 2023 an identified William Hendricks as the potential contributor of the blood and semen found on Sandra Lison's dress. \n\nHendricks was exhumed in 2024 and DNA testing confirmed that his DNA was a match to the crime scene profile. In light of this new information and other supporting evidence, the Bintz brothers were formally exonerated of the crime on September 25, 2024. They will be released from prison imminently after nearly 25 years of wrongful incarceration.\n\n  \nSources:\n\n1) [NBC: Green Bay Brothers Exonerated](https://www.nbc26.com/news/local-news/green-bay-brothers-exonerated-after-nearly-25-years-in-prison)\n\n2)[ Ramapo College: Justice Delayed but not Denied](https://www.ramapo.edu/igg/2024/09/25/justice-delayed-but-not-denied-bintz-brothers-exonerated-after-24-years-with-the-help-of-igg/)\n\n3)[ Ramapo College: New Lead in 1987 Murder](https://www.ramapo.edu/igg/2024/02/05/new-lead-murder-sandra-lison-exoneration/)",

      "title": "Death on Reservoir Ridge: On September 10th, 2023 a man was shot while on a morning hike; Who Killed Paul Gallenstein?",
      "text": "Paul Gallenstein was born August 4^(th), 1959, in Cleveland, Ohio, the youngest of five children. His early years were spent in North Andover, Massachusetts, before his family moved to Fort Collins, Colorado at age 14. There he received both his secondary and undergraduate education, graduating from Colorado State University with a BS in Economics in 1981. In the summer of 1987, he was married to his wife Cindy.\n\nBy all accounts, Paul was an amiable, god-fearing man, who was passionate about fly-fishing. He had an entrepreneurial spirit, founding an over 55 gated community, Sunflower Active Adult Community, with his wife. Though he had no children of his own, he was known to mentor young adults in both professional and recreational settings.\n\nOn the morning of September 10^(th), 2023, Paul was looking forward to a fly-fishing trip scheduled for early October and had plans to watch the Broncos football game with his wife that afternoon. He’d had a procedure done on his heart three weeks prior but was recovering well and cleared by his doctor for physical activity.\n\nSpontaneously, he decided to take a solo hike—something he was known to do. Driving five miles from his house, he headed to the popular Foothills Trail. This trail winds along Fort Collins’s Horsetooth Reservoir. It’s a very popular spot, with the reservoir and its surrounding areas seeing an estimated one million visitors per year. And with the lot Paul parked in being a mere ten-minute drive from downtown, it’s far from out of the way.\n\nYet somehow, no one saw what happened to him.\n\nAt 10:18am a call was placed to emergency services. Two passersby, a female cyclist and male runner, came across Paul’s body on the trail, around Skyline Picnic Area. He was found dead due to multiple gunshot wounds. Where and how many have not been released to the public.\n\nNo weapon was found at the scene. Nothing was missing from Paul’s body, or from his vehicle. According to the two witnesses, they saw no one else on the trail and heard no gunshots. After questioning, both have been cleared. Authorities have gone on record stating they have no suspects or persons of interest, as well as no motive.\n\nOf course, suicide has been considered to be an option. However, Paul had no known money troubles, marital issues, or other concerns. Baring his recent procedure, he was in good health. Loved ones state he was vocally opposed to the act of suicide. Even putting all that aside, no weapon was found at the scene, and his death has always been considered a homicide.\n\nThis case is local to me. I first learned of it through the billboards posted around town and was so shocked that something like this happened in my own backyard. These are the stories I read on the internet, not the things that happen in my own life. I suppose it just goes to show that it really can happen to anyone.\n\nWhen asked about finding her husband's killer, Cindy Gallenstein had this to say: “The very first time I met with the investigator, I told him, ‘if I don’t find out the who, what and why, that will do me in.’ I just want justice for Paul.”\n\nIf you have any information about Paul Gallenstein’s death, or were in the area of Horsetooth Reservoir on September 10^(th), 2023, between the hours of 9am and 11am, you are urged to contact the tip line at 970-498-7331 or submit a secure online tip at [https://www.larimer.gov/sheriff/gallenstein](https://www.larimer.gov/sheriff/gallenstein)\n\n  \nSources:\n\n[https://www.coloradoan.com/story/news/2024/09/09/who-killed-paul-gallenstein-near-fort-collins-larimer-county-investigators-family-seek-answers/75053160007/](https://www.coloradoan.com/story/news/2024/09/09/who-killed-paul-gallenstein-near-fort-collins-larimer-county-investigators-family-seek-answers/75053160007/)\n\n[https://www.cbsnews.com/colorado/news/paul-gallensteins-family-offers-50000-information-homicide-investigation/](https://www.cbsnews.com/colorado/news/paul-gallensteins-family-offers-50000-information-homicide-investigation/)\n\n[https://www.goesfuneralcare.com/obituaries/Paul-Gallenstein/#!/Obituary](https://www.goesfuneralcare.com/obituaries/Paul-Gallenstein/#!/Obituary)",

      "text": "On the morning of Tuesday, August 19, 1969, Fred Miller woke up at 5 a.m. and found his wife, Dorothy Miller, wasn’t home. \n\nThe previous night Dorothy, 48-year-old a real estate agent, had a scheduled showing for a client around 7:30 pm at a house on Grand Street in Burlington, Iowa. Because it was a late showing, Fred had gone to bed around 8:30 pm because he had to wake up early the next morning. Fred called their 27-year-old daughter and the two of them drove to search for her. \n\nThere are a couple of conflicting news reports on where the two went first. One article in the Quad City Times published on August 19, 1969, said they were heading to the house the showing was at, but found Dorothy’s abandoned car on the way and then went to the police to report her missing.\n\nAnother 2015 article written by Andy Hoffman in the Iowa Press-Citizen says that Fred and his daughter actually went to a place called the Maple Leaf Tavern first, but found her car parked a block away, and then went to the police station. Another article says that it was the police who found her vehicle and not Fred and their daughter. Either way, after reporting her missing, police make their way to the home where she had the showing.\n\nThe back door of the home, which was a two-bedroom, two-story house, was unlocked when police arrived. On the first floor, they found a brick and some nylon cord (sometimes described as just rope). When they made their way upstairs, they found Dorothy’s body. She was lying in a large closet, her hands were bound, her dress was pulled up to her chest, her underclothes, pantyhose, and shoes were off, and her bra was loose. She had been raped, beaten, and stabbed 23 times in the head, neck, and back. \n\nPolice also searched her car, which was found in downtown Burlington, over a mile from the home the showing was at. It was unlocked, the keys were in the ignition, her purse was missing, and an “unused camera flashcube” was found on the front seat.\n\nOfficers did a canvas of the neighborhood. They interviewed some neighbors who were sitting on their front porch the previous evening and reported seeing Mrs. Miller and a man enter the house around 8 p.m. They reported not hearing any sort of commotion, screaming, or fighting but they noticed later on in the night that Mrs. Miller’s car was gone from where it had been parked down the street. \n\nThe fact that neighbors saw her go into the place with the man was promising. Even more promising, though, was that Dorothy’s husband Fred had met this man before. \n\nJust a few days prior Fred had gone with Dorothy to show this same client this same house. The client was a man named Robert Clark. And just the Friday before Dorothy was murdered, Fred had accompanied her to show Clark this house for the first time. Fred and Dorothy had picked up Clark that night near the Maple Leaf Tavern, and brought him to the house, and after viewing the home Clark said he wanted to show pictures of the house to his wife so requested another showing for the following night. \n\nDorothy wasn’t able to accommodate that time but agreed to show him the property again on Monday evening. Fred didn’t go with for this visit. They had arranged for Dorothy to call Clark at the Maple Leaf Tavern around 7 p.m., where Dorothy then went and picked him up.\n\nIn an article published in the Des Moines Register on August 20th, 1969, Dorothy and Fred’s daughter says “My mother had my dad go with her Friday night because the man wanted to be picked up at a drugstore at Tenth and Maple Streets, she didn’t want to go alone. They let him out of the car near where my mother’s car was found after showing the house.” \n\nShe says that he was vague about where he lived and worked, and it seems like he just said he was from Des Moines and was moving to Burlington. \n\nNow, because Dorothy had arranged to pick up Clark at the Maple Leaf Tavern, there were plenty of people who had seen him. This, paired with Fred’s description, a composite sketch was made. He was described as a 5 foot 11 good looking, dark-haired, sometimes described as black hair, and clean-cut man in his 20s or 30s.\n\nBeyond his looks, witnesses at the tavern were also able to give police information on his movements just before Dorothy picked him up. Witnesses said they saw Clark leave the tavern, go to a black truck and remove an unidentified object. A few minutes later, a witness saw Dorothy pick up Clark as he walked outside of a pharmacy a few doors down from the tavern. \n\nWitnesses also reported the car he was driving was a black “cab over engine” pickup. It was also reported that the paint job was “rough” and not what the manufacturer would have had. As a side note, I am not a car person, but this type of truck looks unique to me. I also have not read anything that indicates they ever found this truck again. \n\nA psychiatrist at the time told the Burlington Hawk Eye a few days after police discovered Dorothy’s body that “the murder seemed to be so well planned and carried out that I feel the killer is a sociopath with previous experience”. \n\nAssuming Robert Clark is the murderer, his actions are very bold. He allowed himself to be seen in public and interact with the victim’s husband before the murder. This aspect of the crime leads investigators to believe he was not from the area. Burlington was a smaller community, and investigators believe that someone would have recognized him or something would have stood out about him if he lived in the local area. \n\nIt has been over 55 years and Dorothy’s case remains unsolved. Dorothy was 48 years old when she was murdered. She was a well-known and respected member of the community and a grandmother of two. Before getting her real estate license, Dorothy worked at the Iowa Army Ammunition Plant and as a proofreader for the Burlington Hawk-Eye Gazette newspaper. \n\nDorothy’s husband Fred died in 2002 without seeing justice for his wife’s murder. \n\nHer murder is Burlington, Iowa’s oldest cold case. Police there say her case file remains open, and every police officer who becomes a detective is familiar with the case. Lt Jeff Klein, commander of Burlington’s criminal investigation division, said, “We send every officer to a two-week homicide school when they become a detective. When they return, we hand them the Dorothy Miller file and ask them to review it to see if we have missed anything”. \n\nIn my research there are references to evidence that was collected and sent off for testing, it doesn’t specify what exactly. But if this person killed again and DNA was recovered from that scene, I wonder if it would be able to be tested again or matched to anyone in the system. \n\nIf you have any information about Dorothy Miller’s murder or the man who identified himself as Robert Clark, please contact the Iowa Division of Criminal Investigation at (515) 725-6010 Or the [Burlington Police Department](http://www.burlingtoniowa.org/2158/Police) at 319-753-8375.\n\nI am also researching other murders that follow a similar pattern. One I was told about is Catherine Blackburn who was murdered in Albany, NY in 1964. I plan to do some research on that and will post about it when I have a write-up done. \n\nSOURCES: \n\n* Find Saleswoman Dead in Closet, Quad City Times, August 19, 1969\n* Real Estate Saleswoman Found Killed, The Gazette, August 19, 1969\n* Burlington Killer Still At Large, Iowa Press Citizen, August 20, 1969\n* Killer is Still At Large, Quad City Times, August 20, 1969\n* Nick Lamberto, Find Body of Woman Lying Inside Closet, The Des Moines Register, August 20, 1969\n* Burlington Killer Sought, The Gazette, August 20, 1969\n* Sex-Killer Sought at Burlington, The Muscatine Journal, August 20, 1969\n* Hunt Killer of Burlington Woman Stabbed Over 20 Times, The Sioux City Journal, August 20, 1969\n* Suspect Seen in Bar?, Quad City Times, August 21, 1969\n* Death Suspect Seen in Tavern, The Des Moines Register, August 21, 1969\n* Seek Man Seen in Burlington Tavern Monday, The Gazette, August 21, 1969\n* Report suspect in sex slaying seen in tavern, The Muscatine Journal, August 21, 1969\n* Describe Man Sought in Iowa Slaying, The Sioux City Journal, August 21, 1969\n* List of ‘case-open’ slayings in Iowa, Des Moines Sunday Register, September 8, 1974\n* Andy Hoffman, Burlington’s oldest cold case continues to baffle, Iowa Press Citizen, August 1, 2015\n* Andy Hoffman, Burlington’s oldest cold case draws persistent attention, The Gazette, August 2, 2015\n* Gone Cold: Exploring Iowa’s unsolved murders… a statewide newspaper project, The Des Moines Register, July 29, 2015\n* Nancy Bowers, July 2010, Appointment with Death: Murder of Dorothy Miller 1969, [https://iowaunsolvedmurders.com/beyond-1965-selected-unsolved-iowa-murders/appointment-with-death-murder-of-dorothy-miller-1969/](https://iowaunsolvedmurders.com/beyond-1965-selected-unsolved-iowa-murders/appointment-with-death-murder-of-dorothy-miller-1969/)\n* Bob Bruegger, Hint psychopath-killer is plotting his next attack, The Burlington Hawk-Eye, August 21, 1969",

      "text": "Unfortunately I have been banned from the sub and won’t be able to respond to your comments moving forward, this will be my last post:\n\nCherilyn Hawkley was a beloved teacher at Eureka Elementary School in the quiet suburban community of Granite Bay, California, just east of Sacramento. On Friday, October 29, 1993—two days before Halloween—Cherilyn celebrated the holiday with her 5th-grade class. Students trick-or-treated from classroom to classroom, leaving a mess in their wake, which Cherilyn graciously stayed behind to clean up that fall afternoon.\n\n[Cherilyn Hawkley](https://preview.redd.it/fhuag8v3hy5f1.jpg?width=480&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=782b22ad2de29196c98fe98a14db9036458d7211)\n\nBorn on March 19, 1954, in Whittier, California, Cherilyn spent most of her life in the Chico area. After graduating from Pleasant Valley High School in 1972, she married Royal Hawkley, and they had three children: Melissa, Heather, and Ryan. Though Cherilyn and Royal eventually divorced after 15 years, they continued to raise their children amicably.\n\n[Hawkley family](https://preview.redd.it/9xi0ut37hy5f1.png?width=1919&format=png&auto=webp&s=40aacc6282b46a4537e08feb3753f91b34594964)\n\nHer daughter Melissa later reflected, “When I think of Mom, I think of butterflies, calligraphy, art projects. Mom was just super loving and so giving. I love that she read us stories—we’d read chapter books. She was super involved in the community and church. Just an amazing, amazing woman.”\n\nCherilyn had recently moved to Granite Bay for her job at Eureka Elementary, while her children remained in Chico. She was known for her vibrant social life, close friendships, and was dating someone at the time. It was her boyfriend who first sensed something was wrong that Friday night.\n\nExpecting Cherilyn to return home, he grew increasingly concerned as the night went on. At some point, he drove to the school to check on her but found only the night custodian. The custodian said he’d seen Cherilyn around 5:30 p.m. in her classroom, picking up popcorn. When he passed by again about 30 minutes later, she and her car were gone. Another teacher, who had a meeting with Cherilyn at 4:30, left the school around 6:30, and didn’t see her car in the parking lot either.\n\nCherilyn’s boyfriend contacted police, and her name and vehicle information were dispatched to local patrol units. But it was Halloween weekend, and the area was already busy with activity. Few in the community knew she was missing before a terrible discovery was made on Sunday night.\n\nThat Halloween night, an officer on patrol spotted Cherilyn’s van abandoned about 40 yards off the road, parked under trees near a different nearby school, Oakhills Elementary.  In the back seat was Cherilyn—she had been strangled with a rope, which was still beside her.\n\n[Cherilyn's van](https://preview.redd.it/lcrvjhskhy5f1.png?width=1913&format=png&auto=webp&s=24f9001933f6f9a6015e3de52c757a16df7b3cce)\n\nInvestigators acted quickly and eliminated obvious suspects. Cherilyn’s ex-husband was confirmed to be in Oregon, and both her boyfriend and the night custodian were cleared, though details were not made public. Authorities believed the window of opportunity for the crime was narrow—likely between 5:30 and 6:00 p.m.—and joggers later reported seeing her van parked at the same location by Saturday morning.\n\nBut leads were scarce. Cherilyn had not been sexually assaulted, and none of her belongings were stolen. There was no clear motive.\n\nHowever, witnesses had seen a suspicious man on the school grounds that afternoon. He was described as being in his mid-30s, about six feet tall, with a husky, muscular build, hairy arms and legs, and wavy brown hair. He wore blue shorts, a faded pink tank top, and possibly sandals—or may have been barefoot. He drove an older, beat-up Volkswagen Bug, which he parked near the school's entrance.\n\n[Suspect sketch](https://preview.redd.it/hl32iukohy5f1.png?width=429&format=png&auto=webp&s=95edefd1b80cf949993940841058f91818ffb8a8)\n\nPolice pulled over every Volkswagen Bug they could find in the area—some drivers even put signs in their windows indicating they’d already been checked. But the man and his car were never located. In later years, investigators revisited the theory that Cherilyn may have known her killer.\n\nIn 2016, *True Crime Daily* featured the case, speaking with Melissa and Heather, who were 16 and 14 at the time of their mother’s murder. Their brother Ryan was just 11. The sisters spoke movingly about their desire for justice and said they were hopeful about renewed investigative efforts.\n\n[Melissa & Heather in 2016](https://preview.redd.it/nlasvx1shy5f1.png?width=853&format=png&auto=webp&s=b73783677afc05fc2b6a4aec20a2d3301e225a60)\n\nDetectives stated they intended to retest the rope used in the murder for DNA and appeared confident they were close to solving the case. One detective even said, “I think I know who did this.” But no further details were released, and nearly a decade later, few updates have been forthcoming.\n\nIn 2023, on the 30th anniversary of Cherilyn’s murder, investigators released new photos of her in an effort to keep the case alive. Kids from Cherilyn's school were so moved by what happened to her that they erected a memorial to the fallen teacher.  Apparently they have a Facebook group for their class still.\n\nCherilyn Hawkley's family, and community, are still awaiting justice.\n\n[Memorial to Cherilyn Hawkley](https://preview.redd.it/20z6hdthiy5f1.png?width=1131&format=png&auto=webp&s=2594299499bd78c60cef02f713ccdf03d371b261)\n\n\\---\n\n[Abc10 Article](https://www.abc10.com/article/news/crime/5th-grade-teacher-cherilyn-hawkley-california-unsolved/103-3dd05222-7681-4269-9c17-9298531edbb6)\n\n[Abc10 Article II](https://www.abc10.com/article/news/crime/cherilyn-hawkley-cold-case/103-93db734f-b4f5-45a0-9b49-743b6bfd307a)\n\n[Archived Newspaper Clip ](https://www.newspapers.com/article/the-sacramento-bee/174164158/)\n\n[Archived Newspaper Clip II](https://www.newspapers.com/article/enterprise-record/174164411/)\n\n[A Simpler Time True Crime Podcast](https://youtu.be/jyHtz36Rll8?si=_KXHPshaNttcBOFG)",

      "title": "On 2016 New Years Day, New Orleans, Joshua Woodruff was killed and dragged for 6 miles by a hit and run driver. The driver has never been identified in 9 years.",
      "text": "December 2015, 28 year old Californian Joshua Woodruff traveled to New Orleans for a New Years vacation with friends. At around 3 AM January first, Josh and his friends waited at the corner of Decatur and Dumaine Street for an Uber. Minutes later a black sedan going the wrong way against traffic struck Joshua dragging him under the wheels. The driver didn’t stop instead they continued on Highway 90 Expressway, Mississippi River bridge and finally the Westbank Expressway where Joshua was finally dislodged and left on the side of the road as the car sped off. Joshua died of a head injury, hopefully from the initial impact. The car was last seen on cctv exiting Algiers Expressway  at 3:30 AM.\n\nThe case was quickly moved from traffic to the homicide unit at NOPD, who were able to gather a series of cctv and security camera pictures of the car along its route.  Despite the photos of the cars headlight and shape no make and model has ever been 100 percent confirmed by investigators. Also produced was a sketch of a person of interest who police believe may have witnessed the crime, a black teenager with short dreads in his hair. Beyond this, this was the only information released to the public, and nothing substantial came from it. Caren and Mark Woodruff continue to put up reward money and paid for advertisements asking their son’s killer to come forward. No one ever has. There was several allegations of NOPD mishandling the case. While police claim they were knocking on every door along the route asking for camera footage, business owners of the corner claim police never contacted them for the video footage. Joshua’s parents criticized the investigation for not moving it to homicide immediately.\n\nIn a surprising turn, the public and internet became a key factor in progressing the case. Jalopnik, an automotive enthusiast and news site began running a series of articles encouraging people to identify the make and model of the sedan based off the pictures. In 2018 a user claiming to be Joshua’s friend posted on r/whatisthiscar asking them to identify the make and model. Both the Jalopnik forums and a user by the name of OctaneN suggested the car was a 2014-2016 JettaSE, the trim line on the photos match the chrome trimming that a JettaSE with winter tires would have had. \n\nI wish I could end this by saying police followed up on the Jetta lead and arrested the culprit but that never happened. No arrests, no suspects or justice in the 8 years and 11 months since Joshua’s death. The best chance there is it that someone in New Orleans on 2016 New Year’s Day who saw something or gains a conscious decides to come forward.\n\nhttps://www.fox8live.com/story/30883629/new-video-surfaces-in-fatal-hit-and-run-that-killed-28-year-old-tourist/?outputType=amp\n\nhttps://wgno.com/news/local/victim-identified-in-new-years-eve-fatal-hit-and-run/amp/\n\nhttps://www.ketv.com/article/nopd-detectives-release-sketch-of-person-of-interest-in-deadly-new-years-hit-and-run/8633900\n\nhttps://thequarterrat.com/2020/01/08/hit-and-run-death-of-french-quarter-tourist-josh-woodruff-unsolved-4-years-later/amp/\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/whatisthiscar/comments/abi7py/3_years_ago_my_friend_was_killed_and_dragged_many/\n\nIn memory of Joshua Woodruff, beloved brother, son and uncle.",

      "title": "Who brutally killed college couple Bill Sproat and Mary Petry in Bill's apartment near The Ohio State University in Columbus in 1970?",
      "text": "In late February 1970, while much of America’s youth were rebelling, Bill Sproat (22) and Mary Petry (20) stood apart. Mild-mannered and devout Catholic college students, the pair shared a love of the French language, with dreams of one day living in France, where they had both studied. Friends expected them to marry.\n\n[Bill Sproat and Mary Petry](https://preview.redd.it/ewpsqtvfne5f1.png?width=1695&format=png&auto=webp&s=e6ae268a7115ed9311c0279127641fc06dc5cdf6)\n\nBill was attending The Ohio State University, where anti-war protests were escalating. Just over two months later—and 200 miles away—the National Guard would fatally shoot four students at Kent State University, an event many would mark as the symbolic end of 1960s idealism. Or maybe that era had already ended six months earlier, when Sharon Tate and her friends were murdered by the Manson Family.\n\n[Bill's apartment lower right](https://preview.redd.it/qkcoyiu6qe5f1.png?width=641&format=png&auto=webp&s=77fb2e7f004e0b1af1347c7e8f5e5b049d4acafe)\n\nIn Columbus, something equally sinister was unfolding. A man had been posing as someone in need of a phone, gaining entry to homes before assaulting the women inside. Six such rapes had occurred in recent months. But the local media coverage was sparse, and Bill likely hadn’t heard about the serial predator.\n\n[Poster made later for serial rapist](https://preview.redd.it/ulyac8klqe5f1.png?width=1377&format=png&auto=webp&s=86eb8bc01c34b7b7d27dc9063cf0b4d26e096749)\n\nMary was studying at Mt. St. Joseph University in Cincinnati. That weekend, Bill had initially planned to visit her, but he called to say he needed to stay in Columbus to finish a paper. Mary offered to make the trip instead.\n\nBill lived at 178 W. 8th Avenue, just blocks from campus. It appears the apartments are a part of a renovated home, possibly a triplex.  When Mary told him she was coming, Bill’s roommate—fellow grad student Thomas McGuin—graciously said he’d stay elsewhere to give them privacy. Not that Mary planned to spend the night. She arrived around 6:30 p.m. via taxi, after catching a ride to Columbus with a friend.\n\n[Sproat apartment today](https://preview.redd.it/q8p5y1luqe5f1.png?width=710&format=png&auto=webp&s=c71cf3b92e00c68fe3381053a12147e4cbd48506)\n\nThe Petrys were deeply religious. Mary’s twin sister later said she wasn’t the type to have premarital sex. Her brother was a local chaplain. Upon arrival, Mary began calling around to find a place to stay for the night. She tried reaching a local school principal to ask about sleeping at the rectory but couldn’t reach him. Around 7:30, she arranged to stay with a girlfriend—but she never made it there.\n\nAround 8:00 p.m., a young paperboy collecting payments said he saw a man standing on the porch of Bill’s apartment. He couldn’t describe him in detail but thought he looked young. The man reportedly shouted at him: “Get the hell out of here!” Not long after, another tenant noticed Bill’s door ajar.\n\nThe following day, just after noon, Bill’s roommate returned and found the door ¾ open. What he discovered inside was horrifying.\n\nBill lay on the bathroom floor in a pool of blood, a gag in his mouth, bound with wire hangers in a hog-tied position. He had been severely beaten and stabbed approximately 20 times. Mary was found on Bill’s bed. She had marks on her wrists consistent with being restrained, was nude from the waist down, had been stabbed 16 times, and her skull was crushed—believed to be with a nearby bowling ball. The knife used was thought to have come from the apartment.\n\n[Wire used to restrain Bill, possible knife involved](https://preview.redd.it/pufcxdfnre5f1.png?width=726&format=png&auto=webp&s=3f91b9296459e1af79349fe537763138bc88eb78)\n\nThe wire used to bind Bill had Mary’s hair tangled in it, leading investigators to wonder if she had been restrained first. Could she have arrived alone and been attacked, with Bill returning mid-assault? Or were they both taken by surprise?\n\nVery little was taken from the scene, aside from some cash and a small 2x3 ft. rug with gold fringe. The rug was found a week later, discarded in the back of a truck a few blocks away. It had Mary’s blood on it. The reason for its removal remains unclear.\n\nFrom the outset, police had more questions than answers. They soon focused on the serial rapist in the area, releasing a sketch shortly after the murders. The suspect was described as 23–26 years old, 5'9\", about 180 pounds, with brown hair and eyes. Few details were ever publicly shared about his prior attacks.\n\nInvestigators debated whether Mary had been sexually assaulted. She was nude from the waist down, and potential semen was found on the bedspread. Bloody fingerprints were left on the headboard.\n\nThe coroner noted that the victims’ stab wounds appeared in a “sort of pattern”—deep, clustered injuries to the upper back, likely inflicted postmortem. At the time, detectives speculated the crime was personal. But in retrospect, the brutality seems more indicative of sexual sadism. This was the work of someone who derived pleasure from inflicting pain.\n\nLeads were scarce. Police ruled out obvious suspects like the cab driver who dropped Mary off and Bill’s roommate. Neighbors did not hear any struggle, though it is not known who all was home at the time.  There was no sign of forced entry into Bill's apartment.  Investigators never identified the rapist believed to be active at the time—and it’s unknown whether that man simply stopped offending.  Did that offender ask to use the phone at Bill's that night?\n\nThe Kent State shootings soon dominated headlines, and like so many local tragedies, the murders of Mary and Bill faded from the public eye.\n\nSeven months later, another case would terrify locals. Sharon Katz, another young woman, was found murdered in her Columbus home. Her husband came home on September 29 to find her sexually assaulted, strangled, and drowned in the bathtub. In 2006, police linked her murder to local plumber James Keifer through DNA. Keifer had also once confessed to nearly killing another Columbus woman in 1972. It’s unclear if he was ever considered in connection to the 1970 double homicide.\n\n[Sharon Katz](https://preview.redd.it/jphjxbxire5f1.png?width=451&format=png&auto=webp&s=d95f4594a878e1f5bfc9600ca4649cb6568d41de)\n\nThen, in February 1971, another horrific crime: Christina Mitchell and her 8-month-old son, Scott, were found murdered in their Columbus apartment. Christina had been gagged, tied, and stabbed. The details of Scott’s murder are too gruesome to recount—but they pointed unmistakably to a sadist. Years later, a man named John Miller Jr. confessed to the killings and was convicted. Whether he was ever investigated in connection to Mary and Bill remains unknown.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/0kehajorse5f1.png?width=668&format=png&auto=webp&s=71850eb643095b8a79b483c7066d2c7b47f5b385\n\nIt’s possible that early assumptions—that this was a personal crime—hindered the investigation. And despite clearing some individuals, police failed to make meaningful progress.\n\nBut there is hope. In 2023, a podcast, *Mary and Bill: An Ohio Cold Case,* explored the crime in-depth.  Host Justin Glanville, whose parents were friends with Bill, was able to bring attention to the long dormant case.  In 2024, Mary’s twin sister, Martha Petry, told ABC6 she hopes forensic genealogy will finally bring answers. Columbus police have since hired a genetic genealogist, and a cold case unit is reviewing unsolved area murders. The evidence, reportedly well-preserved, may still hold secrets.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/t2yjackdqe5f1.png?width=771&format=png&auto=webp&s=a29c1bf3b1fc64bfc2f52befbcb66e0c93524762\n\nOver fifty years have passed, but justice for Mary and Bill may still be within reach.\n\n\\---\n\n[Article on podcast](https://www.statenews.org/news/2023-09-06/as-ohio-true-crime-podcast-wraps-up-new-hope-for-solving-a-cold-case)\n\n[Eyes On Justice video on case](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=paV6UDxUJTs)\n\n[Archived newspaper article](https://www.newspapers.com/article/the-cincinnati-post-osu/173924297/)\n\n[Archived newspaper article II](https://www.newspapers.com/article/the-cincinnati-enquirer-sproat-petry/173987578/)",

I write these write-ups in the hope of engaging the community with these cases. And bear with any grammatical inaccuracies. I do my best. And, please, do **not** contact or harass any individuals involved in the case.\n\n**Background**\n\nJoleen Cummings was a hairdresser at the Tangles Hair Salon in Fernandina Beach, Florida. A mother of two young boys, Joleen was devoted and caring. Her boys were her entire life. And those in her community knew that; through her work as a hairdresser, Joleen built an extensive repeat client list. Every one of her clients waxed poetic about how sincere and loving of a person Joleen was.\n\nWhich is why her disappearance on May 14, 2018, raised red flags from everyone in her life.\n\nJoleen was supposed to pick up her children from her ex-husband's house that day. When she never showed, her ex called her mother, asking if she knew where Joleen was. Joleen's mother called the salon, inquiring as to when she had last worked. Joleen's most recent shift was on May 12th with a newer employee named Jennifer Sybert. Joleen hadn't been to work since.\n\nLeads were investigated immediately. Joleen's ex-husband was cleared after no evidence tied him to the crime. Her boyfriend at the time was also cleared for the same reason. However, after analysis of local CCTV footage, investigators zeroed in on a new suspect: Jennifer Sybert.\n\nJennifer had driven Joleen's car to a Home Depot nearby and abandoned it on May 12th, making her the last known person to see Joleen alive. That same night, she purchased a carving knife and cleaning supplies and was seen disposing of trash bags in a dumpster behind the salon. Days later, she quit her job at the salon and took off.\n\nPolice found her soon after, living in her car at a rest stop. She was arrested on charges of grand theft auto while investigators built the first-degree murder case.\n\nExcept, Jennifer Sybert wasn't what she seemed. She was actually Kimberly Kessler, a Pennsylvania resident who had been living off odd jobs and aliases since the late 90s.\n\nKimberly Kessler was found guilty of first-degree murder and grand theft auto. She is serving life in prison with no possibility of parole.\n\nJoleen Cummings's body has never been found, but she is legally declared dead. It is believed that she was dismembered, disposed of, and is in a landfill.\n\n**Kimberly's Past**\n\nInvestigators are convinced that Kimberly is not a first-time offender. In fact, she's being investigated in at least two other potential murder cases in Florida alone.\n\nI wrote this brief write-up to help spread her 17 known aliases on this subreddit. This is far briefer than my previous write-ups (sorry!), but I want to help this info get more eyes.\n\nIf you recognize any of these aliases, and Kimberly's face is familiar, please contact the FBI office. Especially if you knew a loved one who disappeared/was murdered and knew her.\n\n**Kimberly's Known Aliases**\n\n-Kimberly L.

      "title": "In April of 1974, twenty four year old Patricia Webb disappeared during her shift at the local adult bookstore in Lincoln, Nebraska. Two days later, her body was discovered riddled with bullets on a vacant farm. Police believe her death may have been a professional execution. Who killed Patricia? ",
      "text": "> *“To me, it has always had the makings of an execution,”* Lincoln Police Sargent Larry Barksdale.\n\n[Patricia Carol Webb](https://imgur.com/a/O5Zz0op) was born on July 2, 1949 in Burnwell, West Virginia. At four years old, Patricia’s mother unexpectedly passed away, and at this point in time, her father was no longer a part of her life. With no one to raise little Patricia, her paternal uncle, Robert Webb, and his wife, Joan, happily took her in and raised her in their own home. Patricia was known to be a loving child growing up, who particularly enjoyed roller skating. Her adoptive parents recalled how Patricia would often beg them to take her to the roller skating rink, and how the three would spend hours roller skating in circles and enjoying their time together as a family. Robert stated that as Patricia grew older, she was a very responsible teen, and he could always rely on her to let him and Joan know where she would be, and the time that she would be home each night. \n\nIn 1967, Patricia won Miss Nebraska at the North Central Regional Amateur Roller Skating championships in Kansas City, Missouri, something that she was quite proud of. A year later, she graduated from Southeast High School, and was eager to start life as an adult, leaving childhood behind. That fall, donned in a satin gown, Patricia married a man she had been dating, but unfortunately, that relationship was short lived and the two quickly went their separate ways. Determined to continue on with her schooling, Patricia enrolled at the University of Nebraska two separate times, but ended up dropping out of her studies. \n\nIn 1972, the Adult Book and Cinema store opened in Lincoln, Nebraska, at 140 S. 11th Street, something that outraged the some of the community. While there was already an adult cinema, Embassy Theatres, in the town limits, being able to purchase and physically own pornography was something that many in the community drew a line at. As the store was still in the opening stages, the police seized a truck full of pornography destined for the Adult Book and Cinema, and the driver was promptly arrested. However, the manager of the store, Jerry Mabie, brought this situation to the courts, where he won the rights to not only open the store on 11th Street, but another store as well, on 27th Street. Despite winning his legal battle, Jerry continued to battle with the police, and was soon charged with distribution of obscene literature and not having a permit to for a coin-operated movie machine. As pornography was not as widely acceptable as it in current times, in 1972 most people believed that the store had been owned by the mafia, and associated it with gambling, drugs, and prostitution. \n\nIn March of 1974, Patricia began to work the counter at Adult Book and Cinema. A year before her employment began, Patricia had began to work as an informant for the police, and it is believed that she may have taken the job at the adult bookstore to help them in their efforts in catching those performing illicit drug deals. In fact, Patricia directly help bust more than 50 drug deals during her time as a police informant until her untimely death. \n\nOn April 18th, 1974, Patricia worked her night shift at Adult Book and Cinema, preparing for a usual night of the steady stream of customers. She never returned home after her shift, however. The next day, when employees returned to the book store to begin their shifts, they noticed the store hadn’t been properly closed down, and the shop door had been left unlocked. When they entered the building, they found that 51 bondage themed magazines were missing, along with a calculator and $30 from the till. A phone cord from the pay phone had also been cut. They quickly filed a police report for the robbery. \n\nTwo days later, a local farmer, Oscar Fiene, was tending to his land on a vacant farm that he owned, and he planned to feed his cattle. As he approached the cattle, he noticed that there was the body of a woman partially concealed underneath the hay. Only a blue arm of a jacket, and a bare thigh, was sticking out from beneath the hay. When uncovered, it was discovered that body of Patricia was completely nude except for one quilt jacket, and a piece of tape had been covering her mouth. This quilt jacket was rare, and they believe it belonged to the killer- it was one of 143 specially made jackets in the size XL, and was distributed by a local feed mill. These jackets were handed out to employees, and occasionally sold to customers. \n\nPatricia had been shot numerous times, with both a .22 and a .25 caliber gun. She had been shot six times in the head, and four times in the upper body. Police believed that the .22 bullets came from a Mossberg rifle, and the .25 bullets were from a semi-automatic handgun, either a Beretta Panther 418 or a Tulksi Korivin. With this limited information, authorities began to try to piece together theories of what may have happened to 24 year old Patricia Webb. They eventually boiled down to three main theories: either she was the victim of a robbery gone wrong, the victim of a sexual assault turned murder, or, that she had been executed due to her work as a police informant. With the body showing no signs of rape or any other sexual mutilation, they ruled out the theory that Patricia had been the victim of a sexual assault, and that theory was thrown by the wayside. \n\nPolice determined that there had been two killers based on the fact that two guns had been used, and they believed that the murder had taken place somewhere other than the vacant farm, as there hadn’t been much blood at the scene. While Patricia’s clothing has never been found, her purse was found abandoned in a ditch a mile and a half away from the crime scene. \n\nWitnesses began to slowly come forward with new information about the night of April 18th, 1974. More than one witness stated they had seen a young woman leaving the Adult Book and Cinema store around 1am in the company of a black male. They observed the woman getting into an older car, which they believed to have been either a Cadillac or a Buick, and that car may have been occupied by another person. They were able to link the description of the man to a possible suspect, and determined that his partner in the crime could have been a white male that he associated with. Both men were known to be transients, and police stated that they believed the men had been the type that you’d call upon to do odd jobs or collect unpaid debts. Sadly for the case, one of the men has died and the other man has since disappeared from police’s radar. \n\nInterestingly, before Patricia had been murdered, she was ordered to testify in a handful of court hearings regarding drug deals that she had helped bust. After her disappearance, since she wasn’t able to testify, half a dozen drug cases had been dropped and let go. These drug charges are small arrests, however, mostly marijuana charges or small amounts of amphetamines, but nothing big enough to warrant such a brutal execution of the 24 year old woman. However, Patricia had angered some criminals in the community, as she had played a key role in setting up drug busts which led to the prosecution of two dozen people, along with another informant. That other informant was never targeted in the way that Patricia was, though, and police struggle to determine if her death was related to her closely working with the department. At the time of her death, she wasn’t currently working as an informant, and had stopped shortly prior, due to them letting her go because she owned $4000 in debt to different finances companies. Larry Ball, an investigator on the case, stated: \n\n> *“We told her that she couldn't work for us until she got those bills straightened out.”*\n\nIn 2017*, Robert Webb was 88 years old, and he when he spoke to the Journal Star, he stated that he still lived in the same house that Patricia was raised in. Sadly, his wife Joan passed passed away in 1997, never knowing who had killed their daughter. Robert said that he and his wife didn’t want to relive the pain of his daughter’s murder, stating to the Journal: \n\n> *“The person that killed Patricia has never been revealed. My wife, before she died, and I, we did not want to know who the killer was. Not now, for it all to be publicized all over again. I have, more or less, buried it all. Her murder damned near destroyed my wife.\"*\n\nJoan was buried next to Patricia in Lincoln Memorial cemetery in Lincoln, Nebraska. Police pulled Patricia’s old files down off the shelf in 2007, to see if they were able to pull any DNA from the evidence located in storage. Sadly, they didn’t find anything. Police believe that the key to solving this case most likely lies in finding whoever owned that rare jacket, one of 143 made, and they still follow up on tips that come in, to this day. Those who loved Patricia continue to hope that one day her case might be solved, and that she will receive justice. \n\n[*] this must be a mistake, as I was informed by a helpful commenter that Robert passed in 2013, and the article sourced must be a reprint from an earlier published article. The date he was interviewed is unknown. \n\n© TaraCalicosBike 2024 \n\n\n\n**Links** \n\n[Find A Grave](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/127501260/patricia-carol-webb)\n\n[The Journal Star](https://journalstar.com/special-section/epilogue/epilogue-38-years-later-patricia-webb-death-still-a-mystery/article_bc73b436-d9a6-52f5-9454-a4717d1096e2.html)",

      "title": "UPDATE: FBI makes arrests in 2022 Brinks jewelry theft",
      "text": "Almost three years ago [I wrote here about the 2022 theft of bags of jewelry from a Brinks truck parked at a truck stop along I-5 in Southern Californi](https://www.reddit.com/r/UnresolvedMysteries/comments/14wk5hq/litigation_and_confusion_in_the_year_since_the/)a in the middle of the night. [It has been described as possibly the largest jewelry theft in U.S. history](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_Brink%27s_theft). We can't be sure of the exact amount yet because of the litigation over it — as I wrote, the jewelers whose bags were stolen routinely lowballed the value of their wares to Brinks to save on insurance costs, meaning that while Brinks believed based on their manifests that it was carrying around $10 million in jewelry, the jewelers say it was really closer to $100 million, and are suing Brinks to cover the full amount regardless of what they told Brinks it was worth, because Brinks was negligent and the theft should never have happened. Brinks in turn is suing the jewelers right back to limit their liability to no more than the declared value of the jewelry, y'know, like their contracts say.\n\nThe circumstances of the theft—two drivers, one supposedly asleep in the truck during the theft while the other one went inside the Flying J at the LA-Kern county line to have some Wendy's—led to suspicion that it was an inside job, by either someone at Brink's or the jewelers themselves, which has been discussed in the news coverage as well as here, in the post I linked.\n\nIt appears now that that was not the case. A couple of weeks ago [the FBI made the first of seven arrests](https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2025-06-17/multimillion-dollar-brinks-heist) based on [a federal indictment](https://www.justice.gov/usao-cdca/pr/two-southern-california-men-arrested-charges-alleging-they-committed-largest-jewelry). It appears the perps were a gang that had previously robbed some other trucks carrying electronics making shorter-run deliveries in San Bernardino County using basically the same MO: trail the truck till it parks somewhere to take a break where your confederates are waiting, tip them off via phone, break into the back, steal as much as you can in a short time without anyone noticing, sell it and split the profits. So the indictment includes those other charges.\n\nIt seems the thieves realized shortly after driving all the stolen jewelry back to West Hollywood that they had bitten off more than they could chew. Several of them deactivated their phones shortly afterwards (didn't work, obviously). And, contrary to early fears that the jewelry had all been melted down or successfully fenced overseas, at least some of it has been recovered (I presume the thieves realized that going to LA's jewelry district with all these valuable pieces in the wake of all this news about the huge heist would attract too much attention)\n\nI do wonder, though, why these guys decided to really up their game by moving from relatively safe jobs on short runs to trailing a Brink's truck all the way down from the Bay Area overnight? And what led them to pick that target? I suppose we'll learn more as the cases work their way towards trial or pleas.\n\nOne thing that does not appear to have changed, though, is the ongoing litigation. The lawyers for the jewelers say the details of the crime in the indictment just prove even more that Brink's was negligent (but, of course, they *would* say that). Brinks thanked the FBI for solving the case but has not taken the opportunity yet to badmouth the jewelers back.",

In 2009, remains of 11 women and an unborn child were discovered buried in the desert near Albuquerque. \n\nWhat bothers me is how this case has slipped from public consciousness. While we obsess over Victorian-era murders like Jack the Ripper, these recent victims from the 2000s have been largely forgotten. Their families still wait for answers and closure.\n\nThe investigation identified several persons of interest, including Lorenzo Montoya, but the case remains unsolved. The killer could still be out there, or may have died without facing justice or may roam around in public \n\nI'm reaching out to see if anyone has:\n- Fresh perspectives on whether this was a lone killer or possibly connected to trafficking\n- Knowledge about how familial DNA or modern forensics might provide new leads\n- Information on similar cases in the region that investigators should examine\n\nIf you know good resources that cover this case thoroughly, please share them.

      "title": "New details in the disappearance of 4-year-old Hayden Manis of Muncie, IN",
      "text": "This is a followup to a write-up I posted a few months ago about Hayden Manis, who was missing for years before his extended family realized it: https://www.reddit.com/r/UnresolvedMysteries/comments/1kwm7bt/dec_2019_4yearold_hayden_manis_spends_christmas/. \n\nI recently discovered an article from local TV station WTHR containing a lengthy interview with some of the people involved in the case. It may be of interest to those familiar with the case, and they would probably not see it if I added a comment to the original write-up. I tried to post before, but omitted the link to the article, so apologies to anyone who saw that post before it was deleted. \n\nTo recap the case, Hayden Manis was born to two people who were addicted to drugs, and at the age of 1 he was placed in the care of his paternal grandfather. Hayden remained happily with his Paw Paw till son Dustin completed state requirements on rehab and was awarded custody. Hayden was around 2 ½. Father and son were seen at family gatherings for the first year, but in 2019, the visits decreased. The last time Hayden was seen by his grandmothers, grandfather, aunts and uncles was Christmas Eve 2019. After that, Dustin evaded all invitations. It seems he tried to make a go of it, but he relapsed into addiction. He lived for a time in a house in Muncie, IN with his girlfriend Crystal, her two daughters, and her father Paul. In 2020 Crystal and Paul moved away to Nevada. In fall 2024, a chance meeting of Hayden's two grandmothers revealed that each had been told something different about Hayden's whereabouts. One thought he was with Dustin, the other thought CPS had given custody back to the mother. No one in the family knew where Hayden and Dustin were, so they contacted the police. When police found Dustin, he told them the same story about Hayden going to his mother. But it was easily disproved. Hayden was with neither parent. Dustin was pulled over for a traffic violation in November 2024, and was found with methamphetamine and heroin. He was jailed, but a relative bailed him out. A week later, in December 2024, Dustin died of an overdose. He took the knowledge of what happened to Hayden with him.\n\nPolice began investigating Hayden's disappearance last fall. They interviewed many people, searched the house where Dustin and Hayden lived with Crystal and her family. The investigating officer has said there are “haunting” aspects to the case. Now a local television station has released a report that updates the timeline on the case and includes interviews they did with both Paul and Crystal, as well as other people. The lengthy article is here. It is not for the faint of heart.\n\n[13 Investigates: New details suggest missing Muncie boy Hayden Manis is dead](https://www.wthr.com/article/news/investigations/13-investigates/what-happened-to-hayden-manis-missing-muncie-boy-dead-body-trash-compactor-indiana-mom-dad-mother-father-dustin-crystal-hall-paul-documentary/531-fe4f1ac6-4112-4ecd-ba6a-7c1b8cace1f3)\n\nSome of the allegations are very upsetting. I include the update because these are new statements that may be important to the case. It also fleshes out the events in a way that has not been heard before. I am not sure what to believe from these people. Crystal seems to be working within an agreement she made when she spoke to the police. Paul is reporting what he saw when he was living with them. Paul speculates a lot and excuses himself a lot. He lived in one half of a small house; they lived in the other. To me, it seems like he should know more than he admits, and should probably have intervened more than he did. But at least he is talking.\n\nOne other piece of information from the article is that it moves the last sighting of Hayden from January 2020 to August of 2020. Paul, Crystal, Dustin and Hayden were seen at the New Castle Sports Park watching a go-kart race. A woman who was there reported seeing Hayden, and Paul confirmed it. I don't know that this changes the story very much, since four years would go by without any signs of Hayden. However, the information does add to the timeline of the events.\n\nI think everyone has assumed that Hayden is dead, but it is still heartbreaking to hear someone basically confirm it. Although there is no good resolution or justice in this case, his family may still benefit from knowing the facts.  \n\n[Hayden's page at The Charley Project](https://charleyproject.org/case/hayden-ian-lee-manis)",

      "title": "The remains of a young girl are found in a wooded area near a rest stop; Her bones reveal that she had suffered multiple skull fractures and chronic ear infections in life- Who was the Northampton Jane Doe? (1983)",
      "text": "Hello everyone! As always, thank you for your votes and comments on my last post about James Valdez- I hope that he will be found soon.\n\n  \nI apologize for being a bit late with my post- I usually use websleuths to find cases to cover, but the site has been down for maintenence from yesterday to the moment of writing this post; Nevertheless, I managed to find a case of a Jane Doe I'd like to bring more attention to.\n\n  \nDISCOVERY\n\n  \nOn the 26th of December, a group of hunters had discovered a child's skull in the woods behind a rest area along Interstate 95 in Northampton County, North Carolina, about a mile from the Virginia border. Once the police was called, more bones have been found- they were scattered, and had the marks of animal scavenging on them, which were found on most long bones, ribs, and vertebrae. The torso and at least one hand were never recovered. It's likely that someone tried to hide her body. Her cause of death is listed as \"undetermined\".\n\n  \nThe forensic investigation had revealed that the child was a girl, aged 4 to 7 years old. Her ancestry was determined to be mostly Black, though she also had some White admixture (some sources outright describe her as \"mixed\"). Her height and weight couldn't be estimated, most likely due to the poor and incomplete state of her remains; Jane's hair and eye color also remain unknown. No clothing, jewelry, or other items were found.\n\n  \nJane's jaw had signs of healing on the left interior border and in the right gonial area (AKA the angle of the mandible)- there was a \"bony remodeling\" there. It's possible that it was a result of either abuse or an accident. She also had a healed fracture of her inferior left nasal.  \n\n\n\nIt had also been established that Jane had suffered from ear infections- described as \"otitis media\", which is a group of inflamatory diseases of the ears caused by viruses or bacteria. Her case was chronic and seems to be pretty severe, as the signs of the illness were found on her bones. \n\n  \nJane had two dental fillings, both in the molars, which means that she was taken to the dentist at least once in her life. Isotope analysis had been done on Jane's bones, and quite a lot had been garnered from it when it comes to her past: She (and possibly her mother) frequently moved throughout the eastern USA. When JAne's mother was pregnant, she might've resided in in the Midwest to Northeast US. Once Jane was born, she might've spent her first year of life in the northern portion of the Southeast US. In the last few years of her life, Jane might've resided to the south of the region where she was found, in the areas of Central and Southern Florida and a region of Central Texas. \n\n  \nIt was speculated that Jane might've been the rest of the body belonging to the St. Louis Jane Doe (a well-known case of a child Jane Doe who had been murdered in 1983; Her body had been found decapitated), but this had been ruled out, most likely when/because more of Northampton Doe's bones were found.  \n\n  \nCONCLUSION\n\n  \nThis story really reminds me of the story of Amore Wiggins, AKA the Opelika Jane Doe, who had been found in 2012 and identified in 2023; In both stories we have a young Black girl whose remains had been found scattered in a wooded area, and who had evidence of previous bone fractures. I don't believe that the cases are connected in any way of course, but the similarities are there. Amore had been abused by her father and stepmother and never reported missing- I feel like this Jane might have a similar story.\n\n  \nIt's interesting that the fractures of Jane's skull are noted to have an abusive or accidental origin. To me, that means that forensic specialists concluded that the fractures didn't have any traits that would instantly point to them being caused by violence. They're such specific injuries too, on both sides on her jaw- I can't come up with any situation that would cause all three at once. \n\n  \nJane's chronic ear infections are notable too; They have managed to cause damage to her skull, so they must've been pretty severe. Ear infections are common in children, but this feels like something more worrying than a simple sickness. I'm not a medical professional, so take it with a grain of salt, but from what I can gather, a more severe version of otitis media can develop in people who suffer from weakened immunity (due to AIDS for example) or diabetes- I wonder if Jane might've been immunocompromised for some reason, hence the chronic infection. \n\n  \nI'd guess that she probably wasn't reported missing by whoever was looking after her, and that this person/s had something to do with her death. It's impossible to tell if they were the ones who killed her due to the state of Jane's remains, but I feel like she either due to direct violence or neglect, and was then disposed of. That's usually what happens in cases of child Does- they're usually killed by their closest people, their caretakers. \n\n  \nLuckily, Jane's dentals and, more importantly, DNA, are on file. All that's needed now is to find the money and experts needed for genetic genealogy, and I think that this Jane has high chances of finally being identified after over 40 years, and the people or person responsible for leaving her in the woods by an interstate like she was disposable will face justice. \n\n  \nIf you have any info about who Jane Doe might've been, contact the North Carolina Office of the Chief Medical Examiner at (919) 743-9000 (case number 83-844).\n\n  \nSOURCES:\n\n1.

      "title": "Missing In Delaware: 14 year old Tina Faye Kemp vanished 46 years ago, what happened to her at the clothesline? Did she runaway or was she abducted in 1979?",
      "text": "I am kicking off Delaware with a case  just a bit up the road from me.\n\nTina has been missing longer than she was alive (presuming the suspected foul play is accurate), and longer than she was  accounted for and with her family. She has been mentioned on other subs but I wanted to feature her here as she is one of Delware's older and longer running missing person's cases.\n\nIt sounds like Tina Kemp was a \"typical teen\" by all accounts. According to her older sister, Brenda King's 2022 interview with Dateline NBC. Brenda described her younger sister as a girl who had \"a few friends but not many\", and that Tina really most prominently was very much into horses. Brenda says Tina would often help their father with the horses at the stables. It wasn't clear in the sources if they owned a horse farm or if her father worked with horses. On The Charley Project description of Tina it states she was \"known to hang around horse racetracks in and around the Delaware area\".\n\nAt 14, Brenda stated that just before Tina vanished for good she had ran away twice previously (within a couple of months of her third and final disappearance). Both of the initial times Tina was found at her boyfriend's home. Only ever named as, Eric. But this all changed on February 3rd 1979. \n\nTina and Brenda's mother, named Ruth, had been hanging clothes on the clothesline that day and Tina had helped her. The family lived in Felton Delaware. They had been together at the clothesline at around 9a.m. yet just briefly afterwards when Ruth went looking for Tina she was gone. Her mother would never see her again. \n\nInitially the family assumed she'd taken off to her boyfriend's once again. Ruth and Brenda had driven around looking for Tina. Eric had stated she was not there. Their search yeilded little and the day after Tina originally disappeared a blizzard struck the area. It was about 2 foot of snow and it shut the area down for about 48+ hours. Tina Kemp was officially reported missing by Ruth on February 5th, 1979. \n\nAccording to an email correspondence to Dateline with Officer Master Corporal Heather Pepper, \"Tina was very young when she went missing, and did not have the means to start a new life with a new identity.\" \n\nFoul play is suspected in Tina's vanishing. However according to Corporal Pepper there are no suspects or persons of interest at this time. I'm not sure if there ever have been or were any in the past. None have been publicly named that I could find. Information about the boyfriend is vague.\n\nTina has been entered into the National Crime Information Center, ( NCIC) as well as DELJIS (Delaware Criminal Justice information system) as well as NAMUS. There have been some Jane Doe comparison over the years but so far all have been ruled out.\n\nTina's father and several family members have submitted their DNA to various familial DNA sites over the years in hopes to snag some information and have as many hooks in the water as possible. They just long to know what happened to Tina just before that blizzard in 1979.\n\nRuth passed away in 2011 without knowing what happened to her youngest child. Brenda, who was 17 when her 14 year old sister vanished decades ago is still seeking answers to what happened to her.\n\nDelaware State Police homicide unit is investigating under Detective Mark Ryde as of 2022 at  302-739-5901\n\nhttps://charleyproject.org/case/tina-faye-kemp\n\nhttps://www.google.com/amp/s/www.nbcnews.com/news/amp/ncna1288995\n\nSo much limited information here. I have read on different threads that perhaps Tina did runaway as she had before to go to Eric's, and something happened to her along the way. I am naturally extremely curious about the boyfriend, his age, his family members. I didn't hear him mentioned much at all in Brenda's interview or any of the limited sources I could find. \nDid the blizzard cover up any possibille evidence after she was gone? \n\nDid she even run away at all after being with Ruth at the clothesline? \n\nPerhaps someone pulled up, possibly accosted her?\n\nI truly hope her remaining loved ones someday get the answers that have remained hidden for so long.",

      "text": "[Poster by me. Information from NamUs. Photos from NamUs and Google Images.](https://preview.redd.it/y1i5bbnw4b2e1.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=53f6d388836c52deacf3b557b77776c2ccb96157)\n\nHello, Reddit! Previously, I covered a [recent Georgia Jane Doe case.](https://www.reddit.com/r/UnresolvedMysteries/comments/1guimpz/unidentified_a_year_ago_skeletal_remains_of_a/) I had such a positive response to that post that I have decided to continue covering these fairly niche Doe cases. Please feel free to share the poster/post around the internet; the more eyes on it, the better. Also, per my last post, I encourage cross-posting on r/gratefuldoe or any other subreddits that focus on Doe cases.\n\nI have named this Doe the \"Texas Butterfly Jane Doe\" because of her tattoo. Sadly, there are so many Harris County Jane Does that it can get confusing. Thus, this is the name I have given her; I hope it'll stick and give her case more word-of-mouth.\n\n**Note**: I am just a web sleuth/criminal justice college student; I have no insider knowledge or involvement in the cases I write up on. I write these write-ups in the hope of engaging the community with these cases. And bear with any grammatical inaccuracies. I do my best.\n\n**Basic Background**\n\nOn July 21, 2020, our Doe was located in a grassy area at the 2000 Block of Ahrens Street in Houston, Texas. I have provided a map pinpoint of where I believe this location was. The area was grassy and located behind a few small warehouses and businesses. It is not disclosed who discovered her or how. \n\nWhat is known is that her remains were partially decomposed, but not fully skeletal. However, the remains were decomposed enough to make it difficult to estimate weight or eye color. \n\n[The \\(estimated\\) location where Texas Butterfly Jane Doe was discovered \\(via Google Earth\\).](https://preview.redd.it/f3svwtvkra2e1.png?width=1008&format=png&auto=webp&s=c1f96d12ac45ff47fe64401c952c6135a39edf1d)\n\n**Identifying Information**\n\nAccording to the information provided by NamUs and the Harris County Institute of Forensic Sciences, this is all we know about our Doe. Unfortunately, a facial reconstruction has not been developed as of posting this.\n\nAs mentioned above, her body was partially decomposed, indicating that she had been dead for likely a week or longer. It is hard to calculate for sure, as I am only a scientist in training, but given the humidity and blazing heat of Texas in the summer, decomposition rates could be altered. A quick search of the weather showed that July 2020 reached temperatures up to 90F, with lots of rainstorms. \n\nWhat we do know is that she was a Caucasian female, likely between 45-70 years of age. She was between 5'5\" and 5'6\" with no exact weight estimation. Her long hair was partially gray; the ends were brown/black. While her eye color is not known, it is known that she wore eyeglasses, though I cannot find a description online of her glasses. \n\nPerhaps her most distinct feature, and the reason that I nicknamed her the \"Texas Butterfly Doe,\" is her bright and colorful butterfly tattoo. Located on her outer left calf, the butterfly has various shades of turquoise, blue, and red in an avant-garde pattern. From the photo, it looks quite large and has some fading to it. \n\nButterfly Doe was found wearing a bra and underwear, yellow hospital-style grip socks, white and pink athletic sneakers, size L stretchy black pants, and a dark blue \"Stronger Than Cancer\" shirt with a pink breast cancer awareness ribbon on it.\n\nIt is likely that Doe had/was in remission for breast cancer. This is evident not only by her shirt but also by the yellow hospital socks she wore. Though hospitals vary on their sock color policies, many hospitals use the color yellow to indicate a patient who is a fall risk. It is possible that Doe had previous experiences in hospitals, cancer or otherwise, and had been a fall risk.\n\nAny fan Wiki is an unreliable source, but it is worth noting that the [Unidentified Awareness Wikia](https://unidentified-awareness.fandom.com/wiki/Harris_County_Jane_Doe_(July_2020)) lists three NamUs entries that have been \"ruled out.\" I cannot confirm the validity of this, but I will note here that the three names listed are Althea Rogers, Tara Blue, and Maria Nelson.\n\nIt is unknown how or why Doe was in this area. If anything was found on her person, it has not been disclosed publicly. Therefore, we can assume she had nothing on her; no phone, no wallet, no purse, and no keys. Nothing.\n\nSo, why was this woman wandering in the grassy area behind a random warehouse? Was she a cancer survivor? Is it known who did her tattoo? Why has no one been looking for her?\n\nYou can find her NamuUs page [here,](https://www.namus.gov/UnidentifiedPersons/Case#/72078/details?nav) and her page on the Harris County Institute of Forensic Sciences [here.](https://ifs.harriscountytx.gov/Family-Services/Unidentified-Persons)\n\n**If you have any information regarding the Texas Butterfly Jane Doe, contact the Harris County Institute of Forensic Sciences (Case #ML20-3041) at (832) 927-5000. Or, contact the Houston Police Department (Case #957815-20) at (837) 394-1872.**",

      "title": "Who killed \"Mother of the Year\" Betty Martin, and her daughter Carolyn, in their upscale Oakland neighborhood in 1964?  Was there a serial killer strangling women across the East Bay?",
      "text": "Wednesday, January 22, 1964, was supposed to be a normal day for the busy Martin family of Oakland, California. The family’s patriarch, Dr. Frank Martin, took his younger daughter, Susan (17), to school, then proceeded to his job as an osteopath. Mrs. Betty Martin and her older daughter, Carolyn (19), who was home on break from Chico State, took the family dog, a small black and white Pekinese named \"T.D\", in for a shot that morning.\n\nThe Martins were a prominent family in the community. In fact, Mrs. Martin had been named “Oakland’s Mother of the Year” just the year prior. All four Martins were dedicated Presbyterians—Betty was an elder in their church—and they were involved in various charitable organizations. The family enjoyed singing; Dr. Martin was a member of the church choir, and Mrs. Martin sang soprano for various groups. Carolyn was said to be quiet and had a “flair for comedy.” She had been very popular at Oakland High.\n\n[Martin family](https://preview.redd.it/5mc4yedwzp4f1.png?width=770&format=png&auto=webp&s=b09747a9371d209e547b4c29c5cbfc1077be17d2)\n\nWhat happened after Betty and Carolyn returned home that day is still a matter of debate. It appears they were attacked shortly after entering their home, likely around 10:20 a.m. They wouldn’t be found until Susan returned home from school around 5:30 p.m.\n\nThe scene inside the house was bizarre. Both women were found next to each other in the living room, hog-tied. Each had been beaten and strangled to death. Most of Carolyn’s clothing had been removed, and she had been raped.\n\n[Illustration of the crime scene](https://preview.redd.it/8bq42ml00q4f1.png?width=704&format=png&auto=webp&s=7f9c7c208f3b5dd819394b6c675acfa8f42f0ba1)\n\nInvestigators believed the women had just stepped inside—Betty had enough time to set her purse and keys on the counter—when they were attacked. Betty was struck in the face with a fused-marble ashtray, which broke into four pieces. Carolyn was also beaten, likely with the assailant’s fists. The killer strangled Betty with an electrical cord from a nearby hi-fi set, and Carolyn with two nylon stockings. The family dog was left unharmed, sitting quietly near its deceased owners.\n\nThere was no sign of forced entry, and investigators were unsure how the assailant got inside. At first, they suggested the mother and daughter had interrupted a burglary. Eventually, however, they came to believe the women may have let the perpetrator in willingly.\n\nThe Crocker Highlands neighborhood is one of the nicest in the East Bay. To emphasize this, *The San Francisco Examiner* at the time wrote, “The neighborhood is dotted with a variety of homes in the $30,000 to $45,000 range. Some are Georgian in style, others traditional. The Martin home is Spanish stucco.” Today, Zillow estimates the Martin home’s value at over $2,000,000. The Martins' neighbors were understandably frightened, as was much of the city. Reportedly, the local animal shelter even ran out of guard dogs.\n\n[Martin home today](https://preview.redd.it/w09ump5d0q4f1.png?width=776&format=png&auto=webp&s=dfc032a47e83bfdf2d2b7ad06f132418f40ee2d5)\n\nNo neighbors had seen or heard anything, and nothing was stolen from the home. Investigators pursued the case aggressively from the outset, with four detectives working on it full time for over six months. They interviewed more than 3,000 people. The case was such major news that investigators from Boston flew out to see whether it could be linked to their infamous Boston Strangler case.\n\nDetectives believed that the assailant may have previously broken into the Martin home the prior June.  That burglar took a bedjacket, and some women's hose, which detectives speculated was related to some sort of fetish.  How similar was this to the nylons used to strangle Carolyn later?\n\nFew details are known, but investigators apparently became focused on one young man—a UC Berkeley student who knew Carolyn. Oakland homicide detective Jack Richardson said of the man in a 2005 interview, “If I could prove it, I would have him right now. I mean today. It was his own mouth. He said some things.”\n\nRichardson believed so strongly in the suspect’s guilt that he went undercover as a fellow UC Berkeley student, shadowing him. But nothing came of it. According to a 2016 *Mercury News* article, the prime suspect is now deceased.\n\nThere appear to be conflicting narratives in this case. It doesn’t quite make sense that the women had just arrived home and also willingly let the assailant in. With so few sources, it’s difficult to sort this out. However, if nothing was taken from the house, it also seems unlikely that they interrupted a burglary.\n\nIf the primary motivation was the sexual assault of Carolyn, then it makes sense to focus on males in her social circle. The killer appeared to use items from within the house to strangle the victims, though it's unclear whether the nylons used on Carolyn were brought in or already present. This detail could offer insight into whether the perpetrator was already inside the home when they arrived. Was the electrical cord used on Betty cut precisely or ripped from the wall? Each scenario paints a very different picture.\n\nThe way the women's bodies were staged appears to be something of a signature for the assailant.  The women's right legs were tied to their upper body at an extreme angle.  The electrical cord was tied about Betty's toe, and then looped around her neck.  The assailant likely intended to shock whomever encountered the scene.\n\nThese murders would draw parallels to the murder of Marian Schiager the previous year.  On February 10, 1962, Marian was accosted in a supermarket parking lot in San Leandro, forced into the car of her attacker, according to witnesses.  The next day her body was found hanging from an electrical cord in a nearby church.  She had been beaten, slashed, raped, and strangled.  Marian had apparently been receiving disconcerting calls from an unknown, mumbling, man prior to her death.  Marian's husband remarried quickly, and it made the papers across the country when his second wife also apparently received calls from the same man, who they described as a \"maniac\".  Nothing seemingly came from this lead.\n\n[Marian Schiager](https://preview.redd.it/0qhugiatfq4f1.png?width=851&format=png&auto=webp&s=e58c7491b9245559fbdf76523a5a9f31eb68cb12)\n\n[Depiction of Mrs. Schiager's movements](https://preview.redd.it/3c63fbsr9q4f1.png?width=1038&format=png&auto=webp&s=0a1680394b22d063a0fe739e8a26e28602b5cf26)\n\nAnother case would be linked as well, that of Jane Stapleton, who was attacked after returning to her San Pablo home late from church, just five days after the Martins were killed.  Initially an electrical cord from a soldering iron was believed to be the murder weapon, but investigators later stated more likely a plastic bag found nearby was used to kill her.  Jane's husband was working his shift as a local policeman when she was murdered.  Some articles say that Jane was not found to be sexually assaulted, and it is unclear what evidence police have in her case.  Police would go back-and-forth on whether they believed the two cases shared the same killer, but the newspapers certainly embraced the connection.\n\n[Jane Stapleton article](https://preview.redd.it/52wfbe3beq4f1.png?width=809&format=png&auto=webp&s=9ad5d7c26dd213ae18ef4faae9057d159e9f0e45)\n\nThe three cases certainly share similarities.  Each woman was a brunette, and each case had some connection to the church.  Each woman had been attacked in a similar fashion, and the timing and proximity between the crimes is of obvious interest.  Was there a sadist targeting women in the East Bay?\n\nThere should be strong evidence in the Martin case, as the assailant reportedly left behind semen—and potentially blood, according to one article. Whether that evidence has been preserved over the 61 years since the crime is unknown.\n\nIf DNA from the assailant still exists, this case *should* be solvable someday. But given its age, it’s doubtful investigators are prioritizing it. Oakland has seen its share of violent crime in the decades since, and sadly, few people are still around who even remember the Martin women. Dr. Martin died in 1991. If Susan is still alive, she would now be in her late 70s.\n\nRest in peace, Betty and Carolyn Martin, Marian Schiager, and Jane Stapleton.  You and your families deserve justice.\n\n[2019 SFWeekly article](https://www.sfweekly.com/archives/yesterday-s-crimes-the-east-bay-strangler/article_f522a172-92dd-599f-9ea9-0457dc7eeea6.html)\n\n[2016 East Bay Times article](https://www.eastbaytimes.com/2010/01/27/a-few-still-remember-the-martin-murders-of-1964-two-of-the-most-notorious-unsolved-killings-in-oakland-history/)",

I covered her case here:   \n    \nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/UnresolvedMysteries/s/Ip02boxtaL  \n\nSo, the Trans Doe Task Force - which helps investigate the murders and disappearances of trans people - worked with the NYPD and the documentary makers of the film \"I'm Your Venus\" to reopen the case of the murdered trans woman Venus Pelagatti Xtravaganza.   \n   \nVenus Pelagatti Xtravaganza was a trans woman of Puerto Rican and Italian descent who was murdered in the 1980s. She was a sex worker and was a \"star\" and standout person in the documentary film Paris Is Burning. She was murdered mid filming and this is covered directly in the documentary. For years, her investigation went unsolved because the New York Police Department didn't care about sex workers or trans women. They didn't even bother to investigate, they were even almost going to cremate her body because nobody claimed it. She was found 3 days, strangled underneath a bed in a hotel known for sex work. Unfortunately, she didn't always disclose her physical genitalia, though nobody knows if she did that time or not.  Regardless, murdering trans women for that is unacceptable.   \n   \nHere's the YouTube clip of Angie Xtravaganza talking about her murder:   \n    https://youtu.be/4ekU2KVP2HE?si=BrtoJ3GwtAbj4HS8\n   \nAs a side-note, her name is \"Venus Pelagatti Xtravaganza\" now bc her family wanted to clear up the idea that they rejected her. They didn't.

      "title": "Jill Dando - She found out something she was not supposed to know that is what led to her death my theory ",
      "text": "Jill Dando was murdered outside her house in Fulham, London, on April 26, 1999. The following year, Barry George, a resident of the same neighborhood, was taken into custody on suspicion of her murder. In 2001, he was found guilty and received a life sentence.\n\n However, he filed multiple appeals and eventually had his conviction overturned after a retrial in 2008. Currently, there are no updates or new suspects in the case.\n\nMaybe that is exactly the issue at hand. One of the most shocking and puzzling high-profile murders in recent history still remains a mystery. Jill Dando, a well-known television journalist and presenter, was tragically shot in the head at close range right outside her home in Fulham, west London, on April 26, 1999, by a shooter who has never been caught. The circumstances surrounding her death were almost unbelievable.\n\n In the UK, shootings that don't involve violent gangs are extremely rare, and murders of women by strangers are even less common. Fulham, being an affluent area, has low crime rates overall. \n\nThe fact that a well-liked public figure was killed in broad daylight for no clear reason was simply hard to comprehend.\n\nI ranked the top theories based on how probable I think they are.\n\n1. Stalker\n2. Hitman\n3. Revenge Act\n\nIn my opinion, the most likely motive is that she discovered something she was not meant to find out.\n\nStalker: \nConsidering Dando’s fame and presence on TV, some people believe she could have been murdered by a fan who was overly obsessed or a stalker, possibly even a pedophile, but that seems a bit far-fetched if you ask me\n\n\nHitman:\nThis theory proposes that Dando was killed by a Serbian assassin as revenge for the NATO bombing of a television station in Belgrade just three days before she was murdered. A few weeks earlier, Dando had also hosted a BBC appeal for Kosovo-Albanian refugees during the Kosovo War. This suggests that her role in reporting on the conflict and advocating for the refugees could have made her a target for some Serbian nationalists.\n\n\nRevenge act:\n There are theories suggesting that Dando could have been a target due to her role in the BBC show Crimewatch, which aimed to get the public's help in solving various crimes. This idea implies that someone who was featured/wanted or felt endangered by the show might have sought revenge against her\n\nDando was a famous figure on television and had actually previously experienced being stalked by an obsessed fan. According to the London weekly Observer, just two weeks before her death, a person who identified themselves as a Serb reached out to Dando. This individual expressed disapproval of her public appeal for help regarding Kosovar Albanian refugees.\n\nFollowing her death, the police investigated various leads and looked into a broad spectrum of possible suspects. Among those considered were a supposed Serb assassin and a former lover who had been rejected. The authorities were determined to uncover the truth behind her untimely demise.\n\nThe situation surrounding Dando's death raised many questions and concerns, especially given her previous experiences with harassment. The involvement of a stalker and the threats she received added a layer of complexity to the investigation. As the police continued their inquiries, the public remained captivated by the unfolding story and the search for justice.\n\nIt triggered one of the biggest criminal investigations in the UK since the hunt for the Yorkshire Ripper, yet the case is still unresolved. \n\nJill Dando transitioned from a promising print journalist in Weston-super-Mare to a beloved BBC personality, often referred to as 'TV's Diana.' Many even drew comparisons between her and Princess Diana. \n\nBorn in Weston-super-Mare, she began her journalism career at the Weston Mercury newspaper and had worked there for years \n\n\nJill Dando began her career with the BBC in the mid-1980s, where she contributed to BBC Radio Devon and worked on the Spotlight program in Plymouth. Her talent and dedication quickly became evident, leading her to transition from regional television to more prominent national programs in London by the late 1980s.\n\n During this time, she gained significant recognition for her work on breakfast television, the 6pm news, and popular shows like Holiday and Songs of Praise.\n\nTragically, Jill Dando's life was cut short when her body was found on the doorstep of her home in West London around 11:47 am. Despite being rushed to the hospital, medical personnel declared her dead by approximately 1 pm. \n\nThe investigation revealed that she had suffered a fatal gunshot wound to the head\n\nIn the aftermath of her death, a neighbor reported seeing a man described as tall and around 40 years old leaving the scene. This sighting is considered to be the only lead in the investigation into her murder\n\nJill Dando's funeral took place at Clarence Park Baptist Church in Weston-super-Mare on May 21, 1999. Over 2,500 attendees were present, and authorities collected more than 1,000 statements regarding her tragic death. \n\nA local resident named Barry George was found guilty and sentenced to prison for her murder in the early 2000s. Nevertheless, after serving eight years behind bars, he was released due to a successful appeal and retrial. To this day, no other individual has been charged in connection with Jill Dando's murder.\n\n1:\nhttps://www.abc.net.au/news/2024-04-26/jill-dando-murder-25-years-bbc/103763480\n\n2:\nhttps://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-66783495\n\n\n3:\nhttps://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/news/uk-news/what-happened-jill-dando-killer-25290884\n\n\n4:\nhttps://youtu.be/NOMOFWgt2jQ?si=_1dGdXr42vDxyEhr\n\n\n5:\nhttps://youtu.be/YR2m6yGaFBM?si=xtLFPrlbuApY-_gh\n\n\nEdit elaborating on the theory she found out something she was not supposed to know/killed to stay quiet:\n\nJill Dando reportedly attempted to inform her colleagues about a pedophile ring at the BBC that included \"big name\" celebrities, according to a former coworker. It is claimed that she communicated this information to higher management in the mid-1990s, but for some unknown reason, no investigation was conducted. \n\nThe year before her death, Dando became involved in a campaign aimed at helping expose/catch pedophiles.  She had been threatened with death before, which led to the BBC going into lockdown, with armed guards stationed at their center in London.\n\nJill in the years before she was murdered had attempted to expose a history of sexual abuse and child molestation involving some of the biggest names in TV, but her concerns were often dismissed and overlooked. \n\nThe BBC has faced serious backlash due to pedophilia scandals after many individuals came forward to share their experiences of abuse by the disgraced TV presenter Jimmy Savile, who was associated with the BBC. Recently, Rolf Harris was sentenced to prison for his involvement in the sexual abuse of children, and police have made additional arrests of unnamed TV personalities connected to these allegations.\n\nA year before her death, Dando became involved in a campaign aimed at exposing pedophiles once again. Fellow BBC presenter Sally Jones mentioned that while she was alive, Dando had to deal with sexual/physical harassment from numerous people at the BBC on a daily basis.\n\nJust days before Jill was murdered, British forces conducted airstrikes, and shortly after her death, it was revealed that the former head of BBC news, Tony Hall, received a call from a man with an Eastern European accent who said, “Your prime minister here. They butchered innocent young people. We butcher back.”\n\n The idea that she might have known too much is not far-fetched, but it seems likely she would have shared that information with someone. Whether it be a colleague or whoever else, someone should have been aware of it. Was this possibility really not taken into consideration during the investigation? 🤦🤦🤦🤦🤦🤦🤦🤦🤦🤦🤦🤦🤦🤦🤦🤦",

      "title": "The Ina Jane doe, a severed head found in an Illinois state park has been identified as Susan Lund after 30 years. Her killer remains unidentified.",
      "text": "December 24th 1992, Susan Lund was a 25 year old mother and wife living in Clarksville Tennessee. She left her house to pick up last minute groceries by foot, but never returned. Her husband reported her missing and a search effort by police over Clarksville was enacted. Information on the month long search is scarce but true crimes have since gathered newspaper articles from the time indicating that the case suffered the usual problem of false sightings. One headline reads that she was found alive and well in Alabama, others say people called in seeing her in Kentucky. The article also reads that at some point in January 1993, Susan called the police claiming to be alive and safe somewhere. This could unfortunately be further from the truth.\n\nOn January 27th 1993, Wayne Fitzgerell park just west of Ina Illinois. Joggers discover a severed head in the bushes on the side of the road. Police searched the area but found no other body parts. The state of the head suggested she had been killed  just a few days earlier. The Ina Jane Doe remained a mystery for decades in the backlog of cold cases. Notable for police exaggerating wry neck syndrome in their sketches of Susan. After 29 years forensics experts Laurah Norton and Amy Michael reopened the case in 2021 and used Redgrave Research to run a genealogy search on a new dna sample extracted from the head. In 2022 they matched it to Susan Minard Lund. \n\nSo we have the head identified and can finally confirm Susan never abandoned her family. Considering she left her house on foot, and ended up hundreds of miles north most likely means she was kidnapped on her way to or from the store. This also means the alleged call to police may have actually been her, if she was kidnapped in December but died in late January she was likely in some sick fucks captivity for a month, and they could have forced her to make the call so police would stop searching for her.\n\n\nNow for the other obvious questions, where is the rest of the body? No other body parts, bones or clothes have been found and matched to Susan. I think the answer to this is that the killer was heading to Lake Rend, a huge lake that the way Wayne Fitzgerell park is a peninsula on. It would be far from the first time body parts or murder victims would be found in the lake if true. Either that or the killer buried or burned her somewhere among miles of woodlands. As for why the killer left a head, it’s possible it fell out of their car while transporting it somewhere or they panicked and through the head out the window before regaining composure and deciding to hide the rest of the body.\n\nThere have never been any named or theorized suspects in Susan Lunds murder. No suspicious vehicles, no enemies, motives or arrests as far as I can find. The 29 years as a Jane Doe doesn’t help the odds of the murderer being caught. We’ve come this far, bring justice for Susan Lund.\n\nSources:\n\nhttps://www.theleafchronicle.com/story/news/crime/2022/03/15/susan-lund-missing-clarksville-tennessee-remains-identified-illinois/7051339001/\n\nhttps://redgraveresearch.com/index.php/cases/ina-jane-doe-illinois-1993\n\nhttps://www.wsiltv.com/news/1993-jefferson-county-murder-victim-identified/article_6b962a0a-a0b3-11ec-a42d-0f8bf0dcea06.html\n\nhttps://amp.bnd.com/news/local/article257582398.html\n\nNewspaper scans reporting her disappearance and alleged sightings:\n\nhttps://imgur.com/TQ6tA0x\n\nhttps://imgur.com/nwANIWJ",

      "title": "Desiring a new life, a happily married couple from Europe moved to an island in Oceania to start their new life, business and farm. 4 years later their decomposed and dismembered body parts, wrapped in fishing nets would be washed ashore on a local beach by the waves. ",
      "text": "Yuri Anatolyevich Shipulin hailed from Russia's Stavropol Krai but soon moved to Krasnodar Krai and started up a successful business where he sold building supplies and materials. Yuri was also a skilled pilot who briefly served in the Russian Air Force and owned two small aircraft. He later moved him and his business to the city of Ryazan where he met and reconnected with an old crush from his school days named Nataliya Gerasimov who by coincidence had also moved to Ryazan and worked as a librarian.\n\n[Both Nataliya and Yuri](https://imgur.com/TyzGXPo) were already married with Nataliya even having two daughters living in Murmansk. Both of their marriages eventually deteriorated and ended in divorce meaning Yuri and Nataliya were free to both marry each other. During my research, I was unable to find any mention of how old the two were, just that they were in their late 40s.\n\nYuri continued selling construction supplies in Ryazan and made good money, owning several warehouses and even buying a massive house in a high-end neighbourhood of the city. Despite how good life seemed to be, Yuri and Nataliya were not happy with their life and even less so with Russia's economic and political situation at the time. One of his friends had moved to Fiji in 2008 and Yuri had visited him several times throughout 2008-2009 so Yuri decided that he and Nataliya would leave Russia behind for their new home. The two arrived and settled down in Nadi, Fiji in 2011.\n\nAt first, the couple's new life went well, Yuri still had a lot of money from his old business in Russia and they had a nice house with a beautiful view of the beach and ocean and to top it off, a swimming pool was a part of their home. Yuri had so much money left over that he would freely give some away without expecting to be paid back.\n\nTheir funds would soon dry up and Yuri encountered a problem. Under local laws, only Fijian citizens can start up a business and engage in entrepreneurship with any foreigners needing special government passes. Yuri tried to circumvent this by simply selling some ATVs he had without a business but it wasn't sustainable and the couple was soon to go bankrupt.\n\nThe couple shifted course and moved to Kachiquari, Mulomulo in The Nasouti Highlands where they started [a farm](https://imgur.com/z3msrin) that they would also live on, grew pumpkins, watermelons, tomatoes, pineapples and vegetables that they would take into town with them to sell at markets. In addition to the farm, Yuri had started up a photography business. The farm like Yuri's previous ventures in Fiji failed to grow and would soon start to actively lose them money.\n\nOn February 20, 2016, Cyclone Winston made landfall in Fiji. The death toll was 44, 126 more were injured and damages amounted to $1.4 billion dollars. While Yuri and Nataliya survived the disaster, it wreaked havoc on their farm and soon their financial situation would plummet even further as they still had to pay a worker they had hired and rebuild.\n\nThe worker they hired was [Andrey Nikolaevich Luzanenko](https://imgur.com/VkM1rRl) and to say he was a farm worker isn't entirely accurate as they were more business partners. Andrey had arrived on January 16 after a personal invitation from Yuri and Nataliya themselves. Back in Russia, however, Andrew had a questionable incident attached to his name. While living in the city of Novorossiysk he met up with a daughter of his who he had next to no contact with.\n\nAndrey also had no job or fixed address. He met his daughter at a shopping mall on April 19, 2015, and left with her. After her mother reported her missing. She was found by Russian police and volunteers with Andrey unharmed over 600 kilometres away from home. No charges were filed against Andrey as his name was on her birth certificate, nothing legally was stopping him from interacting with his daughter and he claimed to return her voluntarily.\n\nHe left Russia for Fiji on January 16, 2016, to work on that farm which surprised many as Andrey had no experience in farming with his only work experience being in telecommunications and computers. The last time he ever spoke to his family was in March when he claimed he couldn't make his alimony payments anymore due to his financial situation.\n\nOn June 14, Yuri called some friends to say that he was selling his car to try and ease their financial situation and on June 16, 2016, Yuri and Nataliya got in their vehicle and began driving off. On June 17, Andrey walked into the local police station to report them missing. The police summoned a few volunteers to search for the couple and questioned witnesses who gave some conflicting accounts of just what the couple's mood was.\n\nMany including Andrey said that they, especially Yuri seemed rather depressed due to the huge amount of unpaid debt the farm was in while another witness said Yuri was very happy with his blooming photography business. Friends tried to call their cellphones and while they were turned on, they'd just ring without anyone answering. The last anyone saw of them was when they headed off in their vehicle alone and were later seen at a resort on Denarau Island having some drinks.\n\nOn June 19, the police found their unlocked car at Natadola Beach and all of their belongings, including their cellphones were found still inside, the keys were also in the ignition, and strangely, Nataliya's clothing and passport were left behind but not Yuri's. [A campfire had also been set up next to the vehicle](https://imgur.com/8RrX3Pk). The police then made their way to the farm and their house which had been built out of shipping containers.\n\nThey searched the entire home and property and noted that their iPads were on a table set up on the veranda, Also on the veranda were a bunch of empty liquor bottles. Their beds had not been made and were a mess, Yuri had all his expensive camera and photography equipment haphazardly stuffed into a corner and they had suitcases stuffed with clothing. The police assumed that this meant they must've left in a hurry. The only thing missing from the home was a chainsaw. The police also [took their second car, a pickup truck](https://imgur.com/2sLt5pm) away to forensically examine it. Inside this vehicle, police found some sand which they wanted to test against the sand from Natadola Beach but nothing seems to of come from this.\n\nBased on the circumstances the police believed that they may have boarded a boat to sail away, went in hiding to escape from their debts or may have even taken their own lives to escape from said debt. In case they did board a yacht to sail outside of Fiji's maritime boundaries, The police contacted Interpol for help. Some said that in the days leading up to their disappearance, they had taken up smoking and drinking heavily which was very out of character for them. On the other hand, some dispute and deny these as simply untrue.\n\nOn June 24, the waves carried decomposing body parts to the shores of Natadola Beach, just a few hundred meters away from where Yuri and Nataliya's car was found. The body parts were discovered by a resort security guard doing his rounds. [The police](https://imgur.com/FxVUtmN) collected the body parts which were wrapped up in a fishing net and sent them away for a medical examiner and forensic scientists to analyze. After this discovery, [the police and divers](https://imgur.com/OB2eozA), alongside help from the Fijian navy and coast guard would scour the entire beach in hopes of finding more.\n\nAnd more they did find as many more decomposing remains littered the beach including a plastic bag weighed down by rocks. Inside the bag was a pair of human feet severed from the ankle, wrapped in a fishing net. They also recovered human legs. On June 26, another bag containing a pair of feet also washed ashore and was discovered by a jet ski operator and diver who worked at a local watersports store.\n\nWhile looking for bodies they also looked for witnesses. One was a security guard employed by a resort adjacent to the beach. At around 3:00 a.m. on June 17, he shone his flashlight at a man he described as \"white from the hip up and black downwards\" he turned around once the light shined on him but no one could see his face as he was holding a cellphone in front of it. Afterward, he turned around and walked up a dirt road leading away from the beach. He was so white he was described as a \"ghostly figure\" The security guard didn't follow him because he technically wasn't trespassing on the public beach or doing anything wrong and also he felt intimidated by him.\n\nThe police's frustration with local security guards did not end there. On June 22, one of the guards (not the same as the other two mentioned) was struck by a foul odour when doing his rounds. There he was ultimately found a fishing net tied shut with a fishing line. Inside was a bunch of rotting internal organs. Because they were giving off a bad smell and because he thought they were animal rather than human, he picked up the net and chucked it back into the water.\n\nLater they saw someone else's torch walk onto the beach and out into the water. This also confused them as it was still dark out and the ocean was rough and choppy at that time so whoever this was, he was putting his life in grave danger. Eventually, the other flashlight turned off and this late-night swimmer eventually left. After this second incident, they realized that the part they described as \"black downwards\" was likely a wet suit or diving suit.\n\nAs Fiji didn't have its own facilities for testing DNA evidence, they sent the samples abroad via Interpol. The samples were sent to Russia specifically so local police could take samples from Yuri and Natlia's relatives. On July 3, the tests came back and positively identified the remains as belonging to Yuri and Nataliya. On July 4, a couple from New Zealand discovered a decomposed human head floating on the surface of the water and wrapped in a net fastened together by a fishing line. Around 5 stones were also used to weigh the net down but they either broke through the net or slipped through allowing the head to float up to the surface. [The police collected](https://imgur.com/nhnEy4s) the head and identified it as Yuri. \n\nOn July 7, the police announced that unless it was an arrest, they would no longer issue any further comments on the case publically. This was the straw that broke the camel's back when it came to the criticism they were facing. While the investigation itself was competent enough, many didn't think that justice was their main priority when compared to protecting tourism. Throughout the entire investigation, the beach remained open and the police would continuously tell the public not to speculate on the case simply because of the impression it may give people of Fiji. The Russian Embassy in Canberra, Australia also refused to comment on the case.\n\nThe police defended this decision though, they said that it was to protect the integrity of the investigation, one which was of a sensitive nature and reiterated that they were still keeping the case open. Many people saw that the police, navy and even some soldiers from Fiji's military were still stationed at the beach and thoroughly searching it for more body parts. K-9 dogs were also brought in to try and lead police to any extra remains.\n\nNaturally, the first suspect was Andrey. The police moved in to detain him for questioning but he denied any involvement and they had no cause to hold him and not even any piece of evidence either. There didn't appear to be a motive as well but many still thought he was suspicious and hiding something. The police seized Andrey's passport and he was banned from leaving Fiji until after the investigation had finished.\n\nThe trail went completely cold until September 20, 2016, on that day a fisherman went out diving for fish when he found nets and fishing line caught on a reef. The net was green and the fishing line blue, that was exactly the same as the net and line where all the other body parts were found and he found this at the same beach. [The police were summoned](https://imgur.com/r0pAjcS) and they returned to Natadola Beach [with their divers](https://imgur.com/DD6cZO7). On September 22, they only recovered one extra body part, a piece of the body severed from below the navel and just above both knees. Testing identified it as belonging to Nataliya.\n\nOn September 26, the police transferred the case to The Office of The Director of Public Prosecutions. This made many believe that the case was actually solved and charges would soon be laid forward. They were left disappointed when no updates were announced and leaving it unknown why the case file was transferred.  \n\nThere wouldn't be an update until April 14, 2017, when it was made abundantly clear that no, the case was still unsolved and they offered a large cash reward to anyone who could provide information that would lead to an arrest. Over the years the police would occasionally re-open the case but swiftly close it due to a lack of any new leads. \n\nSince it appeared as if the police officially and fully cleared Andrey, a new set of theories and speculation was all that was left. Back in Russia, many spread a theory that Yuri had some dealings with the organized crime in Russia who followed him all the way from Russia to their new home so in retaliation. Other Russian publications spread the theory that Yuri and Nataliya were murdered for ritual purposes by a local sect.\n\nThe last update I can find on the case comes from 2018 when it was listed as

      "text": "We are Traci Onders, Monique Platt and Megan Pasika from u/DNADoeProject \\- ask us anything! We will be hosting an AMA tomorrow on **Wednesday** **11 June from 4pm to 8pm Eastern Time**, and we'll be putting our answers in the comments of this post.\n\nThe [DNA Doe Project](http://dnadoeproject.org) is a non-profit organization dedicated to reuniting John and Jane Does with their identities. We have solved 138 cases across North America using investigative genetic genealogy (IGG), including [Pamela Walton](https://dnadoeproject.org/case/transgender-julie-doe/) (formerly known as Transgender Julie Doe), [James Freund](https://dnadoeproject.org/case/sumter-jock-doe-1976/) and [Pamela Buckley ](https://dnadoeproject.org/case/sumter-jane-doe-1976/)(formerly known as the Sumter County Does) and [Keith Bibbs](https://dnadoeproject.org/case/adam-doe-newton-co-1983/) (formerly known as Adam Doe). You can also visit our website to look at some of the other 200+ cases we've worked or are working on: [https://dnadoeproject.org/case-portfolio/](https://dnadoeproject.org/case-portfolio/)\n\nOur identification of [Marcia King](https://dnadoeproject.org/case/buckskin-girl/) in 2018 was the first publicly announced use of IGG to identify a Doe. All genealogy research is performed pro bono by our talented volunteer investigative genetic genealogists - whether a case takes two hours or five years to solve, we will keep on working until it's resolved.\n\n**Traci Onders** is an experienced Accredited Investigative Genetic Genealogist who has worked extensively at the intersection of DNA, family history, and cold case investigations. She has been involved in over 40 investigative genetic genealogy (IGG) cases, in collaboration with law enforcement to help identify unidentified human remains and provide leads in violent crimes. Prior to this, she played a central role at an adoption support nonprofit, where she helped reunite more than 325 adoptees with their birth families and provided guidance on hundreds of additional cases. She currently serves as a Team Lead and Educational Programming Specialist with the DNA Doe Project and is a Program Assistant at the Ramapo College IGG Center, where she supports classroom instruction and guides student teams in live casework. At the heart of her work is a clear mission: to help people find answers by making complex DNA information understandable, actionable, and deeply human.\n\n**Monique Platt** has been researching traditional genealogy since 2006 and began teaching herself genetic genealogy several years ago to break through a personal brick wall. After reading about its launch in a press release on Reddit, she applied for the Ramapo IGG Certificate Program and was a member of the inaugural cohort in spring 2023. She is currently serving as a volunteer with the DNA Doe Project, a Program Assistant to the Ramapo Cert Program and an IGG researcher with Bode Technology. Her casework has allowed her to investigate Jane and John Does from Alaska to Louisiana to New Jersey, as well as the unique opportunity to assist in overturning a wrongful conviction (the exoneration of Robert & David Bintz). She has been involved in over 30 IGG cases including Stark County John Doe 2001 (Anthony Gulley), Smith County Jane Doe 1985 (Sindy Gina Crow), Pima County Bus Stop Jane Doe 1999 (Charlotte Petreikis), and Scattered Man John Doe (Henry Goodsell). She can usually be found lurking on Reddit or at her desk hyperfocusing on a DNA Painter profile, but if she's not there she's probably looking at art, reading a book while the Merlin app tells her which birds are singing, or out hiking with her family.\n\n**Megan Pasika** (they/them) is an investigative genetic genealogist and team leader at DNA Doe Project, which they joined in 2019. Their first case was Larry Porter (formerly Butler County John Doe 1997). They have been involved in over 20 cases, including Pamela Walton (Julie Doe), Richard Bunts/Bunce (Hudson John Doe), Louis Gattaino (Rock County John Doe), Ronnie Kirk (Chimney Doe), and Live Oak Doe (name withheld). They are also a moderator for the Genealogy Discord, the largest such community on Discord; one of the contributors to r/missingmap, which maps missing and unidentified people worldwide; and are a longtime contributor to Wikipedia and Find A Grave. Although casework and their own family history has taken them on a global trip, they specialize in Eastern European research, particularly in western Ukraine. On the rare occasion they aren't doing genealogy, they can be found lovingly tending to their garden, walking old cemeteries, or scouring secondhand shops in the English countryside.\n\nRedditors may wish to assist our mission by uploading their DNA data to the three DNA databases we have access to - [GEDmatch](https://www.gedmatch.com/), [FamilyTreeDNA](https://www.familytreedna.com/) and [DNA Justice](https://www.dnajustice.org/) \\- if they are comfortable doing so. Every person who uploads could be the crucial match we've been waiting for to bring answers to a family and solve a cold case! If you'd like to support our work with a donation, please visit the Donate page on our website here: [https://dnadoeproject.org/donate/](https://dnadoeproject.org/donate/)\n\nWe look forward to answering all your questions!!\n\nEDIT: Thank you everyone for such great questions!!! If any more come through later tonight, we'll make sure to answer them tomorrow.",

      "text": "Editor’s note: I was falsely accused of using A.I. to generate my last case write-up on [The Untimely Death of Jeffrey Boucher](https://www.reddit.com/r/UnresolvedMysteries/comments/1ipgwk2/the_untimely_death_of_jeffrey_boucher/) and I come here today firmly denying these unfounded allegations made against me and my good name. I love to write (mainly novella) and have been following the true crime community for over 20 years now. I take my work seriously and put a lot of time and effort into my posts here. It starts out with a pen put to pad (!) and winging it through a rough draft before running it through spellcheck and conducting a fair amount of research on the cases I share with you all. I correct my mistakes and crosscheck the facts to the best of my abilities while the draft undergoes several revisions before the final copy is published to reddit. I’m not a professional by any means, but as an amateur journalist and fan of the true crime genre, this community seemed like it would be a good fit for me. I’m not against debating topics or taking constructive criticism; I actually encourage it. Thanks to my fans & followers for their continued support and the upvotes and comments down below. It motivates me to do more of these. Let’s get right into it now, shall we. Today’s case write-up originates out of Orangeville, Ontario, Canada.\n\nOn the night of August 29, 2010, 42-year-old Sonia Varaschin would leave her parents home in Bolton, Ontario, and be seen alive for the last time as she drove herself home to Orangeville. Orangeville sits in Dufferin County and has a growing population of 30,167 and counting. Bolton to Orangeville is approx. a ½ hr drive in fair conditions.\n\nSonia presumably would have readied herself for bed that evening as she was due at work the very next day. Sonia would have laid her head down expecting to rise for work the next morning. Unfortunately for her, this would be the last time Sonia was known to be alive. Sometime through the night and into the wee morning hours of August 30, Sonia was blindsided in her sleep by a coward and tragically killed for no apparent rhyme or reason.\n\nSonia’s death would be discovered early the next day, with a Toyota Corolla, white in colour, found abandoned in downtown Orangeville adjacent to the town hall. (Some reports differ on where exactly the car was found). Both the trunk of the car and the driver side door were left open and blood was visible on the rear bumper. The distance between Sonia’s place and the town hall was said to be not very far on foot.\n\nThe area was immediately sealed off and police were quick to run the plate numbers, which is what led them to Varaschin in the first place. Police would visit her townhome on Spring St and the door would be found unlocked with no sign of forced entry or struggle within the home. Once inside, police investigators found the interior of the home to be covered in blood but no sign of Sonia was found after completing a full search of the house. It’s probable to think the killer left the home covered in blood before Sonia was put into the trunk of the car.\n\nPolice would initiate this murder investigation by canvasing the entire neighbourhood, speaking to area residents and requesting any CCTV footage they may have to assist in the investigation. One woman was quoted as saying she heard screaming and tires squealing as the killer made good on their escape. The woman chose not to report this and instead went back to sleep. It wasn’t until the next day when she read the news that she thought these two events could be related.\n\nThere were now two separate crime scenes being processed in the town of Orangeville and the search for Sonia’s killer was on. Police would speak to the people closest to Sonia but still nothing substantial could be gleaned from the initial investigation. Nobody knew who would want to harm Sonia or why they would do that. Sonia had no known enemies, did not consume drugs or alcohol, and most certainly did not live a high-risk lifestyle. She also wasn’t said to be romantically involved with anyone at the time of her disappearance. Investigators were truly at a standstill in the investigation.\n\nSonia worked as a nurse and loved her chosen career path. She was reportedly well-liked and respected by her peers, while also being quick to turn a frown upside down on the face of a child and bring them a bit of joy each day. Sonia could only be described by the people who knew her as caring & compassionate, fun and outgoing. (I wasn’t able to determine exactly how long Sonia had worked in nursing).\n\nInvestigators continued to work the case and vowed to catch the killer or killers responsible for Sonia’s death. It wouldn’t be long until a few big breaks would pop up in the case. One of those being a DNA sample recovered from crime scene #2 and the second, a bloody bootprint left behind. Expert analysis and further testing of this bootprint revealed a few key details: police were able to determine the size & style of this particular boot and determined it was sold exclusively at Mark’s Work Warehouse. This seemed like the most promising lead yet but I wasn’t able to find any photos or physical description of what this boot is said to have looked like.\n\nMany avenues were explored in this investigation but no further evidence would emerge until the morning of September 5, 2010, approx. one week after Sonia went missing. A dogwalker would stumble upon a set of human remains in nearby Caledon. The remains were carefully recovered from a wooded area along Beech Grove Side Rd and would be confirmed days later to be those of Sonia Varaschin. Orangeville to Caledon is approx. 20 mins in moderate conditions. Police now had a bit more to work with in this investigation but that would not stop them from calling on the RCMP & FBI for help in the investigation. With the help and support of RCMP officers and the FBI’s Behavioural Analysis Unit, they were able to generate a suspect profile and release a few tidbits to the public. Those tidbits were:\n\n* Suspect may have missed work or other important events in their life in the aftermath of this crime.\n* Suspect would have discarded blood-soaked boots & clothing somewhere along the way.\n* Suspect may have increased their drug/alcohol intake or started abusing hard drugs.\n* Suspect may have had a change in behaviour following the crime.\n* Suspect was very familiar with Orangeville and surrounding areas.\n* Suspect may have altered their appearance following the crime.\n* Suspect wore size 11-12 work boots.\n\nAside from coming up with a suspect profile, police would turn their eyes to DNA testing & analysis in another last-ditch attempt to find the killer or killer(s) responsible for Sonia’s premature death. Investigators would go on to utilise STRmix technology, DNA phototyping and forensics in this ongoing investigation but nothing fruitful seems to have come of it (even now, in 2015). Investigators would now take it a step further by requesting DNA samples from all of the men aged 18 or over who were close to Sonia or knew of Sonia. The men were allowed to contact a lawyer beforehand and the cheek swabs would only be done on an entirely voluntary basis. It’s not known how many of these men submitted a sample to police or if any of them even did. This could have been an investigative tactic as police were particularly keen on hearing about anybody suddenly moving or disappearing from Orangeville after they announced their plans to collect DNA. Any person who didn’t provide their DNA would be put under intense scrutiny, with or without merit. Any DNA that wasn’t a match would be destroyed by the Centre for Forensic Sciences, police added.\n\nPolice at some point in this investigation would also release CCTV footage of two people seen in a gazebo (Global News has it down below) near to where Sonia’s lifeless body was ultimately discovered. Those individuals have since come forward and cleared themselves of any wrongdoing, bringing the police right back to square one where they started.\n\nOver the years and on anniversary dates of her death, police have used a variety of media channels to reiterate their stance on this very-much-open investigation and their commitment to solve it. [They released an episode on their official YouTube channel focused on Sonia as part of their series on historical and unsolved cases.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMR_5CJfzuY) In October of 2020, Global News would air an episode of “Crime Beat” focused on the case and brought it to a much wider audience. Veteran crime reporter and investigative journalist Catherine McDonald would interview Sonia’s mother, Michelle, and the lead investigator at the time, Det.-Insp. Shawn Glassford. (Sonia’s father was unable to leave his bedroom for many months following the death of his dear daughter, and so he was not featured in the programme). The case file has since been handed over to OPP Det.-Insp. Andy Karski, who says more than 1,500 tips have been vetted since the investigation started.\n\n15 years. That’s how long it’s been since Sonia’s life was taken away from her. There is a serious shortage of nurses in Ontario and Sonia should still be here with us today putting smiles on people’s faces and providing patients with adequate care. May the memory of Sonia Varaschin be a blessing to all who knew her and worked alongside her, and may the person or persons responsible for this heinous act be caught and brought to justice. Her family deserve that much.\n\nA $50,000 cash reward remains in place for anyone with any information leading to the arrest and conviction of those responsible for Sonia’s death. People are encouraged to contact the OPP Orangeville Detachment @ 1-888-310-1122 or Crime Stoppers anonymously @ 1-800-222-8477 (TIPS).\n\nSOURCES:\n\n* [https://ici.radio-canada.ca/nouvelle/497437/meurtre-sonia-varaschin-enquete](https://ici.radio-canada.ca/nouvelle/497437/meurtre-sonia-varaschin-enquete)\n* [https://globalnews.ca/news/10727233/sonia-varaschin-murder-information-appeal-continues/](https://globalnews.ca/news/10727233/sonia-varaschin-murder-information-appeal-continues/)\n* [https://www.ctvnews.ca/kitchener/article/five-years-later-still-no-answers-in-sonia-varaschin-case/](https://www.ctvnews.ca/kitchener/article/five-years-later-still-no-answers-in-sonia-varaschin-case/)\n* Somewhere in My Memory 🧡",

      "text": "On July 21, 1991, at approximately 6:30am, a security guard arrived to begin his shift at Saint Maur Monastery in Indianapolis, Indiana. As he entered the south gate entrance, along Michigan Road, which overlooked the Monastery's lake and recreational areas, he noticed someone lying in the ditch on the roadside. As he neared, he quickly realized that the figure was a deceased man. \n\nThe man was identified as 22-year-old Matthew James. Matthew was found fully clothed, lying facedown on the ground. An autopsy determined a shotgun wound to the back had ended his life. Matthew’s time of death was placed at approximately midnight. \n\nMatthew’s car, a 1985 blue four door Mazda, was discovered ten blocks south of the scene parked along North Caroline Avenue. The car was unlocked, in park, and the engine was still running. According to several witnesses, the car had been parked in the location sometime after 10pm. Robbery was suggested as the likely motive, however police never disclosed what, if anything, was missing from the car. \n\nMatthew was last seen on the evening of July 20th. He and several friends had met for some drinks at a nearby Broad Ripple bar. He left around 9pm, telling them he planned to meet with an unnamed woman for a date at 10pm. Investigators believe Matthew returned to his apartment, before then heading out to meet the woman. However, according to her, he never showed up for their date. \n\nMatthew was a student at Purdue University Indianapolis and worked part time as a maintenance man at a small motel in town, The Knights Inn. He was also a devout member of The First Christian Church. According to his friends and family, Matthew was “an easy going guy” and had no enemies they were aware of. \n\nWith no suspects, authorities, in an effort to potentially spur new leads, announced a five thousand dollar reward for information leading to an arrest. Meanwhile, Matthew's father, Steve, took the investigation into his own hands. He spent his time tirelessly distributing flyers near the site of his son's murder, knocking on doors, and asking locals in the area questions in the hopes someone may have seen something. Steve even doubled the reward offer, bringing it to ten thousand dollars. \n\nIn December 1992, Steve, Matthew's mother Karen, and his younger brother, Aaron, shared their story with The Indianapolis Star newspaper. They spoke of Matthew’s life and death, their enduring pain, and their hope that the person responsible would one day be brought to justice. Unfortunately despite their efforts, no viable leads ever materialized and the case went cold. \n\nThe murder of Matthew James remains unsolved. \n\n**Note:** Please excuse the extremely minimal sources listed below. I could not find anything using google, nor find any mention of Matthew’s case on the Indiana State Police Cold Case website. Matthew’s family chose to have his remains cremated, so, to my knowledge, no Find A Grave exists either. All of the information I obtained about this case came from the newspaper archives and ancestry. \n\n**Sources**\n\n[Newspaper Clippings, Death Certificate](https://imgur.com/a/28SECgb)\n\nhttps://www.newspapers.com (Link to newspapers.com per the requirements of this sub.)",

      "text": "As Halloween approaches, I'm always reminded of the case of Martha Moxley, who was murdered on the night of October 30, 1975 near her home in Greenwich, Connecticut. I first heard of the case on Dateline or one of the investigative true crime shows in the 90s. It is very well known and has been covered in all sorts of media, including articles, books both fiction and nonfiction, television shows, and podcasts. In spite of its familiarity, the case remains controversial, tragic, disturbing, and, in my opinion, fascinating.  \n\nPart 1  |  [Part 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/UnresolvedMysteries/comments/1g65mwe/death_at_halloween_the_murder_of_martha_moxley/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)  |   [Part 3](https://www.reddit.com/r/UnresolvedMysteries/comments/1g6673w/death_at_halloween_the_murder_of_martha_moxley/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)   \n\n**Background**\n\nMartha Moxley was born in California on August 30, 1960, to David and Dorthy Moxley. They also had a son, John two years older. Martha was a straight-A student who made friends easily. She had been voted Best Personality in junior high.  In 1974, her father was transferred to New York. The parents  wanted a safe place to live, and settled on a 3-acre property in Belle Haven, an enclave for the wealthy in Greenwich, Connecticut. This gated community on Long Island Sound was home to CEOs and politically connected people, as well as professionals like doctor and lawyers. Security was assured by the presence of guards on two entrances.  \n\nBy fall 1975, Martha was well settled into life as a sophomore at Greenwich High School. She was involved in school activities, played sports, took ballet and piano lessons. She had a sometime boyfriend since the summer. She had also met two neighbors near her own age, who lived across the street.  \n\nThose neighbors were Michael and Tommy Skakel. They came from one of the most prominent families in the neighborhood. Their father, Rushton Skakel, was chairman of the board of the Great Lakes Carbon Corporation, established by his family in 1919. Adding to the family luster was a Kennedy connection: His sister Ethel was the widow of former U.S. attorney general and U.S. Senator Robert F. Kennedy, who was assassinated during a presidential run in 1968.  \n\nThere were 7 children in the Skakel family, six boys and one girl ranging in age from 19 to 9, all living at home at the time. Their mother, Anne Reynolds Skakel, had died from cancer in 1973, a devastating blow to the family. Rushton was frequently away on business, leaving little adult supervision. Even when there, he struggled with alcoholism and could be a harsh parent, especially with Michael. Thus a family with great privilege, but also a troubled one.  \n\nMichael Skakel was born on September 19, 1960. His brother Tommy was two years older. Michael struggled at school, possibly because he had dyslexia not diagnosed until adulthood. After leaving several schools, he was currently attending the private Brunswick School along with his brother. Michael developed a problem with alcohol at 13, following his mother's death.   \n\nTommy was said to be prone to outbursts of anger that sometimes took a physical form. He had a psychiatric history at age 17.  This was likely due to a fall out of a car when he was 4, wherein he had a head injury.\n\nBoth brothers were smitten with Martha and wanted to date her. Tommy, especially, made advances, which were usually rebuffed. Martha wasn't interested in Michael, but seems to have been ambivalent about Tommy.   \n\n**The Murder**  \n\nOctober 30 was traditionally known as Mischief Night, a night when kids would egg and TP houses, ring doorbells, and pull similar pranks. Martha had been grounded for missing curfew the previous weekend, but the next day was a holiday for her school, so her mother relented and allowed her to go out with her friends. She was to be back by 9:30. Martha met some friends at 6:30, including Helen Ix  and Jeffrey Byrne. They went to the Skakel house several times during the evening, but the Skakels had been taken out to dinner by their new live-in tutor, Kenneth Littleton, who had just started the job that day. Their group returned about 9, and Martha's group met up with Michael and Tommy, sitting in a family car and listening to music. At 9:30, two older Skakel brothers said they needed the car to take their cousin Jimmy Terrien (Dowdle) home. Martha, Helen, Jeffrey, and Tommy got out of the car.  \n\nTommy and Martha were playing around flirtatiously on the Skakels' lawn, so Helen and Jeffrey left. Helen saw Tommy push Martha down and then fall down on top of her.  This left Tommy and Martha as the last two of the group.  \n\nAbout 9:45, the Skakel housekeeper thought she heard a noise and asked Kenneth Littleton to go outside and walk the perimeter of the property. He found nothing, and went back to watching the film The French Connection, which was on TV that night.  \n\nMeanwhile Dorthy Moxley was busy painting a window frame in her bedroom when she heard a commotion and voices outside. She looked out into the yard, but couldn't see anything. Martha had missed her curfew, and Dorthy determined to wait up for her. When Martha hadn't returned by 3 am, a very worried Dorthy sent her son out to look for Martha, and started calling around. Helen Ix said she had last seen Martha with Tommy Skakel at the Skakels' house, so Dorothy called them. But Martha was not there. Finally Dorthy called the police at 3:45 am. Police found nothing, and were not overly concerned, but they did issue an alert for Martha Elizabeth Moxley, five-foot-five, 120 pounds, long blonde hair, blue eyes, last seen wearing a blue parka and dungarees.   \n\nIn the morning, Dorthy went to the Skakels' house, and the door was answered by Michael. He was home on what was a school day for him, and looked hung-over. He said he didn't know where Martha was, but at Dorthy's request, they searched an RV on the property where the friends used to hang out. She wasn't there.   \n\nAt 12:30 pm, Martha's friend Sheila was walking through the Moxley yard when she found Martha's body, lying face down under a group of pine trees. She had been beaten and her pants pulled down around her knees. She was dead. Sheila ran to notify the family and the police.  \n\nThe scene was horrific. Martha had been struck on the head multiple times, crushing her skull. A sharp object had been stabbed through her neck. There was a trail of blood from the driveway to the spot where her body was found. Scattered nearby were also three pieces of a Toney Penna golf club, a 6-iron, the head matted with blood. The grip portion of the club was missing.  \n\nThe medical examiner found that the cause of death was blunt trauma to the head, and the stabbing in the neck might have been done post mortem. The golf club had been struck so hard that the shaft broke. He estimated the time of death as between 9:30 pm and 5:30 am. There were no signs of sexual assault.   \n\nAn expert brought in by Greenwich police in December placed the murder at 10 pm, based on the autopsy reports as well as testimony of dogs barking excessively and sounds being heard by Dorthy Moxley around that time.  \n\nWhen Kenneth Littleton got home from his day teaching, he found 15-20 personnel from the Great Lakes Carbon Corporation convened in the house. One of them instructed him to take Tommy, Michael, John, and Jimmy Terrien to a Skakel residence in Windham, New York. They left Saturday morning.   \n\nTwo days after the murder, a policeman found a set of Tony Penna golf clubs in a garage on the Skakel property. The clubs matched the one found at the crime scene. The 6-iron was missing. Notably, the clubs were labeled at the grip with Anne Skakel's name. This was the section that was missing from the pieces of the 6-iron found at the Moxley property.  \n\nOn Nov . 4, Martha's funeral was held at First Lutheran Church , with 500 people attending. Police were also there, surreptitiously scanning the crowd, with the thought that the murderer might be there.   \n\nOn Nov. 15, Rushton took Michael, Tommy, Jimmy and Julie to the police station to give statements. Tommy stated that he last saw Martha walking toward her home about 9:30, then he went to his room to work on a paper about Abraham Lincoln. Later he joined Kenneth Littleton to watch The French Connection. Michael stated that he went to the Terrien house with the others, and returned about 11:00. He said he went to bed and didn't leave the house again that night.  \n\nThe Greenwich police force put all their detectives on this case, the biggest in their history. Over 300 people were questioned, some of them five or more times. Police searched extensively for the missing piece of the murder weapon. They consulted experts to build a profile. But one person was their prime focus: Tommy Skakel, the last person to have seen Martha.  \n\nTommy failed one polygraph and passed the second. But his claim to have been writing a paper was disproved, as his teachers denied having assigned any such paper. At this point, he was the prime suspect not just for the police but for the public. Rumors were so rampant that the local paper ran an editorial criticizing the rumor mill that had grown up around the case, and the focus on one unnamed young man.   \n\nIn January 1976, Rushton Skakel said that on the advice of attorneys, the family would no longer speak to police. He retained a lawyer for Tommy. Some residents of Greenwich began to grumble that the police were shielding someone, that the money and influence of the Skakels and their connections allowed them to evade the law. Police denied any favoritism. Tommy told CT Insider (issue 12/31/76) that he was grilled by police for four hours, called back numerous times, followed in marked and unmarked cars, even accosted by police when he went to a bar to celebrate his 18th birthday. -  [\"Martha Moxley and the 'Doorbell Night Murder,' CT Insider](https://www.ctinsider.com/connecticutmagazine/article/From-the-Archives-Martha-Moxley-and-The-17046539.php)  \n\nOn May 21, 1976, police sought an arrest warrant for Tommy Skakel, but were denied by the district attorney on grounds of insufficient evidence.  \n\nDespite honing in on Tommy, police looked at other possible suspects. Martha's boyfriend was eliminated as he had an alibi, having stayed at home that night. They looked at  a graduate student living next to the Moxleys; he was also cleared. Kenneth Littleton was investigated some time in 1976. Kenneth had been dismissed by the Skakels after about six months due to dissatisfaction with him as a tutor. He was arrested in 1976 for a burglary on Nantucket, costing him his job at the Brunswick School. He suffered from serious mental health problems, exacerbated by substance abuse. His mother said the Moxley case ruined their family, as Kenneth couldn't hold a job and developed a drinking problem. But with no evidence tying him to the murder, police could not bring a case. In fact, by the end of 1976, the case had become inactive.   \n\n**The case takes a turn**  \n\nThough Tommy had been the chief suspect, Michael was showing signs of a guilty conscience in the aftermath of the murder. On two occasions he blurted out confessions of having committed murder. One was in spring 1976, at a barbershop where he suddenly said, “I'm going to kill him,” and when rebuked by his sister Julie, responded, “Why not? I did it before.”   More seriously, when being driven to New York City by the family driver, he twice attempted to get to the edge of the bridge.  \n> “In 1977, Rushton Skakel, Sr. asked Larry Zicarelli, who worked for the family as a gardener and driver, to drive Michael into New York City for an appointment. Michael and his father had been fighting and Michael was distraught. T. 5/16 at 13-15. On the way into the city, the defendant told Zicarelli that he had done something very bad and he had to either kill himself or get out of the country. T. 5/16 at 15. As they were driving home, they were stopped in traffic on the Triboro Bridge. The defendant jumped out of the car and ran to the side of the bridge. Zicarelli grabbed him and forced him back into the car. The defendant then leapt out of the other side of the car and again tried to make it to the side of the bridge. After getting him back in the car a second time, the defendant told Zicarelli that if he knew what he had done, he'd never talk to him again. Id. At 22-23.”  - https://portal.ct.gov/dcj/latest-news/state-v-skakel/state-of-connecticut-v-michael-skakel?language=en_US  \n\nRushton Sr. is also alleged to have told a close friend that Michael had said he wished he could know for certain if he had or had not killed Martha. The statement was later denied by both parties.   \n\nIn March 1978, Michael was arrested for a DUI. The family made a deal with police that they would send him to a rehab facility in exchange for charges being dropped. Michael was enrolled at Elan in Poland Spring, Maine, a therapeutic school for youth with mental health and substance abuse problems. Michael was there from 1978-1980, and had a difficult time. The school employed some extreme methods that included public confrontation and humiliation. Michael ran away, after which another student, Gregory Coleman, was assigned to guard him. Michael was held on the dining room stage for two days (the length f time the school had searched for him) and a General Meeting was called. A General Meeting was a disciplinary tactic attended by all students and staff, wherein the subject was confronted about their transgressions.  \n\nThe following are witness statements from residents at Elan during Michael's time there. They were made at a later date.  \n> “Defendant's second Elan witness, Michael Wiggins, testified that Joe Ricci confronted the defendant at the General Meeting by announcing to the assembled students that 'we are going to get to the bottom of this, and Michael is going to tell us why he murdered Martha Moxley.' T. 5/23 at 171. Wiggins further stated that each time the defendant denied killing Moxley, he would have to fight another opponent in the boxing ring. According to Wiggins, Ricci only stopped putting the defendant in the ring when he finally said, 'I don't know.' Id. at 175. Wiggins also stated that the defendant was forced to wear two different signs while at Elan. The first said: 'Confront me on why I killed Martha Moxley.\" Id. at 177. The second said: \"Please confront me on why I am a spoiled brat.' “ Id.” - [State of Connecticut v. Michael Skakel, Brief of the State, June 23, 2004](https://portal.ct.gov/dcj/latest-news/state-v-skakel/state-of-connecticut-v-michael-skakel?language=en_US)  \n\nThe murder was thereafter brought up in group therapy sessions, where Michael did not explicitly confess, but described how he was “blind drunk” and wasn't sure what had happened. He also talked about it in private conversations that ranged from boastful to tearful. He allegedly told Gregory Coleman that he was going to get away with murder because he was a Kennedy. He described how a girl refused his advances, so he smashed her skull in with a golf club. To others, he said he was not sure if he had done it but thought his family thought so and had placed him at Elan to hide him from the police.  \n“John Higgins testified that the defendant admitted killing Moxley during a private conversation when they sat up one night on guard duty. See T. 5/16 at 181. Higgins stated they talked about a lot of things that night, including why each of them was at Elan. The defendant told Higgins he was involved in a murder, that he remembered going through his garage and finding a golf club. T. 5/16 at 181-82. The defendant further stated that he recalled running through the woods with a golf club in his hands, and seeing pine trees. Id. As the conversation continued and the defendant became emotional, he progressed from saying 'maybe I did it,' to 'I must have done it,' to 'I did it.' Id. At 182.  -[State of Connecticut v. Michael Skakel, Brief of the State, June 23, 2004](https://portal.ct.gov/dcj/latest-news/state-v-skakel/state-of-connecticut-v-michael-skakel?language=en_US)    \n\nThe case became dormant, though some in the police team had come to believe Michael was the killer. Meanwhile in 1982 a reporter named Leonard Levitt began working on a story about the case and how police had handled the it. His article was eventually published in the Greenwich Times in June 1991, highlighting numerous failures by police, including a failure to search the Skakels' home even after the murder weapon was traced to their property. Shortly afterward, the state reopened the case, with Frank Garr as lead investigator in the case. Levitt and Garr would collaborate on the book *Conviction:  Solving the Moxley Murder: A Reporter and a Detective's Twenty-Year Search for Justice,* (2004) which pointed the finger of guilt at the Skakel family. \n\nIn 1992, police heading the new investigation convinced Kenneth Littleton's ex-wife to record multiple phone conversations with him, hoping to get an incriminating statement. They set up a sting in a bugged hotel room where she told Kenneth that he had confessed to killing Martha during an alcohol-fueled blackout. This was not true, but it forced him to doubt. Though confused and uncertain, Littleton did not confess during this operation. His ex-wife later said she agreed to lie because police said it would give closure to Dorthy Moxley. After the sting failed to produce a confession, Littleton says he was subjected to hours of harsh questioning, but he still did not confess. He failed two lie detector tests. But he maintained that he had never even heard the name Martha Moxley until the day after she had gone missing.  \n\nRushton Skakel Sr., concerned to clear his sons' names, engaged the Sutton Associates private investigation firm to do their own investigation. During questioning, both Tommy and Michael changed their stories. Tommy admitted that he did not see Martha walking home around 9:30. They stayed on the lawn and engaged in consensual mutual masturbation till about 10 pm Then Martha went home. Michael maintained that he had gone to the Terriens', but said that afterward, he went out about 11:30  to peep at women through windows, and wound up climbing a tree in the Moxleys' back yard and masturbating, then ran home past the area where the body was later found.  One of the Sutton investigators, Jim Murphy, became convinced that Tommy had committed the crime. In Leonard Levitt's account, Tommy was “on the verge of tears” while being interviewed in 1993, only for his attorney end the questioning. - [Leonard Levitt, *The Wrong Skakel?*, CT Post, Oct. 20,2012] (https://www.ctpost.com/news/article/the-wrong-skakel-3967989.php)  \n\nIn 1994 the Sutton report, with its damaging changes in testimony, was leaked to Leonard Levitt and writer Dominick Dunne. Dunne gave his copy to Mark Fuhrman, retired detective notorious from the O.J. Simpson trial. Fuhrman's nonfiction account *Murder in Greenwich*, published  in 1998, claimed Michael as the murderer. Dunne had previously written a novel loosely based on the Moxley murder (*A Season in Purgatory*, 1993), wherein a character based on Michael was the murderer.  \n\nWith renewed publicity about the case, and the changed statements by two Skakel brothers, the state called a one-person grand jury in September 1998.  Over 40 witnesses testified. Among those called was Kenneth Littleton. He agreed to testify in return for immunity. Other witnesses included former students at the now-closed Elan. A $50,000 reward had now been offered for evidence.  \n\nIn January 2000, the grand jury concluded that there was sufficient evidence to charge Michael Skakel. He was arrested on January 19, 2000, charged with the murder of Martha Elizabeth Moxley on October 30, 1975. He was then 40 years old.   \n\nEnd of Part 1  \n\n **Sources**\n\n[Who Did It?

This may especially be the case with this write-up, as the victim was a 12-year-old girl. Because of this, reader discretion is advised.*\n\n**Introduction**\n\nIn early 1969 12-year-old Deborah Lee \"Debbie\" Shelton was living in Aptos, Santa Cruz County, CA with her mother Marcia, 28, and sisters Victoria, 11, and Melissa, 6. They had moved to the Rio Del Mar area of the county from Los Gatos, Santa Clara County, CA about a year earlier. Her father, James Vern Shelton, was killed in a car accident at the age of 28 in 1966. Debbie reportedly visited her paternal grandparents in Santa Rosa, Sonoma County, CA often and had made several friends her age in the Santa Rosa area. Debbie was a seventh grader at Aptos Junior High at the time. \n\nAptos is an unincorporated town in Santa Cruz County, CA. According to Wikipedia, it consists of several different small villages, including Rio del Mar, where Debbie's family lived, and nearby Aptos Village. The villages that comprise Aptos presently have a combined population of 24,402, with Rio del Mar itself consisting of 9,128 of those people.\n\n**Disappearance**\n\nAt about 9:30am on Friday, January 3, 1969, Debbie left her home at 423 Palmer St to go mini-bike riding; one contemporary source, quoting Debbie's step-grandmother, stated that she was going to attend a mini-bike race. Debbie had told her mother that she was going to meet up with a male classmate named Sherman whom Marcia didn't know, as well as with Sherman's sister, near the Aptos railroad bridge. They were then going to bike down to the beach at Aptos.\n\nDebbie was expected to be home at around 11:30am for a dentist appointment that she had at noon. In 2014, Marcia reflected, \"I did not want her to go because I was worried about her getting on a mini bike. I finally relented and said OK.\"\n\nAccording to her close friend, Loni Reeder, Debbie had been planning the ride for about a week. Loni had last seen her friend at church the previous December, right around Christmas time. At that time Debbie told Loni about an older guy that she was interested in named Sherman. She told Loni that she and Sherman were making a plan to go mini-bike riding. Debbie never described Sherman's appearance to her friend, \"aside from him being really cute.\" In 2014, Loni stated, \"Now, on reflection, I wonder if \\[Sherman\\] was even his real name.\"\n\nDebbie was last seen alive on Rio Del Mar Blvd at about 11:00am. She was wearing blue Levis, a light blue turtleneck, a purple jacket, and white shoes. She was 5'0, about 85-90 lbs, and had blue eyes and long, straight blonde hair. None of the sources state who was the last to see her and whether there was anyone with her at the time.\n\nDebbie didn't make it home for her dentist appointment, though Marcia seems to have brushed it off as her losing track of time. The mother came home from taking one of her other daughters to an appointment when she received a phone call from someone at about 2pm.\n\nThe caller, who Marcia thought sounded like a teenager, said, \"We have your daughter. Bring $500 up Trout Gulch Road. Don't call police or we'll kill her.\" Marcia, not yet thinking that Debbie was missing, thought that it was just a prank call at the time, and so replied \"Don't be ridiculous\" before hanging up. The caller was never identified, and they never called back. Marcia later told investigators that \"the youth sounded older than her daughter, about 14 or 15 years of age.\"\n\nMarcia eventually grew concerned by Debbie's absence. She first searched for her daughter herself before calling the Sheriff's office at 3:30pm. An intensive search of several days followed, yet failed to uncover any clues. Detectives, having reportedly exhausted all other angles, eventually classified Debbie as a runaway.\n\n**Discovery**\n\nOn Saturday, March 8, 1969, a boy out shooting his BB gun in a secluded wooded area stumbled upon a decomposed body lying beneath a tree near the railroad bridge in the village of Aptos. The body was on a vine-covered slope below Aptos Creek Rd, about 20ft above a road leading to private residences, and less than 0.25mi north of Soquel Drive. According to one clipping, \"the area is no more than 200yd from the village of Aptos.\"\n\nAs of at least March 11, 1969, telephone company crews had \"recently installed new pole and wire hookups\" just across Aptos Creek Rd from the slope. Horsemen also regularly used the road, but the body wasn't found until the boy, Henry, happened across it. The body was soon identified as Debbie's through dental records.\n\nDebbie's hands were bound together behind her back with masking tape. Tape that had held her mouth shut prior to death had slipped down to her neck during decomposition. Her clothes were disheveled yet present on the body. The ME estimated that the remains had been there for at least one month and/or for several weeks.\n\nWhile the scene suggested the possibility of sexual assault, the coroner was unable to determine if any SA occurred due to the condition of the remains. Blood tests showed no poison, sedatives, narcotics, or alcohol in her system. The cause of death was strangulation with her underwear. Investigators believed that Debbie was abducted on the day of her disappearance and then killed by her kidnapper.\n\nThere was soil on the clothing that investigators hoped could be used to determine whether Debbie was killed at the scene or elsewhere. There were also several strands of hair that didn't belong to her found on her clothing; however, it was considered possible that the hair came from the Shelton family's dog. The clothing was sent to the FBI for investigation into the soil and hair; the masking tape was also sent in the hopes that fingerprints could be lifted from it.\n\nDespite this, the case quickly grew cold, and there have never been any arrests or official suspects. Furthermore, neither Sherman nor the ransom caller have ever been identified.\n\n**Later Developments**\n\nDebbie was buried in Saratoga, Santa Clara County alongside her father. Her mother, Marcia, is still alive as of at least 2017, as is Debbie's youngest sister, Melissa.\n\nIn December 2001, one of Debbie's younger sisters, Victoria Lee Specials, 44, disappeared in Clear Lake, CA. It is believed that Victoria was likely murdered by her ex-boyfriend, though her body has not been found. She is still officially missing.\n\nIn 1999 an FBI crime lab determined that the hairs on Debbie's clothing were in fact animal fibers. The case was reopened in 2004, when the Santa Cruz County Sheriff's Office sent DNA evidence to a state crime lab in an effort to find the killer. Detective Dave Deverell, who was in charge of the case at the time, expressed some reticence, stressing how DNA testing can take years. As of 2025, it seems that nothing has been concluded from the DNA investigation.\n\n**Theories and Online Discussion**\n\nDebbie's case has been brought up once before on a Zodiac forum, though it bears very little resemblance to any Z cases. Furthermore, while Debbie wasn't hitchhiking -- her mother pressed that she would not have been -- her murder, as well as her known connection to Santa Rosa, brings the 1972-1974 Santa Rosa Hitchhiker Murders to mind; she also bears a strong physical resemblance to, and was the same age range (12-13) as, confirmed victims Yvonne Weber, Maureen Sterling, and Lori Lee Kursa.\n\nIn 2014 one of Debbie's cousins, who was two years younger than her, set up the Facebook community \"Find Justice for Deborah Lee Shelton.\" It seems that some of the posts on the page have since been taken down in between now (May 2025) and when I first discovered the page within the last six months.\n\nOn May 27, 2022, the cousin posted on the page, \"There have been some recent developments and significant new information regarding Debbie’s case. The family’s attorney and law enforcement are actively working in this regard. Extremely encouraging. Please continue to keep good thoughts in finally bringing Debbie’s killer to Justice.\" It is uncertain what these developments were, as it seems that they were never elaborated on.\n\nAccording to a Jan. 7, 2025 post regarding Debbie on the Pacific Northwest Cold Cases and Missing Persons Facebook page, Lance Voss, a suspect in the Lewis-Clark Valley / Snake River Killings, reportedly lived in Saratoga, Santa Clara County, CA -- approximately 35mi from Aptos -- and attended West Valley College in Campbell, Santa Clara County, CA at the time of Debbie's murder.\n\nIn late January 2025, Debbie's cousin replied to a comment on that same PNW Cold Cases & MPs post, stating, \"Apparently there is a small amount of DNA but Santa Cruz sheriff department says there is not enough money to test again… it’s just horrible. I think they at least owe it to the family!\"\n\nIn February 2022 user Terry \\[last name redacted for privacy\\] commented the following on the then-most recent post -- which has likely since been deleted -- on the Facebook page dedicated to Debbie:\n\n>\"I was 14 years old when Debbie was found murdered. I also attended Aptos Junior High School. I remember my parents discussing the murder with my grandmother and other family members. \\[...\\] \\[In 2016 my mother\\] told me a story about the death of Debbie. She said that her mother (my grandmother) knew a family that had a son named Sherman. After the death of Debbie he hardly ever left the house for weeks. My Grandmother was very suspicious of his behavior and confronted his parents who preceded to break off all contact with my Grandmother. Back in the day no one got involved with other families' problems so nothing else was ever said about the murder. This young man eventually joined the service and he soon thereafter took his own life.\"\n\nAccording to Terry, after being told this story by her mother she called the Santa Cruz Police hotline number for Debbie's case and left a message stating that her mother had vital information. The investigators reportedly never returned Terry's call. Terry's mother passed away in 2018.\n\nAnother user replied to Terry's comment, saying, \"I am a cousin of Debbie’s mom. I was there when it all happened. I remember my cousin saying Debbie was getting letters from a Sherman. Hang in there. Maybe we can solve this.\"\n\nI could not find further information about Sherman or local rumors and speculation on the Facebook page. While further identifying information may be able to be gleaned and/or confirmed through research on Ancestry and Newspapers.com, I will note that it should not be posted here due to privacy concerns.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nDebbie's murder is still unsolved and present on the Santa Cruz County Sheriff's Office Unsolved Homicides page. Anyone with information regarding her case is asked to please call the Sheriff's Investigations at (831) 454-7620 or email them at shf236@co.santa-cruz.ca.us. The agency case number is 69-1574.\n\nWhat do you think happened to Debbie? Who killed her, and why? Could it have been a serial killer or an opportunistic stranger? Or perhaps this unknown Sherman, or even another classmate or someone known to Debbie? Was the ransom call related?\n\n**Sources**\n\n[Santa Cruz cold cases](https://shf.santacruzcountyca.gov/SheriffHome/OurAgency/Operations/OperationsBureauDivisions/UnsolvedHomicides/Homicides69-1574.aspx)\n\n[FindAGrave](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/106900329/deborah-lee-shelton)\n\n[2014 HuffPost article](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/deborah-lee-shelton-victoria-lee-specials_n_4875653)\n\n*Santa Cruz Sentinel* [1/12/69](https://www.newspapers.com/article/santa-cruz-sentinel-sc-sentinel-12-jan-1/438332/), 3/11/69 pt.s [1](https://www.newspapers.com/article/santa-cruz-sentinel-hunt-for-aptos-girl/111998314/) & [2](https://www.newspapers.com/article/santa-cruz-sentinel/94283126/), [3/12/69](https://www.newspapers.com/article/santa-cruz-sentinel/438329/), and [3/18/69](https://www.newspapers.com/article/santa-cruz-sentinel-sc-sentinel-18-mar-1/438324/)\n\n*Santa Rosa Press Democrat* [3/10/69](https://www.newspapers.com/article/the-press-democrat-debbie-shelton-santa/172736001/)\n\n*Los Gatos Times-Saratoga Observer* [3/14/69](https://www.newspapers.com/article/los-gatos-times-saratoga-observer/170279811/)\n\nVictoria Specials [Charley Project](https://charleyproject.org/case/victoria-lee-specials) page\n\n*Santa Cruz Sentinel* [1/10/71](https://www.newspapers.com/article/santa-cruz-sentinel-sc-sentinel-10-jan-1/438349/), [7/7/02](https://www.newspapers.com/article/santa-cruz-sentinel/20368340/), and 7/11/04 pt.s [1](https://www.newspapers.com/article/santa-cruz-sentinel-debbie-shelton-col/172853534/), [2](https://www.newspapers.com/article/santa-cruz-sentinel-debbie-shelton-col/172853561/), & [3](https://www.newspapers.com/article/santa-cruz-sentinel-debbie-shelton-col/172853647/)",

      "title": "1974: Murdered in daylight - The shocking and brutal death of socialite and former model Athalia Ponsell Lindsley",
      "text": "Founded in 1565 on the northeast coast of Florida, St. Augustine is the oldest continuously occupied European-established settlement in the U.S.  Known as the “Old City,” it retains an old world European ambience, with cobbled streets, horse-drawn carriage rides, and a wealth of historic buildings that have long made it a magnet for tourism. But that mixture of historic charm and the Southern way of life was shattered for many of its residents on the early evening of January 23, 1974, when a brutal daylight murder occurred on one of the nicest streets in the historic Old Town neighborhood.  As one headline put it, “Slaying Ended the Old City's Tranquillity.”  (Orlando Sentinel, February 3, 1975)  \n\nThe victim was 56-year-old Athalia Ponsell Lindsley.  Athalia was not a native of St. Augustine – perhaps that was part of the problem. She was born Athalia Fetter on July 25, 1917 to a well-to-do Toledo family, and spent her early years living in a mansion on Isle of Pines off the coast of Cuba. Her family moved to Jacksonville when she was nine, amid growing anti-American sentiment on the island. Athalia had blonde good looks, and won beauty pageants while still in school. She married at age 18, but the marriage only lasted two years. By 1937 she had moved to New York City to pursue a career as a model. She took the stage name Ponselle (later Ponsell). She signed with the John Robert Powers agency and became one of the top models of her day. This led to bit parts on Broadway as a dancer and a job as hostess on the TV game show Winner Take All. \n\nBesides being beautiful, Athalia was well-read and versed in the arts. She was also a product of her privileged upbringing, with all that entails. She dated Joseph P. Kennedy Jr., older brother of John F. Kennedy. Her name sometimes cropped up in the gossip columns. She spent 10 years modeling and pursuing a show business career in New York, but she aged out of modeling and her performing career had never really taken off. By 1947, she had moved back to Jacksonville where her mother still lived. She married again, and divorced again. She got a real estate license, wrote a book on gardening, and patented a device for scouring pans. In 1970, she had an unsuccessful run for the state legislature. She joined clubs and had an active social life. She was a woman of varied interests, with strong opinions, who made both friends and enemies.  \n\nAthalia and her mother Margherita moved to St. Augustine in 1972, to a stucco house at 124 Marine Street in the Old Town. Athalia acted as caretaker for her ailing mother, sleeping on the floor in her room for the last year of her life. Margherita Fetter died on April 26, 1973.  By then, Athalia was already embroiled in the troubles that likely led to her murder. Unlike in Jacksonville, Athalia seems not to have found a welcome in St. Augustine. The city could be cliquish and classist. Newcomers were not welcomed. Athalia was called a Yankee in spite of her Southern roots. Though she had some social success, she rubbed people the wrong way with her outspokenness, very conservative politics, and abrasive personality. It is said she was a great friend to those who were like-minded, but she could be dismissive or rude to those who weren't. She dived into local issues and was not shy about making her opinions known at public city meetings.  \n\nReturning to work in real estate, she met and started dating a former St. Augustine mayor, James “Jinx” Lindsley, who was part of the Old Guard she wished to enter. James was well-liked, a hard drinker and smoker, easy-going but said to have a quick temper. They married in September 1973. Oddly, both of them were still living in their own houses in January 1974. Supposedly this was because they were having trouble selling Athalia's house, and she didn't want to leave it empty and unprotected. She had her mother's valuable possessions there. She also had pets to care for. The couple would spend the daytime together, but Athalia would usually return to her Marine Street house at night, while James stayed in his house on Anastasia Island across the Bridge of Lions, or in another family house on the mainland. Less charitable opinion said the marriage had already failed.  However, this type of living arrangement had existed in James's first marriage as well and might not have been significant.  \n\nAthalia did not make many friends in her neighborhood. The trouble started early on with the animals she kept. She adopted stray dogs, having five at one point plus her mother's dog. The wives on both sides (McCormicks on the north, Stanfords on the south) complained about the dogs barking, and lodged complaints with the city. The first complaint was in 1972 and resulted in a fine. Athalia boarded three of the dogs, but it wasn't enough. The second complaint, made by Rosemary McCormick, resulted in an arrest warrant. Three days later, Athalia's mother died. Patti Stanford testified against Athalia in court in the first case, and wrote a complaining letter to the judge in the second. The feud was on. Athalia retaliated by cutting off the limbs of two trees on the property line that overhung her yard, and planting 10' tall bamboo in a corner where it obstructed the Stanfords' view. (The city removed it.) For some reason, she especially targeted Alan G. Stanford, even though it was his wife Patti who had made the complaints. Athalia delved into his background, talked to disgruntled county employees, and found grist for the pursuit of her vendetta.  \n\nAlan Stanford was the county manager of St. Johns County. In October 1973, Athalia began attending county commissioners meetings and was critical of Stanford's competence and salary. Challenged that this was part of a petty feud between neighbors, she dramatically alleged that Stanford had threatened her life. (The words were actually “I'll fix you.”) The day before the murder, she appeared before the commission together with a county roads worker to once again complain about the state of the roads and to point out that Stanford was signing documents as County Engineer without the qualification. A marine engineer, he was hired with the understanding that he would obtain the necessary civil engineering qualification. Though he failed the exam, he received the raise that had been promised on completion. It didn't sit well with Athalia, who also had ambitions to run for the board of commissioners.  The county employee who testified to botched work on a road project was fired on Jan. 23, the day after the hearing.  And on that day, Alan Stanford was visited by two men from the Florida Department of Professional and Occupational Regulations. They  had been contacted by Athalia and were investigating him for misrepresenting his position. They were planning to interview her the next day.  \n\nLest it seem like Athalia was wholly trumping up criticisms of Alan, it is reported in Elizabeth Randall's book that there actually were some poorly-executed public works projects during his tenure. One of them involved dumping garbage in a poorer part of town under the guise of using it to enrich the soil. The residents there had also complained. (Murder in St. Augustine: The Mysterious Death of Athalia Ponsell Lindsley, The History Press, 2016)  \n\nOn Wednesday, January 23, 1974, Athalia and James made their weekly visit to Jacksonville for lunch and shopping. She had to get home, but they agreed that she would join James on the island later to cook dinner. She returned home around 5:35 p.m., left her groceries in the kitchen, and went out the front door to get her mail and allow her rescued blue jay Clementine to exercise on the lawn. A man approached from the back yard and attacked her with a sharp weapon, virtually on her front steps. She was stabbed nine times in the arm and head and nearly decapitated. The attack was brutal; the Chief of Police later said the crime was committed out of “pure hate.”  \n\nAbout 6:00, the teenage Locke McCormick next door heard “slapping” sounds and moans outside and looked out the window, where he saw a man in front of Athalia's house, raising and lowering his arms. Running outside, he could see Athalia's body on the steps as the man walked away in the direction of the Stanfords' house. He ran back inside telling his mother and grandmother “Mr. Stanford is hitting Mrs. Ponsell.” They found Athalia in a pool of blood, and called both police and ambulance. But Athalia was already dead. The time was 6:08 p.m.  \n\nOther neighbors had also heard screams, and people started to gather in front of the house. The investigation started poorly. Police walked over the grass and hedges, obscuring evidence. They did not lift fingerprints. They even had some of the bloody areas of the porch hosed down.  There was still a trail of blood leading from the steps across the lawn to the low wall adjoining the Stanford house. Inside Athalia's house, nothing was disturbed.  \n\nMeanwhile James had gone back to the island, with a few stops along the way before reaching home about 6 p.m. Around 6:30 he got two calls to come back to Marine Street right away, because something had happened at Athalia's house. He called his lawyer, who met him at the scene. There James identified Athalia.    \n\nAlan Stanford drove up about 7 p.m. and, upon being told that Athalia had been murdered, he asked “Was she shot or was she cut?”  \n\nSt. Augustine police were soon aided by sheriff's police, with Sheriff Dudley Garrett leading the investigation. The coroner said death was caused by lacerations with a thick, sharp bladed instrument, in his opinion a machete. No weapon was found at the scene, nor in searches in nearby woods or a lake behind the property. Apparently many people in St. John's County owned machetes, which were used to clear underbrush. James Lindsley volunteered that he usually had one in his car, and Alan Stanford had borrowed one from the county. Lindsley turned his over to police. Stanford said he had returned his to the county, but this could not be verified.   \n\nA wide-ranging investigation ensued, yielding almost 1,000 pages of  interviews, depositions and reports. They pursued clues as far away as California. The key witness, Locke McCormick, was interviewed under hypnosis in an effort to bring back more memories. At the end of the day, there were two real suspects.  \n\nJames Lindsley was of course one of the first persons the police looked at. He took a polygraph on Feb. 6 and, with his alibi, Garrett considered him to be eliminated. On his way home after parting from Athalia, he had spoken to or was seen by several people at several points, and therefore his time was pretty well accounted for. There was a 15 or 20 minute interval that was not covered. It was considered that the blank period in his alibi would have left little time to return to the mainland, kill Athalia, and get back in time to receive the phone calls.  \n\nPolice then turned their attention to someone with whom Athalia was known to be on bad terms - Alan Stanford. Stanford denied committing the crime. He said witnesses could attest to his having been at work from 6 to 7 p.m. His family alibied him, though both his wife and daughter said earlier at the crime scene that they didn't know where he was. He said he had gone back to work to check on some permits needing to be issued, and stayed to study for the engineers' exam. Stanford downplayed the feud, claiming Athalia was not taken seriously, and said he had barely ever spoken with her - perhaps 5 times in the two years she lived there. To Sheriff Garrett, he said he had sympathy for her because he felt she was deranged.   \n\nGarrett announced a $500 reward for finding the weapon. On February 17, a county mechanic called Dewey Lee searched a swampy area that had once been a city dump, and came up with a bundle  including a white shirt, dark blue pants, and a watch, wrapped in a pink towel. The pants and shirt had blood on them. He found a machete in the water nearby, as well as a diaper. One item, the watch, was traced back to Alan Stanford by markings inside when he had had it repaired. The shirt was tentatively identified as his because of a laundry mark. Shirt and pants were his size. On February 24, Stanford was arrested and charged with first degree murder. He was released on $20,000 bond, voluntarily went on a leave from his job, and took work as a maintenance worker.  \n\nThe case and upcoming trial were reported across the country, not a surprise given the sensational and gruesome aspects of the crime. “Showgirl hacked to death by machete” makes a good headline. In St. Augustine, rumors were rife and opinion was divided, if unevenly. Alan Stanford was well-liked, with a reputation as a mild-mannered man, living quietly with his family. He was a vestryman at his church,  whose members raised bond money and a legal defense fund rumored to be as high as $250,000. Surely such a man could not be guilty of such a violent crime. By contrast, Athalia was unpopular, shockingly so. Residents described her as annoying, haughty and aggressive. She allegedly called Rosemary McCormick's mother “trash” and told her to “get off her property” after the incidents with the nuisance complaints. She was headlined in one newspaper as 'Obnoxious' victim. In the A & E City Confidential episode about the case, one interviewee, identified by name, openly said on camera that she deserved what she got. According to Jacksonville journalist Nancy Powell, it wasn't an uncommon opinion. However, on the other side, there were people who were convinced Stanford had done it. (Nancy would go on to collaborate on a novel based on the crime, \"Bloody Sunset in St. Augustine.\" Though a novel, it purported to be the truth and [featured one of Athalia's modeling photos on the cover.](https://www.amazon.com/Bloody-Sunset-St-Augustine-Story/dp/096682590X)  \n\nThe trial opened on the one year anniversary of the killing. Prosecutors had failed in a bid for a change of venue because of public sentiment in St. Johns County. The prosecution presented their evidence of the trail of blood toward the Stanford home, the finding of the clothes, watch, and machete, Stanford's possession of a machete, the motive of Athalia's attempts to have him ousted from his job, and the eyewitness account of neighbor Locke McCormick. They pointed out inconsistencies in witness testimony, such as Patricia Stanford saying her father left home around 5:35. Her initial statement said that he was not at home when she got back from a tennis match around 5:15. Patrica also changed her testimony about what her father was wearing when she saw him. Athalia's friend Nancy Powell  testified that Stanford called her about a week before the murder to ask her if she had any dirt on Athalia. He said he needed something to stop her, or she would have to be sent back where she came from. (After the trial Stanford would claim he said only that he wished she would go back where she came from.) (Miami Herald, January 27, 1975)  \n\nThe physical evidence was a mixed bag, as water had obscured identifying information on several items. There was one night session where the jury were shown the white shirt under ultraviolet light, to be able to read Stanford's laundry mark. Doctors from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms lab testified as to the finding of a blonde hair embedded in the machete, and to the blood found on the diaper, which matched Athalia's Type A. It was implied that the diaper was used to wipe down the machete, on which neither fingerprints nor blood were found.  \n\nBut the defense countered strongly. They brought two county employees to testify to Stanford's alibi. One had seen him leaving between 5 and 5:10 p.m. Another had seen his car at the office between 5:30 and 6 p.m.  But more importantly, Locke McCormick's eyewitness testimony faltered. He had previously stated he saw Mr. Stanford; now he said he could only attest that he saw a man in a white shirt and dark trousers, never saw his full face, and thought he might have been burlier in the shoulders than Alan Stanford. The defense also had a surprise witness who had been riding her bike nearby and had seen a man whose description matched Dewey Lee standing in front of Athalia's house about 4:30 p.m. Her uncle, a county employee, had previously taken her to the county building and she had picked Lee out as the man she saw.  Finally, they attacked Dewey Lee's testimony about so conveniently finding the clothes and weapon. According to Stanford, the laundry had lost some of his shirts, so the tentative identification of a laundry mark to him was not relevant. He also said the watch had gone missing shortly after the murder. The defense theory was that the watch and clothes had been stolen from the Stanford house when it was searched, then given to Lee to hide and “find.” This was alleged to be a conspiracy among the police, Lee, and James Lindsley, with one of them committing the actual crime. The defense made much of the Lindsleys' marital arrangements, to insinuate that the marriage with James was rocky. They introduced letters Athalia had written to her sister in which she called James a leech and a liar, and said she had changed the locks on her house and not given him the keys. James denied that there was any trouble in the marriage. But the defense had scored against what had at first seemed to be a strong prosecution case.  \n\nOn February 3, the jury of 7 men and 5 women retired to consider their verdict. In two and a half hours, during which time they were served lunch, they came back with a verdict of Not Guilty. Stanford fell to his knees, vocally thanking God and then the members of the jury. Many people were shocked, including the prosecution. One prosecuting attorney said they had barely had time to elect a foreman, consider the evidence, and come to a conclusion. Sheriff Garrett said he did not intend to re-open the investigation, because he would be trying to convict an innocent person. Law enforcement were convinced they had the right man.  \n\nAlan Stanford gave an interview on February 4 in which he admitted that he “couldn't stand Athalia.” He said his recourse against Athalia's attacks would have been a lawsuit, not murder. He said the trial had devastated his family financially, and he hoped to resume his job as county manager. However, the county decided it would be best to hire someone new, given the strong feelings about the trial. The Stanfords moved to Miami and then South Carolina and were able to pick up their lives reasonably well.  \n\nJames Lindsley petitioned the court to overturn Athalia's will, in which she left everything to her sister.  He was successful in receiving a third of the estate, though the $100,000 estate amounted to only about $69,000 after her mortgage was paid off. James told the court he had changed his will upon marriage to leave half his estate to his son, and half to Athalia.  \n\nIn a tragic irony, a neighbor on Marine Street, Frances Bemis, had been quoted after the murder about feeling safe in St. Augustine. She said she took a walk every night and would keep doing so. On November 3, 1974, her body was found in a vacant lot with her skull crushed by a concrete block and her body partially burned. Police claim there is no connection with Athalia's murder. But some friends said Frances, a former newspaperwoman, was helping Nancy Powell on a book about that crime. The Miami Herald reported on January 27, 1975, that police found an outline of Frances' suggestions for the book in her home. Frances's murder, like Athalia's, has never been solved.  \n\nSo, who did kill Athalia Ponsell Lindsley? Was it the neighbor she feuded with? The husband from whom she may or may not have been estranged? Another person she had made an enemy? Or a random attacker?  In my opinion, the viciousness of the crime, committed up close to the victim, implies a personal motive. That leaves the two main suspects. Both are deceased, James Lindsley in 1983 and Alan Stanford in 2006. With so much contradictory testimony, it is hard to discern the truth. To me, Stanford had the greater motive, and there is a shakiness to his alibi. He had possession of a machete. Despite acting unruffled by Athalia's attacks, he was playing the same game by seeking out dirt on her from a friend and also from the sheriff's office. He had threatened to “fix her.” But Lindsley can't be dismissed. He had an alibi supported by seeing or chatting with a number of people. Were those meetings orchestrated for the purpose? He went to court to get a share of her estate. And then there are those letters to Athalia's sister.  \n\n And what about Frances Bemis? Was her murder connected to Athalia's case? I do not think so. The type of attack being so different makes this look like coincidence to me. It is much more likely for a lone woman to meet with violence in the dark, than for conspirators to try to stifle someone because of information they hold.   \n\nAthalia was buried in Oakdale Cemetery, alongside her parents. No one else has been investigated for or charged with her murder. The story lives on in St. Augustine as one of their most shocking unsolved crimes.  Athalia never got justice. She never will. Likewise, we will never know the truth about the case. There is no DNA to test. Almost all the principals are gone. Contemporary reporting skews against her, but recent books, blogs and podcasts seem to take a more sympathetic stance. Many draw from the very detailed account in Elizabeth Randall's book, ““Murder in St. Augustine: The Mysterious Death of Athalia Ponsell Lindsley. ” (The History Press, 2016)  What do you think about the case?  \n\nSources  \n\nNewspapers.com:  \nThe Miami Herald (Miami, Florida) · Fri, Feb 8, 1974  \n“Murder Suspect Pleads Innocent,” The Naples Daily News (Naples, Florida) · Wed, Feb 27, 1974 \nThe Naples Daily News (Naples, Florida) · Wed, Feb 27, 1974   \n“St. Augustine Residents Mull Murder Possibilities,” News-Press (Fort Myers, Florida) · Thu, Feb 28, 1974  \n“Arrest jolts St. John's,” Tampa Bay Times (St. Petersburg, Florida) · Mon, Mar 18, 1974  \n“Poor Athalia,“ Dudley Cleninden, Tampa Bay Times (St. Petersburg, Florida) · Mon, Mar 18, 1974  \n“Stanford “Simmered” For Months: State,” Julie Wilson, The Orlando Sentinel (Orlando, Florida) · Thu, Jan 23, 1975  \n“1 Topic Dominates City – Murder,” The Miami Herald (Miami, Florida) · Mon, Jan 27, 1975  \n“Trail of Blood Ended, Stanford Jury Told,” Julie Wilson, The Orlando Sentinel (Orlando, Florida) · Sun, Jan 26, 1975  \n“Stanford Defense Next,” Julie Wilson, Thurs, Jan. 30, 1975  The Orlando Sentinel (Orlando, Florida)\n“Slaying Ended Old City's Tranquility,” Julie Wilson, The Orlando Sentinel (Orlando, Florida) · Mon, Feb 3, 1975  \n“Lindsley Slaying Spreads Fear,” Julie Wilson, The Orlando Sentinel (Orlando, Florida) · Mon, Jan. 27, 1975  \n“Stanford Defense, State Rest Cases,” Julie Wilson, The Orlando Sentinel (Orlando, Florida) · Sun, Feb 2, 1975  \n“Stanford: My Weapon Lawsuit, Not Machete,” Ron Sachs, The Miami Herald (Miami, Florida) · Wed, Feb 5, 1975  \n\n\n[Excerpt from “Murder in St. Augustine: The Mysterious Death of Athalia Ponsell Lindsley, ” Elizabeth Randall](https://floridawriters.blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Murder-in-Stexcerpt.pdf)  \n[Episode 33, An Inconvenient Woman, Southern Fried TrueCrime podcast](https://www.southernfriedtruecrime.com/33-an-inconvenient-woman)  \n[Wikipedia: Athalia Ponsell Lindsley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Athalia_Ponsell_Lindsley)  \n[A Recurring Horror, Peter Giunta, St Augustine Record, Jan. 29,2007](https://web.archive.org/web/20100715053521/http://www.staugustine.com/stories/012907/news_4366914.shtml)  \n['Obnoxious' victim had no shortage of possible killers, Peter Giunta, St. Augustine Record, Jan. 30, 2007](https://web.archive.org/web/20141015175351/http://staugustine.com/stories/013007/news_4368775.shtml)  \n[City Confidential: The Socialite and the Politician](https://pluto.tv/us/on-demand/series/65cbe4fab65b870013458852/season/2/episode/65cbf03db65b870013476a84)  \n[The Mysterious Murder of St. Augustine Socialite Athalia Ponsell Lindsley\n](https://www.flhistory.com/post/the-mysterious-murder-of-st-augustine-socialite-athalia-ponsell-lindsley)  \n[January 23rd was a dark day for St. Augustine\n](https://historiccity.com/2010/staugustine/news/january-23rd-was-a-dark-day-for-st-augustine-2465)  \n[Athalia Lindsley & The Florida Machete Murder](https://www.truecrimeneversleeps.com/athalia-lindsley-the-florida-machete-murder/)  \n[Find a Grave: Mary Anne “Athalia Ponsell” Fetter Lindsley \n](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/39910608/mary_anne-lindsley)  \n[LOOKING BACK: '74 slaying still stirs emotions – Sany Strickland, Jacksonville Times-Union, Jan. 31, 2000](https://web.archive.org/web/20121004192208/http://jacksonville.com/tu-online/stories/013100/met_1968990.html)  \n[Wikipedia: Frances Bemis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frances_Bemis)  \n[Police still hunt for killer after 38 years](https://historiccity.com/2012/staugustine/news/police-still-hunt-for-killer-after-38-years-32524)",

      "title": "What happened to Julie Ferguson in Greenbelt, Maryland, on the night of March 20-21, 1995?",
      "text": "On Monday, March 20th 1995, 17 year old Julie Lynn Ferguson completed her shift at Linens 'n Things in Greenway Shopping Center in Greenbelt, Maryland. Two girlfriends were scheduled to pick her up when her shift ended at 9:30PM. Julie spoke on the phone with her friends and reassured her mother just before her shift ended that her friends were coming to pick her up. This night her manager closed the store early so she was out early. Julie waited on a brick flower box near a curb, two stores down in front of the well-lit and open liquor store. When her friends arrived around 10PM, Julie was nowhere to be found. Only her purse, a shopping bag and a Coca-Cola, which was still wet with condensation. Early the next morning on March 21st, Julie's body was found on a semi-rural road called Daisy Lane in Glenndale, Maryland, less than 5 miles from where she was last seen. She had been strangeled, her throat had been cut and her hands were tied.\n\nWhat went wrong?\n\n**Background, the 2 weeks prior, the last day and timeline:**\n\n1995 Julie Ferguson lived with her mom in Greenbelt, Maryland(in an apartment off Mandan Rd/Mandan Terrace), and was an only child. Her father passed away when she was a year old. Her mom worked and was out a lot but her mom preferred that she ride home with a family member or friend. Julie had her own private phone line. She was receiving prank calls from someone saying they were \"habib\". Did you know that in Arabic \"habib\" means \"beloved\", or \"my love\" / \"darling\" or it also forms the Arabic word \"habibi\", which refer to a friend or a significant other in the aspect of love or admiration? Julie was also receiving late night calls.\n\nAFAIK, some kind of \"known drug dealing\" in the same court, Julie was acquainted with residence.\n\nAround that time, Julie was approached romantically by a man named Noel Smith.\n\nJulie was a student at Eleanor Roosevelt High School, was a good student, had a part-time job at Linens 'n Things at the Greenway Shopping Center and earned her own income at her job, only a quarter mile from her home. The high school yard is practically on the other side of the intersection from the shopping center, even though the main building is about 800 yards(800m) away. The well-lit and open liquor store/the spot where Julie was last seen, was central to the main entrance.\n\nJulie was hinging around some \"scary people\". She was surrounded by all kinds of people at the time. Some were really good at school, some were \"not bad, but just like being teenagers\", and then there were some that weren't just not really good people. And she was associating with some of them in some ways. She was also in a youth group and hung out with a vere preppy crowd. So, her friendships were compartmentalized.\n\n**During the previous 2 weeks,**\n\n\\-Julie had a fight at the bowling alley. It is believed, that this is not related to her murder.\n\n\\-She was crying at a friends(deceased?) house about being scared - could be related to the credit card fraud at the time. But the source for this is anonymous. Why?\n\n\\-A source, not a reliable, said that Julie \"opened her mouth\"(maybe, maybe relating to the credit card fraud) about a week or two prior her death that supposedly put her in danger. The same source says that \"there are people who know what happened\". Was it connected to her workplace? Was she afraid of getting in trouble? 2 managers that worked with her and neither one was aware of a credit card fraud issue going on at the time.\n\nClosest friends knew nothing of involvement in this.\n\n\\-Was partying at an underage club in College Park\n\n\\-The previous Wednesday, a movie night with a boy at her place - The Lion King.\n\n\\-Dinner planned for the night of March 21st with a guy friend\n\n\\-\"Ice cream date\", she went out for ice cream with somebody, she was not supposed to be going out with him. He took a friend's car, drove it to where she was, pick her up because she was basically taking over from the friend to pick up Julie. She accepted the ride and she did know who he was, but he wasn't someone she knew well (getting in the car with someone you don't know well?). He was going to be driving her home but took the time to stop and get ice cream. We don't know if she wanted to go, or was happy to get the ice cream, or went along with it, but his own words after that time that he took her out, he did hear that Julie was \"talking shit about him\" and he didn't like it, but that was \"no big deal\".\n\n**The day of**\n\n\\-Ride to work with 3(some say 2) friends, had 2(according to some sources she had 3) blunts in her possession that were never found. So she had a source for buying drugs. Who? And/or from where?\n\n[Greenway Shopping Center, Linens 'n Things](https://justiceforjulie.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/screen-shot-2017-01-13-at-11-24-09-pm.png)\n\n\\-It was on a school night, but she was taking off the next day. She was going to go hang out with her friends that night because they were all going to attend their friend’s mother’s funeral the next day, which is why they were picking her up.\n\n\\-Talked to friends at work and was happy. No indication that she had any issues that day.\n\n**Around 8:30PM**, Witness A saw suspicious black male walking around shopping center parking lot. Described a black male, 30's, light brown skin, stocky build 5'10\" to 6', wearing beige flat jacket vest, green or grey sweat pants. Saw a small red vehicle, older model, possibly a Toyota Corolla, playing loud music parked behing Wendy's with a black subject in passenger seat and reclined back.\n\n[mid 80's Toyota Corolla](https://www.reddit.com/media?url=https%3A%2F%2Fpreview.redd.it%2F1985-toyota-corolla-v0-f2df8b4asuld1.jpeg%3Fwidth%3D640%26crop%3Dsmart%26auto%3Dwebp%26s%3D428a5d3d6eb919ebf3182adc7cba43de32ab2907)\n\n\\- Two girlfriends were scheduled to pick her up when her shift ended at 9:30PM. It usually took her closer to 10PM to get off work. Julie spoke on the phone with her friends and reassured her mother just before her shift ended, that her friends were coming to pick her up. That night her manager closed the store early so she was out early, around 9:30PM.\n\n**Around 9:30PM** Julie walks to liquor store with manager and co-worker. Buys beverage from store and sits on planter. Manager leaves and makes note of people hanging in the parking lot by a red/burgundy VW Jetta(possibly), occupied by 2 black males and 1 black female. All 3 exited the vehicle and were walking towards liquor store and one dark skin tone black man, describeb as slim built, 6', dress pants, dark colored short-sleeved multi-colored silk shirt and approx 20 years old, asked the manager if she wanted weed.\n\nSecond black man was very light skinned.\n\nThe black female, short hair, was wearing a big baggy jacket, jeans and white tennis shoes and was on the taller side for a female, around 5'9.\n\nIt seemed that the driver was sort of hunched forward, was he trying to hide himself?\n\n**Around 9:45PM** they went into the liquor store, but the manager said they started the car to leave(exact time is unknown).\n\nNot clear when co-worker left.\n\n[late 80's VW Jetta](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/98/JettaMkII.JPG)\n\n**Around 9:30PM** Witness B saw maroon or red VW Jetta with tinted windows driving around, loud sound system, customized spoiler, unknown race or occupant, but could see sunglasses, curly hair or afro (because only saw the top of head) and saw car earlier in the day as well.\n\nWitness C saw burgundy VW Jetta.\n\nWitness D saw burgundy vehicle, possibly VW Jetta.\n\nWitness E saw strange white van, unknown make or model, with silver stripes, good condition, possible rack on rear, van was close to CVS, drove by Safeway and close to Linens 'n Things and liquor store. No one has reported seeing it stop at Julie's or the liquor store. If you were a kid in the 80's and 90's, a white van was a thing.\n\nThe time is a bit unclear, but most likely around 9:30...9:50PM Witness F observed black Ford Mustang 5.0 \"newer model\", early 90's...1995, ground effects, chrome rims, wings on back, shiny, tinted windows and both windows down. Julie was seen between 9:30PM and 9:50PM so somewhere in this time frame this Mustang was pulled up and pulled back and spoke to Julie. Occupant described as a white male, or Hispanic male, with brown hair.\n\n**9:45...9:50PM** Witness G saw a maroon VW Jetta with a passenger door open and Julie appeared to converse with occupant. Witness G could not tell how many people were inside vehicle.\n\nWas she leanig in? Did she know them?\n\nSomeone who worked with her at Linens 'n Things say no way would she have been talking to a stranger or gotten into a car with a stranger. She was going through enough in her life that she would have been wary of that, so it seems that it was someone she knew.\n\nThat person, who last saw her, walked in and when this person came back, she was gone within a matter of minutes. I'm not entirely sure which of the witnesses saw Julie last, maybe Witness G, but they said Julie disappeared in that very short window of time, very likely 9:50-10PM.\n\nWho Julie knew that fit those descriptions?\n\nDid she ever hang out with older guys? Yes. Probably anywhere up to 20...23 that we know of.\n\nWas Julie buying weed that night? She had 2 blunts on her way to work. Where did she buy her weed? Her friends would know her supplier?\n\nJulie had wide social circles and they were compartmentalized. We don't know how close she was with each person, but it was definitely the social scene and there were people who hung out a lot.\n\n**Her friends showed up just before 10PM**. Julie was nowhere to be found. Only her purse, a shopping bag and a Coca-Cola, which was still wet with condensation, were in front of the liquor store waiting for Julie to return.\n\nIt wasn’t like Julie to not be where she said she’d be. After asking around, her friends realized something was very wrong. They checked with Ferguson’s mom, who had not heard from her. A liquor store employee called the police and a search began. In the following hours, Greenbelt police and U.S. Park Police with helicopters searched the area and Julie was confirmed missing.\n\n**Around midnight**, again, not sure of the exect time, but around midnight or a little after, woman was taking her son to work and she saw a dark, red(edit, typo) sedan-style vehicle with its lights on facing 193/Glenn Dale Blvd. She was driving past and she didn't see any people. When she drove back, she noticed that the car was gone and she thought she saw garbage on the side of the road. I assume the exact location is east of Daisy Lane Neighborhood Park, on the edge of the park.\n\n**Between 4 and 5AM**, the manager of Linens 'n Things was interviewed.\n\n**5:20AM**, it was raining and two men were walking along Daisy Lane on their way to work and at first thought they saw an animal, but they discovered her in the exact spot where the red car was seen at midnight. Julie Lynn Ferguson was found less than 5 miles(7,7km) from where she was last seen. She was left near the side of the road, in the open.\n\nHer hands were tied behind her back, \"something improvised\" had been used.\n\n**EDIT/UPDATE Apr 4th 2025:** Police know the names of the 3 occupants of the car. The female lived near Julie. She is the cousin of one of the male occupants. Her last known current whereabouts was California. **A hair strand from rope that was used to tie Julie's hands indicates it is African American in origin.** Coincidence?  \n\n\nShe was strangled.\n\nHer throat had been cut, but bleeding was minimal after throat slash suggesting heart may not have been beating.\n\nJulie did not have defensive wounds. All wounds on her hands were related to being bound, she had bruised hands.\n\nFully clothed except for one shoe, which was found next to her\n\nJulie's nose had drag marks consistent with being dragged after death\n\nJulie's knees and thighs also had drag marks.\n\nNo burns, bite marks or other trauma.\n\nRigor mortis had set in, it can occur as soon as 3 to 4 hours after death and it begins to pass within hours of onset.\n\nCat and dog hair found. She had a cat, but no dog, and her clother was newly purchased, so could that be from the car of the killer(s)?\n\nMoney and jewelry were found on her.\n\nNo blunts found on Julie.\n\nHer toxicology was clean.\n\nWhere she was found, there was a \"wire fence\" blocking that dirt road on Daisy Lane. Rumor is the wire looked like it was run into with a car. A red or burgundy car with \"wire fence\" scratches?\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\n\nJulie’s identification was found in the median of Greenbelt Road near the intersection with Lanham-Severn Road, halfway between her job and the site where her body was found.\n\nOne source said, at her funeral, the casket was white and they were allowed to write her a note on it. Someone signed it \"your boyfriend\". Apparently this person was that \"The Lion King\" boy. But did she have a boyfriend?\n\nDaisy Lane Neighborhood Park, youngsters used to hang out at. It was a semi rural. We don't know did Julie hang out on Daisy Lane.\n\nPolice have old phone records that could use some follow-up investigation into.\n\n**The car:**\n\nSome source says community car VW Jetta, another source says red Nissan Sentra owned by someone's mom, was regularly used by people in town and it looked identical(?) to a Jetta of that era, early/mid 80's. The same car with people in it was seen talking to her and a car matching the same description was seen where she was left.\n\n[Nissan Sentra 1985](https://live.staticflickr.com/5456/18016246925_2658ab9fbb_b.jpg)\n\n**Persons:**\n\n**Who is Jermaine Johnson**? Was calling her house leading up to her death. At random times, enough for her mom to say this number was suspicious. Parkdale school? Riverdale/New Carrolton/Lanham/Landover/south of Greenbelt?\n\n**Noel Smith** had known Julie before her death because she rejected his romantic advances. Noel Smith is serving life sentence in prison for a separate murder he committed in the late 90's. He was a regular visitor to Daisy Lane. Apparently he did not own a car but had access to a friend's car - which was red.\n\nSupposedly he was with his friends and they backed up as alibi. However, he seemd nervous and the story \"was vague\", but they never changed the story.\n\nBut, later he was behind bars for an unrelated drug charge and while he was in jail(or prison?), an inmate said he bragged about murdering Julie.\n\n**Doug DeSilva**, his ex-wife and Betty Krashoc, mother of Army Spc. Darlene Krashoc who was murdered in Colorado Springs in 1987(pathetic piece of shit Michael Whyte), they used to live together on Daisy Lane, about 500 yards(500m) from where Julie was found. I'm pretty sure this was long before Julie died. Long story short: is he a little odd? Yes, seems to be. He has been suspected in other contexts, but if you have to just say \"yes\" or \"no\", I don't think he is involved in the case.\n\n**There is also a person**, a local high school student, had gone into Linens 'n Things and given a credit card to Julie around two weeks prior her death. It was declined and Julie confiscated the card. He got enraged and told her \"I kill you and leave your body by the side of the road\". The LE showed up and interviewed this person, he was home being punished by his parents and they'd taken his vehicle away from him. Model and color unclear, but there are indications that he was driving a car similar to the one seen at the scene. He couldn't vouch for his whereabouts. But, it seems that he was infatuated with Julie and supposedly kept Julie's picture on the dashboard. AFAIK, this person has now deceased.\n\n**There is also (probably) another person.** This person got married in 1998. They both went to Liberty University in Lynchburg, Virginia, 200 miles(320km) from Greenbelt. The bride knew Julie from high school. He had a tattoo on his arm with cross and flowers that said \"Loving memory of Julie Ferguson\". He said they dated in high school. He is bipolar and gets into these rants and when he hurt her, he \"saw red\" and that \"you could never be the real Julie\". One time he was choking her and said in a sing-song voice \"we are killing Julie\".\n\nHe had a picture of Julie. He took her wife to the site where Julie was found and said that Julie had gotten involved with the wrong guys and she was a slut and she got punished.\n\nApparently this guy tried to kill himself after Julies's death and later tried to kill himself with Tylenol, was put back in the hospital and tried to kill himself again.\n\nSupposedly he had had a boxer with a white belly. Pathological liar. Did drugs.\n\n3 different people have mentioned this guy.\n\n**Then and now:**\n\nDNA evidence supporting the eyewitness descriptions of the three occupants of the vehicle Julie was last seen near is sitting in a box. Authorities have had the names of two of these individuals via anonymous tips for quite some time. Police have had names of 2 suspects for decades, they know who these people are.\n\n**Same edit here: EDIT/UPDATE Apr 4th 2025:** Police know the names of the 3 occupants of the car. The female lived near Julie. She is the cousin of one of the male occupants. Her last known current whereabouts was California. A hair strand from rope that was used to tie Julie's hands indicates it is African American in origin. Coincidence?\n\nIf Julie ended up in the car, why did she get in it?\n\nSome of you who knew Julie will surely recognize these people and vehicles. Would you share your information?\n\n[Justice for Julie](https://justiceforjulie.wordpress.com/)\n\n[The Raider Review](https://erhsraider.org/18230/uncategorized/30-years-since-julie-seeking-truth-and-justice-greenbelt-teen-unredeemed/)\n\n[Greenbelt News Review](https://www.greenbeltnewsreview.com/news-stories/murder-of-greenbelt-teen-remains-unsolved-on-30th-anniversary/)\n\nThere is a Facebook page called Justice for Julie Ferguson.\n\nContact Crime Solvers at 1-866-411-TIPS\n\nSend a text to 274637 (CRIMES) and in the body of your message include “PGPD” and your tip.\n\nTips can be anonymous!

      "title": "In 2018, a transgender woman who was beloved in the LGBTQ+ community, Tonya Kita Harvey, was shot 6 times and left for dead in the streets of Buffalo. It was rumored she had witnessed a murder before her death, and it may be related. Who killed Tonya? ",
      "text": "[Tonya Kita Harvey](https://imgur.com/a/T1E4yFJ) was a transgender woman who grew up in Buffalo, New York, residing in the Ferry Grider home projects with her mother and siblings. Tonya was born as “Mark,” named after her father, but her mother, Arnester Harvey, knew that her child was different from an early age- and she did her best to accept these differences, as any loving mother would. Arnester recalls how many people who surrounded the family would tell her that her child was gay, starting around when Tonya was seven or eight years old. Arnester, however, didn’t feel like this was exactly accurate, but couldn’t put a finger on what exactly was different about her child, saying to the Daily Public: \n\n> *“I was, like, ‘He’s a kid, he should be able to do what he want to do’. You can’t put anybody in a box.”*\n\nAround this age, Tonya started going by the gender neutral name of “Boo,” in place of being called Mark, despite not having come out yet to loved ones as transgender. Boo began to be bullied around the neighborhood and at school for being different, which upset her mother enough to enact a huge change in their lives: Arnester was determined to get her and her children out of the projects and into an area that would be more accepting of Boo’s identity, saying: \n\n> *“When I saw Boo being bullied and everything, I was, like, ‘I gotta get him out of here’. I gotta work hard and get my kids out of the projects.”*\n\nArnester worked as a nursing assistant for the New York State Department of Corrections for 20 years at this point, and she saved up enough money to move away from the Donovan Drive home and into a home along Burgard Street in the Bailey-Kensington neighborhood. In this area, Boo began to blossom into herself, but she also had what her mother would have considered a bit of a rebellious streak. Boo would often sneak out of her home at the age of 14, going downtown to a club called Club Marcella, and would often leave her home to spend time at hair salon along Main Street, where she was welcomed with open arms. A stylist who worked at the Garth Beauty salon, and who now owns it, named Vaughn Mciver essentially took Boo under his wing, in an order to protect her, saying to the Daily Public: \n\n> *“Honestly I gravitated towards Kita because so many people in the community kind of did not like her. She was a lot to deal with. At that time, I felt I could take her underneath my wing before somebody really hurts her.”*\n\nVaughn became an integral part in the Harvey family, and Boo would call him “Dad” until the day she died. Vaughn acted as a parental figure to many young people in the neighborhood who had questioned their sexuality, and was a huge influence in the lives of those children and their families. Vaughn comforted and helped Arnester learn to accept her own child’s blossoming identity when she was struggling between her religious faith and her child’s needs, saying: \n\n> *“My struggle come in is that I don’t want to be a disappointment to God.. I don’t want God mad at me. At the same time, God gave me a child that I know felt like a woman, that I believe deep down inside was a woman.”* \n\nAnd with Vaughn stating: \n\n> *“A lot of families, they don’t know how to cope with homosexual children. I came from a super supportive family, so I didn’t identify with those things. So it was easier for me to talk to their parents and help them understand like my parents understood.”*\n\nWith the influence of Vaughn and the love of her family, Boo began to be more comfortable being herself, and began to wear feminine clothing to school, where she attended Lafayette High. After High School, Boo attempted to enlist in the army, under her legal name “Mark,” but they told her that she was not eligible to enlist, and also, that she had a life threatening illness, though it doesn’t seem to be stated exactly what the illness was. \n\nAs Boo grew older and took on her new name as Tonya, she began to sing cabaret in nightclubs, where she met many friends who looked up to her. She was described as a talented singer and a wonderful dancer. Tonya began to transition, going to Mexico to complete the process, and when she came back, she was described as a trailblazer in the LGBTQ+ community. She inspired many others who were starting their journey in transitioning, and many, many people found her to be an inspiration, with one friend saying: \n\n> *“Throughout the years she gave me, you know, tactics—what I needed to do. She was a big staple in the LGBT community here in Western New York. She brought back a lot of things, she inspired a lot of young trans women that came out in this community around this time.”*\n\nOn Tuesday, February 6, 2018, at 5:30 pm, Tonya was leaving her home to go to the store when she was fatally shot on a dead end street, Shepherd Street in Buffalo. According to sources, there were a few men on the street and Tonya was heard yelling, before she was shot six times, in the head, neck, buttocks, groin, and back. Police arrived on scene to save Tonya’s life, but by the time they arrived, it was too late, and she was pronounced dead on scene. Nine millimeter shell cases were strewn around Tonya’s body. Tonya’s killer has never been identified, and her murder had sent shockwaves through not only the community of Buffalo, but of the LGBTQ+ community that she was so important to. \n\nThere was a rumor that went around, and whether it is accurate or not, is not clear, that Tonya had witnessed a murder only four days before her death, and that she was killed in order to be silenced. Days before, Douglas Padre Johnson was murdered at 134 Wick Street, and he was 47 years old. It was rumored that Douglas worked at a drug house in Buffalo, which sat along a similar dead end street to where Tonya had been killed. Douglas had been stabbed numerous times, and his body was left out in the open and had been covered with snow when discovered. Strangely, his body was discovered the same day that Tonya had died, and it was only three streets away from the scene of Tonya’s murder. Douglas’ murder has never been solved. \n\nOn the night of Tonya’s murder, Arnester sat down in her living room to watch some television, and she had put on a show about makeup, which reminded her of her daughter. As she was sitting there thinking of Tonya, she heard a loud bang on her door, which startled her. Arnester looked out the window to see her son, who looked incredibly angry, and she opened the door to ask him what was wrong. Her son stepped inside and asked her to sit, but Arnester refused, and asked him again what was going on. That’s when he broke the news to his mother that Tonya was dead, and she had been murdered. Arnester refused to believe that her daughter was dead, and demanded to know if her son had seen the body. Her son told her that he hadn’t, but she had been identified from her various tattoos. Arnester wouldn’t believe her daughter was no longer with her, until she finally saw the body at the funeral home, and reality set in. \n\nTonya’s funeral was held at noon on February 12, 2018 at TL Pickens Mortuary located at 66 E. Utica street in Buffalo, and remembrance rally was held in her honor on February 18th at City Hall. After Tonya’s death, police begin to dive into the investigation, stating initially that they believed  that her murder was a hate crime. Later, the Erie county DA’s office released a statement about the crime, where the spokeswoman stated: \n\n> *”[The office is] extremely concerned about a spike of homicides of transgender people across the country and will be, as part of this investigation, looking into whether or not this is a potential hate crime.”*\n\nThough police initially stated that they believed Tonya’s murder was a hate crime, they backtracked and later stated that they can not be completely certain that it was a fact. Very little has been released to the public about the investigation, and media coverage on Tonya’s case had significantly dwindled over the years. Tonya’s family had put in place a $4,000 reward for any information leading to a resolution in her case, and in 2019, another remembrance rally was held in her honor at City Hall. Tonya has yet to receive justice, 6 years after her murder.  However, Tonya is still remembered by her family, the community, and the LGBTQ+ community, with many people having nothing but loving, kind things to say about her: \n\n> *“When I first seen her I was traumatized how beautiful she was,m. She was the epitome of looking like a woman.”* - Elaise Watson \n\n> *“I want her death to mean something. Boo was the type of person that encouraged others that came into the lifestyle, that it’s okay. Her legacy is that if this is the way you feel you have to go, it’s okay. She helped a lot of people accept who they were. That’s part of how Boo was.”* - Arnester Harvey \n\n> *”[Tonya was] a beautiful girl, not just on the inside, but on the outside as well. She was a great performer. She was very talented.”* - Ebony Johnson \n\n**Links**\n\n[The Daily Public](http://www.dailypublic.com/articles/05152018/remembering-kita-harvey)\n\n[Human Rights Campaign](https://www.hrc.org/news/hrc-mourns-tonya-harvey-a-transgender-woman-murdered-in-new-york)",

      "title": "The brutal murder of Emer O'Loughlin",
      "text": "Emer O'Loughlin was a 23 year old Irish woman who was brutally murdered on April 8th 2005. Despite a known suspect, no motive has ever been uncovered and they have yet to be located, leaving this case unresolved. \n\nBorn to parents Josephine and Johnny O'Loughlin, Emer was a student from Galway. She was studying art at college in the city and was described as a \"talented artist with a love for photography and drawing.\" Her family also described her as a \"gentle soul who loved living in the rural country.\" Emer and her long-term boyfriend, Shane Bowe, had arrived back in Ireland after a year long world trip and were sharing a caravan in an effort to save money. They planned to live on the site in Ballybornagh, County Clare until they could save enough to build their own house. Friday the 8th of April 2005 was a public holiday due to the funeral of Pope John Paul II and so Emer was enjoying a day off from her usual classes at college. Shane had to leave for work that morning but recalled that the electricity supply to their caravan had encountered a fault and so wasn't working. Emer's phone had died and she needed to charge it so he suggested that she go and ask their neighbour in an adjoining field to charge it for her. He then left for work, not knowing he wouldn't see Emer again.\n\nAt some stage during the day, while at work, Shane got a call to inform him that there was a caravan on fire at his site. He rushed back home to discover that the caravan owned by his neighbour, a man called John Griffin, was fiercely ablaze. Horrifically, after the fire was extinguished, human remains were found among the wreckage. It was stated that the body was so disfigured and mutilated, investigators couldn't tell if they were male or female. A week later, the remains were positively identified as Emer O'Loughlin. John Griffin, the owner of the caravan, was nowhere to be found however and a Garda search began. He was eventually located in Galway City and when interviewed, stated that he had stayed with a relative the night before and had no idea about the fire. \n\nTwo days after being interviewed, John travelled to the island of Inis Mór and barricaded himself inside the ancient fort of Dun Aengus. After a 9 hour standoff with Garda, he was eventually subdued and taken to a psychiatric hospital in Galway city. However, only 5 days later, John walked out of St Bridgid's psychiatrist hospital in Ballinasloe. He had shaved his head and beard and was last seen boarding a ferry back to the island of Inis Mór. Garda later found a pile of his clothes, neatly folded, at the edge of a cliff on the island.\n\nAt the time of Emer's demise, the coroner was unable to accurately determine a cause of death due to the condition of her remains. However, her family were adamant she had met foul play and that this wasn't an accidental death. After much campaigning on their behalf, her body was eventually exhumed in 2010 and a second autopsy was conducted. This investigation revealed some very concerning things, most notably numerous cuts on the skull and spine. It was concluded that Emer had met a very violent and aggressive death with a machete-like knife prior to the fire and that the caravan was destroyed to conceal the crime scene. It was also revealed that a traditional Nepalese knife had been recovered from the wreckage at the time. The case was immediately upgraded to a murder investigation and an Interpol notice for John's arrest was sent out.\n\nGarda and Interpol don't believe that John ended his own life and that he faked his own death before fleeing the country. It has now been over 20 years since Emer's life was cruelly cut short and the key suspect has never been caught. However, there have been numerous alleged sightings in that time. It's believed that he is living under an alias somewhere in Europe. He had previously lived in Scotland under the name 'John McDermott' prior to returning to Ireland. In 2014, it was revealed that Griffin might have been living in Edinburgh after an alleged paper trail was discovered. Then, in 2022, he was tracked down to a drug rehabilitation facility in Scotland following co-ordination between Gardaí, Scottish police and Interpol. However, by the time his whereabouts were revealed, he had been discharged. He has not been seen or heard from since. Emer's family has still not received any justice and believe that he may not be caught, stating that \"He could be anywhere in the world now, using any name.\" The Garda investigation continues to this day but unless John Griffin is apprehended, Emer's case won't be closed and her family will never receive the peace and justice they so desperately deserve.\n\nIn April 2025, 20 years after the murder, it was announced that the Garda were launching another appeal for information. A spokesperson stated that they firmly believe John Griffin is still alive and that someone must know where he is. Emer's sister, Pam O'Loughlin, also shared some disturbing new details about her death around this time. She revealed that Emer had been completely decapitated and had numerous broken ribs, stating that \"She must have suffered terribly.\" She went on to explain that the family had only learned the true extent of the injuries 4 months prior to April 2025, despite the second autopsy being conducted all the way back in 2010. \n\nSources: https://m.independent.ie/irish-news/family-of-emer-oloughlin-appeal-for-information-on-19th-anniversary-of-her-violent-death/a902392677.html\n\nhttps://m.sundayworld.com/crime/irish-crime/sister-of-murdered-emer-oloughlin-publishes-last-known-image-of-chief-suspect/a176727619.html\n\nhttps://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-13287177/The-tragic-murder-Emer-OLoughlin-suspect-faked-death-19-years-later.html\n\nhttps://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-14605547/sister-decapitated-woman-murdered-unrecognisable-sick-details.html\n\nhttps://www.rte.ie/news/ireland/2025/0408/1506356-emer-oloughlin-investigation/",

      "title": "In May of 2020, Nicholas Cordova was on a facetime call with his two young children, when two men entered his office and shot him. During the investigation, some shady thing about his business partner come to light, including the death of his business partner’s wife. Who killed Nicholas?",
      "text": "[Nicholas Cordova](https://imgur.com/a/oTbAiKP) was born on October 16, 1979, in Mesa, Arizona. In his childhood, Nicholas moved to Casper, Wyoming, before he and his family moved back to the Phoenix Valley. Nicholas and his sister were raised by their mother and grandmother, and Nicholas was said to be calm and mellow, with great energy, and he was always smiling. In his teen years, Nicholas would attend Chandler High School, where he excelled in sports- being on both the football and wrestling teams. Nicholas  graduated from high school in 1998, and had a scholarship to college for his excellency in football, but at some point in his college career he shifted gears, and then went on to become a personal trainer, helping others with their fitness goals. Later in life, Nicholas would shift gears as far as his career, and entered into the heating & ventilation trade.\n\n\nNicholas would meet his wife, Alysha, in 2003, at his sister’s graduation party when his cousin had introduced them to one another. At the time, Alysha was 18 and Nicholas was 23 years old. The two spent time with one another at the party and hit it off immediately. When asked about how they met, Alysha told Fox 10 Phoenix news:\n\n\n> *”Then at the end of the night, he was standing at the door when I left, and I was like, ‘You're cute, you should give me your number.’ And so, he gave me his number, and I feel like the rest is kind of history from there.\"*\n\n\n They began dating and had dated for several years, before they decided they would wed in October of 2011. The couple would go on to have two children- they welcomed a baby boy named Cruize in 2012, and a baby girl they named Capri in 2015. The [family](https://netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/0c6998b3fd19eb37.jpg) was very close, with Nicholas being described as a devoted father and attentive husband. They were lucky enough to have a close support system of cousins, aunts, uncles, and grandparents living around them, as they both grew up in Arizona. Things were going very well for the family. Alysha said this about their growing family:\n\n\n> *”We were two and done. We had our son, and we had our daughter. We said if we had two boys, he was like, ‘We’d be done.’ I was like, ’No, if we had two boys, we’d try for a third.’ I could have talked him into it.\"*\n\n \nIn 2018, Nick bought half of an established cooling and heating company in the East valley called Gilbert Air, making him the co-owner of the business. The other co-owner was a man named David Sweetman, who preferred to be a “silent” partner-leaving the day to day tasks to Nicholas, such as organizing the teams and dealing with customers. Dave would only come into the office about once a month. The business partners hadn’t known each other well, but Nicholas was very hands on with the business and Dave tended to hang out on the sidelines, so the two hadn’t had a chance to become well acquainted.\n\n\nCustomers loved Nicholas, and left great reviews about him online, speaking about how kind and hard working he was. One such review stated:\n\n\n> *”I can't say enough about this company! Hard to find good & honest businesses now a days. We had them go out to my mothers home to give her a quote. Nick not only took his time but explained and answered all her questions and concerns. The price was better than we expected and he actually saved her money on work she was told she needed by other companies. I will forever be grateful and highly recommend this company to everyone.”*\n\n\nNick aspired to grow his half of the business over the next 5 years, where he then planned to sell it, and devote his time to being with his family and focusing on his children. His goal was to make enough money to retire early, because at the time he had been working so much at Gilbert Air that he didn’t feel he was spending sufficient time with his wife and children, with Alysha saying:\n\n\n> *”He was gone a lot. He would leave sometimes before the kids got up. I'd be like, ‘Please be home before they go to bed so they can see you.’ But, he worked a lot and really tried to build the company up. It was his third baby.\"*\n\n\n\nOver Memorial Day weekend of 2020, the family spent a few days in Forest Lakes, after the stay at home order in Phoenix had just expired as it was I the midst of the pandemic. Their extended family and a handful of friends joined them, and they spent time enjoying what nature had to offer. When the family returned home, it was back to normal, which meant that Nicholas had to head back to work at Gilbert Air. Alysha was grateful they had this last weekend trip together, leaving her with memories in the form of smiling photos of Nicholas and the children.\n\n\nOn Wednesday, May 27th, Nick was in his [office](https://imgur.com/a/eGV30Ek) at Gilbert Air, located on the corner Guadalupe and Cooper Roads in the city of Gilbert, when he received a FaceTime call from his wife. Alysha explained to Nicholas that Cruize had just learned a cool trick from a TikTok video, and he wanted to show his dad what he had learned. Alysha handed the phone over to her children before heading into the kitchen to wash some dishes in the sink. She was only half listening to their conversation, but three minutes into the call she had overheard Capri say “*Something is wrong with dad*,” which immediately got her attention. She rushed back into the living room to grab the phone and check on her husband, but when she did, the screen only showed white- as if it had been dropped or put inside a pocket. The audio was working, however. She listened and heard some muffled sounds and shuffling, before the sounds of someone yelling.\n\n\nAlysha tried to ask her husband what was happening, but she got no response. She rushed to grab her other phone and call 911, keeping Nicholas on FaceTime on her IPhone. In a panic, she explained to the dispatcher that someone had attacked her husband in his office, saying this:\n\n\n> *”I think they’re beating him… I didn’t see anyone… I’m pretty sure I saw a black glove or gun above… I didn’t hear any shots or anything though. I could hear him yelling, screaming – someone was hitting him.”*\n\n\nWhile she was still on the phone with 911, Alysha could overhear a male voice on the FaceTime call. She yells to the man that she has the police on the phone, asking who he was. She gets no response, but only those same muffled sounds. Then she is heard saying “*Dave! Pick up the phone!*” referring to Nicholas’ co-owner, David Sweetman. The dispatcher hears this interaction and asks Alysha who that is. Alysha, distracted with trying to get Dave’s attention, doesn’t respond, but then finally says that it is her husband’s business partner, saying:\n\n\n> *”He just came into the building, I don’t know.. He’s just saying ‘Oh my God.’”*\n\n\nAlysha recalled her helplessness being on the phone with 911, stating:\n\n\n> *”It's terrifying. I felt helpless because I'm just screaming through this phone like someone, like someone do something. Someone say something. I’m pretty sure I saw a black glove or black gun above. I didn’t hear any shots or anything though. I could hear him screaming, yelling, someone was hitting him.\"*\n\n \nPolice were quickly dispatched to the office in Gilbert, and Alysha gathered her kids and made the twenty minute drive to her husband’s work. When she arrived there, the scene was already roped off with yellow tape, and she was told she was not allowed to go past when she attempted to dash underneath it. Alysha questioned where the ambulance was, or if Nick had already been transported to the hospital, desperate to know what was going on. The officers in front of her stayed quiet, before a detective walked over to her and explained the bad news- her husband was dead. She recalls crumbling to the ground, in shock.\n\n\n\nGilbert Police immediately began their investigation, questioning neighboring offices and local nearby businesses. No one nearby had heard any gunshots, and neither had Alysha while she was on the FaceTime call. David Sweetman was also questioned, and he had handed over his own gun for testing. He explained what happened that afternoon, saying that he had been knocked out by the attackers from behind, and when he finally gained consciousness, the suspects were gone. That’s when he heard Alysha’s voice on the phone and discovered Nicholas’ body. When asked if Dave would like to be transported to the hospital or given medical attention for his head injury, he had refused their offer. When questioned by police, Sweetman had claimed that there were two men who entered Gilbert Air that day, one who had hit him over the head, and the other had shot Nicholas. He had called it a robbery, however, police quickly noted that a substantial amount of cash had been left behind in the office. Two witnesses claimed that they had left the building at 5pm that day and hadn’t seen anything suspicious, but, did state that Nicholas and David had a closed door meeting right before the two witnesses left, and it was louder than usual. Alysha had stated that after the murder, someone had insinuated to her that Nicholas had been involved in something shady, but Alysha adamantly denies this, stating:\n\n\n\n> *”He wasn't involved in anything shady or any criminal activity. Is there something I could have possibly not have known? No way. 100%. There was nothing, nothing shady going on with him at all.\"*\n\n\n \nPolice also gathered security footage of the area. They had heard from a witness that they had seen two men leaving the parking lot in a white pickup truck shortly after the murder. The police noted how tight the timeline was: the FaceTime called started at 5:25, Alysha was alerted by Capri at 5:28, and had called the police at 5:30. All of this had happened in under 5 minutes. On surveillance footage that has never been shown to the public, the entire murder was caught on tape. According to Alysha, which has been relayed to her by police, the surveillance footage from outside of the officer shows Nick running out the door, followed by two men: one tall slender Mexican man, and another Mexican man who is shorter and heavyset. Nick tries to escape, but the shooter fires 5 shots- the first three miss, and the last two enter in Nicholas’s back. The two men were wearing bright colored construction outfits.\n\n\nIn mid-June, police released surveillance video of an Arco gas station a few blocks away from the site of the murder. It had been time stamped at 5:33 p.m., showing a stocky [man](https://imgur.com/a/0sZNgbP) enter the gas station, pay for gas with cash, before pumping it and leaving. He was described as standing around 5’8” with a heavy build, wearing a blue t-shirt and jeans. This man was identified to be a suspect in the murder of Nicholas Cordova, and it is now determined that this man wasn’t the shooter, but he was the accomplice and driver of the truck seen fleeing the parking lot of Gilbert Air. The truck was described by police as being a *two-tone red and silver Ford F-150.*\n\n \nWhen Nicholas became co-owner of Gilbert Air in 2018, he applied for two life insurance policies, one for $3 million which named Alysha as the beneficiary, and one for $5 million for the business. However, without Alysha’s knowledge, in December of that same year, the beneficiary was changed to Gilbert Air. So, in the event of Nick’s death, Gilbert Air would receive the $8 million dollar payout, and not his wife. Taking out a life insurance on a business partner or employee is not uncommon- this allows the business to keep functioning in the event of the death of someone with an important role. However, three days after Nichoa’s death, Dave pressured Alysha to file the insurance claim, and told her that her part of the claim was a mere $500,000. Alysha filed a complaint with the court, claiming that the change of beneficiaries was fraudulent. The case was taken to court, where the judge decided that the insurance claims would be split 50/50.\n\n\n\nIn 2013, shortly after what was described as a nasty separation from his wife, neurologist [Laura Sweetman](https://www.legacy.com/us/obituaries/sandiegouniontribune/name/laura-sweetman-obituary?id=17927596), she had died from drowning in her bathtub. Official rulings declared her death as an overdose as well a drowning, and David Sweetman would receive an insurance payout in her death. However, shortly before her death on April 21, 2013, police had been dispatched to the Sweetman home for a domestic dispute, and the report stated that David Sweetman had manhandled Laura against her will, and that he had threatened to kill both her and himself. Laura stated that she had attempted to leave several times but that David had grabbed her by her throat and pulled her back into the residence, and he had repeatedly choked her. Laura was quick to think had had recorded the incident as an audio file on her phone, which lasted one hour and 2 minutes, in order to prove what had happened to the police. Police stated in their report that they had listened to the audio and they had heard David threaten to shoot himself but that they had not heard him threaten to kill Laura. In the recording Laura had asked to leave numerous times but David would not allow her, and at one instance they heard what sounded like a physical struggle and Laura had been yelling for help. Only 9 months later, Laura would be discovered dead in the bathtub due to drowning.\n\n\n\nIt’s been over four years since the death of Nicholas Cordova, and it appears that very little progress has been made in this case. The Gilbert police department has switched the detectives in Nicholas’ case out four times in four years, and each new detective that is assigned to the case essentially has to start from scratch, so very little progress has been made. The man in the surveillance video has never been identified, and it is also unknown how deeply they dug into David Sweetman. Alysha described life after Nicholas as very difficult- how she misses her best friend, and how their children miss their father, every day. She said that reality began to set in after six months, when she realized Nicholas hadn’t just gone on vacation and would be back, but how he was gone in a permanent way. She believes there will be justice for the death of her husband, and that police will discover who took his life, and her happiness, away that summer evening. If you know anything about the case of Nicholas Cordova, or recognize the man in the surveillance photo, you can contact Gilbert Police at 480. 503. 6500\n\n \nIn a recent interview with Fix 10 Phoenix, Alysha spoke about life after Nicholas’s death, saying:\n\n\n> *”It's really hard being in this house, because this is the home that we'd planned to raise our kids in together. He put that tire swing up in the front yard and everything in here we've done together. But, for me, it's like darkness in here. Having to live in this house that we planned on growing old together in, and then him not physically being here.\"* \n\n\n\\*Links\\*\n\n\\[Phoenix Fox 10\\]([https://www.fox10phoenix.com/news/who-killed-nick-cordova-fathers-murder-heard-over-facetime-remains-unsolved-gilbert-pd](https://www.fox10phoenix.com/news/who-killed-nick-cordova-fathers-murder-heard-over-facetime-remains-unsolved-gilbert-pd))\n\n\\[Scottsdale Progress\\]([https://www.scottsdale.org/city\\_news/police-seek-help-in-probing-scottsdale-man-s-slaying/article\\_f5b0953c-b266-11ea-9211-db989884ddf5.html](https://www.scottsdale.org/city_news/police-seek-help-in-probing-scottsdale-man-s-slaying/article_f5b0953c-b266-11ea-9211-db989884ddf5.html))",

      "title": "Who stabbed Suellen Evans to death in broad daylight in the middle of the campus of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill in 1965?",
      "text": "Unfortunately I have been banned from the subreddit and won’t be able to respond to your comments moving forward.\n\n—\n\nIt was a quiet summer day on the campus of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, July 30, 1965, and Suellen Evans had a lot on her mind.\n\n[Suellen Evans](https://preview.redd.it/yo7lp3sxat5f1.jpg?width=607&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f15a8fe5b4d6035355c77de0d9bcd5e06df49e59)\n\nSuellen, 21, was taking summer classes at UNC before returning to Greensboro to finish her Home Economics degree the following year. She hadn’t originally planned to attend summer classes; she was said to be a good student, but some of her credits hadn’t transferred when she moved from Catawba College to UNCG the previous year.\n\nOnly two weeks remained in the summer session, and she planned to return home to Mooresville, two hours away, that weekend. She was reportedly annoyed with her hometown boyfriend and hadn’t decided whether she would tell him she was coming home. On Thursday night, Suellen had been studying intensely for a sociology quiz, telling her friend she was too busy to wash her hair and planned to do so after her Friday morning class. Her cousin was scheduled to pick her up at 2 p.m.\n\nSuellen came from a tight-knit Christian family in Mooresville. Articles mention her siblings Elaine and Adrian, her mother, Rachel, and her father Glenn, who worked as a postal carrier.  Suellen had been a popular student at Moorseville Senior High School, where she was described as a, “quiet, stable, conscientious-minded student.”\n\nThat Friday morning, Suellen took her sociology quiz and then went to her education class in Peabody Hall. Class let out just before noon. She was last seen chatting with a friend near the Old Well, a prominent campus landmark. Suellen mentioned she needed to speak with her sociology professor, but when she went to his office, he had already gone to lunch.\n\n[Her route from the local paper](https://preview.redd.it/kf5igg9ubt5f1.png?width=449&format=png&auto=webp&s=a4488975693da5d8ec9ac3e371daa5cac3cc0cb4)\n\nExactly what she did over the next half hour is unclear, but around 12:35 p.m., she was walking alone in the Coker Arboretum—a lush, shaded area on campus known for its natural beauty, which Suellen enjoyed.\n\n[The area today](https://preview.redd.it/ag4zvsdfbt5f1.png?width=481&format=png&auto=webp&s=427a3d10d1a58031e1083005952cdadc120938cd)\n\nAround that time, a female student heard a scream coming from the arboretum and ran toward it from nearby Raleigh Street. She later reported seeing a “dark arm—darker than a sunburn” grasping Suellen’s leg, and then saw a man fleeing. She and another nearby student—both within about 50 feet—reached Suellen quickly, although the thick greenery had obscured their view of the attack.\n\nThey helped Suellen to her feet, none of them yet realizing how gravely she was injured.\n\n“Are you hurt?” one asked.\n\n“No,” Suellen replied. “He tried to rape me.”\n\nThe group walked toward the edge of the arboretum, just about 10 feet from Raleigh Street, when Suellen said, “I think I’m going to faint,” and collapsed. A nearby nun attempted to revive her, but it was no use. A doctor arrived on the scene, but later said they believed Suellen had died before the ambulance arrived. She had been stabbed directly in the heart.\n\nThough it was summer, there were still many people on campus that Friday afternoon. Police responded quickly, converging from all directions, but were unable to locate a suspect. Bloodhounds failed to pick up a scent.\n\nFormer Chapel Hill police chief Herman Stone later said, “It was unbelievable. It was about 12 in the daytime, and there must have been umpteen people walking through the arboretum.”\n\nThe best lead detectives had come from a workman who saw a young Black man running toward the Episcopal Church on busy Franklin Street. He was described as around 20 years old, 5'10\", 160 pounds, slender and athletic, with brown eyes, brown hair, and pockmarks or pimples. He was wearing a light blue sport shirt and dark brown trousers. Witnesses said he had previously been seen around campus, often wearing sunglasses, though he was not wearing them that day.\n\nNearly 200 students organized a search of the arboretum, hoping to find the murder weapon or other evidence. Detectives took shoe print impressions and collected scrapings from beneath Suellen’s fingernails. By all accounts, investigators worked hard to solve the case—but the trail quickly grew cold.\n\nPolice questioned a white man seen with blood on his shirt, but he was cleared after it was determined he had simply cut himself shaving. They also interrogated a campus groundskeeper who resembled the suspect's description; the man fainted multiple times during questioning but gave no confession, and police eventually released him.\n\nAs the fall semester began, life on campus returned to normal for most students. Faculty urged students to walk in pairs, but media reports noted that the advice was soon ignored. Thankfully, the campus remained relatively safe for decades to come.\n\nBy 1997, investigators acknowledged that their chances of solving Suellen’s murder were fading. They re-interviewed a longtime suspect, who reportedly had a solid alibi. Another prime suspect was, by that point, already deceased. Suellen’s father, Glenn, sadly died in 1975; her mother, Rachel, passed away in 1995.\n\n[1997 article](https://preview.redd.it/wssf0f61ct5f1.png?width=421&format=png&auto=webp&s=5e210c07b20afa99d5b2303c26ca232c8094bb30)\n\nIn 2008, the brutal murder of UNC student Eve Carson shocked the nation. Abducted and killed for her ATM card, she asked her captors to pray with her before they shot her five times. In 2012, Faith Hedgepeth was beaten to death with a liquor bottle in her off-campus apartment. After nearly a decade, police arrested Miguel Salguero-Olivares, who has yet to stand trial for Faith’s murder, even years after his arrest.\n\nThese tragedies brought renewed attention to the long-unsolved murder of Suellen Evans. In 2013, Suellen’s sister, Elaine Evans, offered words of encouragement to the Hedgepeth family:\n\n\"Don't give up hope,\" she said. \"As long as you're alive, there is always hope that something can come up, even if it never is solved.\"\n\nHedgepeth’s case has subsequently seen an arrest, and hopefully that family will receive some justice soon.  Elaine shared that Suellen’s case continues to impact their family, even into a new generation. Her daughter became a paralegal and victims' advocate; her son, a corrections officer.\n\nIf she were alive today Suellen would be in her early eighties, but sadly she will have been gone for sixty years in just a few months.  She and her family deserve justice.\n\n[Suellen's gravestone](https://preview.redd.it/envtnaw8ct5f1.png?width=845&format=png&auto=webp&s=d00a99c8878881fae78ad46bb0673e0106c49174)\n\n[Find a Grave Memorial](https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/23666429/suellen-evans)\n\n[Archived newspaper article](https://www.newspapers.com/article/the-news-and-observer-evans/174131117/)\n\n[Archived newspaper article II](https://www.newspapers.com/article/the-herald-sun-evans/174129383/)\n\n[Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder_of_Suellen_Evans)",

      "title": "Henry McCabe revisited - some misunderstandings corrected and the voicemail analysed.",
      "text": "Most readers here will be aware of the case of Henry McCabe, a Liberian born man found dead in Rush Lake in the Minneapolis/St Paul metropolitan area a couple of months after going missing on 7 September 2015.\n\nA brief summary.  Info here is based on press reports, police records and interviews with people associated with the case as recorded by David Singleton and Gregory Evans - the latter's podcasts are available on YouTube by searching \"Gregory Evans Henry McCabe\".\n\nHenry was born in Lofa County, Liberia in 1984, and because of the civil war he emigrated as a child to the USA.  His  father had been poisoned and killed.  At the time of his disappearance he was 31.  He worked for the Minnesota department of Revenue and had been married to his wife Kareen for 11 years,  He had two daughters.  He had political ambitions, maybe he even hoped to become President of Liberia one day.  He also played soccer and was a huge follower of the game.  Living in Mounds View, Minnesota, he had previously lived in California - Kareen was from Oakland.  At the time Henry went missing Kareen was in California with the children.\n\nOn Sunday 6 September 2015 Henry went to a barbecue.  He had phoned the host, Emmanuel Dee, to complain that he hadn't been invited, telling him \"You're my boy\".  There he met William 'Papus' Kennedy, a well-known basketball player who he had met at least once before.  They decided to go on to a club, Povlitzki's, some way north of where they both lived, and Papus followed McCabe to his house.  Henry then asked Papus for a lift to the club.  Papus told him he wouldn't be returning via Henry's residence but Henry said this was okay, and he paid for Papus to get into the club.\n\nNot being friends Papus and Henry didn't spend much time together.  Some of their own friends were there and Henry was circulating most of the time.  At some point he gave his wallet to a friend, J T (Jonathan Thomas) to buy a round of drinks  It was never returned.  J T was a friend of both Henry and Kareen from California.   Indeed according to Gregory Evans he introduced the pair to each other.  He followed when Henry and Kareen moved to Minnesota.  J T was with a \"girl\" that night and another friend, Calvin Johnson, was also at the club with them\n\n.About 2am Papus left the club and by his account Henry followed and forced his way into his car. He asked to be dropped off at a gas station on Papus' route home, and was talking to his wife on the phone most off the way.  Unbeknownst to Papus Henry left his keys in his car - when he found them he assumed they belonged to a female friend of his.  Confusion arose because when Henry went missing Papus told police that he had dropped Henry off at a different gas station than the one he had actually dropped him off at.  This drew suspicion to Papus until the police found CCTV coverage of him dropping Henry off at the other gas station - further from Henry's residence - although no-one was ever100% sure that it was actually Henry or Papus' car on the video.  Henry didn't look drunk on the video if it was him.\n\nKareen was busy on the phone that night.  She phoned not only Henry but his older brother Timothy Borbor and J T.  J T spoke to Henry at 0209 am.  Kareen had phoned him and told him that Henry was acting crazy.  When he spoke to him Henry told him that he was a minute from his home after J T had asked him \"Where the f you at?\", and Henry said \"Don't mind that woman (Kareen), she's crazy\".  Kareen made a final call to Henry at 0223am (she originally told police the conversation was the result of a misdial) when he started making strange noises and talking incoherently (\"He wasn't talking sense\").  She then tried to link Timothy in a three way call but he didn't pick up the phone and it went to voicemail.  Hence we have the two minute recording which only became available to the public when YouTube creator Nick Kyle obtained it in 2022 and included it in his Missing Enigma video on the case. Previously ABC had used a snippet from it on a news report.  At this point Kareen went to bed.  It was Timothy who reported Henry as missing to the police.\n\nPapus has stated that Henry had been drinking but he didn't think he was so drunk that he couldn't make his way home.  Of course Henry never made it.  Theories of how he ended up in the lake include accidental death, suicide, foul play or even some sort of supernatural occurrence.  Some believe it was a political assassination and/or ritual killing by members of the Liberian community.\n\nHenry was reported missing on 7 September and extensive searches were conducted by the community.  His body was found in Rush Lake by a canoeist on 2 November.  The FBI had been involved in the investigation, which seems plain weird.  The autopsy was unable to pinpoint the cause of death as the body was too decomposed but the Medical Examiner eventually ruled that the cause of death was drowning.  Many in the Liberian community believed it was murder.  His brother Timothy certainly believes he was murdered.\n\nSome suspect Papus and/or Kareen, with whom Henry apparently had a rocky relationship.  Henry was supposedly a womanizer.  On audio content available on the internet Kareen admits to monitoring Henry on his phone via spyware (see Gregory Evans' podcasts).  She would change Henry's passwords only for Henry to change them again and so on, back and forth.  She was recorded at the time of Henry's disappearance as saying that she knew where he was but that she couldn't prove it (by David Singleton - again you can hear this on Evans' podcasts).\n\nIssa Mansaray wrote a series of articles about Henry's death for the Minnesota Spokesman-Recorder (\"Top resource for news, sports, culture, and entertainment in the Twin Cities African American community.\")\n\n[https://spokesman-recorder.com/2015/09/23/mounds-view-man-goes-missing](https://spokesman-recorder.com/2015/09/23/mounds-view-man-goes-missing/)/\n\n[https://spokesman-recorder.com/2015/10/15/search-missing-man-shifts-new-brighton/](https://spokesman-recorder.com/2015/10/15/search-missing-man-shifts-new-brighton/)\n\n[Search for Henry McCabe ends](https://spokesman-recorder.com/2015/11/03/search-missing-mounds-view-man-ends/)\n\n[https://spokesman-recorder.com/2015/11/12/liberians-demand-answers-mccabe-deat](https://spokesman-recorder.com/2015/11/12/liberians-demand-answers-mccabe-death/)h\n\n[https://spokesman-recorder.com/2015/12/26/mccabe-death-remains-mystery/](https://spokesman-recorder.com/2015/12/26/mccabe-death-remains-mystery/)\n\n[https://spokesman-recorder.com/2016/01/19/community-family-mourn-henry-mccabe/](https://spokesman-recorder.com/2016/01/19/community-family-mourn-henry-mccabe/)\n\nSee also:\n\n[https://spokesman-recorder.com/2016/03/30/vanished-without-trace-really-happened-henry-t-mccabe/](https://spokesman-recorder.com/2016/03/30/vanished-without-trace-really-happened-henry-t-mccabe/)\n\n[https://spokesman-recorder.com/2016/07/20/vanished-without-trace/](https://spokesman-recorder.com/2016/07/20/vanished-without-trace/)\n\n[https://mshale.com/2016/01/06/family-friends-remember-celebrate-henry-mccabe/](https://mshale.com/2016/01/06/family-friends-remember-celebrate-henry-mccabe/)\n\n[Disturbing' Voicemail Woman Got From Missing Husband's Phone May Hold Clues Into His Disappearance, Police Say](https://abcnews.go.com/US/disturbing-voicemail-woman-missing-husbands-phone-hold-clues/story?id=34177863)\n\nTo be honest there's not a lot of press/TV coverage of the case that I can find on the internet, although there are multiple YouTube videos and some speculation on reddit.  Without the voicemail one suspects that hardly anyone outside the community would have heard about the case.  There is much sensationalist rubbish about Bigfoot, UFOs, the Smiley Faced Killer and the suchlike.\n\nIt is often speculated that this was a suicide or that Henry, drunk or drugged, fell into the lake. These seem absurd theories to me for a number of reasons:\n\nHenry's phone was used after the night he went missing. The same number was dialled 24 times on 7 September, starting at 3.26 am, then again on the 9 and 10 September.\n\nHis phone was found in the right front pocket of his jean shorts and the phone battery, along with some currency, was found in his left pocket.  According to brother Timothy after Henry's disappearance Kareen asked him to meet up with her in a remote location and to take the battery out of his phone, supposedly because the FBI might be listening in.  You can hear Timothy say this on Gregory Evans' podcasts.\n\nA front tooth was missing which nobody noticed whilst he was at the club.\n\nThere is clearly more than one person heard on the infamous voicemail recording of Henry in obvious distress.\n\nThere was however no evidence of bruising or knife or gunshot wounds on the body and the official cause of death was drowning.  Authorities said that it was \"highly likely\" that Henry would have ended up in Rush Lake if he had continued along the route he was taking, which they had determined through his last cell phone ping.  BS!  If you look on Google Maps/Google Earth you can clearly see that Henry would have had to fight his way through vegetation to reach the shore of the lake.  I say there is zero possibility of an accidental death.  No evidence of foul play?  Again BS!\n\nI will re-examine the voicemail here  - I don't actually think it's as indecipherable as most people say it is. But first I will examine some posts from Henry's Facebook page.  I will finally look at an interesting note in the police records.  \n\nThe above-mentioned Gregory Evans, of Hacker For Hire, who was hired by Henry's wife Kareen to help hack into Henry's phone, produced a number of podcasts about the case in 2020.  He was going to upload many more but mysteriously disappeared.  \\[Edit: he did NOT vanish into thin air - he just stopped his series of podcasts after promising many more, and his website on which he uploaded lots of info also vanished.  He is still posting on FB about other issues.\\]  He also operated as a private investigator on the case after Kareen had fallen out with David Singleton of Minnesota Community Police, \"a private organization that helps public safety assistance and acts as a mediator between citizens and official law enforcement\". Singleton accused her of withholding information.  Although there are only four episodes the podcast series ended after Evans promised more saying he had 30 hours of recordings of Kareen alone. \n\nBoth Evans and Singleton have some very interesting - and maybe questionable - things to say about the case and are deeply suspicious of Kareen.  On Evans' podcasts you get to hear conversations with Kareen, Timothy Borbor, William \"Papus\" Kennedy and the aforementioned David Singleton.  One should add that Evans and Singleton are both controversial figures.  The former has frequently been in trouble with the law whilst the latter is currently being sued by the Minnesota Attorney General for alleged fraud.\n\n1 Facebook\n\nI would very much encourage you to look at Henry's FB page to get an idea of the man. You can find this under the name of Joseph Fayiah Borbor Mccabe (Tuku). His first post was on 16 September 2009 and the last post was on 31 August 2015, after which other people have posted to his profile, such as his oldest brother George Borbor who had stayed in Liberia:\n\n\"My lil brother did not commit suicide and the circumstances surrounding his death is mysterious. There is a need for authorities to conduct a complete Autopsy which will include Forensic Toxicology to clear all doubts. I don't think anyone innocent will ever object as cause of death has to be established.\" and further \"...But whoever murdered my lil bro will be brought to justice unless there is no more God...the culprits will never have peace again until they are caught in Jesus name. Amen.\"\n\nA recent comment on Nick Kyle's YouTube video states \"No one cares about drunk Africans acting like animals.\" In fact Henry was an educated, erudite, seemingly likeable and very interesting man, not \"an animal\". You can view videos on his FB page of him giving lectures and this might help with interpreting the voicemail - he has a strong Liberian accent. He was a committed Evangelical Christian. He was interested in politics in the US and Liberia - he refers to himself as the \"people's politician\". He was a big fan of Barcelona FC. The spelling, grammar, syntax and use of punctuation in his prolific and often long posts is impeccable. He also has 1,144 \"friends\" and was followed by 182 people.\n\nOne example of his posts will suffice. In this post of 16 May 2014 (he also links a video of himself speaking) he writes:\n\n\"This month marks the 152nd anniversary since the death of the American Philosopher, Henry David Thoreau. The writings of Thoreau, especially his essay, “ Civil Disobedience,” changed the way I view the world around me and how I consider the issue of Justice, so I can avoid the deluge of injustice. Today, I present a comparative analysis of three philosophers’ views on the issue of Justice based on Thoreau’s essay, “Civil Disobedience.” My question is whether Socrates and Aristotle would have agreed or disagreed with Thoreau on the issue of Justice? I will reference some of their views on justice. From these views, I can fairly predict Socrates’ and Aristotle’s responses to Thoreau’s essay, “Civil Disobedience.”\"\n\nClick on Videos, then Joseph's Videos to see several examples of him giving talks.\n\nGeorge Borbor also said \"I think it is rumored that people are saying Papus Kennedy said on news that he did not know u when both of u took pictures together n he Papus Joe n myself commented on it. Papus knew Joseph was my lil bro which I m 100% sure about\".\n\nIndeed on 15 February 2015 Henry had made a post \"George S Borbor. I ran into your friend, William Papus Kennedy. Mr. Kennedy made me to be a big fan of the Lakers.\"  There is a photo of the two of them together.\n\n2 The Voicemail\n\nThe best videos to watch on the case on YouTube are: \n\n1. Nick Kyle's Missing Enigma episode 'The Full Story Behind The Most Mysterious Voicemail Ever Recorded' (Henry McCabe) uploaded on 8 June 2022. Nick obtained both the police reports AND the full two minute voicemail recording:\n2. A more recent video is also excellent, if a little derivative, and it was watching this that rekindled my interest in the case. This is Crime Zone's 'The Disturbing Last Voicemail of Henry McCabe' of 31 October 2024.\n\nI am using the timings from Crime Zone's video in my analysis of the voicemail:\n\n[https://youtu.be/y78luAuqf-4?si=mjTm7F2Mn981zn7R&t=882](https://youtu.be/y78luAuqf-4?si=mjTm7F2Mn981zn7R&t=882)\n\nThe first word is clearly \"Papus\" (pronounced papoose).  There follows some gibberish that sounds like \"Gamma gamma ga ooh\". Then from 14.51 Henry says some words which are very hard to interpret. Something is said ending in \"is here\". Following this it sounds a bit like \"I'm telling you guys here\", then something unintelligible ending with the words \"Lofa County\", the region of Liberia where Henry was from. At 15.01 Henry clearly says \"I'm just bringing down the fire of God\" followed by something unintelligible which possibly ends with the word \"taxi\". This is followed by growling and other strange noises, and at 15.18 Henry appears to say the word \"gas\", and then some more noise which might be Henry imitating a motor car.\n\nThe most important part of the recording begins at 15.49 when Henry suddenly exclaims \"oh!\". This is followed by a clearly different voice, one with an American accent, not a Liberian one and it has a clear, bright tone . A further voice enters in reply before Henry starts making noises again. The first voice, at 15.50 says \"You gotta car free?\" followed by what sounds like the word \"trucks\". It is just possible that this is someone's name. Remember Butch Trucks, drummer with the Allman Brothers? A more slurred voice replies at 15.52 \"the ambulances are coming\". It could possibly be Henry but it doesn't sound like it . There is no doubt about these particular words in my view because after Henry makes more noises, as if he is really in distress, at 16.20 the same words are repeated. After this there is no speech but Henry may be repeating the word vu, because a Liberian friend of Henry said on hearing the recording that he might be warning people that he has vu and they could be possessed by a spirit if they harm him.  Some of the weird vocalisations might have some connection to this.\n\nVu would relate to Liberian beliefs in 'sorcery’, ‘witchcraft’, ‘voodoo’, ‘juju’ and ‘African science’. In Liberian cosmology, the spirit world influences and regulates all aspects of daily life, for good and evil.\n\nDaimon Xanthopoulos, a photographer who has worked in West Africa, writes on the lensculture website:\n\n\"Magic and secret societies play an important role in the societies of Sierra Leone and Liberia. At all socio-economic levels, secret societies can be found and their influence felt. Indeed, they are everywhere: part of politics, culture and religion.\n\nThe widespread belief in magic and the public fight against witchcraft is one major reason that secret societies are so influential. These secret societies use herbs and ceremonies to fight against the malignant powers of witchcraft. Bewitched people or children are persecuted by special healers unions—and, on occasion, killed for being cursed.\n\nIn the villages, there are bush schools and dancing devil ceremonies....\"\n\nIn summary I would say that Henry is definitely with one or two other people. That doesn't mean they killed him. If I am correct that Henry says the word \"taxi\" - and that is not certain - this might have implications concerning where Henry was at the time. Perhaps one of the other voices was coming over a taxi radio. I am as sure as I can be that the phrase \"the ambulances are coming\" is used twice. Again we know that Henry hadn't been beaten up or in an accident. But why does he sound so \"out of it\"? Papus said that when he dropped him off at the gas station he wasn't so drunk that he was worried he wouldn't be able to get home by himself. He might of course say that to make himself look better. Before even entering the club Henry urinated near the bank ATM  where he withdrew some cash.  He is obviously intoxicated on something on the voicemail. People who say they hear a wild animal, attacking him, sasquatch, aliens or the sound of Henry actually drowning are clearly wrong. And if some other people just found him in such a dire state why didn't they take him to hospital or wait for those ambulances?\n\n3 The Police Files\n\nI haven't seen these myself but Nick Kyle showed parts of them on the screen in the Missing Enigma video.  I freeze framed the bits he showed and one part in particular intrigued me.\n\nSee:  [https://youtu.be/tI2kncP85Is?si=7ZfvmYiCXqDsBnP1&t=981](https://youtu.be/tI2kncP85Is?si=7ZfvmYiCXqDsBnP1&t=981)\n\n\"09/19/2015\n\nI received a call from Stone Mountain Lodge stating that on the morning of 09/07 at 0325 hours a silver Mercedes...pulled into the parking lot and then backed out and drove across the grass at the entrance to the parking lot at the east and followed down a small grass path that leads down the north fence line of the property.  The video then shows the  vehicle leaving at 0723 hours.  Unknown what the vehicle is doing but there should be no reason for any vehicle to drive into that area...The vehicle was then located in St Paul where it was found running in a no parking zone and was impounded...officers saw that the vehicle...had fresh damage to the front bumper and the hood with weeds attached to the front.  Officers found a YMCA card that had the photo of the r/O Andre Artzel Duncan.\"\n\nDuncan claimed that there he was alone that night but that there were \"beings\" with him.  The officer decided that based on his account \"it did not appear likely that Duncan was a likely suspect if there was foul play in this case.\"\n\nBut what is interesting is that I found out that Duncan himself was reported missing on 12 November 2015 after his family lost contact with him for several days.  His body was subsequently found in the Mississippi on 1 February 2016.\n\nHenry McCabe's body was found 2 November 2015!  Bit of a coincidence.\n\nFox 9 Minneapolis-St Paul reported on the disappearance on 5 Dec 2015:\n\n[https://www.fox9.com/news/south-st-paul-looking-for-missing-35-year-old-man](https://www.fox9.com/news/south-st-paul-looking-for-missing-35-year-old-man)\n\nFrom Twin Cities Pioneer Press 2 Feb 2016:\n\n\"The body found in the Mississippi River in St. Paul on Monday was that of a man reported missing in South St. Paul in November, the Ramsey County medical examiner’s office said Tuesday. South St. Paul police had sought the public’s help in November to find Andre Artzel Duncan, then 35.\"\n\n[https://www.twincities.com/2016/02/02/stpaul-body-river-missing-man/](https://www.twincities.com/2016/02/02/stpaul-body-river-missing-man/)\n\nThe Medical Examiner's Office determined that Duncan had drowned and his death did not \"immediately appear suspicious\".  I can't find any later references to his death.\n\nOne commenter on KSTP-PTV's FB page wrote on 5 December 2015:  \"Is there a serial killer on the loose?  How many young men need to go missing before this is considered?  There has been so many of late!\"\n\nAnother high profile case in the area was that of 10 year old Barway Collins, also a member of the Liberian community, whose body was found in the Mississippi in 2015 weeks after he went missing.  His father was later convicted of his murder; police thought he wanted the insurance money.\n\nThis has a video about the case (from 17 March 2024)\n\n:https://www.fox9.com/news/barway-collins-remembered-9-years-after-tragic-death\n\nAll very sad!",

      "title": "Body of a man is found hanging near an interstate; A note found with him explains that he commited suicide due to not being able to afford the drugs he needed to control the pain his illness was causing him- who was the Broward County John Doe? (1997)",
      "text": "Hello everyone! As always, I'd like to thank you for all your comments under my post about Perpetua, Ezekiel, Justice, and Ava Bushey- I hope that they will be found safe and soon.\n\n  \nToday I'd like to bring up a Doe case where the deceased left behind a letter. I recently covered a similar story, of another John Doe who wrote a suicide note, but this is a different one. I found out about this case through [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/gratefuldoe/comments/1bsqlwr/broward_county_john_doe_1997/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=mweb3x&utm_name=mweb3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) thread on r/gratefuldoe, so I want to give credit where it is due :)\n\n  \nDISCOVERY\n\n  \nOn the 30th of September, remains of a man have been found in a wooded area in the 3500 block of U. S. 1, near the Interstate 595 ramp in Dania Beach, Florida, USA. He had seemingly hung himself on a tree a couple days prior to discovery, but his body had already become mummified.  \n\n  \nThere isn't much that is known about John, likely in part due to the state his body was in. He was white, and between 20 and 30, about 6'1\" (73 inch / 185 cm), but his weight couldn't be estimated. His hair was brown and balding, but his eye color was unknown. He was wearing non-descript \"shirt, shoes, socks, and trousers\", and other items found with him were 2$, one key, and a revlon-brand white metal pocket knife. \n\n  \nThere were some discrepancies between the initial report and the data on him that has been seemingly standardized in different databases later; For example, while it seems that now it's estimated that John was only in his 20s, one report said that he was an \"old man\". It was also said that he was 5'7\" (67 inch / 171 cm).\n\n  \nProbably the most unusual thing found with John was a hand-written suicide note that explained why he chose to take his own life. The note had been scanned and is available to read, but it isn't very clear, so not everything is legible. However, someone tried their best to upscale the scan and transcript the note. It goes something like this:\n\n\n\n>I am expressing my Right to Die as\n\n>the Government says we don't Have\n\n>any one with half the pain that I am\n\n>going thru would do the same the\n\n>pain gets stronger by the day since\n\n>I don't have the 900.00 a month it take\n\n>to keep me in medication. And have been\n\n>to all government agencies for help\n\n>with letters from \\[ \\] Dr. telling them my\n\n>problems.\n\n>Since I am \\[not an\\] un wed mother\n\n>under 18 \\[or a senior citizen\\] there is\n\n>nothing they can \\[do\\] \\[ \\]\n\n>\\[ \\]\n\n>\\[ \\] the \\[ \\]\n\n>at least now \\[I will\\] be at Peace\n\n>and out of Pain\n\n>I get a little \\[ \\] when I think\n\n>about the fact that the Government will\n\n>have to pay for my creamation since\n\n>I have no family\n\n(The \\[ \\]'s are parts that still remain unclear)\n\n\n\n CONCLUSION\n\n  \nIf what is written in the note is true, then we actually know quite a lot about John's life: he was suffering from a disease that caused him pain, but he didn't have enough money to keep buying the medications he needed. When it comes to Doe cases, this is much more than we are usually given, since we know what was his motivation for suicide, and the situation he was in before death. We also know that he seeked help from the government but didn't recieve it because he didn't fit in the narrow criteria you have to fulfill if you were to get any benefits. He was under the care of a doctor, but we have no idea what their surname was, or even what they specialized in. John also said that he had no family to pick up his body, so he was possibly all alone in the world.\n\n\n\nIt's such a tough situation to find yourself in; It's horrible that he felt like suicide was his only option. There are books and articles that cover the problems with the American healthcare system much better than I ever could, so I'll just say that John seems to sadly be another victim of it. I've seen voices that if John was alive today, he would have more options he could take to get the money/drugs he'd need, but I have no experience with the American healthcare system, so I can't comment on that. I hope, however, that it is true, for the sake of others who might be suffering like he was.\n\n\n\nIt seems like this case wasn't handled well, or at least it was, but in a pretty sloppy way. There are no recons of John, the descriptions of his clothes are very vague, and there are no exclusions for him on NamUS. It seems like the report of his death was taken, bare minimum was done, and his case was completely forgotten about. He was \"just\" a suicide victim who stated that he had no family, so perhaps he was shrugged off as someone mostly insignificant and who wouldn't be missed.\n\n\n\nIt's such a shame that his body was in that bad of a shape when he was found, especially since his PMI was mere few days. This kind of mumification is usually what happens with corpses that have been lying somewhere for a long time, but different environmental factors can speed up the process, which I assume happened here. It's unknown as to what his disease was; Or at least, it wasn't mentioned anywhere. I think that if it caused him such pain, then the reason for it should've been found during an autopsy- maybe it was, but it wasn't shared with the public.\n\n\n\nIf they did find it, then I'd think that the next logical step would be to contact any local doctors who specialize in said disease, and ask them about a patient who had financial troubles and asked for assistance with finding a governemnt program that would help him buy his drugs. It doesn't seem that hard to do- time-consuming, sure, but not impossible. I wonder if anything was even done for John after his death to find his identity, or if the government once again completely ignored his suffering.\n\n\n\nThere seemingly wasn't anything taken from John that might aid in finding his identity now; No dental records, no fingerprints (possibly due to him being mummified), and no DNA. This case took place in the 90s, so basic DNA technology was definitely around, and it was known that it will develop further, so it's perplexing why no sample was taken for the future. I hope that the data isn't accurate, and that there is still something remaining that might be used for DNA extraction and genetic genealogy. It would be such a shame if this Doe, who was clearly suffering in life, became a complete blip in history, with the only known record that he existed being a police file and a note he wrote before death about the pain he was in and his innability to afford medications. I hope that one day he will be remembered as a whole person, not exclusively defined by his illness, pain, loneliness, and the overall lack of any help and support around him.\n\n\n\nIf you believe you know anything about John's identity, contact the Broward County Sheriff's Office at (954) 321-4735 (case number 97-09-15027).\n\n\n\nSOURCES:\n\n1.

      "text": "Hello all! I fell down the rabbit hole when I found this case on NamUs. I truly believe that this case could be solved if there are more eyes on it.\n\n**Note**: I am just a web sleuth/criminal justice college student; I have no insider knowledge or involvement in the cases I write up on. I write these write-ups in the hope of engaging the community with these cases. And bear with any grammatical inaccuracies. I do my best.\n\n**Background**\n\nKaren Rae Bosta was born to her mother, Arlene Murin, in New Jersey on December 20, 1975. She was the youngest of two other children, but that didn't stop her from shining brightly. Bosta was described by those who knew her as a bright, tender woman with a passion for helping others. She attended the Morris County Community College, majoring in Early Childhood Education, then worked as a public school teacher for several years. In 2014, she moved from New Jersey to Hertford, North Carolina to live with and care for her mother and grandmother. By all accounts, Bosta had acclimated well to the change. [(Source)](https://disappearedblog.com/karen-rae-bosta/)\n\nBosta has an undisclosed mental disorder and cognitive impairment. She takes essential medication for these conditions, which could have severe side effects if suddenly ceased.\n\n**Disappearance**\n\nOn May 30, 2015, Bosta left her home in Hertford, North Carolina to run errands in the nearby town of Edenton, North Carolina. This drive was roughly twenty minutes. She was driving her red 1997 Lincoln Continental and brought her paisley quilted pocketbook, keys, phone, and her mother's credit card. Murin had given Bosta the card so that she could buy groceries and cigarettes. Bosta left around noon and seemed in good spirits. [(Source)](https://www.dailyadvance.com/perquimans/news/local/womans-disappearance-remains-a-mystery-seven-years-later/article_455533df-4fca-5074-a7ee-59819f7467d3.html)\n\nBosta's whereabouts around this time are only vaguely known to the public. According to the sheriff's office, her phone pinged in various locations around Edenton. She visited a fast-food restaurant, drove past a crossing bridge, and visited the home of her friend, 62-year-old Thomas White multiple times. White lived on Johnson Street, along the same road as the Walgreens and Food Lion. This behavior was apparently not unusual for Bosta. [(Source)](https://www.nbcnews.com/dateline/search-north-carolina-woman-karen-rae-bosta-continues-four-years-n1012686)\n\nTowards the evening, Bosta texted her mother saying that she was with friends but would return home earlier than anticipated. This is the last known communication from her.\n\nMurin claims that Bosta was last seen leaving a Walgreens store; however, the sheriff's department had said that her last confirmed sighting was at a Food Lion store at around 10 p.m. This is backed up by security cameras and credit card records. After that, it is unknown where exactly she traveled. It is believed that she intended to go home, but she never arrived. Calls to Bosta went unanswered, though her phone was still on for two days until it either died or was shut off on June 1.\n\nBosta was not reported missing until around June 1st. Murin says that is because she was in disbelief that her daughter would disappear and expected her to return soon. When she didn't, Murin filed a missing persons report.\n\nThis is where the legality gets dicey. Bosta lived in a different area than Edenton, meaning that there were two police departments involved on the case. Plus, controversy arose when a Silver Alert was never issued for Bosta, despite her suffering from cognitive impairments. It's hard to say what effects these choices had on the overall case.\n\nBosta's car was discovered on June 8th in downtown Edenton, pulled into a parking lot off of Broad Street. It is unknown how long it had been there, but what was clear was all that was missing. Her keys, phone, and credit card were missing, and the car's doors were locked. After processing the car, there was no foreign DNA or evidence indicating what may have happened to her. It was as if she had exited the car and vanished. [(Source)](https://www.outerbanksvoice.com/2015/06/09/car-of-missing-perquimans-woman-found-in-edenton/)\n\nHowever, a big break in the case came shortly afterwards, when it was discovered that charges were still being made on the borrowed credit card. The card was being used after May 30th at a local grocery store and gas station, but the gas station had declined the card. It turns out that the card had been in the possession of Bosta's friend, Thomas White. White's story on how he acquired the card varied throughout the investigation; he claimed that he had found it in his girlfriend's car, but he later changed the story to say that he found it on his porch. Regardless, White was arrested and charged on October 3rd in regard to the theft. He has not been charged regarding Bosta's disappearance, but those in the investigation believe he may have information that he has refused to share. [(Source)](https://www.dailyadvance.com/news/local/warrants-man-charged-with-using-missing-womans-credit-card/article_834c06fd-fecb-5152-91e4-c62dd05d2645.html)\n\nBosta has never been heard from or seen since. Her phone has not been active since.\n\n**Vital Information**\n\nKaren was 39 when she went missing. If alive today. she would be a few weeks shy of 49. She is 5'3, roughly 140 pounds, and white. Brown curly hair and blue eyes. She was last seen wearing a plain white shirt, white shorts, and slip-on gray Sketchers sneakers. Karen has a lower back tattoo of a butterfly and a tattoo of a strawberry between her shoulder blades. If carrying her keys, they will be on a butterfly keychain loop.\n\n**If you have any information regarding Karen's disappearance, please contact the North Carolina Bureau of Investigation at 919-662-4500, or the Edenton Police Department at 252-337-4875.**",

      "title": "A woman is assaulted, possibly shot, and pushed into a trunk of a car during a regular evening in a place surrounded by people; She is never seen again- What happened to Krista Daniel? (2020)",
      "text": "Hello everyone! As always, thank you for all your comments and votes under my last post about the Skagit Jane Doe; I hope that her name will be given back to her soon.\n\n  \nToday I'd like to highlight a case of a very strange disappearance.\n\n  \nBACKGROUND\n\n  \nKrista Daniel was 42 when she went missing from Detroit, Michigan, USA.\n\n\n\nShe was a mother of five young children, with the oldest being 17 and the youngest being 2. Her husband died a month earlier. \n\n  \nKrista worked at a restaurant at the time, but she aspired to move into nursing. \n\n  \nHer family said that Krista was \"intelligent\" and \"kind-hearted\".\n\n  \nDISAPPEARANCE\n\n  \nKrista was last seen in the area of 8 Mile Road and I-75 Service Drive on the 22nd of April. She was reported to be in a good mental and physical condition. \n\n\n\nShe last spoke with her mother, Teri Daniel, at about 7:20 PM. Teri sent a family friend to meet up with Krista at Olar's, a party store, to lend her some money; She was supposed to come home (on foot) after that. Krista was last seen at around 7:30 PM as she was leaving Olar's, a party store. After she came out of the store, Krista crossed the west bound lanes of Eight Mile heading towards Hawthorn. She was last seen at around 7:45 PM. \n\n  \nThe police believes that Krista was assaulted, possibly shot, and thrown into a trunk of a car. This was stated by a lot of eyewitnesses who came forward after it was announced that Krista went missing.\n\n  \nCONCLUSION\n\n  \nThere isn't a lot of info available on Krista's story, unfortunately, which is strange- she was allegedly kidnapped right from the street of a large city during fairly early hours (I imagine Detroit is busy at any hour of the day), and nobody seems to know who did it and why. \n\n  \nKidnapping someone like that is pretty brazen. Not to mention that Krista was assaulted only about 15 minutes after she parted ways with the family friend and started going home. To me, that means that the kidnapper was either following her, or that they were waiting in ambush, and Krista just happened to be the first woman walking on foot that happened to be there (making her an easy target). \n\n  \nI think that the big question in this case is if Krista was targeted or a victim of a crime of opportunity- that can help us narrow down the reasons as to why Krista was attacked. Teri says that she doesn't know why someone would want her daughter dead (the full quote is below); This means that Krista didn't have any enemies, criminal ties, or outstanding debts, or at least any that her mother would know about. That doesn't mean that Krista's life was simple and easy- her husband died a month earlier, and now she was left with 5 kids below 18, which would take a toll on anyone. It's possible that Krista turned to drugs to cope, or she did something that would put her on the radar- something that would put dangerous people on her trail. I'm not saying that to put Krista in bad light, or to judge her- it's just my speculation. She was in a difficult moment in life, and it's possible she made some risky choices in her state.\n\n  \nSomething about the brutality of this crime just doesn't sit right with me. For a moment I wondered if Krista might've been attacked because someone wanted to rob her- perhaps they saw that she got money from the family friend, so they thought that they might be able to easily take it from her. But then why not only asssault her, but also shoot her and pull her into a car? Robberies can turn violent, sure, but rarely to that degree. No witnesses say anything about any attempted robbery either.\n\n  \nI feel like this had to be something personal, but the only things I can come up with is money/debts, or someone who wanted Krista dead for personal reasons, someone who absolutely hated her guts. We don't know anything about Krista's enemies- from what little we know, it seems like she was an average mother working in the restaurant industry to support her family. She was recently widowed, so a spurned lover seems unlikely. I feel like the most likely reason is money, as it often is. Perhaps Krista borrowed money from a loan shark, or had a debt at the wrong person, and that's why she was killed- she just wasn't paying her due. \n\n  \nThere is a small chance that Krista was kidnapped by someone completely random. Of course, she could just be in the wrong place at the wrong time and crossed paths with a crazy man, but I'd say that's unlikely.\n\n  \nIt's so bizzare to me that, apparently, there was quite a lot of witnesses who saw Krista being kidnapped, and yet there are no descriptions of the alleged kidnapper that I could find. There's just nothing, not even basic things like estimated height and weight, race, rough description of clothing, no info about the car... Just nothing. I don't know how is that even possible; Could nobody say absolutely anything about a man who was just seen attacking a woman and dragging her into his car? Or does the police not want to release that info for some ridiculous reason? If not for the fact that it's the police saying that Krista was kidnapped in these strange circumstances, and it's not just a local rumor or the family's theory, I would think that it's a hoax. \n\n  \nTo this day, Teri is doing what she can to get any justice for her daughter. She spoke during a crimestoppers event focused on combatting gun violence in Detroit, asking the public for any tips about her daughter's case, but also highlighting other local missing people whose cases have went cold and need new leads.  \n\n\n\nTeri says that she doesn't know why someone would want to kill her daughter. In one article, she said that she doesn't know if \"If she owed him money, whatever it was drug-related, I'm not sure\" (sic). Something about this quote feels off to me, I think it's the \"whatever\"- I think that it was supposed to be \"wether\"? And it's interesting that she called Krista's murderer a \"he\"- I wonder if she said that as a reflex, or if she actually has a suspect in mind and knows that it's a \"he\". Teri says that she knows that there are people who know more about Krista's disappearance, but that they are afraid to speak up. She and her other daughter are currently raising Krista's five kids. Teri doesn't believe that Krista is alive anymore and just wants to know where her daughter's body is so that she could bury it, and that Krista's children had a place to mourn her. Teri says that she had eyewitnesses tell her that Krista simply isn't alive anymore.\n\n  \nKrista Lynn Daniel was 42 when she went missing, making her about 46 now. She's a white woman, 5' 4\" (64 Inch / 163 cm) and 130 lbs (59 kg). Her hair was gray or partially gray and pulled into a ponytail, and her eyes are green. She has a mole on her left eyebrow, a scar on her right arm, and a linear scar on her abdomen. She has a tattoo saying \"Charlie\" on her ankle. Krista was last seen wearing blue jeans and a teal winter coat.\n\n\n\nIf you believe that you have any info regarding Krista's case, contact the Detroit Police Department at (313) 596-1800 (case number 200424-0194).\n\n  \nSOURCES:\n\n1.

She attended West Milford High School where she graduated in 1981 before taking classes at Rider College in Lawrenceville. She had a wide circle of friends and owned her home in Highland Lakes, which she painted and landscaped herself, and where she lived alone with her two cats. She was an amateur competitive shooter, who regularly called her parents just to talk, and practiced ballet with the same passion that she taught it to children.  As a teenager she was a member of New Generation Dancers in Wanaque, an 8-girl troupe that performed ballet, tap, jazz, and modern dances. At 16 she performed with them in Romania. She hoped to open her own studio one day.\n\nIt was around 70 degrees with a cool breeze as Lisa and her friends crossed back into Sussex County [driving back home from the concert](https://duckduckgo.com/?t=ffab&q=beacon+theater+manhattan&iaxm=directions&end=what%3ABeacon%2520Theatre%2Cwhere%3A2124%2520Broadway%252C%2520New%2520York%252C%2520NY%2520%252010023%252C%2520United%2520States&transport=automobile&start=glen+road+highland+lakes+nj). They stopped at [Big John's Pub](https://duckduckgo.com/?t=ffab&q=big+johns+pub+newfoundland+nj&iaxm=maps&source=maps) in West Milford before her friends (??) dropped Lisa off at her home on Glen Road, a winding, knotted community of mountain lake houses, navigate-able by only those who've lived there. A neighbor saw Lisa entering her home and locking the door sometime between 1:45 and 2:00am in the morning.\\]\n\n\\[Edit: I've also read reports that Lisa drove home herself. I don't know if that means she dropped her friends off beforehand or not.\\]\n\nWhen Lisa didn't show up for her 9am shift at Lakeland Bank the next day, her coworkers were flummoxed. She hadn't missed a day of work in three years. They called her home in Highland Lakes, and when no one answered, they called her family. Norma, Lisa's mother, got the call and then phoned [the police](https://vernontwp.com/index.php/public-safety/police-department/organization).\n\nWhen the police arrived at Lisa's house they didn't find Lisa, and they didn't find her bed-sheets, comforter, black purse, and key chain, either. Norma stated that there were signs of trouble inside the house where things had been \"strewn about\". There were no signs of forced entry at the house, though we know Lisa did keep a key hidden outside. However, when her brother Douglas showed up that morning to work on her gas range, the key was still there.\n\nA few newspapers report that the telephone lines had been cut, but it's unclear who found them this way (her brother Douglas or the police), and if it was publicly confirmed. A screen window was also found cut. \\[This contradicts other reports that says there was no signs of forced entry. The screen cut was reported many years later--perhaps to keep information close to the chest at first?\\] \n\nAt this point, the police had determined that it was an involuntary disappearance and that she didn't leave her home willingly.\n\nRichard Honig, Sussex County Prosecutor and head of the task force assembled to search for Lisa McBride, moved from his county office to Vernon Police Station where they set up makeshift headquarters in a trailer on the property. The special task force was seventeen members strong, and when the \"massive round-the-clock\" search started, even the FBI took interest. They were looking for a 5'7\", 135 lb woman with long brown hair. Lisa was just 27.\n\n\"We don't have a suspect at this point, but it may turn out that we probably have already interviewed the guilty person or persons and don't know it yet,\" Richard Honig said. \"...I believe we will eventually find the answers.\"\n\nThe search for Lisa held no punches. Overhead, helicopters with infrared beams searched hundreds of miles of New Jersey woods, and dogs covered the same acreage below on the ground. Police would go on to investigate over 750 leads and interview over 300 people, both in person and by phone. Twenty psychics offered tips, more than $150,000 in reward money was offered for information, and the NRA--of which Lisa was an active member--swooped in to assist in the search hoping they could find clues of her disappearance with hunting season around the corner. Norma gave them fliers, too, and asked the NRA to join the search. Lisa's father, George, had a plastic company, the company that printed the fliers. Those flyers ended up all over northern New Jersey as community members posted them on poles and traffic lights all across the area, in store fronts, and at the Sussex County Farm and Horse Show grounds where they knew big events would bring in big crowds. George posted $100,000 for her safe return, and another $10,000 to the person who found her \\[remains\\].\n\nIt's been published that it seems that the killer had considerable local knowledge, since there are only a few ways in and out of the community and it is not an easy area to drive to begin with. Her body was also found 30 miles away, close to the border of PA in a secluded area.\n\nThe newspapers and TV reporters were broadcasting the disappearance all over North Jersey. NBC TV ran a segment on Lisa in \"Missing Reward\".\n\nRodger F Iverson, the NRA director at the time, said \"we will walk shoulder-to-shoulder through the forest. We will climb every mountain and pray Lisa is not there.\" Iverson printed information about her disappearance in sports and hunting magazines all across the country, asking for hunters, trappers, and hikers to keep a look out. The Coalition of NJ Sportsman also committed to help in the search, led by the chairman Richard Miller. The Sierra Club also said they'd lend assistance.\n\nThe volunteers were set up to search the 30,000-acre [Waywayanda State Park](https://www.state.nj.us/dep/parksandforests/images/photogallery/wawayanda/2.jpg) ([location](https://duckduckgo.com/?t=ffab&q=waywayanda+state+park+nj&iaxm=maps)) as well as Canistear Road in Vernon on Sunday October 20th, 1990, with a rain date set for October 28th. The search territory included parts of the Newark Watershed. They were told to look for the remains of a human body.\n\nBut the search never happened.\n\nEarly on Saturday morning, October 20th, 1990, just before the big search for Lisa was supposed to begin, Lisa's remains were found off of [Old Mine Road](https://www.onlyinyourstate.com/trip-ideas/new-jersey/old-mine-road-scenic-back-road-drive-nj) ([location of road](https://duckduckgo.com/?t=ffab&q=Old+Mine+Rd&iaxm=maps&bbox=-74.81134370174051%2C41.29222440985303%2C-74.81014677677511%2C41.29132508965869)\\--it is long and goes south from the pin point) in Sandyston Township, NJ. She was found by a hunter about 50 yards into the dense woods, unclothed and mostly decomposed, laying on top of brush at the base of a cherry tree.\n\nThe hunter from Montague that happened upon the body was reported as a grouse hunter or a birdwatcher, but his identity has never been revealed. He summoned a park ranger and ultimately received a $10,000 reward for finding Lisa's remains\n\nThe area where she was found is a secluded section of woods of the Delaware Water Gap, less than two miles from the Dingmans Ferry Bridge which leads from New Jersey to Pennsylvania.\n\nThe New Jersey State Police, Vernon Township Police, and investigators from the prosecutor's office searched the area of discovery. They combed the site and the roadside with a metal detector, but no details were released about the findings. Richard Honig said they recovered new evidence where her body was found and were examining it for clues, but he didn't share more.\n\nRichard Miller called off his search crew, which included dozens of gun clubs, sporting clubs, ham radio clubs, community groups, and the Red Cross.\n\nRichard Honig, Sgt Michael Buono, and Virgil Rome went to the McBride's home to break the news to the family.\n\nLisa's remains were transported to the [Medical Examiner's Office in Newark](https://www.countyoffice.org/essex-county-medical-examiner-coroner-newark-nj-e47/), NJ. She was identified through dental records, but determining the cause of death was difficult due to the condition of her remains. An autopsy and anthropological tests were conducted. It was now also confirmed a homicide and they said they had addition information for leads.\n\nA year later, her house was still sealed off as a crime scene. And today, there has been no cause of death released, though her death certificate states she died from \"external violence.\" There have never been any arrests made in the case.\n\nVirgil Rome said the three friends Lisa went with to the concert with have been cleared, although their identities have never been publicly released.\n\nA main suspect in the case was a man who had been unsuccessfully trying to \"court\" Lisa by asking her on dates, showing up at the bank where she worked, waiting in the parking lot for her, and even leaving flowers on her car. Lisa told friends she was being followed by the man, and that he'd shown up to see her at Big John's Pub, too.\n\nThe stalker was a major focus in the beginning. For more than a year the police couldn't find him and no one remembered the man's name. But one day in 1992, Norma was shuffling through things in Lisa's room and happened across a license plate number that Lisa's friend had scrawled down. It turns out it was the license plate belonging to the man who had tried to ask Lisa out six months before the murder, the stalker.\n\nWhen investigators finally tracked him down to talk to him he was living out west, and was able to satisfy investigators with his alibi, ultimately proving he was also out west on June 23rd, 1990, the day Lisa had disappeared. He was also forthcoming about trying to get dates with Lisa.\n\nJohn T., the owner of Big John's Pub where Lisa and her friends had stopped after the concert, said he thought the killer had been interviewed but wasn't optimistic that the killer would be caught. He said that the authorities knew a lot more than what they were saying.\n\nThe site Lisa was found was about an hours drive from her house, in an area that is heavily hunted during squirrel and grouse season, which began October 13th.  The authorities said that the area had not been checked in the previous searches.\n\nOn October 20th, 1990, The Daily Record printed Lisa's obituary. Her funeral was at [Restland Memorial Park Chapel](https://s3.amazonaws.com/CFSV2/siteimages/rsp/505268-St.Giles3Original.png) in East Hanover, NJ the following month on November 12th. The chapel, a replica of an 11th century English church, was visited by close to 200 mourners. Reverend John F Dow, who baptized Lisa, read the gospel from John and Psalm 23. An organ played a rendition of one of Lisa's favorite songs, \"[Memory](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdBVJbzkoqo)\", from the musical Cats. She was buried in a cherrywood casket next to her grandfather, Albert Trinder, in the family plot.\n\nLisa McBride was the daughter of George E and Norma M Trinder of Newton, NJ. She was the sister of Douglas of Vernon, NJ. She was the godmother of Rebecca Lynn.\n\nA scholarship fund was created in Lisa's honor, the Lisa Marie McBride Memorial Fund, which is in the care of the local Vernon Police Athletic League (PAL).\n\nCircumstances suggest that Lisa was killed at her Glen Road home in Highland Lakes. She didn't have a steady boyfriend. Authorities have said multiple times that they believe they already interviewed the killer, and that they may have been in Lisa's circle of acquaintances. Norma has said she thinks it had to be someone she knew.\n\nMost of Lisa's loved ones remembered her for her laughter. They said it was infectious. She would call up her bank friend, a date at the time, Roy Jr, to tell him the Pee Wee Herman word of the day on Saturdays. Linda Fredricksen, a family friend, said \"it was hard to get a decent picture of her because she was always making faces or doing something to make us laugh.\"\n\n\"Lisa had a way of downplaying the stressful days and make us smile,\" one of her coworkers wrote. Many of the Vernon police officers involved in the investigation knew her from dancing lessons she gave to the officers' children. Everyone recalls her as independent, down-to-earth, active, fun, and popular.\n\n\"Every year at holiday time, Lisa's friends climb to the top of Kanouse Mtn to erect an enormous star.\" From the last article I read, it had been going on for 15 years strong. You can see it driving north on Rt 23, heading towards Echo Lake Road. The batteries needed to be changed every day. It required a 25-minute climb up a rock peak to reach. Lisa had once joked that she wanted a decorated Christmas tree up there, and that they could just, you know, run extension cords from her friend Jimmy's house on Union Valley Road to make it happen.\n\nNorma and George said they prefer to go to the cemetery to visit Lisa in June when it's full of life instead of October when it's dead and dying.\n\nToday is October 20th, 2024, and it's been 34 years since Lisa's body was found in that cold October that was dead and dying. But she is not forgotten, and we will keep her light aflame.\n\nI've got an eye out for Justice for Lisa.\n\n\\--\n\nIf you have a few minutes, give \"Memory\" a listen in honor of an independent woman who a life full of laughter left to live.\n\n\"Memory\" - Elaine Page; one of Lisa's favorite songs\n\n\\[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdBVJbzkoqo\\]\n\n\"Touch me\n\nIt's so easy to leave me\n\nAll alone with the memory\n\nOf my days in the sun\n\nIf you touch me\n\nYou'll understand what happiness is\n\nLook\n\nA new day has begun\"\n\n\\--\n\nWebsleuths\n\n[https://www.websleuths.com/forums/threads/nj-lisa-mcbride-27-vernon-twp-23-jun-1990.38054/page-4](https://www.websleuths.com/forums/threads/nj-lisa-mcbride-27-vernon-twp-23-jun-1990.38054/page-4)\n\nMore recent article about her exhumation:\n\n[https://www.njherald.com/story/news/2022/03/15/lisa-mcbride-nj-cold-case-police-exhume-body-dna-evidence/7040908001/](https://www.njherald.com/story/news/2022/03/15/lisa-mcbride-nj-cold-case-police-exhume-body-dna-evidence/7040908001/)\n\nPlease excuse my mistakes, and let me know if you have corrections/better sources.

      "title": "Did the acquittal of a guilty man cause his defence lawyer to commit suicide or did the police target the wrong man? A look into the unsolved murder of Scott Guy",
      "text": "Kia ora, here is another case in my Unsolved Cold Cases in New Zealand series.\n\nOn a freezing winter morning in July 2010, in the quiet farming town of Feilding, New Zealand, a local man named Scott Guy was found murdered at the gate of his family farm. He had been gunned down execution-style, shot twice at close range with a shotgun, once in the throat, once in the face, as he exited his ute to open a gate.\n\nScott was just 31 years old, a father, husband, and respected member of the community. He had no known enemies. No signs of a robbery. No murder weapon. Just a trail of muddy boot prints, a cigarette butt, and three missing chocolate Labrador puppies that would never be found.\n\nAs investigators scrambled for leads, they eventually zeroed in on someone uncomfortably close to home: Scott's brother-in-law, Ewen Macdonald, a man who had carried Scott's coffin at his funeral.\n\n**The Victim: Who Was Scott Guy?**\n\nScott Guy was widely seen as a good man: friendly, devoted to his wife Kylee, and excited about the birth of their second child. He was considered competent, hardworking, and ambitious. He had recently returned to the family farm business, working alongside his father and brother-in-law, Ewen Macdonald, who was married to Scott's sister, Anna. On the surface, their working relationship appeared functional, but behind the scenes, tensions had been brewing over family succession, leadership, and farm roles. Scott had begun asserting more authority, and there was a dispute over who exactly was going to inherit the family farm. In 2008, Scott said that he expected to inherit the entire farm, which caused some tension with Macdonald. In May of 2008, Scott’s parents transferred 400 shares (20% of the business) to Scott, Ewen and each of their wives.\n\nScott’s parents told him that he was not going to inherit the farm but would have to buy out the others if he wanted to own it solely. After this discussion, the tension apparently died down, and Scott and Ewan were supposedly back to getting along.\n\n**The Murder**\n\nIn the pre-dawn hours on July 8, 2010, Scott Guy left home to do the early farm work. Sometime between 4:43–5:00 AM, as he stopped to open a farm gate on Aorangi Road, he was shot at close range with a shotgun. He suffered fatal wounds to his neck, face, and arm. Around 7:00 AM, a passing truck driver discovered Scott’s body lying in the driveway and called police at 7:08 AM. The driver’s landlord arrived shortly after, and at 7:16 AM, he phoned Macdonald to alert him of the tragedy.\n\nMacdonald rushed to the scene on a quad bike and appeared distraught, even calling Scott’s father in a frenzied, incoherent state at 7:21 AM. Adding to the mystery, three chocolate Labrador puppies that the Guy family was raising vanished on the same morning and were never found. (Investigators later theorised the puppy disappearance might have been staged to suggest a burglary gone wrong.)\n\n \n\n**Ewen McDonald**\n\nInvestigators learned of a strange pattern in Ewen Macdonald’s past. Far from the grieving brother-in-law he appeared to be, Macdonald had a history of secret sabotage missions against Scott and Kylee. Callum Boe, a former farm worker of the Guy’s, told police that he and Macdonald had gone on several trips, which they called “missions”  to trespass and poach deer. If they were caught, they'd also return to get “revenge” on the farmers by destroying livestock and property. On one such mission, they went onto another farmer's property and dumped out entire vats of milk onto the ground.\n\nIn 2008, they burned down an abandoned farmhouse on the Guy’s property, and in 2009, Boe and Macdonald vandalised a home being built by Guy and Kylee, causing $14,000 worth of damage. They caused this damage by smashing windows and walls and scrawling obscene graffiti on the walls directed at Kylee.\n\nAt the time, the Guy family had no idea who was behind these incidents. It wasn’t until police interrogated Boe in 2010–2011 that he confessed to these acts and implicated Macdonald.\n\nRoughly nine months after the murder, police made the decision to arrest Macdonald, then 30 years old, and charge him with the murder of his brother-in-law. On April 8, 2011, Macdonald appeared in court in Palmerston North to face the murder charge, as well as multiple related charges (suppressed at the time) for the prior vandalism, arson, and animal-killing incidents that the investigation had uncovered. \n\nThe news devastated the Guy family. Scott’s father, Bryan Guy, described the development as “our worst nightmare,”. Still, the family resolved to let the justice process play out, and Bryan said he would give Macdonald the benefit of the doubt as the case went to trial. Macdonald, through his lawyer, denied any involvement in Scott’s killing and has maintained his innocence.\n\n**The Evidence**\n\nThis was a case that lacked substantial, concrete evidence.\n\nThe Crown prosecutors laid out a narrative of simmering sibling rivalry and calculated murder. They argued that Macdonald’s jealousy and fear of losing his place in the family business drove him to kill Scott. \n\nAccording to the prosecution, Macdonald lured Scott into an ambush by closing the farm’s gate on the driveway, causing Scott to stop his ute. As Scott got out of his vehicle to open the gate, Macdonald allegedly shot him twice at close range with a 12-gauge shotgun. The time of death was estimated around 4:43 AM, based on a nearby resident reporting an early gunshot sound.\n\nThe only physical evidence tying Macdonald to the scene was a set of footprints: more than 50 impressions had been left in the mud by size 9 dive boots. Investigators did not recover the actual boots, but an expert linked the distinctive sole pattern to a Proline dive boot of size 9 – the same size Macdonald wore. \n\nThe Crown claimed Macdonald had used the Guy family’s own shotgun as the murder weapon and then staged a burglary to mislead police, possibly by shooting or disposing of the Labrador puppies that vanished that morning. \n\n\n\n**The Defence’s case:**\n\nMacdonald’s defence, led by attorney Greg King, vigorously attacked the prosecution’s evidence as circumstantial and riddled with doubt. They identified “four fatal flaws” in the Crown’s case.\n\n*1. Timeline*\n\nWhile police believed the murder happened around 4:43 AM, several witnesses reported hearing gunshots closer to 5:00 AM or shortly after. In fact, four neighbours testified to hearing three gunshots in quick succession around 4:50–5:00 AM – later than the Crown’s timeline and also a different number of shots.\n\nThis was crucial because the Guy family’s farm shotgun was a double-barrelled model, only capable of two quick shots before reloading. An American firearms expert testified that it could not have fired three shots so rapidly, suggesting that if three shots were truly heard, a different firearm (possibly a semi-automatic shotgun) must have been used. This opened the possibility of an unknown shooter with another weapon.\n\n*2. Possible Alibi*\n\nThe defence produced witnesses (including farm workers) who said they saw Macdonald present at the milking shed around 5:00 AM, behaving normally. If accurate, that would overlap with the time of the gunshots and imply he couldn’t have been 1.5 km (0.93 miles) away on the road committing the murder at that same moment. It is important to note that the murder could have been done in this timeframe if Macdonald drove his quad bike to and from the scene of the crime. \n\nThe average speed of a quad bike depends on several factors, including the type of quad bike (sport, utility, etc.), the terrain, and the rider's experience. I am unsure of the kind of bike that Macdonald owned. Generally, ATVs can reach speeds between 50 and 110 km/h (30-70 mph), with some sport models capable of exceeding 130 km/h (80 mph).\n\nThis means even if Macdonald were driving at an average speed of 30km/h throughout the journey, it would only take him roughly 3 minutes to drive between the scene of the crime and where he was milking the cows. \n\n*3. The Shoes*\n\nThe third major point was the footprint evidence: the prosecution contended the muddy boot prints were size 9 (Macdonald’s size), but the defence expert argued the cast impressions had 33 waves on the sole pattern, consistent with a much larger boot (around size 11 or 12).\n\nFurthermore, Macdonald claimed that his own size 9 dive boots had been discarded two years before, and the shoes were never found by police despite extensive searches. T\n\n*4. Police Incompetence*\n\nKing argued that police had overlooked or ignored other potential suspects and clues in their laser focus on Macdonald.\n\nThe defence highlighted several suspicious incidents: for example, unknown vehicle tracks were found near the crime scene, and a farmhand reported seeing an unfamiliar dark sedan driving away from the direction of Scott’s house around the time of the murder (with a second car following shortly after 5 AM). Despite public appeals, police never identified these vehicles, a fact one defence lawyer said “just defies belief, unless that car is connected with the murder.”\n\nAnother abandoned lead was a local burglar with a record of violent crime: just four days before the murder, this man had carried out an armed robbery in the area, stealing (among other things) a carton of Winfield Gold cigarettes – the same brand of cigarette later found discarded near Scott’s driveway after the shooting.\n\nYet police cleared this suspect based on an iffy alibi (his partner, high on methamphetamine, claimed he was home around 4 AM) and did not pursue him further.\n\nThe jury also heard that two weeks before the murder, a “tall, unshaven” stranger had shown up drunk and agitated at the Berry residence (the truck driver who later found Scott’s body), banging on the door asking for Scott Guy in the middle of the night. This strange incident was reported to police, but no follow-up was done to identify the man. \n\nAdditionally, an assistant farm manager, Simon Asplin, who knew Scott since school days, admitted he held a grudge against him and even remarked that “Scott’s pissed a lot of people off.” Asplin was upset that when Scott returned to work on the family farm in 2008, Asplin lost his coveted tractor-driving role. Tellingly, Asplin acknowledged under oath that he “gained” from Scott’s death, because he got his old tractor job back afterwards. \n\nWhile the defence stopped short of directly accusing these other individuals, their point was made: there were multiple avenues of investigation and possible motives beyond Macdonald, which the police allegedly failed to fully explore.\n\n**Verdict**\n\nAfter four weeks, the jury deliberated for just 11 hours. Verdict: Not Guilty.\n\n**So What Happened Next?**\n\nMacdonald wasn’t off the hook entirely. He was sentenced to five years in prison for the vandalism and sabotage. He served four years, divorced Anna, and then disappeared from the public eye.\n\nMacdonald’s lawyer, Greg King, committed suicide just a few short months after the trial had ended. King's wife, Catherine Milnes-King, told the coroner that her husband was publicly slated after the trial and that, in the evening, after delivering his closing address in the Macdonald case, her husband had a massive breakdown. The coroner revealed the suicide note explained: \"he is haunted by the dead from his numerous homicide cases and hates himself for what he has done.\"\n\nImmediately after the trial, Bryan and Jo Guy (Scott’s parents) tried to make peace with the outcome, saying they didn’t want to live in bitterness and just wanted the truth to surface eventually. They thanked the police and accepted that the evidence hadn’t met the high threshold for conviction. Yet, interviews conducted in later years have revealed how the unresolved nature of the case continues to weigh on them.\n\nScott’s widow, Kylee, has persistently sought answers. She hired a private investigator in the hopes of solving the case, but sadly, this turned up no new leads. Kylee has since moved away and raised her sons, but in interviews, she has expressed hope that one day they will know who killed their father.\n\nThe police regard this case as closed and are not investigating further.\n\n \n\n**Unanswered Questions:**\n\n* If not Macdonald, then who? Could the local burglar, the mystery man, or someone else entirely be behind it?\n* Where are the puppies? The boots? The shotgun? Were these taken to stage a fake burglary, or do they hold a darker purpose?\n* What about the cigarette butt? DNA testing in 2025 could yield results never possible in 2010. Why hasn’t it been done?\n* Did police suffer from tunnel vision? Did their obsession with Macdonald cost them the chance to solve the case?\n\n \n\n\n**Bibliography**\n\nCarolyne Meng-Yee, “Scott Guy murder mystery: 'We will never forget or forgive,' say slain farmer's family” NZ Herald (26 June 2020) https://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/scott-guy-murder-mystery-we-will-never-forget-or-forgive-say-slain-farmers-family/5WLYAAGVGCVOE5Y5L5L4WZN3G4/.\nRNZ+3NZ Herald+3Wikipedia+3\n\n“Case #036 - Scott Guy” RNZ (1 March 2022) https://www.rnz.co.nz/programmes/crimes-nz/story/2018827268/case-036-scott-guy.\nRNZ+4RNZ+4RNZ+4\n\n“Scott Guy murder: Private investigator uncovers new information” NZ Herald (26 June 2020) https://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/scott-guy-murder-private-investigator-uncovers-new-information/XJR23EWRJVPD7XGHVSDMEP35EQ/.\nNZ Herald\n\n“Crimes NZ: Scott Guy murder” RNZ (12 November 2020) https://www.rnz.co.nz/national/programmes/afternoons/audio/2018772521/crimes-nz-scott-guy-murder.\nRNZ+1RNZ+1\n\n“A Moment In Crime Podcast: The murder of Scott Guy - 10 years on from the murder of a farmer, father, friend” NZ Herald (26 June 2020) https://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/a-moment-in-crime-podcast-the-murder-of-scott-guy-10-years-on-from-the-murder-of-a-farmer-father-friend/AIUJKRNZE2BMSKJMCJ5SI4QBTA/.\nNZ Herald\n\n“Brother-in-law found not guilty of killing Scott Guy” RNZ News (3 July 2012) https://www.rnz.co.nz/news/national/109780/brother-in-law-found-not-guilty-of-killing-scott-guy.\nRNZ+1RNZ+1\n\n“Scott Guy's father: Solving killing hinges on someone coming forward” NZ Herald (7 September 2013) https://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/scott-guys-father-solving-killing-hinges-on-someone-coming-forward/ZP576MXMGSKZCC45667WNYETOA/.\nNZ Herald\n\n“A decade on from Scott Guy's murder” RNZ (6 July 2020) https://www.rnz.co.nz/national/programmes/afternoons/audio/2018753723/a-decade-on-from-scott-guy-s-murder.\nRNZ+7RNZ+7RNZ+7\n\n“Timeline in Scott Guy murder case” NZ Herald (3 July 2012) https://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/timeline-in-scott-guy-murder-case/YZX4UTZBAJEZTBD7O5T7NCJIUM/.\nNZ Herald\n\n“Father tells of hearing Scott Guy killed” RNZ News (6 June 2012) https://www.rnz.co.nz/news/national/107589/father-tells-of-hearing-scott-guy-killed.\nRNZ+2RNZ+2RNZ+2\n\n“Kylee Guy still determined to get justice for husband Scott Guy's murder” NZ Herald (26 June 2020) https://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/kylee-guy-still-determined-to-get-justice-for-husband-scott-guys-murder/CAKTQHQWIC346DDW5TANX4EDRQ/.\nNZ Herald\n\n“Scott Guy murder trial and Mark Lundy retrial judge Simon France dies, age 64” RNZ News (11 April 2023) https://www.rnz.co.nz/news/national/487717/scott-guy-murder-trial-and-mark-lundy-retrial-judge-simon-france-dies-age-64.\nRNZ\n\n“Book on Scott Guy murder an 'absolute joke'” NZ Herald (14 September 2013) https://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/book-on-scott-guy-murder-an-absolute-joke/TSSO2POOAHKHPSSVA2MAPYOVMA/.\nNZ Herald+1NZ Herald+1\n\n“Coroner not reopening Scott Guy case” RNZ News (1 November 2013) https://www.rnz.co.nz/news/national/226439/coroner-not-reopening-scott-guy-case.\nRNZ\n\n“Scott Guy murder accused Ewen Macdonald out of prison, playing rugby in Christchurch” NZ Herald (28 November 2015) https://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/scott-guy-murder-accused-ewen-macdonald-out-of-prison-playing-rugby-in-christchurch/AWP2VMPLMQZVJJ74FJWSZUYEE4/.\nNZ Herald\n\n“Accused a good marksman, Scott Guy trial told” RNZ News (13 June 2012) https://www.rnz.co.nz/news/national/108029/accused-a-good-marksman%2C-scott-guy-trial-told.\nRNZ+4RNZ+4RNZ+4\n\n“Focus: Scott Guy murder never forgotten by parents ten years on” NZ Herald (26 June 2020) https://www.nzherald.co.nz/the-country/news/focus-scott-guy-murder-never-forgotten-by-parents-ten-years-on/NJSM4YNBLUS6KHIOTWBYOEK5TA/.\nNZ Herald\n\n“Scott Guy case like horror movie, family friend says” RNZ News (4 July 2012) https://www.rnz.co.nz/news/national/109874/scott-guy-case-like-horror-movie%2C-family-friend-says.\nRNZ+2RNZ+2RNZ+2\n\n“Guy case mystery calls may point to accomplice” NZ Herald (13 September 2013) https://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/guy-case-mystery-calls-may-point-to-accomplice/TBR5ZAW3A622XB34CNCFOORY7Y/.\nNZ Herald\n\n“Ewen Macdonald released from prison” RNZ News (2 November 2015) https://www.rnz.co.nz/news/national/288642/ewen-macdonald-released-from-prison.\nRNZ",

Despite no physical evidence, local weirdo Brandon Lee Flagner would be convicted of her murder based on his confession (which he rescinded a month later).",
      "text": "I began to research this case for my podcast and got pulled into this strange, fascinating case. Most law enforcement still consider this an open case and most also agree Brandon Lee Flagner deserves to be locked up even if he is not guilty of this crime. What do you think?\n\nTiffany Jennifer Papesh. Tiffany was an 8 year old girl from Maple Heights, Ohio when she vanished without a trace on June 13, 1980. \n\nOn that Friday night, Tiffany's family was busy preparing for a family camping vacation at 6pm that night. Tiffany was sent to a Convenient Food Mart close to her home to buy a pack of hamburger buns. She was last seen leaving the store at about 2:45 pm. and has never been seen again.\n\nArriving home from work, her father, Frank Papesh, went to the store with his son Ricky, to find her about 20 minutes after she was supposed to be home but Frank couldnt find her and became worried and hurried home.\n\nHe notified the police and attempted to file a missing persons report. However, police said that the family had to wait 24 hours since her last known appearance and didnt seem to be much help. Her family now began to panic, and started to search on their own, but deep inside they sensed that something terrible had happened. Desperate for help, Frank called the mayor, who agreed to send word to the police department to begin the investigation process.  However, no search or interview happened until the following morning. The Papesh family searched through the night but there was no sign of Tiffany.\n\nThe next day with the law enforcement search underway, investigators questioned Frank for several very long interview sessions where police determined he had been at work at the time that Tiffany went to the store and was cleared as a suspect. Tiffany's stepmother, Debbie, was also questioned and was also cleared after passing a polygraph. Police conducted several exhaustive searches with over 600 volunteers and despite extensive newspaper and television coverage, no sign of Tiffany was ever discovered. Police would interview over 300 people and even solicit the help of an area psychic all to no avail.\n\nWitness from the store that day would claim Tiffany had been seen with a woman, approximately 50 years old. Reportedly this woman allowed Tiffany to pass her in the checkout line, then left the store at the same time. The mystery woman had short brown hair, was about 5'4 and 180lbs, and  could have been driving a blue car. This woman has never come forward nor been identified and police began to search for her to question her too ultimately never making contact with her.\n\nCases like these tend to bring some the darker fringes of society into the light. One of these fringes was a young man named Chico Virgilio Tenorio. On the surface, he seemed to be just another of the 600 volunteers helping the Papesh family search for Tiffany. However he offered to print T-Shirts with Tiffany’s picture on it and to print and distribute 15,000 flyers to assist in the search. Soon word got back to the Papesh’s that he was actively soliciting money to help in the “search”. Once Frank became alerted to this, He notified the police and they requested Tenorio to come to the Papesh house. Tenorio showed up the next day where he was promptly arrested. After returning the money he claimed to have raised over to the Papesh’s he was released and no charges were ever filed. What authorities didnt know at the time was that this man had been paroled 3 months prior for child molestation charges. But more on him later.\n\nDesperate for to find Tiffany, Frank would contact the FBI to get involved but they would not intervene unless invited or if a ransom note was received. Curiously, 4 days after her disappearance, the Papesh family received a ransom letter stating they had kidnapped Tiffany and would return her only if the Papeshes paid a $40,000 ransom and to not contact the police. There was a lock of hair taped to the top of the letter and the FBI took the letter and lock of hair. Frank Papesh would later state he was never able to get a definitive answer as to whether or not the hair belonged to Tiffany; the FBI reportedly refused to give a simple yes or no. No ransom was ever paid and the lead seemed to instantly grow cold. \n\nEarly into the investigation police released a sketch of a man they considered to be involved in her abduction. This man had allegedly attacked a 12 year old girl a year prior to Tiffany's disappearance. Despite this encouraging lead there is no information on who this man was, or if anything ever came of it.\n\nAfter several heartbreaking months and no signs of Tiffany, a sad resignation began to settle over Tiffany's family. While most neighbors had initially been supportive, dark rumors and stories began to emerge that Frank was somehow involved with the mob and Tiffany's disappearance was a result of Frank not paying off a debt. \n\nWith a heavy heart, Frank Papesh returned to work and would soon receive a call at work explaining where to find Tiffany's body in a nearby park. Frank immediately contacted the Bedford Park rangers to determine if an area matching the description given was in the park and the rangers confirmed there was. Frank asked the rangers to contact law enforcement to meet him there but no law enforcement ever showed. Frank gathered friends and  searched the area himself. He found a plastic bag from Convenient Food Mart, the same store from which Tiffany was likely abducted. \n\nFrank called the FBI and local police again to come search the area; they refused again, saying the bag was a merely a coincidence. The FBI also refused to alert national press to broadcast information about Tiffany's disappearance and the case seemed to go cold.\n\nIn an attempt to exhaust every resource, Frank would begin a foundation called People for Justice, which focused on strengthening prison sentences and reinstating the death penalty.\n\nEnter Brandon Lee Flagner.\n\nBorn Chico Virgilio Tenorio, Flagner was born in 1952 and grew up in Elyria, Ohio and it's fair to say he was no saint. He spent many years in prison for various charges usually involving very young girls and seemed to almost always be in trouble. This was the same man who offered to help the Papesh’s in finding their daughter Tiffany. \n\nIn 1976, at age 24, he got into an argument with his then girlfriend and the police were called. He resisted questioning and got into a small shoving match with police. For this, he served 2 weeks in the local jail. When he returned to his girlfriend he learned she was pregnant with his child. Really wanting nothing to do with him, his girlfriend refused to allow him to name their son “Chico Tenorio Jr”. Instead Tenorio decided to adopt his son’s name, thus on April 15, 1977 Brandon Lee Flagner (Sr.?) officially came to be. \n\nFlagner soon found work at an Elyria restaurant as a cook and the sympathetic owners allowed him to live in their home. This arrangement didnt last long when Flagner professed his love for the couples 10 year old daughter. When the girl’s mother learned of this, she flew into a rage and Flagner escaped, landing in Austin, Texas. Soon Flagner would begin to agressively seek young girls in schools and shopping malls and the local police began to pay attention. He was caught attempting to break into an Austin house and in April of 1978 would be captured and convicted for burglary and was sentenced to 5 years probabtion. \n\nFlagner then decided to return back to Elyria to “patch things up” with the 8 year old girl he professed to love. On July 15, 1978 He tried to break into the girl’s bedroom window but was instantly caught. The Ohio Reformatory would be his new home serving a 2-5 year sentence. \n\nUpon his release, he returned to Creston, Ohio where he would meet and begin a secret affair with Carol Woodward who inexplicably invited Flagner to share the same house as her husband and 15 year old daughter. Shortly after, her daughter would admit being pregnant with Flagner’s child. To avoid the wrath of Carol’s husband, Carol, her pregnant daughter and other child joined Flagner as they struck out for Austin. It was during this stint in Creston that Tiffany Papesh would vanish.\n\nReturning back to Austin, Flanger parted ways with his girlfriend and her children (and his child) and continued his old ways with new reckless abandon. By his estimates would expose himself and molest over 400 girls in this stretch in Austin. He was caught molesting 2 young girls at an Arlington playground and would be arrested 3 months later. During those 3 months, police would claim he was involved in at least 5 other cases but in August ’81, Flagner would be convicted and sentenced to 10 years the Arlington crimes. While in prison, Flagner claimed to wanting to get help but in reality he was actively writing and communicating with young girls in the “Pen Pal’ program until prison authorities ended the practice. \n\nFlagner then approached prison authorities with an idea. He would travel the country on a lecture circuit of sorts where he would educate parents and police on the dangers of child molestation and how to prevent it. Prison officials offered a short reply for him to “stick it”.\n\nIn 1983, Flagner, now an inmate at a Palestine, Texas prison was due to be released soon. \n\nHe wrote a letter to Cleveland News station WEWS to confess to the abduction, rape and murder of Tiffany claiming his confession was driven by the guilt of this awful crime and to ease the suffering of the Papesh family. He would claim that he was on his way from his then home in Creston, Ohio to Cleveland to kill a man who had raped him in prison. He grew thirsty along his journey and had randomly stopped at this store to purchase a drink when fate would put him in the same store as Tiffany. \n\nFlagner stated that he had followed Tiffany home, took her to a wooded area close to a nearby school, and attempted to sexually assault her. When Tiffany fought back, he accidentally shot her in the head. In a gruesome twist, Flagner said he then dismembered her body, ate a portion of her remains, then stored the remainder in a freezer and claimed he hid her body parts in various places throughout Ohio. Flagner also supposedly mentioned a specific scar on Tiffany's right knee, something that had not yet been revealed to the public. This detail caused authorities to seriously consider him as a suspect. \n\nHowever investigators soon began to doubt his story as Flagner would tell 30 different versions of story to various detectives. Flagner would testify that he was married 4 times (twice legally and twice common law) and was in the process of divorcing his most recent wife of 17 years old after 4 years of marriage. \n\nJust a short month later, Flagner would recant his confession and deny any involvement in Tiffany’s death realizing the depth of trouble he was in. Flagner would advise investigators he simply confessed so that he could remain in prison to take advantage of the programs and assistance available for sexual predators.   \n\nIn light of Flagner’s wavering confessions, he was extradited back to Ohio and booked into the Cuyahoga County jail in August 1984 despite the lack of any physical evidence. A competency hearing was called, and Flagner was found competent to stand trial which began in 1985. \n\nFlagner reportedly asked his wife and brother to destroy a metal box in the trunk of his car in the days following Tiffany's disappearance. The wife and brother stated that the box had various children's clothing and children's objects. There is no information on the whereabouts of this box, nor if this box had any of Tiffany's belongings. About 4 months after Tiffany went missing, Flagner alleged to his brother that Frank Papesh had hired him to find Tiffany, and he believed Tiffany's father, Frank had actually killed his daughter.\n\nThe Papesh family was said to never believed that Brandon Flagner had anything to do with Tiffany's disappearance but were satisfied to see Flagner sentenced to life behind bars. \n\nAdditionally, Flagner's employer at Sta-Co, a factory in Creston, OH, stated that Flagner had been at work the day of her disappearance, seeing as the machinery he worked on required five employees to operate it, and Flagner was one of only five people able to do so. \n\nSome of his fellow employees deny seeing him at work that day, but his employer believed he must have been due to the operation of the machine as there were no problems with the production line on this day. \n\nThe factory where he was employed was about an hours drive to Maple Heights. Assuming Brandon had been at work at the time he would have had to drive an hour each way, leaving only 20 minutes to complete the abduction, attempted rape, murder, and cover-up. Flagner is still imprisoned in the Pickaway Correctional Institute to this day and was denied parole in 2019. He claims to have molested more than 400 girls, which lends credence to the belief that he is either delusional or seeking attention.\n\nFlagner's lawyers stated that Flagner was innocent and was deluded by fantasies of solving Tiffany's disappearance by inserting himself into it and getting arrested by somehow becoming “closer” to the case. According to his legal team, Flagner thought being so close to investigators would give him enough information to solve the crime and thus become a hero.\n\nDuring his trial, several young girls testified they too had been assaulted by Flagner. Their testimony against him detailed the threats and violence he used against them and it was clear the tide had turned and Flagner was facing a guilty verdict. One point of interest was the testimony of Carol Woodward, his former girlfriend who had travelled from her Ohio home to Texas (with her daughter, now 19, and Flagner’s son Michael). Woodward testified that Flagner wrote her twice in 1983, the first time she had heard from him since he left her in 1980 in Texas. She claimed in the first letter, Flagner admitted to killing Tiffany but that she shouldn’t alert authorities. In the next letter, he denied any involvement in the murder and that he was being paid to take the blame for it. He had even produced a check in the amount of $10K to prove it. For her part, Woodward claimed she didnt alert authorities because she wanted to put the whole thing behind her. She also testified that at one point, Carol and her daughter joined Flagner in searching for Tiffany’s body along a highway between Maple Heights (where she was last seen) and Creston. \n\nBased on the testimony of the young girls and his confession and some similarities between his initial story and stories of his past victims, In July of that year, Brandon Flagner was indicted and found guilty in June 1985 on two counts of aggravated murder and one count of kidnapping of Tiffany Papesh and was sentenced to life in prison and received an additional 25 years for the abduction. Currently, he is being held in Ohio’s Pickaway Correctional Institutional facility. He would appeal the case and lose. He tried again in 1998 claiming one of the detectives (Argo) had written in his notes that he didnt think Flagner was guilty but was denied again.\n\nWhile Flagner appears to be the best suspect, there were other suspects as well. In 1983, police would annouce Robert Anthony Buell was as a person of interest in Tiffany's disappearance. He had been arrested for and was the primary suspect of three other abductions in the area (Damascus, Massillon, and Marshalville). However, the only evidence linking Buell to Tiffany's crime is that Tiffany fits the profile of the other women and girls he abducted, and investigators note similarities in their cases. The victims are an unnamed woman who escaped his abduction, Krista Harrison, and Tina Harmon.\n\nSome people would speculate that Tiffany was murdered by the Oakland Child Killer. Most of these children's murders happened in Oakland County, Michigan in the 1970s and the main suspect in this case, Ted Lamborgine, had moved to nearby Parma, OH around the time Tiffany went missing. Two of the OCK victims were roughly her age, and they had both been abducted and killed after leaving grocery or convenience stores. Tiffany also reportedly has a strikingly similar appearance to the female victims of OCK.\n\nFrank Papesh would pass away in 2000 without ever learning what happened to his daughter. \n\nA parole hearing for Flagner was held in 2019, but he was denied. \n\nTo this day, Tiffany Papesh has never been found. No body, no clothing, no weapon. She simply disappeared.\n\nShe was 4'0 and 58lbs with brown hair and blue eyes and her family called her \"TJ\".

      "title": "Who shot Ed Pons, a well-respected deputy county manager, while he was out on his evening walk? He himself had a year to solve his own murder, before he passed from his injuries.  Over twenty years later and the police aren’t investigating further.",
      "text": "Ed Pons was born in Greensboro, North Carolina, in 1951. He was raised by his mother, Frances, along with his brother Tim. Ed was said to be both intelligent and dedicated to his passions. He was an Eagle Scout, a wrestler, and reportedly even invented a parachute prototype while still in high school.\n\n[Ed Pons](https://preview.redd.it/irw2dbz64q3f1.png?width=460&format=png&auto=webp&s=6fab50ade04f6164a6d4c9de44d90f30daa53751)\n\nHis mother Frances raised the boys on her own. She was a trailblazer, having filed a sex discrimination suit against her employer—one that eventually set a precedent after a Supreme Court decision in her favor. This court exposure, and his mother’s tenacity, influenced Pons’ future career choices.\n\nPons graduated from the Naval Academy in 1969 and became a Marine Corps officer. He was said to have grown disenchanted with the laxness of the military at the time. The Corps sent him to law school at Chapel Hill, but Ed eventually left the service and took a job with the county attorney’s office in Greensboro in 1981.\n\nOver the next decade, he bounced between jobs—as a deputy with the Sheriff’s Department (an unusual path for a lawyer), then a failed run at District Attorney, then back to the Sheriff’s Department, and finally returning to the county attorney’s office before becoming deputy county manager in 1999. As deputy county manager, he was the second-highest-ranking county employee, overseeing an institution with 2,600 employees and $414 million in operating costs.\n\nFormer Sheriff Walter “Sticky” Burch, who promoted Ed to be his second-in-command, said of him: “Ed was a gung-ho type guy. He was a workaholic. He didn’t have a real good personality. But if you had a job to get done, he wouldn’t hesitate to do it.” Ed’s propensity for being direct didn’t always win him friends. Disagreements over disorder seemed to be a running theme in his life.\n\n[Pons](https://preview.redd.it/chzn5aie4q3f1.png?width=456&format=png&auto=webp&s=9b717127f0755932505d0acfd93c9aa2766d850d)\n\nEd was married three times. He had a daughter, Megan, with his first wife, though little is known about that marriage. He married his second wife, Susan, after a rather bizarre incident. While Susan was working as a deputy under Ed and dating him, she was kidnapped by a wanted murderer who had recently escaped from Angola Prison. She had been unlocking her car in the parking lot of the Four Seasons Mall in Greensboro when Danny Weeks, along with his girlfriend Jorene Florea, abducted her to steal her vehicle. For the next three days, Susan cooperated with her captors and concealed the fact that she was a sheriff’s deputy to protect herself. The pair eventually abandoned her in Chicago, unharmed.\n\nEd flew to Chicago to retrieve her and proposed to her on their trip back to North Carolina. They were married from 1988 to 1996. Though they eventually divorced, Susan spoke highly of Ed in many news articles. She went on to become a professor of criminal justice.\n\nEd later married Florence McCloskey, his divorce attorney from the second marriage. Florence was also a prominent figure in the local court scene and had unsuccessfully run for Guilford Clerk of Superior Court in 1998. The two were together until their separation in March 2001. Over the following months, they worked on a separation agreement.\n\nAs part of that arrangement, on June 4, 2001, Florence moved out of their upscale New Irving Park home, and Ed moved back in. On June 5, the two reportedly got into an argument over email. Florence apparently wanted to reconcile; Ed did not.\n\nOn June 8, Ed left his house around 10 p.m. for a late-night walk around the picturesque neighborhood. Ed frequently walked the quiet streets around his home.  New Irving Park is one of the city’s nicest areas, and no one would expect any serious crime to occur there. He had been walking for nearly an hour, listening to Janis Joplin on his portable CD player, when he noticed a dark-colored car with its lights off pass him. Not long after, he heard a noise and turned to see the same car behind him—and a man running at him with a gun.\n\nEd had just enough time to pull out his own firearm, which he carried for protection, but the assailant got the drop on him. Ed later said he thought he may have surprised the attacker by drawing his weapon. He got off one shot, but before he could fully register what had happened, he had been shot in the head and shoulder. A resident saw the shooter—described in one article as a white man with dark hair—jump into the backseat of a sedan with tinted windows and no lights. The car was seen speeding off, running a stop sign on Greenbrook Drive. Soon after, a dark-colored Plymouth with its lights off was seen driving nearby.\n\n[Newspaper depiction of the shooting](https://preview.redd.it/d3tt8pgb4q3f1.png?width=1179&format=png&auto=webp&s=f0d1b4bc96ca447c5f6bca7e9d4c6c8368133d9e)\n\nEd was quickly found by nearby residents and brought to a local hospital with life-threatening injuries. His skull was fractured, with fragments lodged deep in his brain. He remained hospitalized for weeks. Doctors described the head injury as similar to a stroke. Despite the severity of his condition, Ed was determined to recover as fully and quickly as possible.\n\nOver the next year, Ed had to relearn how to speak—an effort that frustrated him greatly. Unfortunately, he couldn’t say much about who he thought was responsible. “I really don’t think there is anybody out there who wants to kill me,” Ed later said. He often blamed himself for not getting the upper hand in the encounter. Still, he fought to return to work and eventually did so on a limited basis. His divorce from Florence was finalized in April 2002.\n\nSadly, just under a year after the shooting, Ed was found deceased in his home on May 11, 2002. His family and community were shocked by his sudden death. His life had been on the upswing in the preceding months—difficult, but progressing. He was making plans for the future. His first grandchild had recently been born.\n\nThere was no obvious cause of death, and many expected the medical examiner to rule that Ed had died from complications related to his head injury. However, despite not finding a natural cause, the medical examiner stated he didn’t have enough evidence to determine a cause at all—and left the matter as “undetermined.”\n\nThis put investigators in an awkward position, as they said they couldn’t transfer the case to the homicide division without a ruling of homicide. Not long after, they announced the case wouldn’t be investigated further unless new evidence emerged. Ed’s case was left in limbo. There have been no updates since.\n\nEd’s brother Tim was particularly affected by his death and was frustrated by what he believed was a poor police investigation. Tim, who was the Director of Research at the Wake Forest Department of Neurosurgery, said, “I think police never did a thorough investigation to start with.” Tim noted his frustration with the medical examiner's ruling as well.  Tim passed away a few years later in 2005.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/pgtlersm4q3f1.png?width=915&format=png&auto=webp&s=bc47f45dba18b6ba8d11125c6244c87e9babb375\n\nInvestigators never identified a theory or prime suspect in the shooting. There was, however, some court intrigue in the local community, with rumors circulating about potential suspects. In 2004, a candidate even had to apologize after implying her opponent—the sitting county sheriff—was involved in Pons’ death, saying, “I don’t want to end up like Ed Pons.”\n\nSpeculation continued about a political opponent or a grudge from someone Ed had helped put behind bars, but friends pointed toward his pending divorce as potentially relevant. Ed himself, as well as detectives, dismissed that theory. Florence reportedly kept emails expressing her love for Ed and her desire to reconcile. “I loved him then, when he walked out. I love him now,” she said.\n\nEd believed he was the victim of a robbery gone wrong. One detective friend said that if it had been a hit, the shooter would have simply fired from inside the car. It’s possible the assailant approached Ed intending to rob him, and the confrontation escalated when Ed pulled his gun. Some discounted the robbery theory because all of Ed’s belongings were left behind—but the attacker may have fled, spooked by the unexpected resistance.\n\nWe’re left with little to go on. This is the type of case that’s incredibly difficult to solve due to the lack of evidence. Hopefully, investigators have ballistics from the shooting, though even that remains unclear. There certainly aren’t many witness statements—and no known DNA evidence. Investigators have said they need someone to come forward, but that becomes increasingly unlikely nearly twenty-five years later. Ed seemed like a decent man, a dedicated public servant, and he deserves justice.\n\n[Article ](https://www.newspapers.com/article/news-and-record-pons/173360889/)\n\n[Article II](https://www.newspapers.com/article/news-and-record-pons-general/173360756/)\n\n[Article III](https://www.newspapers.com/article/news-and-record-pons-addresses/173347111/)\n\n[Article IV](https://www.newspapers.com/article/news-and-record-pons/173361291/)",

      "title": "Two young men were killed in separate incidents during the Notting Hill Carnival in London - Despite the huge crowds and heavy police presence, both murders remain unsolved since 2000.",
      "text": "Notting Hill Carnival is a vibrant, annual street festival in London that celebrates Caribbean culture, featuring parades, music, dancing, and food, and is one of the largest street festivals in Europe. \n\nAbdul Bhatti and his family had moved to West London from Wolverhampton in 1996. Abdul was described as a caring young man with a passion for football, loved by those who knew him. On August 28, 2000, he attended the Notting Hill Carnival with friends, enjoying the vibrant atmosphere near stalls run by the South Asian community.\n\nAs the carnival began winding down around 7:30 p.m., chaos erupted when a gang of up to 50 youths rampaged through the crowded streets. In what police called “steaming,” the gang tore through groups of unsuspecting carnival-goers, robbing and attacking them indiscriminately.\n\nAbdul and his friends were targeted when one of the gang members tried to steal a gold chain from Abdul’s friend. Abdul intervened to protect his friend, but the gang turned on him instead. In an act of brutal violence, the 50-strong group punched and kicked Abdul mercilessly. Witnesses reported that as Abdul tried to crawl away, one gang member delivered a sickening running blow to his head before the group fled.\n\nAbdul was rushed to the hospital but tragically died the next day from devastating brainstem injuries.\n\nThe attack, which unfolded on the streets of the carnival, was partially caught on CCTV, but the specific assault on Abdul was not captured. No police officers were present at the scene during the attack.\n\nLondon’s Chief Inspector condemned the gang’s “totally indiscriminate violence” and suggested that Abdul’s murder may have had a racial motivation, as none of the Caribbean-run stalls were targeted during the rampage. Abdul’s family, while acknowledging this possibility, focused on the senseless criminality of the act. His brother-in-law told the media, “At the end of the day, it’s criminals and mindless thugs intent on mayhem and robbery. That’s the overwhelming fact here.”\n\nIn the months following the carnival, police arrested over 200 people for various crimes committed during the event, including petty thefts and assaults. Many suspects were linked to the gang calling themselves the “Hackney Posse,” which operated out of Hackney, more than 10 miles away from West London.\n\nDespite efforts, police were unable to gather sufficient evidence to charge anyone with Abdul’s murder. Nine men from the gang were convicted of violent disorder and sentenced to up to 21 months in prison, a sentence that left Abdul’s family devastated. They believed some or all of these men were directly involved in the attack but were disheartened by the lack of justice for Abdul.\n\nMore than two decades later, no one has been charged with Abdul Bhatti’s murder.\n\nOn the same tragic day, just two hours after Abdul’s death, 21-year-old Greg Watson became another victim of the chaos.\n\nGreg, a delivery man and a young father to a month-old baby daughter, had attended the carnival with his partner and friends. As the group followed one of the final floats on their way home, they encountered a group of young men harassing and grabbing girls in the crowd.\n\nWhen one of the men began pestering a girl in Greg’s group, he calmly intervened to defuse the situation. Greg’s actions were non-confrontational, but one of the men, described as hooded and muscular, responded with shocking violence. He handed an item to another person before rushing at Greg and stabbing him in the abdomen with a long kitchen knife he had hidden in his jeans.\n\nAs Greg collapsed, a girl nearby screamed, “You stabbed him!” to which the attacker coldly replied, “So what?”\n\nGreg Watson died from his injuries despite calling out for help.\n\nThe entire attack was caught on CCTV, and Greg’s partner allowed the footage to be aired on Crimewatch in the hope of catching his killer. Police quickly identified a suspect, Sean Cephinis, who was arrested after being found hiding in a wardrobe.\n\nDespite initial hopes for justice, the case against Cephinis fell apart during the trial. The prosecution relied on a single witness who admitted to identifying Cephinis after watching the CCTV footage and confessed to not having seen the stabbing itself. Additionally, none of the 12 people in the identification parade could conclusively identify Cephinis as the attacker.\n\nThe judge dismissed the case, instructing the jury to find Cephinis not guilty due to a lack of reliable evidence. He walked free, though he would later face multiple arrests for other crimes over the next 20 years.\n\nThe failure to convict Cephinis left Greg’s family without justice, and his murder remains unsolved to this day.\n\nMore than 20 years later, the families of Abdul and Greg are still waiting for answers. Their stories are a stark reminder of how negligence and violence can shatter lives, and how justice delayed often feels like justice denied.\n\nSources:\n\n[BBC](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/911242.stm)\n\n[The Standard](https://www.standard.co.uk/hp/front/gang-jailed-for-carnival-rampage-6303924.html)\n\n[The Standard](https://www.standard.co.uk/hp/front/man-accused-of-carnival-killing-free-6312773.html)\n\n[BBC](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/967787.stm)",

      "text": "Leah Nicole Hickman, 21, a journalism student at Marshall University, was murdered December 14th, 2007 in Huntington, WV at an apartment building on 8th Avenue in which she lived with her half sister. \\*\\*\\*Following information may not be reliable\\*\\* The day Leah went missing she had been shopping at the Huntington Mall with her half sister and possibly their mother. Leah and her sister came back to the apartment before lunch, and her sister left for work. When her sister came home from work at 3pm for a break, Leah was still alive and washing dishes. Her sister left to go back to work, and then went her boyfriends house directly after. Leah was supposed to have a friend coming over, possibly a male, though it was said that Leah was very closed off and didn't date, but it's also been said she had been on several dates before she went missing (a lot of the information does not add up) It is unknown if the friend came over. Leah was also supposed to meet up with her best friend that night but never showed. The back door was left open when her sister arrived home the next day around 1pm after she received a call from their mother that Leah could not be reached by anyone, no Leah anywhere for a week. (Leah was supposed to be returning home to Point Pleasant, WV for the Winter Break that weekend)\n\nSister makes a Myspace post that Saturday upon returning to apartment on Leah's own account \"where art thou sister?\"\n\nNow the facts, Leah was found a week later in the basement crawlspace of her apartment building where everyone in the 4 unit building did laundry. Many people who have lived in the building before and around that time claim they didn't know the crawl space existed. Leah was found wrapped in plastic believed to be from the building as it was also being worked on. No other information other than that she was strangled has been released. It has been said that the only DNA they have from the plastic is touch DNA, and there are no progressions or updates on that. Half sister tells police she believes it could be her own ex boyfriend. HPD says they have \"an idea,\" of who it could be, but have no evidence to prove it. Due to the fact that Huntington, WV does not have an investigative unit and the officers are NOT (especially in 2007) trained for investigation, ESPECIALLY FOR COLD CASES, it is very hard to believe they actually have an idea about anything in the case.\n\nLeah deserves justice.

      "text": "**Bernadett “Betty” Szabó was born in Nyíregyháza, a city in northeastern Hungary.** Despite growing up in poverty with few opportunities and in difficult circumstances, Betty was a good student and a prize-winning violinist who enjoyed gardening in her spare time.\n\nNevertheless, **at the age of just 18** Betty had had enough of her life of poverty; she lost a dramatic amount of weight (25kg or roughly 55 lbs) and **moved to Amsterdam** where she could start over.\n\nIn Amsterdam, Betty started earning money as a sex worker in the red light district. She was striking: aside from her warm smile, she has a large, winding dragon tattoo on her chest and stomach. She quickly became pregnant but continued to work during her pregnancy, earning her the nickname \"pinguin\". Shortly after his birth, Betty's son is placed with a foster family, a heart-wrenching moment for the young mother.\n\nThree months after giving birth, **on the night of 19 February 2009, Betty was found brutally murdered in her workroom on Oudezijds Achterburgwal.** Two fellow sex workers, concerned that they had not seen her nor heard her usual music coming from her room, decided to checked on her at 1am. They found her in a pool of her own blood with over 70 stab wounds. She was 19 years old.\n\nAt the time, police conducted a large-scale investigation, including CCTV monitoring, interviewing witnesses, and a thorough investigation of the crime scene. Anne Dreijer-Heemskerk, a member of the cold case department at the Amsterdam Police, states that the case went cold due to a lack of cooperation from witnesses.\n\n**Now, a decade and a half later, Dutch police have launched a massive campaign in an effort to solve Betty's murder and are offering of €30,000 for information that leads to her killer.**\n\nAt the corner of Korte Stormsteeg and Oudezijds Achterburgwal, [the facade of a house](https://images0.persgroep.net/rcs/F7sGVrj1vWQbGalzR6P-r6kbV30/diocontent/250463027/_fitwidth/694/?appId=21791a8992982cd8da851550a453bd7f&quality=0.8) has been plastered with large stickers outlining who Betty was and providing facts about her murder. TV screens have been set up to show the crime scene, a documentary and the last images of Betty alive.\n\nBut what brings the campaign to life (and what has drawn the attention of media outlets across Europe) is **the** [**lifesize hologram**](https://x.com/POL_Amsterdam/status/1855129127424077901) **of Betty in the window**, who periodically gets up from her stool to ask passersby for their help through the glass. Cleary visible is the large and memorable dragon tattoo that covered her chest and stomach.\n\nPolice are hoping that the campaign not only jogs people's memories, but that it can put a face to the murder victim with dignity and with the clear aim of getting justice for Betty. \n\nDreijer-Heemskerk, from the cold case team (quoted in [The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/nov/10/dutch-police-use-hologram-to-try-to-solve-2009-sex-worker-killing)) said: “Betty was murdered in one of the busiest areas in Amsterdam, maybe even in the Netherlands. It is really almost impossible that there are no people who saw or heard something unusual at the time. Or heard someone talk about the case, which doesn’t even have to have been in Amsterdam, because, after all, the red light district gets visitors from all over the world. ... \n\n\"**We hope witnesses who may have been afraid before or kept silent for other reasons now have the courage to come forward.”**\n\n  \nSources:\n\nNetherlands Police webpage: [https://www.politie.nl/en/wanted-and-missing/wanted-persons/2009/february/bernadett-betty-szabo-english.html](https://www.politie.nl/en/wanted-and-missing/wanted-persons/2009/february/bernadett-betty-szabo-english.html)\n\nThe Guardian: [https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/nov/10/dutch-police-use-hologram-to-try-to-solve-2009-sex-worker-killing](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/nov/10/dutch-police-use-hologram-to-try-to-solve-2009-sex-worker-killing)\n\n  \nEuronews: [https://www.euronews.com/my-europe/2024/11/10/dutch-police-attempt-to-solve-sex-worker-murder-case-with-hologram](https://www.euronews.com/my-europe/2024/11/10/dutch-police-attempt-to-solve-sex-worker-murder-case-with-hologram)\n\nCNN: [https://www.cnn.com/2024/11/10/europe/dutch-police-hologram-sex-worker-cold-case-intl/index.html](https://www.cnn.com/2024/11/10/europe/dutch-police-hologram-sex-worker-cold-case-intl/index.html)",

      "title": "Lizzie Borden Part 3: The Trial and Aftermath. Lizzie Borden goes to trial with her dream team defense, shocking evidence, and a verdict is read. ",
      "text": "Once Lizzie was behind bars, her tough and stoic exterior began to fade, and she crumbled into herself, crying and wailing. The matron of the jail was so worried about Lizzie that she had called Doctor Bowen to come visit, at once. Once there, the doctor treated Lizzie with morphine, and Lizzie began to settle into her new life as a prisoner who was to go on trial for her parent’s murder. With nothing but time on her hands, Lizzie began to secure her defense, and with her new influx on money, she was able to hire what was considered the “dream team” of lawyers in Massachusetts at the time. These defense lawyers were well known, well respected, and had a reputation for getting their clients off with a non-guilty verdict much of the time. Her defense consisted of three men: Andrew Jackson Jennings, Melvin Ohio Adams, and George Dexter Robinson. George Dexter Robinson was particularly notable, as he was Harvard educated, was previously part of the Massachusetts state senate, and had been the governor of the state prior. \n\nThe trial began on June 5, 1893 in the New Bedford Courthouse, nearly one year after the deaths of Andrew and Abby Borden. The jury was comprised of 12 men. While it wasn’t illegal for women to be a part of a jury during this time, it was highly unusual, and most juries were made up of only men. Much in the same way the defense was made up of three lawyers, the council was made up of three presiding judges- Justice Justin Dewey, Chief Justice Albert Mason, and Judge Caleb Blodget. In what may be seen as a conflict of interest, Justice Justin Dewey was appointed as a judge by none other than the former governor, and defense attorney of Lizzie Borden, George Dexter Robinson. District Attorney Knowlton and Thomas Moody would be speaking on behalf of the prosecution. \n\nThe three judges made some initial rulings in the case, which threw out some important evidence that the prosecution held. Firstly, the entire testimony that Lizzie gave during her inquest was not eligible to be used in the trial, as Doctor Bowen claimed that not only was Lizzie under the effects of morphine at the time, he had actually given her a higher dose than usual on the day of her inquest testimony. In addition to this, they would also not allow the testimony of the pharmacist whom Lizzie attempted to buy prussic acid from. They stated that since Andrew and Abby had not been killed by poison, but rather an attack with a hatchet, this testimony was deemed as inadmissible during the trial. \n\nPrior to the trial, Andrew and Abby’s bodies were exhumed. In a shocking moment in the courthouse, Moody placed one of Lizzie’s blue frocks on a table, and when he lifted it into the air, it revealed the skulls of Andrew and Abby, stripped of flesh. When Lizzie saw her parent’s bashed in skulls, she swooned and fainted, shocked by what she was seeing. A local newspaper reported on this moment, saying, *\"Into a feint that lasted for several minutes, sending a thrill of excitement through awe-struck spectators and causing unfeigned embarrassment and discomfiture to penetrate the ranks of counsel.\"* The trial had to be momentarily put on hold while Lizzie came to. Moody spoke for nearly two hours about how only Lizzie had the motive to kill her parents- stating her hatred for Abby, and her resentment towards Andrew for his frugal ways- before he pulled from a bag the broken off hatchet blade, claiming  that it was the murder weapon. \n\nMany people were cross examined, including Doctor Bowen, friends and family, as well as Bridget. Bridget claimed that Lizzie was the only person in the home with her on the day that the Borden’s were killed, and that the family had been experiencing severe stomach pains in the days leading up to the murders. She described the moments that Andrew knocked on the door, how she heard Lizzie laugh on top of the stairs, and that at the time the pair were killed, she did not see Lizzie from where Bridget was at- both outside and in her room in the attic. \n\nThe matron from the jail also testified, where she shared an interesting story of something that she had overheard between the two sisters, Lizzie and Emma, while Lizzie was in her prison cell.  She claims that Emma came to visit Lizzie, and the two had a heated discussion, where she overheard Lizzie say to Emma *”Emma, you have given me away, haven’t you?”* Emma responded with *”No, Lizzie.”* Lizzie followed up with *”You have, and you’ll see, I won’t give an inch.”*\n\nDoctor Edward Woods, a blood stain and poison expert from Harvard, was also brought to the stand to testify. He was appointed to examine the contents of Andrew and Abby’s stomachs. Upon his findings, Doctor Woods determined that Abby had 11 ounces of partially digested food and liquid still inside of her stomach, which indicated that Abby had died about 2-3 hours after eating her last meal. When Andrew’s organs were dissected, it revealed that he had been farther in his digestion process, and that most of the food was already out of his stomach, and in his intestines, proving that his time of death was about 3-4 hours after his last meal. Their stomachs were also tested for poison, and none was found. In addition, the milk at the family home was tested for any evidence of poison, and this too, was found not to have any traces. \n\nThe jury was presented with the potential murder weapons: a claw hammer, two axes, a hatchet, and a hatchet blade with the handle broken off. All items had been tested for blood, and they determined that no blood had been found. A hair had been discovered on one of the tools, but it was analyzed and determined to be an animal hair, most likely from a cow. The prosecution particularly pointed towards the hatchet blade with the handle broken off as the murder weapon. When the defense had asked the prosecution where the handle of the hatchet was, the state had no answer.  Both sides agreed that the blood could have been washed off of the tools, but that it would have taken a considerable amount of time, due to the grooves and crevices between the blades and handles. Prosecution claimed that the handle was most likely broken off in order to hide any blood imbedded in it. The defense also drove home the tight timeline that the state presented: they reiterated the fact that Lizzie would have only had eight to thirteen minutes to clean up, change, and sound the alarm from when Andrew died, to when Lizzie called for Bridget. \n\nThe issue of bloodstains was brought up in the courthouse, with the prosecution pointing to a small, pinpoint sized blood stain on one of Lizzie’s underskirts. This blood stain was located six inches from the bottom hem of the skirt,  was very minuscule in size, and was determined to be human blood. The defense fought back, cross examining Doctor Woods, and asked him if the blood could be from Lizzie’s menstrual cycle. He said that yes, it could be. \n\nThe defense had their own key witnesses to testify on behalf of Lizzie. Two men named Charles Gifford and Uriah Kirby claimed that they had seen a strange man around the Borden house at about 11 o clock the night before the murders. Another man, Doctor Benjamin Handfy, stated that he had seen a pale faced man on the sidewalk outside the Borden home around 10:30am on August 4th. Additionally, the defense brought in a plumber who testified that he had been in the Borden’s barn two weeks prior to the murder, which cast doubt on the prosecutions claims that Lizzie’s couldn’t have possibly been in the barn that day because they hadn’t found any footprints in the dirt inside of it. \n\nAt the end of the trial, both sides had the opportunity to give their closing arguments. The defense argued that Lizzie had no motive to commit the murders, and that she was not strong enough to have enough force to create the blows and damage to the skulls. They also pointed to the fact that two witnesses had seen Lizzie leaving the barn at 11:03 am on August 4th, 1892. They made mention that there was no true physical evidence that linked Lizzie to the crime, and that the murder weapon had never been found. The prosecution were up next, and they spoke to Bridget’s testimony, how anytime Bridget left Lizzie alone that morning, someone had died. They also mentioned how the supposed note that Abby had received had never been found, and that the only proof that it had ever existed, was because Lizzie said it had. In the aftermath of the murder, advertisements were placed in the newspapers offering a $5,000 reward for anyone who had information about the note, but not a single person had come forward. \n\nThe 12 jurors left the courtroom and deliberated for 90 minutes. These jurors would later say that they knew their verdict almost immediately after leaving the courtroom, but they waited the 90 minutes so their decision wouldn’t seem rash. When the jurors entered the courtroom again, the judges asked them if they had their verdict, and they’re unanimously said yes. When asked what the verdict was, the jury foreman stated *”Not guilty.”* At this moment Lizzie let out a gasp and sank into her chair and wept.  She stood up and held Emma, saying *”Now take me home. I want to go to the old place and go at once tonight.”*\n\nIn the aftermath of the trial, Lizzie was determined to resume her old life and to stay in Fall River. However, the community wasn’t so kind to her, and were shocked at her acquittal. Lizzie was shunned by her community, much in the way Lizzie had shunned Abby’s family when she saw them on the streets. The societies that Lizzie was a part of made her resign from her position, and she was prohibited from teaching Sunday school. On August 10, 1893, one of Lizzie’s dreams had finally come true- her and Emma had purchased a home on “The Hill,” at 7 French Street for $13,000, which they lovingly called “Maplecroft.” However, neighbors on The Hill were not pleased that a potential murderer had moved into their otherwise quiet and safe neighborhood. Her home was repeatedly vandalized. Around Halloween, children would pull straws, and whoever came up with the short straw had to approach Maplecroft and ring the doorbell. And that infamous song about Lizzie Borden was created around this time period, so when Lizzie walked about town, she heard the sound of children’s voices singing about her as they skipped rope. \n\nLizzie changed her name to Lizebeth shortly after the trial, hoping to rebrand herself. Lizbeth expanded her circle of friends, and began to associated with artists and actresses in the area, and she would often throw lavish parties at her home. One of her closest friends was  actress Nance O’Neil, and many at the time suspected that Lizbeth and Nance were more than friends, having grown a romantic relationship between them. In 1905, Lizbeth threw a grand party for Nance at Maplecroft, and shortly after, Lizbeth and Emma would go their separate ways, for good. Lizbeth would pay Emma $150 a month for her needs, but the two sisters never spoke again. It was never clear why this might have happened, and when interviewed later in life, Emma refused to divulge. All Emma said in her 1913 interview was *”The happenings at the French street house caused me to leave, I must refuse to talk about. I did not go until the conditions became unbearable.”*\n\nIn 1926, Lizbeth’s health was declining, and she died at her home, surrounded by close friends and servants, on June 1, 1927- one month before her 67th birthday. Strangely, Emma died 9 days later, at her own home. At the time of her death, Lizbeth was worth $310,000, which is roughly about $5,000,000 in today’s money.  In her will, Lizbeth left the town of Fall River 500 dollars to continue tending to her father’s grave. She also left $30,000 to the Fall River Animal Rescue. Every year on Memorial Day, the animal rescue plants geraniums on Lizzie Borden’s grave. \n\n\n© TaraCalicosBike 2024\n\n**Links and pictures**\n\n[Pictures](https://imgur.com/a/Uzef9Rr)\n\n[Famous Trials](https://www.famous-trials.com/lizzieborden/1437-home)\n\n[Library of Congress](https://guides.loc.gov/chronicling-america-lizzie-borden)",

      "title": "The Dream Murder",
      "text": "The Dream Murder\n\nOak Park, Illinois in 1980. A nice, middle-class suburb with connections to Hemingway and Frank Lloyd Wright. A good place to live. But its eastern border, Austin Boulevard, was shared with the Austin neighborhood of Chicago's West Side, more known for crime, gangs, drugs, and poverty. Into this uneasy milieu came two young people whose lives would be entwined in a crime that reached more than a decade into the future.  \n\nKaren Ann Phillips was born April 29, 1956 in Forest City, North Carolina. She transferred colleges as a junior to Aurora College in Aurora, Illinois, some 40 miles west of Chicago. After graduation, she enrolled in nursing school at Presbyterian-St. Luke's Medical Center in the south Loop area of Chicago, and in April 1979 rented a studio apartment at 324 N. Austin Blvd. in Oak Park, only twenty minutes away.  \n\nKaren appears to have been a friendly person and perhaps naive. According to the book Innocence: The True Story of Steve Linscott, she made friends readily and was not afraid to visit others' apartments in the building on short acquaintance, nor to allow them into hers. In one instance, she had allowed a stranger off the street into her apartment to paint her portrait.  \n\nIn her off time, Karen was a practitioner of Kriya yoga and was heavily involved with the [Temple of Kriya Yoga in Chicago](https://templeofkriyayoga.org/). She became close to Helen, a swami at the Temple who encouraged her to study to become a swami herself. But all was not positive. One of her North Carolina friends, when visiting, became concerned about the Temple's influence on Karen, and tried to warn her. This friend saw some of the Temple members as drug addicts, disagreed with some of the teachings, and disliked how much money Karen was pouring into it, money she could not afford. He talked to Karen, but Karen largely disagreed and ignored his advice to leave the Temple.\n\nTwo doors down from Karen's apartment, at 316 N. Austin Blvd., was the Good News Mission, a Christian sponsored halfway house for ex-inmates. Steven Linscott, a 26-year-old Bible student, lived there with his wife as \"house parents\" and counselor in exchange for free rent. Steven came from Maine and had two years in college studying psychology before following in his father's footsteps as a radioman in the Navy.  Steven had had a religious conversion in 1974 and wanted to study at Bible college to expand his understanding of Bible teaching. After his honorable discharge in 1979, Steven, his wife Lois, and their two small children moved to Chicago so Steven could study at Emmaus Bible College in Oak Park. Around the beginning of September 1980, the family moved into the Good News Mission. Steven counseled the residents and attended classes, while Lois cared for their young children.  \n\nSteven was aware of and bothered by the atmosphere of crime and violence in the neighborhood, but happy with the work he was doing at the Mission. On the night of October 3, the Linscotts were at home. Lois went to bed at about 10:30, Steven shortly after. In the early hours of October 4, Steven woke from a disturbing dream where he saw a man in a living room talking with another person. Steven was bothered by the vividness of the dream and tried to dismiss it. Once awake, he heard a noise in the flat, and went to investigate, but saw nothing. He went back to bed, and his dream resumed. The atmosphere in the dream living room had turned sinister. The man smiled evilly, lifted his arms, and started beating the other person on the head with a metal object. The second person was forced down onto their hands and knees, then to the floor. There was blood everywhere. Steven awoke again. In his mind, the dream was linked to his situation of living with criminals and seeing evidence of crime in his neighborhood.\n\nLater that day, police knocked on the door of the halfway house. They were speaking to all the neighbors. A murder had occurred overnight just a couple of doors down. Police were seeking any information and asked everyone to contact them if they remembered anything. \"Even if it seems silly.\"  \n\nOn October 3, Karen Phillips had gone to class and got a ride home with a classmate. Later she attended class at the Kriya Temple, getting home about 10:30 pm. On arriving home she got a call from her friend Helen, and they arranged to meet up the next day at 11 to go to a flea market. The next day, Karen failed to meet up with Helen as planned, and Helen wasn't able to contact her by phone. Helen got her husband to go to the apartment to check on Karen. But there was no answer. He knocked on the next door apartment, where the neighbor, Mohammed, said he had heard raised voices and pounding noises in Karen's apartment after midnight, and had knocked on the door to ask them to quiet down. The noises stopped, then resumed for a short while. Peter, a neighbor from upstairs, soon joined the group, and eventually Helen's husband decided it was time to call the fire department for help.  \n\nThe responders discovered Karen dead, face down on the floor of her studio apartment. Her body was naked, with her nightgown rucked up around her neck. She had been beaten and had numerous bruises and abrasions. On autopsy, she was discovered to have been raped, while the cause of death was beating and strangulation. Foreign hairs were found in her hands, pubic area, and on the carpet surrounding where she lay. Swabs and other physical evidence were taken for examination, but this was in the days before DNA analysis. Only microscopic and serum analysis were available. A tire iron covered with blood and hair was found in bushes outside the building, later identified as the murder weapon.\n\nHearing the news, Steven remembered his dream, but he hesitated about whether to tell the police about it. He consulted a co-worker on Sunday, and his wife on Monday after reading a newspaper account of the killing. Both felt he should contact the police. \"It couldn't hurt and might help.\"  So Steven called the Oak Park police around 9:30 p.m. on Monday, October 6, and told them that he had a dream about a man beating someone to death the night Karen had been murdered. He described a man in his 20s with short blond hair who beat another person, possibly black, with a metal object. Police asked him to write it all down, and they would come to his house to pick it up. \n\n> \"After the discussion with his wife on Monday, defendant telephoned the Oak Park police and said that he had dreamed about a murder on the same night as the murder that had been reported. Defendant was told to write an account of his dream and that the police would contact him later. That evening, two police officers went to defendant's residence. They read defendant's account of the dream, and one of the police officers asked defendant why he had not described the murder weapon. According to the police officer, defendant had stated in the unrecorded telephone conversation that evening that defendant thought the murder weapon was a blunt object that looked like a tire iron. Defendant denied that he referred to the murder weapon as a tire iron, and he told the police officer that he had not described the weapon as a tire iron in his written account because he was uncertain what the object was in his dream. \"  \n> \n> \"Defendant told the officers that in his dream a man bludgeoned a woman to death. The man in the dream was approximately 20-30 years old, had straight blond hair, was light complected, had a somewhat husky build, and was approximately 5 feet 5 inches to 5 feet 7 inches tall. He was wearing brown trousers and a terry-cloth shirt with two or three stripes across the chest. In the first stage of the dream, the attacker was quiet and easygoing, but defendant noticed a change come over the person. Defendant then awakened, tried to shake off the dream and fell back asleep. His dream continued with the man striking the woman on the head while she was lying or crouching on the floor. The victim had an air of acceptance even though she did not expect the attack, and she did not offer much resistance.\" - [Casetext, People v. Steven Linscott](https://casetext.com/case/people-v-linscott-3)  \n \nAs you would expect, the dream had the police interested. It has to be a very unusual occurrence that a member of the public comes forward with a dream that correlates in both timing and details to an actual crime.  Police asked Steven to come in to discuss the dream on October 8. It had not escaped them that Steven himself resembled the dream attacker in some respects, having straight light hair, a square build, and being between 20 and 30. When Steven came for the interview, they noted that he was wearing a short-sleeved terry shirt with some stripes, similar to what he described of the dream attacker.  \n\n> \"In the conference room, defendant stated that on October 4, between 1 a.m. and 3 a.m., he had a vivid dream. The dream was about a ruthless beating. He said the attacker wore a white or off-white terry-cloth shirt with two red or purple stripes on the chest and one on the sleeve. He thought that the victim knew her assailant because they were at ease with one another. In response to a question, defendant said that he thought the victim was a religious person. When asked about her background, defendant said that she was somewhat intelligent, \"at least high school and beyond a little bit.\" Defendant had the impression that the beating occurred close by in a living room which was the same size or larger than his four room apartment. He said the living room contained a couch and stereo. Defendant said that in his dream, the victim and the attacker talked for a while. Defendant did not know how long they talked or what was said. After a time, the attacker produced a dark, metallic instrument and began striking the woman in the face. The instrument was tapered down at one end and rounded at the other. Defendant was unsure what the instrument was, but he described it as a \"counterbalance like a clock.\"  -  - [Casetext, People v. Steven Linscott](https://casetext.com/case/people-v-linscott-3)  \n \nThe transcript of the questions at this session show the lines of inquiry the police were taking. They veered into off-topic discussions, religion, and asked Steven to extrapolate rather widely about aspects of the dream, presumably in hopes of getting incriminating statements. They tried to get him to say waht the killer might have been thinking and what he would do next. All this time, the officers portrayed the sessions as informational, trying to use Steven's knowledge and background in psychology to help with the case.    \n\nPolice again requested Steven's presence on October 10. They started the interview by reading Steven his rights. they went over the same ground as previous interrogations. At one point, the assistant district attorney joined the session. Steven, becoming wary, asked if they considered him a suspect, but they reassured him that he was just their prime witness. After several hours of questioning, Steven agreed to go to a hospital for swabs and blood to be taken for comparison with evidence from the scene. Again, they told him that this was so he would be absolutely eliminated as a potential suspect, so as not to taint his evidence in front of a jury. In reality, police had locked in on Steven as a likely guilty party from the beginning.  \n\nAfter returning from the hospital, Steven asked to call his wife. Unbeknown to Steven, during this time an assistant DA and policemen were questioning Lois at the Mission. They looked around the apartment and looked at the soles of Steven's shoes. A worried Lois had contacted the head of the Good News Mission, who advised that Steven should leave immediately and not say anything more. But when Steven stood up and said he was leaving, the atmosphere changed. Police told him he was going nowhere, that they knew he had killed Karen, that the evidence he had given would send him to the electric chair. But Steven refused to confess after an additional two hours, and without physical evidence, police were forced to let him leave. It was by then 3 a.m. \n\nBy November 19, the crime lab had provided the results of tests on the specimens found at the crime scene. On November 24, Steven was pulled over while driving and arrested for the rape and murder of Karen Ann Phillips on October 4. He was detained without bond at Cook County jail, waiting for trial. Bond was later set at $450,000.00, and Steven's supporters were able to raise the amount for him to be released on bond.  \n\nThe trial finally began on June 1, 1982. The prosecuting attorneys leaned heavily on the dream and correlating it to the facts of the murder. The \"dream\" tape from Steven's first taped interview on Oct. 8 was played in court. They said that the dream included details of the crime that only the perpetrator would know. The taped statements, with their descriptions and thoughts about the perpetrator's state of mind, amounted to a confession. They zeroed in on the following points of comparison: Killer with short blond hair, age between 20 and 30, wearing a short-sleeved terry shirt with stripes, attacking with a blunt metal object like a tire iron, 7 blows around the head and shoulders, and the victim not resisting. The attack taking place in a large living room with a couch and stereo. They ignored that Steven's dream killer was 5'6\"-5'7\" and husky, whereas Steven was 6' and slim, with glasses, that Steven described a metal weight about 9 inches long, where the actual weapon was two feet long, that there were more than 7 blows in the actual attack. That the scene of the crime was a 10 by 12 foot area of a studio apartment, with no couch.  \n\nIn terms of the physical evidence, they had the hair, blood, and swabs. A key point was that the vaginal fluid did not indicate the blood type of the attacker, meaning he was a non-secretor. 15 to 20% of males are non-secretors, and Steven Linscott was in this group. (A new set of tests showed the mixed vaginal fluids contained Type ABO-O and PGM 2-1, Karen's blood type. Police interpreted this as proof that a non-secretor had been the killer, but it could also have been a secretor with the same blood type. This greatly expands the pool of possibles.) Testimony about the hair samples stated that the hairs were consistent with Steven's. Closing arguments made it more emphatic, that the hairs were Steven's. Again, recall that this is in the days before DNA. The dream and the lab tests formed basically the whole prosecution case.  \n\nTestimony for the prosecution included statements from police going back to early interviews. Sgt. Mendrick recounted a conversation with Steven on November 25, after his arrest. Mendrick asked Steven, if the dream was so vivid, was it possible he thought he was dreaming when he was actually doing it? Steven said no, because he \"checked out his subconscious\" that morning while praying as to whether he did it, and also checked his arm, since the murderer's arm would have been sore after swinging a heavy object with such violence. Mendrick said Steven's hair had been found in the apartment. Steven said if that was so, Satan must have put them there to prevent him from continuing his work in ministry. \n\nSteven's attorney stayed away from the dream for the most part, instead focusing on Steven's unblemished record prior to this event, and the unreliability of the physical evidence. As a Navy radioman, Steven had passed security checks to obtain a top security clearance. His only prior brush with the law was a $50.00 ticket in Maine. He was well-regarded in the community and had the backing of his employers and the college he attended. Regarding the seminal tests, he pointed out that 15 to 20% is a large number and that possibly jury members also fell into this group. He disregarded the hair analysis as not being considered a reliable source, let alone dispositive.  \n\nThere was testimony about the position of Karen's hands after the murder. Her thumbs were pressed against her index fingers in an \"O\" shape. Helen Palella stated that this was a sign in their religion of seeking for peace, which she interpreted as an acceptance of death. There was a side table set up as an altar in the room where Karen was found. The defense attorney decried attempts to suggest a religious motive and portrayal of Steven as a member of a \"kooky\" religion.  \n\nOn June 16, 1982, after nine and a half hours of deliberation over two days, the jury returned a verdict finding Steven Linscott guilty of the murder of Karen Linscott. They found him not guilty of rape. He was taken into custody with sentencing set for July 21. The courtroom erupted with shouts from Steven's supporters at the Bible college. One of the board members said \"The verdict results from the meeting of the naivete of Steve and of the jury believing this concocted story. To us, it is a miscarriage of justice.\"  \n\nNotably, an alternate juror reported statements made by other jurors that revealed they had discussed the case with outsiders, made up their minds immediately, and brought newspaper clippings into the jury room. She did not report it at the time, because she did not know she could approach the judge. In November, the judge denied a request for a hearing into the allegations.  \n\nOn November 23, Judge Adam Stillo sentenced Steven to 40 years in prison for the murder of Karen Ann Phillips. Steven was sent to the Centralia Correctional Center in Centralia, Illinois, a small town about 3 hours south of Chicago. Lois moved there with the children, taking a job as a nurse to support the family.  \n\nOn December 3, the defense team filed an appeal on the basis of insufficient evidence, destruction of critical evidence without notifying the defense, and misrepresentation of test results. (The destruction of evidence refers to sending the last swab sample to Scotland Yard for more sophisticated blood typing, after which no samples remained for testing. This was first revealed by the prosecution at the trial.) The appellate brief was filed June 9, 1983, and oral arguments took place on Dec. 21,  1983.  \n\nThe law moves slowly, and the appeal was decided in August 1985. In a 2-1 decision, the Appellate Court reversed the conviction on the basis that the dream was not a confession and should not have been entered as evidence; further, that the circumstantial evidence was not conclusive. The opinion pointed put that Steven's dream did not reveal information that only the killer could have known. By the time Steven contacted police, some of the details of the crime were already published and he might have known them from those sources. They also pointed out that there were inconsistencies between the dream details and the actual event. The court said the forensic results only showed that the samples \"could have\" been from Steven; no positive identification was made. Finally, the court instanced that no fingerprints or direct evidence of Steven's presence in the apartment were ever presented. \n\n> People v. Linscott, 135 Ill. App. 3d 773, 779 (Ill. App. Ct. 1985) (“Under the circumstances, we believe that as a matter of law, the State did not meet its responsibility to present direct or circumstantial evidence which proves that defendant is guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. While it was the province of the jury to weigh the evidence and determine the credibility of witnesses, a reviewing court will not hesitate to reverse a conviction which, as in this case, rests solely upon circumstantial evidence that merely raises a possibility or suspicion that defendant is guilty. If we did not reverse such a conviction, we would indeed be derelict in our duty as a reviewing court. Accordingly, the judgment of conviction is reversed”) - [Casetext](https://casetext.com/case/people-v-linscott-3)  \n\nThe State countered with a petition to appeal the reversal to the Illinois Supreme Court, so Steven was not released from Centralia Correctional Center until he was unexpectedly granted bond on Oct. 31.  \n\nOn October 17, 1986, the Illinois Supreme Court upheld the original conviction by a 4-2 decision, reversing the earlier decision by the Appellate Court. The Supreme Court stated that the evidence presented by the prosecution was sufficient for a jury to find Linscott guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. \"In particular, defendant's account of the beating, his knowledge of the murder weapon,\nand his knowledge of the victim's passive acceptance of the attack showed knowledge of the\ncrime which would not likely be available to anyone other than the murderer,\" the court said. (\"Nightmare Goes on for Dream Killer,\" Tom Gibbons, Chicago Sun-Times, November 9, 1986) They remanded the case back to the lower court for decisions regarding some of the forensic evidence.  \n\nOn July 29, 1987, the Appellate Court again reversed the conviction and ordered a new trial, based on prosecutorial misconduct. Dissimilarities between the dream and the murder were overlooked, and test results on physical evidence misstated that the blood and hairs were identified as Steven's, rather than that they could not be ruled out as Steven's. The result was that Steven did not have a fair trial. Once again, the Cook County state's attorney appealed to the Supreme Court.  \n\nNew evidence was presented in 1988 when the deputy chief medical examiner in the original trial, having read the books *Innocence* by a Linscott supporter, re-examined some of the abrasions in photographs of the body. and believed they were actually bite marks. Two experts from Northwestern University presented preliminary evidence that the marks could not have come from Steven. However a Cook County judge ruled the evidence inconclusive, and it had no effect on the appeals.  \n\nThe arguments before the Supreme Court took place November 14 and 15, 1990. Finally, on January 31, 1991, the Illinois Supreme Court vacated the conviction and sent the case back to the Cook County State's Attorney for a new trial. The Court held that the prosecution made prejudicial statements identifying hairs found at the scene as belonging to Steven, and told the jury that blood typing showed the semen at the crime came from someone with Steven's blood type. Neither statement was accurate. (Adriana Colindres, 'Retrial ordered in '80 murder', Chicago Tribune, February 1, 1991)    \n\nAlthough a new trial was slated for July 1992, it never took place. Then State's Attorney Jack O'Malley sent the old DNA samples to a lab in Boston with the most up-to-date facilities for DNA testing, and the results came back \"inconclusive.\" \"We do not have a 100% yes or no answer. I cannot tell you whether he is innocent or guilty. We frankly do not have enough evidence to obtain a conviction.\" _ Jack O'Malley quoted in Associated Press, July 16, 1992  \n\nThe Chicago Tribune quoted him: \"The scientific evidence does not completely exonerate the man, but it raises sufficient doubts, and leaves us, in my opinion, with no choice but to drop the prosecution of him.\" (Andrew Fegelman, Chicago Tribune, July 16, 1992)  In 2002, Governor George Ryan issued a pardon, ending the case for good.  \n\nSo a twelve-year ordeal was over for Steven Linscott and his family. Today he is a practicing psychotherapist and also has a master's degree in social work. Steven wrote a book about the trials called *Maximum Security* (Steven Linscott, Randall Frame, Crossway Books, January 1, 1994), for those who are interested in more detail about what he experienced. The book *Innocence: The True Story of Steve Linscott* by Steve's friend W. Gordon Haresign, (Zondevan Books, 1986) also covers the crime, the trials, and the intervening years. It has to be said that the Linscott family experienced an amazing amount of support from those within their community throughout these years.  \n\nBut what of Karen Ann Phillips? There is little to no newspaper coverage about her once the police mounted their case against Linscott. In the early days, they did obtain fingerprints from the scene, from the next-door neighbor, from the landlord, and from a TV repairman who had been given a key to Karen's apartment that week. They checked the alibis of these persons as well as Karen's friend Jerry from North Carolina. There was a man being investigated for rape in the far west suburbs, who was living in Oak Park at the time of the murder. He was eliminated based on results of tests of body fluids. Beyond that, no information is available about any lines of investigation. No lab tests were done on the other men in Karen's circle. To all outward appearances, once Steven came to them with the dream, police decided they had their man. When Steven was arrested, the case was closed. Now, after all this time, the trail is more than cold. There may not even be viable samples for further testing. Once again we are left to hope that a random genealogy search will turn up familial DNA. It's both tragic and frustrating.  \n\nThere are plenty of possibilities for who could have committed the crime. Karen lived on the fringes of a big city, and traveled through the city for work and for leisure. She was a nursing student in a large teaching hospital, where she would have known and come into contact with many people. She spent a large part of her time at the Temple Kriya, and the friend who knew her the longest was concerned about some of the people who hung around there. She lived in an area where crime and violence were regular occurrences. She was not as street-smart as perhaps she should have been. She had a first floor apartment with front and back doors. (Although police found the back door padlocked.)  \n\nMy best guess is that Karen let in someone she knew. There was no forced entry. She got home from the Temple at about 10:30 and had a call from her friend Helen. There is nothing to say that she didn't bring someone home with her. Recall that the neighbor in the apartment next to hers heard voices and pounding after midnight. He had an impression of arguing. It could equally be someone she knew in the building. Reportedly she was friends with a newish tenant above her. Something went wrong, perhaps to do with sex or drugs or money, and whoever it was attacked her. The biggest argument against this is the tire iron as a weapon. Who brings a tire iron to a friendly visit? That weapon suggests a random person who followed her home or was watching her, even an opportunistic break-in. But, again, how did they get into the apartment, unless she forgot to lock up?   \n\nAnd then we have the dream. What do we make of it? It does seem that Steven Linscott did not commit the murder. DNA was the final piece. Yet it is so strange that he had the dream on this particular night. The policeman who asked if he might have thought he was dreaming while actually committing the crime, was not so far off base in terms of a theory, even if it proved wrong in this case. Steven suggested that it might have been dream telepathy, which was allegedly one of the subjects Karen studied at the Temple. Or it might have been a violent dream because he lived in a place where there was fighting on the street, frequent police sirens, and the like. It's possible that he had a vague dream of being attacked, and when he heard about the murder, his subconscious embroidered his memory with details. I lean toward this explanation, as my mind balks at any psychic theory. But I don't know. This truly is a remarkable case - a dream that became a nightmare.  \n\nIf you have come this far, thanks for reading. There were so many twists and turns that I needed a long post to do the case justice. \n\nSources:  \n\n*Innocence: The True Story of Steve Linscott* by w.

      "title": "Cadaver dog brought in amid search for body of American student last seen 32 years ago",
      "text": "This is the moment a cadaver dog was brought in to help in the search for the body of [US woman Annie McCarrick](https://www.irishmirror.ie/news/irish-news/cadaver-dog-brought-amid-search-35387875).\n\nGardai were last night questioning a millionaire over the murder of missing Annie McCarrick – after they received new information in the case. And, more than 32 years after the American student disappeared in Dublin, officers also began searching a house in the city.\n\nSources have told The Irish Mirror that the arrested man, who is now a respectable businessman and owns several properties with combined values of more than €1 million, has long been a suspect in the case of Ms McCarrick, who disappeared from south Dublin in March 1993.\n\nThe search is ongoing and it's hoped the dog will assist as despite extensive investigations, her body has never been found\n\nThe searches come with the first arrest in the long running probe into her disappearance – and comes two years after the case was upgraded from a missing person’s case to a full blown murder inquiry. Sources have also told us that the man, who is now in his 60s, had an infatuation with Ms McCarrick. He has been interviewed by gardai at least twice.\n\nBut that was as a witness – and now he is being questioned as a murder suspect. Officers from Irishtown Garda Station in south central Dublin – where the Annie McCarrick investigation is based – early yesterday morning sealed off a house in Clondalkin in south west Dublin that they suspect may be connected to the American woman’s murder.\n\nOfficers began using specialist search equipment at the house yesterday afternoon – but gardai were keen to stress that the current occupants of the property were not connected in any way with Ms McCarrick – or the investigation. “The current residents of this home are not connected in any way with Annie McCarrick or her disappearance,” gardai said in a statement.\n\nThe suspect, who was known to Ms McCarrick, was arrested on suspicion of murder early on Thursday morning and he was being quizzed in a Dublin Garda Station last night. Officers can hold the man for 24 hours before he must either be charged or released.\n\nBut that does not include significant periods of rest that must be offered to the suspect – which means it is likely the detention time will run out on Friday afternoon, or even the evening. Sources last night told us that gardai took the decision to arrest the suspect after a thorough review of the case that has seen dozens of people interviewed by detectives.\n\nThey said investigators were not anticipating any immediate breakthrough in the case – but remained hopeful. “This arrest is not a shot in the dark,” one source said last night. “It came about after the investigation team received new information. After evaluating that information, the decision was taken to make the arrest and carry out the search.”\n\nWe have also established that gardai have spent much of the last two years interviewing dozens of people who worked with Ms McCarrick – or knew her personally. They have been building a case against the suspect – and even went to France to interview a key associate.\n\nGardai announced the dramatic development in a statement early yesterday morning. The force said: ”Gardaí investigating the disappearance and murder of Annie McCarrick in March 1993 have this morning arrested a male on suspicion of her murder.\n\n“The male aged in his 60’ is detained under the provisions of Section 4 of the Criminal Justice Act 1984 at a Garda Station in Dublin. Investigating Gardaí are today commencing a search operation at a residence in Clondalkin, Dublin 22.\n\n“Elements of that house and garden will be searched and subject of both technical and forensic examinations. The current residents of this home are not connected in any way with Annie McCarrick or her disappearance.”\n\nThe statement also said local gardai were being assisted by detectives from the Garda Cold Case Unit and National Bureau of Criminal Investigation.\n\nThe force said: “The arrest and search operation is being led by an investigation team from the DMR South Central Division, Serious Crime Unit based at Irishtown Garda Station under the direction of a Senior Investigating Officer and with the assistance of the Serious Crime Review Team, Garda National Bureau of Criminal Investigation.\n\n“The search is being carried out by the DMR South Central divisional search team supported by the Garda National Technical Bureau. This search operation has the support of other state and external expertise if required. An Garda Síochána has and will continue to keep the family of Annie McCarrick fully updated in relation to this investigation. They have been fully appraised of today’s developments.”\n\nAnd officers also appealed for witnesses to come forward – even if they had been holding back information for decades. Gardai said: “An Garda Síochána appeal to anyone with information, no matter how small or insignificant that they might believe it to be, to contact the investigation team.\n\n“Gardaí also appeal to anyone that may have previously come forward but who felt that they could not provide Gardaí with all of the relevant information they had in relation to this matter, to please make contact with An Garda Síochána again. With the passage of time they may now be in a position to speak further with the investigation team.\n\n“Any information will be welcomed by the investigation team, and will be treated in the strictest confidence. The investigation team can be contacted at Irishtown Garda Station on 01 666 9600 or anyone who wishes to provide information confidentially should contact the Garda Confidential Line: 1800 666 111.”\n\nIt's understood gardai were aware of the suspect shortly after Annie was last seen in a coffee shop in the Sandymount area of south Dublin on March 26, 1993. Sources say he was able to give an account of his whereabouts around the time Annie disappeared – but that account is now under the spotlight again.\n\nThe focus of the investigation had been in Enniskerry, in rural south County Dublin, after a sighting of Ms McCarrick there on the day she disappeared – as well as one of her at Johnny Fox’s pub in Glencullen, around 5kms away. But neither of those sightings was ever confirmed and gardai now doubt she was in that area.\n\nShe was, however, caught on CCTV in a bank in the Sandymount area of central Dublin on March 26 – and that is the last confirmed sighting of her. Sources say detectives now believe the answer to her disappearance and murder lies in and around an area in south central Dublin, including Sandymount.\n\nBest selling author Marisa Mackle, who worked in a restaurant with Ms McCarrick and never believed that she had gone to Johnny Fox’s, last night said she felt vindicated by the arrest.\n\nShe said: “I do feel vindicated, but it is a hollow vindication. I never wanted to be proven right.”\n\nBut she added: “It is a good day. But I really hope it ends in something rather than getting the family’s hopes up.”",

      "title": "A Failed Hit and a Disappearance: The Case of Missing Person Mary Ann Johnson Case in 1994 from Los Angeles",
      "text": "In the heart of Los Angeles, January 1994, a 54-year-old account representative walked out of Robinson's-May Department Store and into thin air. Mary Ann Johnson told colleagues she would meet her estranged husband the next day. She would never arrive at that meeting – or anywhere else. For over three decades, her disappearance has baffled investigators, left her family in limbo, and added to the tragic roster of unsolved missing persons cases. What happened to Mary Ann Johnson? And why, after all these years, does her case remain shrouded in mystery?\n\n## The Last Known Movements\n\nMary Ann Johnson was last seen on January 19, 1994, leaving her workplace in Los Angeles, California. As an account representative at Robinson's-May Department Store, Mary Ann was known for her reliability and professionalism. According to her co-workers, she mentioned plans to meet with her estranged husband, Andrew Johnson, the following day.\n\nAndrew later told investigators a different story. While he acknowledged speaking with Mary Ann on the day she disappeared, he claimed they had no plans to meet the next day as she had indicated to her colleagues. This discrepancy would become the first of many puzzling elements in her case.\n\n### The Discovery of Her Vehicle\n\nA week after Mary Ann's disappearance, on January 26, 1994, her black 1988 Chevrolet Corvette was located in the parking lot of Louisiana West, a restaurant in Van Nuys that she and her husband owned. The restaurant had recently gone out of business and was locked, but curiously, Mary Ann's car keys were found inside the building. How the keys ended up inside the locked restaurant while her car remained in the parking lot has never been adequately explained.\n\n### A Marriage in Transition\n\nAt the time of her disappearance, Mary Ann and Andrew Johnson were in a complex phase of their relationship. The couple had separated in 1993 but had not filed for divorce and were reportedly in the process of reconciliation. Together, they owned Louisiana West, the restaurant where her car was ultimately found, though the business had ceased operations prior to her disappearance.\n\nThis personal transition period—attempting to salvage a marriage while dealing with a failed business venture—adds layers of complexity to understanding Mary Ann's state of mind and circumstances when she vanished.\n\n## Ominous Warning Signs\n\nPerhaps the most chilling thing about Mary Ann Johnson's disappearance was what happened right before. A few weeks before she went missing, something shocking happened that now looks like a warning sign of what was to come.\n\n### The Threat Before Christmas\n\nIn late December 1993, approximately one month before she went missing, Mary Ann experienced a disturbing encounter. Three men approached her and delivered an alarming message: they had been paid $800 to break her legs. In an unusual twist, rather than carrying out this violent act, the men chose to warn Mary Ann instead, pocketing the money they'd been given to harm her.\n\nWhat makes this incident particularly unsettling is that the three men refused to identify who had hired them or explain why someone wanted to hurt Mary Ann. Her sister reported this threat to police after her disappearance, adding a sinister element to the investigation.\n\nDetective Robert Cosley of the Los Angeles Police Department's West Valley Division acknowledged the significance of this threat, noting it as one of the factors that led authorities to suspect foul play in Mary Ann's case.\n\n## The Investigation\n\nInitially handled as a missing person case, the investigation into Mary Ann Johnson's disappearance eventually shifted toward a probable homicide investigation.\n\n### From Missing Person to Suspected Homicide\n\nBy June 1994, approximately five months after Mary Ann vanished, police publicly stated they believed she \"may have met with foul play\". The length of time that had passed without contact, combined with the prior threat against her, prompted homicide investigators to take over the case.\n\nCity Councilwoman Laura Chick, whose district included Reseda where Mary Ann lived, introduced a motion to offer a $10,000 reward for information that would reveal Johnson's fate. The council was scheduled to consider this motion, highlighting the seriousness with which authorities were treating her disappearance. This formal government action was significant because reward money is typically only allocated for high-priority cases where investigators believe public tips could be crucial to solving the case. The fact that a city council would dedicate public funds to a missing person case demonstrated both the concerning circumstances surrounding her disappearance and the growing frustration with the lack of progress in the investigation after five months.\n\n### Limited Evidence and Few Leads\n\nDespite the investigation's shift toward homicide, search results indicate that evidence in the case remained frustratingly scant. No reports of recovered physical evidence from either her vehicle or the restaurant appear in the available information. The case gradually went cold, joining thousands of other unsolved disappearances across the country.\n\n## Theories About Her Disappearance\n\nOver the decades, several theories have emerged regarding what might have happened to Mary Ann Johnson, though none have been definitively proven.\n\n### The Threat Carried Out\n\nThe most obvious theory stems from the threat Mary Ann received shortly before her disappearance. The fact that someone paid $800 to have her physically harmed suggests she had made an enemy capable of orchestrating violence. While the hired men claimed to have spared her, the person who wanted her harmed may have found others willing to do worse.\n\nThis theory gains credence from the timing—only weeks separated the threat from her disappearance—and would explain why no trace of Mary Ann has been found in the decades since. If someone wanted her harmed badly enough to pay for it, that malice might have escalated to more permanent violence.\n\n### Business Connections\n\nThe location of Mary Ann's abandoned vehicle at the failed restaurant she co-owned with her husband raises questions about possible business-related motives. Financial troubles stemming from the restaurant's closure might have created tensions or dangerous associations that played a role in her disappearance.\n\nFailed businesses sometimes involve debts, disputes with partners or suppliers, or other complications that can lead to dangerous situations. The fact that her car and keys were found at this business location suggests a possible connection to her disappearance.\n\n### Domestic Complications\n\nWhile no sources I found explicitly implicate Andrew Johnson in his wife's disappearance, the discrepancy between what Mary Ann told colleagues about meeting him and his denial of such plans raises questions. The couple was in a period of separation yet reconciliation, potentially creating a complex emotional situation.\n\nInvestigators would typically look closely at this inconsistency, particularly given that Mary Ann's vehicle was found at a property connected to both of them. However, available information does not indicate whether Andrew was ever named as a suspect or person of interest in the case.\n\n## The Ongoing Mystery\n\nAs of 2025, Mary Ann Johnson's case remains unsolved, with no significant breakthroughs reported in public sources. Her disappearance has been listed in multiple missing persons databases for over three decades.\n\n### An Investigation That Never Closed\n\nThe Charley Project, which documents cold missing persons cases, lists Mary Ann's disappearance as an \"Endangered Missing\" case, indicating authorities believe she disappeared under suspicious circumstances and may be in danger. Her case also appears in the California Department of Justice's missing persons database, where her information remains available to law enforcement nationwide.\n\nDespite the passage of time, Mary Ann's case continues to be featured on websites dedicated to unsolved disappearances, particularly those focused on missing Black women and girls. Her story represents one of many cases where minority women have vanished with less media attention than similar cases involving white women.\n\n## Conclusion: The Woman Who Vanished\n\nMore than three decades after Mary Ann Johnson walked out of her workplace and disappeared, the fundamental questions remain unanswered: What happened to her? Who wanted to harm her? And will her family ever know the truth?\n\nHer case exemplifies the cruel limbo that families of missing persons endure—without resolution, without a body to mourn, and without justice. For investigators, her disappearance represents a persistent challenge, a case file that cannot be closed but offers few new avenues to explore.\n\nAs time passes, the likelihood of solving Mary Ann Johnson's disappearance diminishes, but her story continues to resonate as a reminder of lives interrupted and justice delayed. Somewhere in Los Angeles, perhaps, lies the answer to what happened on that January day in 1994—an answer that, for now, remains as elusive as Mary Ann herself.\n\n## Sources\n\n- https://ourblackgirls.com/2023/07/02/mary-ann-johnson-missing/\n- https://charleyproject.org/case/mary-ann-johnson\n- https://www.doenetwork.org/cases/2728dfca.html\n- https://ourblackgirls.com/tag/missing-in-1994/\n- https://oag.ca.gov/missing/person/mary-ann-johnson\n- https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1994-06-23-me-7688-story.html",

      "title": "Super Bowl Sunday Stabbing: Who killed Jill Lyn Euto, and why?",
      "text": "January 28th, 2001. The Baltimore Ravens beat the New York Giants for their first ever Super Bowl win, 34-7. 18 year old Jill Lyn Euto had plans that day to watch the Super Bowl with her family. She called that morning around 11am or so and asked to speak to her mother. Her sister, then 17 year old Jenna, picked up the phone and said their mother couldn't talk because they were heading out to get groceries for that afternoon.  “It’s one of my biggest regrets,” Jenna told Dateline. “I just wish I would’ve let her talk to my mom.” \n\nThis was the last time anyone heard from Jill. When they got back from the grocery store an hour later, Jenna repeatedly called and left voicemails her sister with no answer. Their mother reassured Jenna that Jill probably had a change of plans and they would hear from her later. They never did.\n\nThe next day, a Monday morning, their mother phoned home to report that Jill had never shown up to work. She'd been calling Jill all morning with no answer, so she phoned her workplace at the time, Aeropostale, which said Jill did not come in her for her shift that morning. So Joanne Browning, the girls' mother, headed home to pick up Jenna then swing by Jill's apartment. When Joanne went inside, she saw a sight no mother should have to see - her daughter's lifeless body.  Jill had been stabbed multiple times with her own kitchen knife and had a cut to her neck. 24 years later, her case remains unsolved.\n\nJill Lyn Euto worked at Aeropostale part time while studying to fulfill her dream of being a paramedic. She'd recently moved out of her mother's house on Butternut Sreet in Syracuse, NY into a sixth floor apartment on on 600 James St. Tragically, Joanne Browning died in 2007 without ever getting justice for her daughter. She'd been on disability while relentlessly pursuing justice for Jill, and had picked up a landscaping job to make extra money. She fell 12ft from a roof to the ground below and hit the back of her head, dying instantly. Jill's sister Jenna is still keeping her name out there and hoping to get answers in her case. \n\nCopied from the NBC Article: Anyone with information about Jill Lyn Euto’s murder is asked to contact the Syracuse Police Department’s Criminal Investigations Division at (315) 442-5222, the Homicide Tip Line at (315) 442-5223 or by email at [homicideunit@syracusepolice.org](mailto:homicideunit@syracusepolice.org). All tips will be kept confidential.\n\nFURTHER READING AND SOURCES:\n\nNBC News did a wonderful and informative write-up that shed light on Jill's case in February of this year, which is how I learned about it. I highly recommend reading it. [NBC Article on Jill](https://www.nbcnews.com/dateline/cold-case-spotlight/jill-lyn-euto-2001-syracuse-new-york-murder-rcna191267)\n\nThere is also a wikipedia article that can be read [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder_of_Jill-Lyn_Euto)\n\nFollow up questions: \n\nDo you have any theories on why Jill was murdered?\n\nDo any locals have any insight on the case?",

      "title": "Corinne Perry was last seen at a laundromat in Creston, Iowa on April 17, 1983, and her remains were found 6 miles away on November 3, 1984. Despite multiple witnesses seeing a man follow her out of the laundromat, her murder and the identity of the man remain unsolved.",
      "text": "On the night of Sunday, April 17, 1983, Letitia Perry was at her mother Barbara’s house. Letitia was 19 years old and was taking classes at a community college and lived on her own, but was spending the evening, and perhaps the night, at her mom’s. That night, however, Letitia and her mother began to worry because Corinne, Letitia’s 17-year-old sister, hadn’t come home. \n\nLetitia and Corinne were the youngest of four sisters in the Perry household. They were all very close growing up, and they moved often because their dad, Donald Perry, was in the Air Force. After he retired, they moved to Creston, Iowa, and eventually, Donald and Barbara divorced.\n\nCorinne Perry was 17 years old and just about to graduate from high school. She had earned a scholarship to Simpson College in Iowa and had plans to double major in psychology and acting. Based on my research, acting was a clear passion of hers. She was in her high school's mime troupe, she acted in several plays, and also took part in speech competitions. \n\nIn a 2020 NBC article by Andrea Cavallier, Letitia said, “I was at the house that day and when Corinne didn’t come home that night, we started to worry… It got late, so we started calling her friends.” Letitia and Barbara started calling Corinne’s friends but none of them had seen or heard from her. \n\nEventually, they called Creston Police, but were reportedly not taken seriously, and police told them they believed she was a runaway. Letitia said she remembers feeling frustrated and getting upset with the questions police initially asked. She said, “We were wasting time and I just wanted to find my sister.”\n\nIt’s unclear to me in my research how much police were initially involved, and what her family knew about what Corinne was doing that evening, because the next day, Corinne’s vehicle, which she shared with her mother, was found at the Highlander Laundromat in Creston, Iowa. I don’t know if it was the police who found it or someone else. When looking up this story, it’s one of the main details reported, that she was last seen at a laundromat, but based on her family calling friends to try and find her and not checking the laundromat first, makes me believe they perhaps didn’t know that she was there. \n\nEither way, Corinne’s vehicle was found at the Highlander Laundromat, and inside her vehicle, her clothes were neatly folded in a cardboard box; there was no other sign of her or her belongings, like her purse. \n\nIt is reported that Corinne had gone to the laundromat by herself around 6:10 p.m. on April 17. Police said there were three witnesses who indicated Perry had dried her clothes in a room separate from the washers, and in that room was a man about 6 feet tall with a medium build and medium-length brown hair, clean shaven, and wearing glasses. \n\nAccording to witnesses, Corinne left the laundromat around 8:30 pm and the man left soon after.\n\nOn May 3rd, 1983, newspapers published articles informing the public that a specific witness was being sought for information, this man. \n\nIn an article by Nick Lamberto in the Des Moines Register, it’s written, \"State and local investigators are seeking a man in his early 20s who was seen April 17 at a coin-operated laundry at Creston before a 17-year-old girl disappeared\". \n\nGene Meyer, a special agent supervisor with the Iowa Division of Criminal Investigation, said, \"We want to talk to him as a possible witness, not as a suspect. He may be able to give us information that will help us in the investigation”. \n\nJust days after Corinne went missing, her purse was found by police. But it was found seven miles from the laundromat and her vehicle. According to this same article by Nick Lamberto in the Des Moines Register, it was found on a highway bridge and is described in another article as possibly being placed on the bridge, rather than tossed or dropped, because none of the contents inside the purse - like her glasses and makeup - weren’t broken. \n\nThe contents of her purse, and finding it in a location so far from her vehicle, seem to have pushed investigators to look at this through the lens of foul play potentially being involved. For one, Corinne had terrible eyesight, and the DCI Chief at the time said she would likely have trouble functioning on a day-to-day basis without them. Her mother also said that Corinne would have “splitting headaches within 30 minutes” if she didn’t wear them, so the fact that they were in her purse was not a good sign. Letitia also commented that Corinne loved makeup and wouldn’t leave the house or go anywhere without it on, so to her, that also made the idea that Corinne ran away even less likely. \n\nThe bridge the purse was found on was over the West Platte River. According to the Police Chief it was searched multiple times, and months later, when hunting season was ramping up, special notices and warnings were posted in motels and in the area asking visitors and hunters to be on the lookout for any sign of Corrine. But this didn’t produce any leads or results. \n\nThe search for Corinne went on month by month, with no new information coming in. Chief Kessler was quoted in a Des Moines Register article on February 6, 1984 as saying “We’ve never had a case here that we’ve spent even a tenth of the amount of time we have on this one, and to no avail”.\n\nThe Assistant Chief Dean Jarman added, “I think we have interviewed 200 people and, quite frankly, we don’t know any more now than we did the day after she was reported missing”. \n\nHer photo was sent to and posted at truck stops, hospitals, theaters, and optical shops all over the U.S. Theaters were picked as one target because of her interest in theater and drama. The optical shops were chosen because of her poor eyesight and because she’d need glasses. This specific strategy also makes me believe there was still a part of the police and maybe volunteers that she had left on her own. \n\nDespite months going by with no answers, the community and her mother did all they could to keep hope alive. A support group met weekly to connect and to also organize, putting up information flyers and informing the public that $2500 in reward money had been gathered for information leading to Corrine’s location. \n\nCorrine’s mother, Barbara, attended those weekly meetings and an article in the Des Moines Register by Gene Raffensperger published on February 6, 1984 says, “She continues to maintain an attitude of optimism that Corinne will return or turn up alive. But, as time passes and nothing is heard, she acknowledges that sometimes she faces up to the fact that her daughter might be dead. “I think I have myself to the point where I could accept it if I was told she was not alive. Sometimes I think about how I would feel if someone came and knocked on the door and said they had found my daughter’s body.”\n\nNine months after Barbara Perry made that comment, it became a reality. Corinne’s remains were found on Saturday, November 3rd, 1984, by two teenage hunters in a heavily wooded area. \n\nLetitia told Dateline in an interview that she was in another part of Iowa at a friend's house when her mom called her with the news. She said, “She told me Corinne’s body had been found. I—I hit the floor. I dropped the phone. I couldn't breathe or think. My sister was gone.”\n\nWhat was ultimately recovered included a skull and other bones, which were found scattered in a stream where the hunters were walking. The area was heavily wooded and 100 yards away from an abandoned Burlington Northern Railroad track and about a quarter of a mile north of a gravel road. \n\nThe location of her remains was about six and a half miles northeast of Lenox, and just a mile from the bridge where her purse was found shortly after she disappeared. Based on the remains being described as skeletal, I assume that she had been there the whole time, though I found nothing in my research to confirm that.\n\nIn the Dateline interview, Letitia says she believes her sister was killed and that her body was placed in a shallow grave. “We searched near that bridge, but we searched down the river. In case she fell, or something, into the water and moved downstream. But this was up river from the bridge. I don’t think that area was searched”. \n\nAn article published in the Des Moines Register on November 5, 1984 said state and local law enforcement were coming together to begin what was described as an “intensive” investigation to determine if Corinne Perry was murdered, and if so, by whom. \n\nThe article goes on to say, “Although investigators are awaiting a pathology report, there was widespread talk among them that Perry had been slain,” and that aside from the skull and bones, nothing else was recovered that day. \n\nCreston Police Chief Robert Kessler said, “We’ve followed so many leads and we’ve had no luck. Now we’re going to have to re-look at it all over again and see what happened”. \n\nUltimately, in my research, I don’t believe a cause of death was ever able to be determined, likely because of the state of the remains. And years have gone by, and investigators are no closer to knowing who was responsible, or who the man was at the laundromat. \n\nIn my research, I came across an article by Bob Shaw in the Des Moines Register from September 18, 1984, so a month and a half before Corinne’s remains were found. It talks about how at a certain point Barbara Perry received a call in the middle of the night about a man who said he had seen Corinne. \n\nThe article reads: \n\n“Barbara Perry was jarred awake Monday morning by a man who said he had seen her daughter, Corinne, who has been missing since April 17, 1983. But the man hung up too soon to give the police any clue whether the call was a prank or a legitimate sighting. He asked for Corinne, said Perry, who was awakened by the call at 6am. He seemed very definite. I said she wasn’t here right now and he started to hang up. I asked him how he knew Corinne, and he said he had seen her in the last couple of days in Creston. Then he hung up. This is the first time this happened. I have been so fortunate before. That’s why I was so shook by it”. \n\nThe article goes on to quote the Creston Assistant Police Chief, “There is no doubt she got the call. She really didn't find out a thing from the guy. I don't know what to make of it. We have checked out calls from coast to coast, every lead we get, and we are checking this one out too.”\n\nBarbara Perry said, “I want to tell the person to please call back, even if it was a case of mistaken identity. We do want to know if she’s alright. We do love her”. \n\nUltimately, it was never determined who called Barbara Perry that night, and very well could have been a hoax. \n\nOver the years in Iowa there have been many efforts to stand up cold case units and look at the many cold cases in the state, and Corrine’s case is always on the list. \n\nIn the NBC article I have referenced a couple of times, it says that one month after Corinne’s disappearance, Iowa Governor Terry Branstad approved a proposal to remove the 72-hour hold that some law enforcement agencies were required to wait before asking the division of criminal investigation for help in missing persons cases with suspected foul play. \n\nThe issue with Corinne’s disappearance appeared to be related to law enforcement treating her as a runaway, rather than the issue being with local law enforcement requesting assistance from DCI, but it was perhaps a step in the right direction for missing person cases overall. \n\nCorinne’s father died in 2001, and her mother Barbara died in 2017, neither getting answers in their daughter's unsolved murder. Corinne’s sisters had to move on. Letitia has two daughters now, and says the youngest looks exactly like Corinne. She told Dateline that even after all of these years, she still hopes to find justice for her sister and closure for her family. \n\nShe said she’s quit having expectations, but she can’t give up on her little sister. \n\nIf you have any information on the murder of Corinne Perry, please contact the Iowa Division of Criminal Investigation at (515) 725-6010, email [dciinfo@dps.state.ia.us](mailto:dciinfo@dps.state.ia.us), or contact the Creston Police Department at (641) 782-8402.\n\n\n\nSOURCES\n\n* Cavallier, Andrea, April 10, 2020, Woman still searching for justice in her sister Corinne Perry’s murder nearly 40 years after she was killed after leaving Iowa Laundromat, NBC News, [https://www.nbcnews.com/dateline/woman-still-searching-justice-sister-corinne-perry-s-murder-nearly-n1181291](https://www.nbcnews.com/dateline/woman-still-searching-justice-sister-corinne-perry-s-murder-nearly-n1181291)\n\n* Shaw, Bob, Sep 18, 1984, Call about missing daughter mystifies, unnerves Iowa mother, The Des Moines Register\n\n* Lamberto, Nick, May 3, 1983, Witness sought in girl’s disappearance, The Des Moines Register\n\n* Santiago, Frank, July 3, 1983, Creston folks gather to find young woman who is missing, The Des Moines Register\n\n* Raffensperger, Gene, Feb 6, 1984, Search goes on for girl missing nearly 10 months, The Des Moines Register\n\n* Santiago, Frank, Nov 5, 1984, Officers seek Corinne Perry’s cause of death, The Des Moines Register",

      "title": "Pah Pow left her South Dakota home in 2016 after a fight with her husband. Allegedly, she was heading to her boyfriend's house, yet she's never been heard from since. She leaves four children behind. What happened to Pah Pow?",
      "text": "Hello all! I am back with another case write-up. This case drew my attention from the first moment I read it, and I think it needs more eyes.\n\nThis is the unexpected and frankly odd disappearance of Pah Pow.\n\n**Note**: I am just a web sleuth/criminal justice college student; I have no insider knowledge or involvement in the cases I write up on. I write these write-ups in the hope of engaging the community with these cases. And bear with any grammatical inaccuracies. I do my best.\n\n\n\n**Background**\n\nPah Pow was born in Thailand circa 1985/1986. Not much is publicly known about this period of her life, but it is known that she and her husband, Sah Doe, immigrated to the United States in their adult life. The pair lived with family members in Lincoln, Nebraska for a time before moving to Aberdeen, South Dakota around 2014.\n\nThe couple has four children. The eldest was 10 at the time of Pah's disappearance, with the youngest being only 17 months old.\n\nPah and Sah worked at Molded Fiber Glass together for a time, though Pah had to quit due to medical concerns. It is known that **Pah suffered from depression and was prone to seizures if she was overwhelmed or upset**. Pah did not speak much English and spoke primarily Thai and Karen. She almost always had to have a translator with her. Understandably, this was highly stressful for her, and the stress-based seizures posed a safety concern. She left the company to begin work at DemKota Ranch Beef instead. [(Source)](https://www.aberdeennews.com/story/news/local/2016/05/05/missing-since-april-17-pah-pows-family-left-with-questions/116698566/)\n\nIt was during her time at the ranch that things began to get dicey. According to reports, she got a boyfriend (name unknown) while working at the plant, and even blocked Sah on Facebook. It is inferred based on articles that she was still living with her husband and children, and the exact status of their relationship is unknown. Nonetheless, it was a tense time for the pair.\n\n**The Disappearance** \n\nAllegedly, Sah took the couple's youngest son to a local park on **April 17, 2016**. That day, Pah and Sah had apparently had another argument, resulting in Sah deciding to take their youngest child to the park to cool off. When they left, Pah was still inside the home (Seventh Avenue Southeast, Aberdeen, SD) with the other three children. There was nothing indicating immediate mental distress.\n\nBut when Sah came home around 7:00 pm (though some sources claim it was closer to 11:00 pm), Pah was gone. Her belongings, with the exception of her cell phone, were all still in the home. Her phone was apparently turned off around the same time as the disappearance. Sah claims that Pah had left for a few days at a time, but always came back or contacted her other family members. Disappearing for this long with no contact is highly unusual for her.\n\nHowever, due to an unfortunate miscommunication, Pah was not officially reported as a missing person until a week later. Sah claims this is because he mistakenly believed she was staying with family, whereas her family believed she was staying with friends. Sah reported her missing the moment he realized the error.\n\nInterestingly, the couple's eldest son recalled that Pah had entered an unknown vehicle with a man he was familiar with, yet didn't know the name of. It is believed that the man in question was Pah's boyfriend, though the make and model of the car is unknown. It is worth noting that, while news reports claim she went into a car, the FBI poster claims she left on foot. Police have since claimed that they interviewed the boyfriend and confirmed that Pah is not with him, though nothing more has been elaborated on. [(Source)](https://www.aberdeennews.com/story/news/local/2016/05/05/missing-since-april-17-pah-pows-family-left-with-questions/116698566/)\n\nThere has been one unconfirmed sighting of Pah. A Facebook user claimed to have seen her in Ellendale, North Dakota in the days after her disappearance. Though Aberdeen PD did investigate the tip, they were unable to confirm if the woman was Pah. [(Source)](https://www.dakotanewsnow.com/content/news/Police-search-for-missing-Aberdeen-woman-377201411.html)\n\nIn all interviews, Sah is quite distraught and teary over Pah's disappearance. He has had to reduce his shifts to help care for his children and recently moved in with family in Nebraska to get help with caring for them.\n\n**Theories, Suspects, and the Investigation**\n\nThere are very few public details about suspects or theories in this case. Here is what we do know.\n\nSah has not been publicly named as a suspect or person of interest. Pah's boyfriend's name has not been released to the public, but he has also not been publicly named as a suspect or person of interest. To date, very little about the investigation has been made public.\n\nPah's family agrees that her disappearance is not normal. Though Pah had occasionally left for days at a time, she often either stayed with or contacted friends and family. Due to her seizures, her loved ones fear that she may have had a tragic accident or is disoriented. On the other hand, some online are suspicious of her boyfriend or husband.\n\nCurrently, the investigation seems to have gone into a standstill. There have been no publicly released details, persons of interest, or clues in her disappearance. \n\n**The Important Stuff**\n\nPah Pow was 30 years old at the time of her disappearance. If alive, she would be 38 today. She is 5'2 and 110 pounds with brown hair and eyes. She is reported to have been wearing a white shirt, blue denim jeans, pink tennis shoes, a silver ring, and a silver heart necklace. [(Source)](https://namus.nij.ojp.gov/case/MP35793)\n\nPah is known to have struggled with anxiety, depression, and stress-based seizures. She has four missing teeth and five restored teeth, and her familial DNA is available in CODIS for comparison.

Families continue to call for justice, but the case remains unsolved more than 3 years later.\n\nThis happened during the pandemic when gun violence had reached a relative peak. It is rare for gun violence to go unsolved in Western New York though and especially a mass shooting. What do you all think?\n\n[https://13wham.com/news/local/pennsylvania-avenue-mass-shooting-where-the-case-stands-one-year-later](https://13wham.com/news/local/pennsylvania-avenue-mass-shooting-where-the-case-stands-one-year-later)\n\nThis was the latest article I could find on the mass shooting with details a year after it happened. It would be good if it could get solved someday.",

      "title": "A body of a teen girl, wrapped in a blanket, is found in a pond in a park; She appeared to be physically disabled, and remains unidentified to this day- Who was the Baltimore Jane Doe? (1979)",
      "text": "Hello everyone! As always, I'd like to thank you for all your comments and votes under my post about the Broward County John Doe; I hope that his name will be given back to him soon.\n\n  \nToday I'd like to bring up another Doe case.\n\n  \nDISCOVERY\n\n  \nOn the 6th of December, a body had been discovered by a city maintenence worker by the edge of a half-frozen pond in Fort Smallwood Park (about 15 ft (457 cm) off Cabana Road) on the Patapsco River in Baltimore, Maryland, USA. The body was wrapped in a yellow blanket and a green and tan sheet. When the investigators arrived at the scene, they've noted that the victim appeared to be dragged to the pond and was lying in the spot for about 24 hours (two days at most). There didn't seem to be any obvious signs of violence on the deceased's body, and the cause of death was ultimately left as undetermined.\n\n  \nThe deceased was a female of undetermined, possibly mixed ancestry. She was between 13 to 17 years, but one article from the era suggests that she might've been in her early 20s. She was 4' 7\" (55 inch / 140 cm) and 89 lbs (40 kg). Her hair was brown, straight, and about 2,5 inch (6,35 cm) in length, and her eyes were blue. It's noted that she had some facial hair above her upper lip, and two of her upper teeth fell out before death. Her limbs were noted to be short, with slightly bowed forearms, and her feet were small, broad, and \"abnormally developed\". Her blood type was AB (but it's not noted if it was rh+ or rh-). She was found wearing only a long sleeve blouse with cream, light blue and beige print.\n\n  \nCONCLUSION\n\n  \nIt's not exactly clear what happened to Jane, as her cause of death was never able to be determined; We don't know if her death was caused by homicidal means, or if she perhaps died due to natural causes or suicide. Regardless of that, her death had been deliberately hidden by someone else- I doubt that Jane wrapped herself up in the sheets and came to the park herself. But why would someone do this?\n\n  \nAs you've probably noticed, Jane most likely suffered from some physical disabilities- she was very short, and her limbs were noted to be short and \"abnormally developed\". It's speculated that she might've been suffering from Léri-Weill dyschondrosteosis (a genetic disorder that causes wrist deformities, short arms and legs, and \"bayonet-like\" forearms) and achondroplasia, more commonly known as dwarfism. Sadly, it's possible that Jane was killed by her caregivers- there are many cases of disabled people who were murdered by their caregivers, most commonly in order to commit fraud (recieve disability benefits without having to actually look after someone who's disabled). Jane was very physically distinct, so if her caretakers filled a missing person's report, it most likely wouldn't go unnoticed, and the two cases would quickly get connected. I think it's most likely that a report was never filed. She was just a teenager, a disabled one at that, so her disappearance should've been very concerning, and the fact that she was never reported missing certainly suggests that her caretakers were involved. What's interesting is that neither of the disorders that Jane might've suffered from would have any impact on her cognitive abilities- I don't want to downplay her possible disabilites of course, and she would require some degree of extra support her whole life, but there are plenty of people with dwarfism who lead independent lives. In a lot of disabled Doe cases the victim is estimated to require extensive support for their whole life, with the implication being that their caretakers didn't want to support them anymore.\n\n  \nOf course, it's also possible that someone else had killed Jane. Some people noticed that she was only wearing a blouse, and no pants or skirt, which might mean that she was a victim of sexual assault- her attacker would kill her and dump her in the lake afterwards. There is no info in any sources about her being a victim of assault, so this is only speculation, but it is possible, so I thought I'll at least mention it; After all, the investigators know a lot more than we do, and they don't share all their discoveries with us. Jane, as a disabled teenager, would be an easy target for someone who might've wanted to hurt her- and her small stature certainly didn't make her harder to overpower. \n\n  \nThe only other idea I have is that Jane died of some natural cause, somehow, and whoever was looking after her didn't have the money for a funeral. She didn't have any obvious signs of violence on her body despite being found recently, so it's possible that she died of something like a heart attack- she was young, but it's possible that she suffered from some other health problems that caused her to die a natural death at a young age. \n\n  \nAs of now, it's been 45 years since Jane's discovery. There hasn't been much movement in her case, except for a reconstruction done in 2019. Her dentals and fingerprints are on file, but it seems like not much came of it. Her DNA is listed as unavailable, which is a shame, but I hope that it can be obtained from some evidence, or that she can be exhumed and a sample then taken from her remains. It's an old case, so I understand why there's no DNA, but still, I wish there was, so that genetic genealogy could be performed. Jane was clearly just a kid, a vulnerable, disabled one at that, and it saddens me that she can't even rest under her own name. It's odd to me that seemingly not much has been done to identify her, especially due to her suspicious (at the very least) circumstances of discovery, but I'm afraid that the attitudes on the disabled at the time and the way every missing teen case had been dismissed as a runaway back then had something to do with it. I hope that Jane will be identified one day, and that the person or people who tossed her into that lake will be put to justice. \n\n  \nIf you believe you have any info about Jane Doe, contact the Baltimore Police Department at 443-263-2220 (case number 799L09892). \n\n  \nSOURCES:\n\n1.

      "text": "[NO CRIMINAL CHARGES](https://abc3340.com/news/local/fathers-outrage-as-no-charges-filed-in-sons-torture-rape-death-in-prison)\n\nDaniel Terry Williams, 22, was likely smothered to death a year ago, according to the state’s chief medical examiner, and there was evidence on his body that corroborate what witnesses have said was his kidnapping and torture over a period of several days inside Staton Correctional Facility. A DNA a rape kit revealed three attackers according to Williams' family. They believe he was held by other inmates over two to three days. Dr. Edward Reedy, chief medical examiner for the Alabama Department of Forensic Sciences, conducted the autopsy, and his report includes details of Mr. Williams’ tragic last few days. \n\n“There is evidence of ligature restraint on the decedent’s ankles and contusions on various locations that are also suggestive of manual restraint,” Mr. Reedy wrote in the report, also noting there were “Multiple abrasions and contusions in varying states of healing” and “diffuse abrasions and contusions on his upper extremities that may be defensive in nature….The cause of death was probable asphyxia due to smothering...Injuries of the decedent's face are highly suggestive of his face being pressed into a soft object.\" The autopsy from the Alabama Department of Forensic Sciences lists the Manner of Death as Homicide.\n\nDaniel was found unconscious, on the bunk of another inmate the family believes is responsible for this death on October 22. An I-Team investigation found that[ inmate had a history of sexual violence](https://abc3340.com/news/local/suspect-in-murder-and-rape-of-22-year-old-inmate-had-history-of-sexual-violence-according-to-adoc-documents) yet was housed in an open dorm area.\n\nDaniel was transferred to Jackson Hospital and placed on life support before dying in hospice care at Kilby Correctional Infirmary two weeks later. With all this overwhelming evidence, why did the grand jury not return an indictment? Will there be justice for Daniel?\n\nThe killing of Daniel Williams gained national attention. Williams was 22 years old serving a one year sentence on drug charges, dying the day he was to be released.\n\nLAST FACEBOOK MESSAGE\n\nDANIEL had just been transferred into this prison and his last Facebook read:\n\n**\"How every body doing I ain't got to much longer left pray for me I'm coming home better then I was before drug free it's been a crazy ride 3 different prisons now. It's almost over,\" Daniel Terry Williams, 22, wrote on Oct. 15, about one week before his family says he was brutally attacked by a prison gang on Oct. 19.** **(Facebook)**\n\nWARDEN'S LIES\n\nTaylor Bostic, Williams' stepmother, said the warden at Staton told her over the phone that Williams had overdosed on drugs. When she and her husband, Terry Williams — Daniel's father — went to visit him at a hospital after the alleged overdose, they could not believe what they saw. \"He was black and blue from head to toe,\" Bostic said. \"He had restraint marks on his wrists. He had indents, almost, in his head from being beaten.\" Terry Williams noted multiple injuries on his son at the hospital. \"It looked like mop handles across his head, bruising everywhere. It's something parents shouldn't see,\" said Williams. The bruising on the inside of his legs led the hospital staff to believe he had been sexually assaulted too.\n\nTerry Williams alleged, citing what he has heard from other inmates at the facility, that Daniel had been \"tied up\" and beaten on Oct. 19, three days before another inmate got him help on Oct. 22. Daniel was brain-dead and transported to a hospital, where his family ultimately decided to take him off life support. \n\nHe was apparently transported to Kilby Correctional Facility three days after being taken off life support, where he was pronounced dead on Nov. 9, his parents alleged, the day he was supposed to be released.\n\n\"I'm speechless really,\" said Terry Williams, his father after learning no indictments were handed down by an Elmore County Grand Jury in the homicide. \"I think about it all the time,\" said Williams wiping away tears. Prior to his son's death he had lost his mother.\n\nThe autopsy from the Alabama Department of Forensic Sciences lists the Manner of Death as Homicide and the Cause of Death as probable asphyxia due to smothering. \"Injuries of the decedent's face are highly suggestive of his face being pressed into a soft object.\"\n\nThe report notes \"evidence of ligature restraint\" on the inmate meaning he was tied up. It also reports \"multiple abrasions and contusions in varying states of healing.\"\n\nA longtime prison researcher with Alabama Appleseed was queried about how an inmate could be held by other inmates, tortured and raped for two to three days and no one intervened? Where were the guards?\n\n\"Great question. In a secure prison to have someone kidnapped and moved to a dorm where he's not supposed to be for a period of days, it's unconscionable. There should have been officers to see that and cameras,\" remarked researcher Eddie Burkhalter. He says he is surprised the Elmore County Grand Jury which met last month returned no indictments.\n\n\"Daniel's death and the inability to hold anyone accountable is more evidence why more eyes need to be on this crisis,\" said Burkhalter. His organization tracked 325 deaths last year in the state prisons. \"They've gotten worse across the board,\" said Burkhalter.\n\nNO ONE ACCOUNTABLE FOR HIS BRUTAL GANG RAPE, TORTURE, AND MURDER?\n\nHe was a father of two. Despite witnesses who saw Mr. Williams being held against his will in a secure prison staffed with officers, and despite clear medical evidence pointing to homicide and a suspect identified, that suspect has not been charged in Mr. Williams’s death. To date, no one has been criminally charged in connection with his death. \n\nIn a prison system where frequent, violent deaths are common, the homicide of Mr. Williams stood out for a number of reasons: he was serving a short sentence for a minor crime, he was scheduled for release within days, his torture over a prolonged period went undetected for days, and his assailant had a long record of institutional violence that went unaddressed. \n\nAnd now, it appears, no one will be held accountable for this young man’s suffering and death.\n\nWHAT IS SCARY\n\nWhat's scary is the suspected perpetrator was serving a 20 year sentence for sodomy, assault and escape. He has a record dating back to 2015 across multiple prisons, nearly killed another inmate, by stabbing him to death, yet still had a violence assessment score of 0 and is still due to be released from prison in like 10 years.\n\nHighlighted points from [https://alabamaappleseed.org/author/eddie-burkhalter/after-investigation-no-criminal-charges-in-the-torture-and-homicide-of-daniel-williams-at-staton-prison/](https://alabamaappleseed.org/author/eddie-burkhalter/after-investigation-no-criminal-charges-in-the-torture-and-homicide-of-daniel-williams-at-staton-prison/)\n\n\"The 38-year-old suspect in this kidnapping, rape and torture was involved in nine instances of sex assault, rape, and stabbing since 2017 in ADOC while incarcerated. … There is no documentation that he was placed in segregation for any of these assaults. There was no disciplinary action by ADOC.”\n\n“His classification summary showed a five-year clear record of institutional violence, which resulted in a perfect score of zero in risk assessment conducted in October, and a total score low enough for him to be placed in medium security in an open bay dorm. The psych associates signed off on this and the warden signed off on this,” Mrs. Crowder told committee members. “Nine days later, 22-year-old Daniel Williams … was found, according to ADOC, unresponsive on this inmate’s assigned bed.”\n\n\"ADOC didn’t classify the assault as a crime or levy a disciplinary charge, but instead simply wrote the matter up as an “enemies report” which are supposed to be used to keep disputing incarcerated people from one-another.\"\n\n**“Insufficient probable cause to issue an indictment”**\n\nThe Alabama Department of Corrections (ADOC) Law Enforcement Services Division completed its investigation and forwarded those findings in July to the Elmore County District Attorney’s Office for presentation of a criminal case to the grand jury, an ADOC spokeswoman told Appleseed. \n\n“The case involving the death of Daniel Williams was investigated by the I&I Division of DOC,” wrote 19th Judicial Circuit District Attorney CJ Robinson in a response to Appleseed last week. He referred to ADOC’s Law Enforcement Services Division as I&I, which is the abbreviation of the division’s former name, the Investigations and Intelligence Division. \n\n“The completed casefile was submitted to the 19th Judicial Circuit DA’s Office several weeks ago and presented to the first available Grand Jury in Elmore County (October 2024). After hearing the details of the investigation, the grand jury determined there was insufficient probable cause to issue an indictment,” Mr. Robinson said. \n\nIn Mr. Williams’ case, the grand jury had the opportunity to hear from investigators and review any video footage before being presented with three possible offenses to indict on: murder, manslaughter, or criminally negligent homicide, Mr. Robinson told Appleseed. \n\n“They took a long amount of time to hear the evidence and for their deliberations,” he said. But ultimately, they failed to receive 12 votes to indict. \n\nMr. Robinson also shared that if additional evidence or witnesses surface that might change the grand jury vote, he would consider re-presenting the case, which is something he has done in the past. \n\n[https://abc3340.com/news/local/fathers-outrage-as-no-charges-filed-in-sons-torture-rape-death-in-prison](https://abc3340.com/news/local/fathers-outrage-as-no-charges-filed-in-sons-torture-rape-death-in-prison)\n\nWill there be charges brought forward in this case?\n\nThis is my first time posting. I hope this is okay. This case, I cannot get it out of my head. His family, his two babies, no justice.",

      "text": "François Vérove, also known as Le Grêlé, was a French serial killer, rapist, police officer and local politician, who murdered three people (including one child) and raped at least six people between 1986 and 1994 in the Paris area. He received his nickname from acne scars seen on his face by witnesses following his first murder.\n\nVérove committed suicide in September 2021 upon realizing that he was about to be identified. Before his suicide, He wrote a farewell letter to his family and I find it super interesting ! Following are excerpts from an article :\n\n*Having no news of him, his wife decided to report his disappearance to the police. The body of François Vérove was finally found two days later, on a mattress in an apartment he was renting.*\n\n*On the kitchen hood, He wrote “SUICIDE PLEASE CALL 17 (french 911)\"*\n\n*He wrote on his ID : “09/27/2021, my name is François Vérove. I have just committed suicide. In case I'm in a coma DO NOT TRY TO RESUSCITATE ME, THANK YOU”.*\n\n*On the kitchen worktop, police officers found a letter to his family :*\n\n*\"My dear, I am going to explain to you why I had to leave this world.\"*\n\n*\"You met me in 1984, when I was a young policeman. A that time, You had already detected some difficulties that I was trying to hide. I was actually nourishing an uncontrollable rage which made me a criminal.\"*\n\n*\"Sometimes I couldn't take it anymore, and I had to destroy, tarnish, kill innocent people.\" According to him, his crimes were caused by \"growing impulses\" that he couldn't control until the birth of his children. He explains that these impulses completely vanished in 1997, when he went to therapy following a job burnout.*\n\n*\"Therapy erased my death instinct : when I was killing innocent people, I was actually seeking to destroy my childhood wounds\".*\n\n*“This recovery was a real relief, a true rebirth. But I could not erase the past”. \"More than 30 years after my first crimes, the justice system has caught up with me. In order to avoid a trial that will have consequences for you, I have made the decision to commit suicide. Indeed, French justice system stops prosecution at the death of the criminal\".*\n\n*He concluded the farewell letter by writing a message to all his victims :*\n\n*\"I will never be able to undo the harm I have caused to my family and to the families of the victims (…) I am not asking for forgiveness because my deeds are unforgivable. I love you more than anything else in this world and I hate this criminal that I used to be\".*\n\nSources :\n\n[François Vérove - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fran%C3%A7ois_V%C3%A9rove)\n\n[Le Grêlé: la lettre qu’il a laissé à sa femme avant de se suicider (bfmtv.com)](https://rmccrime.bfmtv.com/affaires-criminelles/france/le-grele-la-lettre-qu-il-a-laisse-a-sa-femme-avant-de-se-suicider_AN-202210010031.html)\n\n[French ex-officer's DNA ends 35-year murder hunt - BBC News](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-58749596)\n\n[Former policeman's suicide ends 35-year hunt for French serial killer (france24.com)](https://www.france24.com/en/europe/20211001-former-policeman-s-suicide-ends-35-year-hunt-for-french-serial-killer)",

On the evening of October 24th, her severed arms were found in a downtown dumpster, wrapped in trash bags.\n\n[https://tucsoncitizen.com/morgue2/1994/04/20/132089-mystery-shrouds-1992-murder/](https://tucsoncitizen.com/morgue2/1994/04/20/132089-mystery-shrouds-1992-murder/)\n\nHer car, which was locked with the alarm set, was found on the same neighborhood street as a house owned by the mother of her drama teachers fiancé. The rest of Diana's remains were never found.\n\nIn 1999, Lemuel Prion was convicted and sentenced to death row. In 2003, his conviction was thrown out. Prion died in Utah in August of 2023. Prion was exonerated due to several reasons...\n\n[https://caselaw.findlaw.com/court/az-supreme-court/1291382.html](https://caselaw.findlaw.com/court/az-supreme-court/1291382.html)\n\nHis DNA did not match what was found at the crime scene. Only one witness could connect Prion and Diana together on the night of her death. \n\nA local DJ who worked at the bar Diana was spotted at on the evening of Oct 22nd. This DJ came forward 3 years later when he saw Prion's name and face was published in a local newspaper. The DJ's coworker's testimony contradicted what the DJ said in court.\n\n\nThe defense also provided an alternative suspect who Diana allegedly was looking for the night she disappeared. This man, John Mazure, had a history of alleged violence against two female coworkers. He allegedly bit one on the nose during a fight, and attempted to rape another coworker outside of work.\n\nMazure was never charged. His car was searched by police for the presence of blood early on in the investigation.\n\nDiana's sister Debbie claimed in a post on her Youtube channel years ago that their mother was looking for Diana at the 32 year old drama teachers house. They claimed that Diana was engaged in an affair with him. Years later, Debbie met the drama teacher at a karaoke event and claimed the drama teacher told her he was cleared with a polygraph test.\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMfrGha-7fQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMfrGha-7fQ)\n\nAnother suspect in the case was a convicted child molester named Gregory Scott Hatton who was arrested in June of 1993, and later sentenced to life in prison for sexually and physically abusing his girlfriends 8 month old son. The baby had multiple broken limbs, was sodomized and infected with herpes in a horrific case of child abuse.\n\nHatton's alleged connection to Diana was that he worked at the gas station across the street from the Eegees location where both Diana and John Mazure were employed, and was a friend of Diana and her sisters. Hatton was also an alleged drug dealer who used both cocaine and meth.\n\nHatton remains in prison to this day. The child's mother, Angela Leeman, who only met Hatton in early 1993, months after Diana was murdered, received a life sentence as well. The baby was adopted by a local family.\n\n[https://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/18/18-1267/109572/20190729101505187\\_18-1267%20Brief%20in%20Opposition--PDFA.pdf](https://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/18/18-1267/109572/20190729101505187_18-1267%20Brief%20in%20Opposition--PDFA.pdf)\n\nDiana's parents, brother and sister Debbie have all passed away in the years since the murder. There is no active page for Diana on Tucson's 88Crime program and it is unknown if it is being actively investigated by TPD.\n\nThe last media coverage on the case was back in 2014 when Diana's last surviving sister gave an interview with local news.\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuLzhZMPeww](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuLzhZMPeww)",

      "text": "Rachel Hansen was adopted by a local foster couple that lived on a ranch in Gilbert, Arizona. From an early age, she developed a love of horses.

      "title": "The Tragic Abby Choi Case: Hong Kong’s Shocking 2023 Dismemberment Murder",
      "text": "Hey everyone, I’ve been going down a rabbit hole on the Abby Choi dismemberment case from Hong Kong in 2023, and I can’t stop thinking about it. It’s one of those cases that’s so shocking and gruesome it sticks with you, but it also feels like it hasn’t gotten enough attention outside Asia. I figured it’d be perfect to share here for anyone into true crime or mysteries. This is a long post, but bear with me, it’s a wild, tragic story with so many layers. I’ve done my best to stick to verified facts from news reports and avoid speculation.\n\nSo, Abby Choi was a 28-year-old model, socialite, and influencer in Hong Kong. She had over 100,000 Instagram followers and was known for her glamorous posts about fashion shows and photo shoots. Her last post was on Feb 19, 2023, showing a shoot for L’Officiel Monaco. She seemed to have it all, a succesful career, four kids, and a seemingly happy life. But on February 21, 2023, she went missing after failing to pick up her 8-year-old daughter from school, which was super out of character for her. Her family reported her missing that day.\n\nThree days later, on Feb 24, police found her dismembered remains in a village house in Tai Po’s Lung Mei Tsuen, a quiet suburban area about 30 minutes from mainland China. The details are honestly horrifying. Her legs were found stuffed in a refrigerator, and her skull, ribs, and some hair were discovered in a large stainless steel soup pot mixed with carrots and radishes. Investigators believe she was killed by a blow to the head, as her skull had a large hole in it. They also found a meat grinder, electric saw, chainsaws, face shields, raincoats, and gloves in the house, which was recently rented and unfurnished, suggesting it was set up specifically for the crime. The police said the walls were covered with a sail to avoid bloodstains. It’s chilling to think about how planned this was.\n\nHere’s where it gets even crazier: the main suspects were all tied to Abby’s ex-husband, Alex Kwong Kong-chi, who was 28 at the time. Alex, his brother Anthony Kwong (31), and their father Kwong Kau (65) were charged with murder. Alex’s mother, Jenny Li (63), was charged with perverting the course of justice for allegedly destroying evidence. The motive seems to have been a financial dispute involving tens of millions of Hong Kong dollars. Apparently, Abby had bought a luxury apartment in Kadoorie Hill, a super fancy area in Kowloon Tong, and put it under her ex-father-in-law’s name. Some reports say the family was upset about her plans to sell it, though the exact details are murky. Abby and Alex had divorced years earlier but stayed on good terms, co-parenting their two kids (she had two more with her current husband, Chris Tam).\n\nThe investigation moved fast. On Feb 25, police arrested Anthony, Kwong Kau, and Jenny Li. Alex was caught the next day trying to flee Hong Kong by speedboat, carrying about $64,000 USD in cash and $510,000 worth of luxury watches. A manhunt was already underway, with Abby’s friend Pao Jo-yee and a Taiwanese influencer named Doris offering a combined HK$3 million reward for info on his whereabouts. By March 7, seven people had been arrested, including a 47-year-old woman named Ng Chi Wing, who was Kwong Kau’s mistress, and two others accused of helping Alex escape. The seventh suspect, a 29-year-old woman, was nabbed in mainland China and handed over to Hong Kong police at Shenzhen Bay Port.\n\nPolice searched hard for Abby’s missing hands and torso, even combing through the North East New Territories Landfill and checking sewage manholes near the crime scene. They never found those parts, but DNA tests in March 2023 confirmed the skull was Abby’s. Over 100 officers were involved in the search at one point. The four main suspects,, Alex, Anthony, Kwong Kau, and Jenny — appeared in Kowloon City Magistrates’ Court on Feb 27, 2023, and were denied bail. Their case was adjourned to May 8 for further evidence analysis, like phone records and forensic tests. Later, in December 2023, Alex, Anthony, and Kwong Kau got an additional charge of preventing the lawful burial of a body. Jenny’s charge was adjusted to obstructing a police investigation tied to a 2015 theft case involving Alex, which carries a lighter sentence. The trial for the three men is set for the High Court, while Jenny’s case will be in the lower District Court.\n\nWhat makes this case so haunting is how it happened in Hong Kong, a city known for being super safe with a crazy low murder rate (0.2-0.9 homicides per 100,000 people, compared to 4.4-6.5 in the US). Dismemberment cases are rare there, but this one brought up memories of other gruesome murders, like the 1999 “Hello Kitty” case where a woman’s skull was found in a plush doll. The media went wild, especially on Chinese language social media, with some comparing it to the movie Parasite because of the class dynamics and greed involved. Abby’s Instagram gained about 20,000 followers after her death, with people leaving tributes and condolences.\n\nThere are still so many questions. Why did the family go to such extreme lengths? Was it really just about money, or was there more bad blood we don’t know about? And what happened to the rest of her remains? The case is still ongoing, with no final verdicts yet, and it feels like there’s more to uncover. I’d love to hear what you all think, any theories or insights? Or maybe you’ve seen updates I missed? Let’s discuss, but please keep it respectful since this is such a tragic case. Abby’s kids and family are still dealing with the aftermath, and her school even offered counseling for students affected by the news.\n\nSources: South China Morning Post, CNN, The Independent, NBC News, The Guardian, TODAY, Forbes, Wikipedia\n\nCredible links : https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder_of_Abby_Choi\n\nhttps://edition.cnn.com/2023/02/28/asia/hong-kong-abby-choi-funeral-rites-intl-hnk\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2023/02/26/world/asia/model-murder-dismember-hong-kong.html",

      "title": "The Italian Biologist Suitcase Murder in Colombia (2024): A Gruesome Unsolved Case",
      "text": "Yo r/truecrime, I stumbled across this wild case from Colombia that’s barely gotten any buzz, and it’s giving me chills. In April 2024, a molecular biologist from Italy, Alessandro Coatti, was found dismembered in a suitcase in Santa Marta, Colombia. This ain’t your typical true crime story—it’s got drugs, gangs, and a dating app twist that’s straight outta a horror movie. I’ve been digging through news articles (mostly English ones, some translated), and here’s what I got. Sorry for any typos, I’m writting this at like 2 a.m. after a deep dive. Let’s get into it.\n\nSo, Alessandro Coatti, a 42-year-old scientist who worked in London for the Royal Society of Biology, was traveling in South America after quitting his job to volunteer in Ecuador. He lands in Santa Marta, a touristy beach town on Colombia’s Caribbean coast, on April 3, 2024. Two days later, he’s reported missing. Then, on April 6, kids playing near a stream find a black suitcase with his head, arms, and feet inside, identified by a hotel wristband. Yeah, it’s grim. Other parts of his body, like his torso, were found in a trash bag floating in the Manzanares River, miles away. Colombian police confirmed it’s a homicide, and the mayor’s offering a $12,000 reward for info on the killers, but no arrests yet\n\n\nHere’s where it gets crazy. Cops think Coatti was lured to his death via Grindr, the dating app. According to La Voce di New York, they believe a gang used a fake profile to trick him into a meetup, drugged him with scopolamine (aka “Devil’s Breath,” a scary drug that knocks you out), robbed him, and then killed and chopped him up. The dismemberment was super methodical, like the killers knew what they were doing. The Guardian says this might’ve been a mistake—Coatti could’ve been caught in a gang feud, maybe targeted as the wrong guy in a drug cartel hit. No evidence he was into anything shady, just a scientist studying animals in the area.\n\nSanta Marta’s a hot spot for tourists, but it’s got a dark side. AP News says the city had 194 murders in 2024, and a local activist (Norma Vera Salazar) told the Daily Mail there’s been 13 similar dismemberment cases in the region that year. Like, bodies stuffed in bags or suitcases, left on roads to scare people. Sounds like cartel tactics to me. Some reports, like The Independent, say police are looking into whether this ties to organ trafficking, but that’s unconfirmed and kinda speculative. Still, Coatti’s family is freaking out, thinking he might’ve been targeted for his organs, which is next-level creepy.\n\nWhat bugs me is how little we know. Coatti was last seen leaving his hotel for a night out. A hotel worker told El Tiempo (Colombian paper) he was asking about visiting Minca, a nearby village, for research. No one knows who he met or what happened next. Italian investigators are now in Colombia, working with local cops, but the trail’s cold. The Grindr angle makes it tough—fake profiles are hard to trace, and scopolamine leaves no memory. Plus, Colombia’s got a history of cartel violence, so is this just another hit, or something more personal?\n\nMy theory: this feels like a planned job. The dismemberment, the suitcase, the river dump—it’s too clean for a random crime. Maybe Coatti saw something he shouldn’t have while researching in the jungle, or maybe the Grindr thing was a setup to rob a “rich” tourist. But why cut him up like that? And why no arrests with a $12,000 reward on the table? Makes me wonder if someone’s protecting the killers, like corrupt cops or a big cartel. Idk, it’s fishy.\n\nHas anyone else heard about this? Any similar cases in Colombia or South America? If you’re from the area, what’s the vibe in Santa Marta? I saw a post on X saying this could tie to other tourist murders, but I can’t find more on that. Drop your thoughts or any leads below—I’m hooked and wanna know more. This case deserves way more attention than it’s getting.\n\nhttps://philstarlife.com/news-and-views/363781-italian-scientist-murdered-dismembered-partial-remains-found#:~:text=Police%20in%20a%20popular%20Colombian%20tourist%20town%20hunted,were%20found%20in%20a%20bag%20at%20another%20location.\n\nhttps://www.cbsnews.com/news/colombia-biologist-alessandro-coatti-dismembered-body-found-murder/",

      "title": "A 57-Year-Old Iowa Cold Case, the 1967 Slaying of Leota Camp",
      "text": "In the summer of 1967, Leota Camp was brutally slain in her home in Des Moines, IA. The crime remains a cold case, and the family still hopes for justice.\n\n**Leota Camp**\n\nLeota Mae Hodges was born on January 20, 1942, in Kirksville, MO. She grew up in Missouri, and married Lloyd Raymond \"Ray\" Camp in 1961. The couple had 3 children together, Kevin, Brenda, and Kristine. The family resided in Des Moines, IA, where Ray worked as an equipment operator for the Iowa Employment Security Commission, while Leota was a housewife. The family was shattered, when Leota was brutally and mysteriously slain in the family home on July 10, 1967.\n\n**Day of the Murder**\n\nIn the morning of July 10, 1967, Ray kissed his wife good-bye before leaving for work for the day. Later that morning when the clouds and sky cleared, 4-year-old Kevin Camp and 3-year-old Brenda Camp went to play outside in the backyard. A little while later, their mother went outside to check on them, as well as hang laundry on the clothesline.\n\nShortly after noon, Kevin and Brenda went inside for lunch. 3-month-old Kristine lay on a white blanket feeding from her bottle, but Leota was nowhere to be seen. Before long, the two older kids discovered their mother in the home's front bedroom, lying face down on the bed. To their horror, the bed was soaked in blood, and a knife was protruding from Leota's back. Kevin pulled the knife from her body, and he and Brenda ran outside, yelling \"Mommy's bleeding!\"\n\nA couple neighbors, Mary Groe and Nelle Edwards, responded to their screams and then made the horrifying discovery for themselves. In addition to being stabbed, Leota had been bound with neckties around her hands, neck, and ankles, and another necktie was stuffed in her mouth, serving as a gag. Emergency services rushed the young mother to Broadlawns Polk County Hospital (now Broadlawns Medical Center), but Leota was pronounced dead on arrival. Her husband was summoned by authorities to meet them at the hospital, where they notified him of his wife's death.\n\nDr. Leo Luka, the Polk County medical examiner, found that Leota was stabbed 4 times in the back, and all 4 wounds penetrated her lungs. He stated that she died from internal hemorrhaging, and there wasn't any evidence of sexual assault. Dr. Luka later said that he believed the killer was “a kook or pervert who got scared and panicked.”\n\n**Investigation**\n\nNeighbors reported seeing a handsome but strange man in a black Ford Mustang parked near the Camp residence around 11:00 AM on the day of the slaying. He was described as Caucasian with a good tan, 5 ' 8\" - 5' 10\" tall, brown curly hair, a stocky build, in his early - mid 20s, and wearing a brown and white plaid shirt with dark trousers. Neighbors also reported that the stranger cut diagonally across the Camp's front yard and entered the house, and left shortly before noon.\n\nDr. Luka believed that the killer entered the home while Leota was hanging clothes on the clothesline, and she returned inside sooner than expected. He also theorized that the killer threatened baby Kristine if Leota screamed or struggled, since no sign of a struggle was found.\n\nA sketch of the suspect was released after neighbors assisted Detective Robert Weichman with compiling a sketch. Within the following 4 days of public release of the suspect sketch, police received 500 calls with tips.\n\nA few weeks before her senseless death, Leota called Ray while he was work, saying she'd received an obscene phone call from a stranger. When she answered the phone, a male voice asked, \"Where you been?\"\n\nThinking it might be a friend joking around, Leota replied that she'd been feeding the baby, to which the stranger replied, \"I thought maybe you were...\", followed by an obscene expression which Ray refused to share. The couple's phone number wasn't even listed in the phone book. It was assumed to be a call to the wrong number, and no further calls were received.\n\nDespite multiple tips to police and a $2,500 reward offered by Ray Camp, no arrests have ever been made for the horrid death of Leota Camp.\n\n**Aftermath, Motive, and Suspects**\n\nSince there was no evidence of sexual assault and nothing was missing from the home, there's no known motive for Leota's murder. Her family never returned to the house; daughter Brenda still resides in the Des Moines area, but to this day has never driven past the home.\n\nWhen Brenda was reaching her 50s, she finally got a thick file about her mother's case. Around this time, she received a call from a man in Maryland who studied serial killer James \"Mike\" Mitchell DeBardeleben, who died in prison in 2011 after being charged for multiple murders and other crimes. The caller had seen the police sketch, and he said it resembled Mike. Unfortunately, the file hasn't revealed anything useful to Brenda.\n\nAnother neighbor of the Camp family, Carol Wuetherich, believes that she was the intended victim. On the day of Leota's slaying, Carol left home to purchase a new car, leaving her kids with a babysitter, who informed her of the news when she returned home. Carol is convinced the whole thing was a mistake made by a hitman, who was supposed to come after her. Carol stated, \"I had a gut feeling my life was in danger. I went to a dog pound and got a German Shepherd for protection, that is how afraid I was.\"\n\nRay Camp passed away in the summer of 2024. His funeral took place in West Des Moines, IA, and he was buried in Scobee Cemetery in Pollock, MO, next to Leota.

The death was initially ruled accidental after Sharon claimed that her 2-year-old daughter had shot her while playing with the gun, but later testimony revealed marital problems and extramarital affairs on her part.\n\nSharon met her lover Walter Jones when she bought a car with money from her husband's life insurance and the sale of their house, and tried unsuccessfully to convince him to leave his wife, Patricia Jones. In May 1960, Patricia disappeared after a date with Sharon. \n\nIn 1960, Sharon was acquitted of Patricia's murder, but was convicted of her husband's murder in 1962, but the Missouri Supreme Court overturned that conviction due to improper jury selection. Kinne was released on bail, then fled to Mexico with a new boyfriend in 1964, becoming involved in the murder of Francisco Ordonez a few days later. She escaped from a Mexican prison in 1969.\n\nBefore and after her escape, Kinne gave several interviews and became known as \"La Pistolera\", and it was through a pistol obtained last year that the investigation received new developments.\n\nRecently, an anonymous tip led authorities to confirm that she died of natural causes on January 21, 2022, in Alberta, Canada. During a press conference, Sergeant Dustin Love of the Jackson County Sheriff's Office in Kansas City, Missouri, said that Kinne had been living under the name Diedra Glabus. The investigation revealed that Kinne had married several times over the years, including in 1970 to a man named James Glabus in Los Angeles, raising families under several different identities. The final identification of the identity came through a comparison of fingerprints collected at the funeral with those previously recorded during the investigation of Kinne's crimes.\n\nSource: \n\nhttps://www.google.com/amp/s/www.cbsnews.com/amp/news/sharon-kinne-murders-vanished-mexican-prison-1969/\n\nhttps://www.google.com/amp/s/www.cbc.ca/amp/1.7446150",

      "text": "Joël Le Scouarnec (born in 1950) was initially sentenced to 15 years in prison on 2020, three years after being arrested for sexually abusing a six-year-old neighbour; further investigations found three other victims: a four-year-old patient and two of his own nieces, who were also four when the abuse started.\n\nDuring the investigation over his abuse of his neighbours, Le Scouarnec's home is searched by police and his diaries are found, along with items such as wigs and sex toys. On the harddrive of his computers, child porn is found, along videos of hangings and beheadings, alongside videos featuring zoosadism.\n\nMeanwhile, his diaries, held during 30 years and written on thousands of pages. For exemple, the entry for April 10, 2004 at 8:45 AM read as such:\n\n>In the bathroom in Lorient. While smoking my morning cigarette, I reflected on the fact that I'm a major pervert. I'm an exhibitionist, a voyeur, a sadist, a masochist, a scatologist, a fetishist, and a pedophile all at once. And I'm very happy about it.\n\nGendarmerie officer Benoît Bordenave reported that his men had difficulties to get over this reading.\n\nAlready in 2004, he was flagged to French authorities by the FBI fot child pornography on the dark web, which resulted the next year to a four-year suspended prison sentence without ban on working with children, thereby keeping him working as surgeon.\n\nIn his diaries, he described several incidents of bestiality involving dogs and cooking dishes with bodily excretions which were then served to his household among other instances of sexual perversion. He also listed most of his victims, describing how he sometimes abused four patients in the same day or the same patient six times at different hours.\n\nOut of his 299 recorded victims, 256 were children under 15, with an average age of 11, with ages ranging from below 1 up to 70.\n\nOn May 26, he has been sentenced to the maximum penalty: 20 years in prison. However, as he confessed and admitted the crimes, the court didn't mandate post-sentence civil commitment.\n\nSome criticism has been levied against the medical boards which didn't remove him his license, even after his convictions for CSAM.\n\nSources:\n\n* [Ex-surgeon tells French court he used status to sexually abuse children](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/mar/04/ex-surgeon-joel-le-scouarnec-tells-french-court-he-used-status-to-sexually-abuse-children)\n* [Former surgeon admits to victimising granddaughter during France's biggest child abuse trial](https://www.france24.com/en/france/20250228-french-former-surgeon-admits-to-abusing-granddaughter)\n* [‘My paedophile letters’: French surgeon to stand trial accused of abusing 299 child patients](https://www.theguardian.com/society/2025/feb/22/my-paedophile-letters-french-surgeon-to-stand-trial-accused-of-abusing-299-patients-mostly-children)\n* [ « Je ne m’interdisais rien » : au procès de Joël Le Scouarnec, l’effroi devant l’ampleur de ses activités pédocriminelles](https://www.nouvelobs.com/justice/20250305.OBS101067/je-ne-m-interdisais-rien-au-proces-de-joel-le-scouarnec-l-effroi-devant-l-ampleur-de-ses-activites-pedocriminelles.html) (in French)\n* [Au procès Le Scouarnec, l’horreur minutieuse des « carnets noirs »](https://www.lemonde.fr/societe/article/2025/03/06/au-proces-de-le-scouarnec-l-horreur-minutieuse-des-carnets-noirs_6576775_3224.html) (paywalled, in French)\n* [Former surgeon Le Scouarnec handed 20-year sentence in France's worst child abuse case](https://www.lemonde.fr/en/france/article/2025/05/28/former-surgeon-le-scouarnec-handed-20-year-sentence-in-france-s-worst-child-abuse-case_6741759_8.html)\n* [A French Pedophile Doctor Abused Hundreds in His Care.

      "title": "The brutal case of Daniel Zamudio",
      "text": "Daniel Zamudio was born in Chile on August 3,1987. The second child of a family of four, he came out as a gay at 17. A regular guy into parties and Britney Spears and who dreamed on becoming a father one day who lived with his mom and grandma. He worked on a clothing store hoping to finish studying, save some money and studying modelling.\n\nHe was last seen by his mom on March 2, 2012, although it would be confirmed later that he went to work on his usual schedule from 14:00 to 19:00. His last whereabouts where at a local cybercafe on wich he stayed until 22:00.\n\nAt the early mornings of March 3, 2012 he was found by a local security guard of San Borja park in a catastrophic state. Without any identification he was send to a nearby hospital urgently.\n\nAmong his wounds were:\n\n>Severe TBI, open fracture of the left tibia and fibula, aspiration pneumonia, regressing rhabdomyolysis, multiple blunt and sharp trauma to the facial area, chest, back, and limbs. Cigarette burns on the body and swastika-shaped cuts on the chest and back were other characteristics of the sad and discouraging condition of the young man, who had to be placed in an induced coma.\n\nThe attackers were:\n\nAlejandro Áxel Angulo Tapia (26),\n\nPatricio Iván Ahumada Garay (25),\n\nRaúl Alfonso López Fuentes (25),\n\nFabián Alexis Mora Mora (19).\n\nRaul Lopez claimed he kicked him a few times on his head and legs while mentioning the sexual orientation of the victim. He continued describing how the victim was profundly bleeding and unconscious which made Alejandro broke a bottle on Daniel's head and then Patricio Ahumada come with the neck of the bottle to mark Daniel's body with an swastika.\n\nAlejandro then took a heavy stone and threw it a couple of times on his stomach, then on his head until Fabián took the lead and threw it on Daniel's legs until, according to them, his legs cracked as if were chicken bones. Afterwards, they left the scene.\n\nIt wouldn't be until 2 am of Sunday that Daniel's identity would be known and the family would be informed. Sadly, the news weren't encouraging. If he survived, he would suffer from brain damage. Finally, Daniel after nearly a month of struggle and pain, died on March 27.\n\nThese people didn't feel ashamed of what they did. Angulo sister recalled how he boasted about beating a faggot and breaking his legs. In fact, Angulo carried her sister purse at the time of the attacks which had traces of blood that would be confirmed to be of Daniel.\n\nOf all the perpetrators, only Fabián didn't have a criminal record. Angulo had been detained twice for robbery, Lopez for violent acts (unspecified as far as I know) but the worst was Ahumada. Nine detentions since 16 when he was caught with a baseball bat modified with nails. From then on, robberies, violence with knives and threats would increase his record. In fact, he had been in jail for five years for a brutal robbery with violence.\n\nAhumada had his conviction reduced thanks to apparent good behaviour. A week before the crime he had been given the benefit of going out the weekends. During the investigations it would reveal that two psychological tests adviced against his release.\n\nAccording to them, Daniel had been sleeping in the park, until the group woke him up, he talked with Lopez confiding his fears about being beaten up by neonazis who hated him for his sexuality. The group left him for a while when they went to buy rum. After seeing Daniel asleep, Alejandro came and started the beating. He even peed on Daniel while they drank and laughed about their actions.\n\nAhumada received a life sentence, Angulo received 15 years, Lopez, 15 years and Mora seven years which he completed in 2016.\n\nAfter all these years, Ahumada remains the most violent of the group despites finishing some studies. Mora was the only one that was released. A few years later he was interviewed on TVN where he didn't feel remorse by his actions. For some bizarre reasons, the show decided to confront Daniel's father with the killer just for him to claim that he's not sure about what really happened and that he left as soon as the brutal violence started, contradicting his statement during the trial. Even claiming:\n\n>The truth is, I punched his son, but it was because he groped me\n\nTo further add:\n\n>I went to jail unjustly; I only punched him, that was my crime. I didn't do anything else. They went, they told me (...) I didn't see anything that those three did to him.\n\nNevertheless, he remains free.\n\nDaniel's brutal death caused an inmense reaction across Chile against homophobia and his name lives on the law that punishes lgbt discrimination in Chile.\n\nSources: [http://movilh.cl/documentacion/Daniel\\_Zamudio\\_Informe\\_Movilh\\_1013.pdf](http://movilh.cl/documentacion/Daniel_Zamudio_Informe_Movilh_1013.pdf)\n\n[https://www.ciperchile.cl/2012/04/04/crimen-de-zamudio-devela-errores-de-gendarmeria-que-en-tres-meses-terminaron-con-dos-homicidios-y-una-violacion/](https://www.ciperchile.cl/2012/04/04/crimen-de-zamudio-devela-errores-de-gendarmeria-que-en-tres-meses-terminaron-con-dos-homicidios-y-una-violacion/)\n\n[https://www.24horas.cl/nacional/homicidio-de-zamudio-el-antes-y-despues-de-un-caso-historico-908560](https://www.24horas.cl/nacional/homicidio-de-zamudio-el-antes-y-despues-de-un-caso-historico-908560)\n\n[https://www.emol.com/noticias/nacional/2012/05/16/540737/brutal-relato-de-imputado-del-caso-zamudio-le-pegaron-punzazos-y-lo-orinaron-publicar-a-las-7-am.html](https://www.emol.com/noticias/nacional/2012/05/16/540737/brutal-relato-de-imputado-del-caso-zamudio-le-pegaron-punzazos-y-lo-orinaron-publicar-a-las-7-am.html)\n\n[https://resumen.cl/articulos/caso-zamudio-se-cumplen-nueve-anos-desde-el-brutal-ataque-de-odio-hacia-daniel-zamudio-por-parte-de-grupo-neonazi](https://resumen.cl/articulos/caso-zamudio-se-cumplen-nueve-anos-desde-el-brutal-ataque-de-odio-hacia-daniel-zamudio-por-parte-de-grupo-neonazi)\n\n[https://www.eldinamo.cl/actualidad/2020/09/04/programa-de-tvn-que-enfrento-a-padre-de-daniel-zamudio-y-condenado-por-el-caso-levanta-criticas-en-redes-sociales/](https://www.eldinamo.cl/actualidad/2020/09/04/programa-de-tvn-que-enfrento-a-padre-de-daniel-zamudio-y-condenado-por-el-caso-levanta-criticas-en-redes-sociales/)",

      "text": "William \"Bill\" Leasure, dubbed the \"LA killer cop\" in the press was released on parole yesterday, March 5, 2025.  \n\nLast May, the LA Times profiled Leasure in an article titled \"L.A.’s dirtiest cop: A mild-mannered traffic officer who moonlighted as a hit man.\" [https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2024-05-15/criminal-record-the-crimes-of-william-leasure](https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2024-05-15/criminal-record-the-crimes-of-william-leasure)  Leasure had been in custody for 38 years, since his arrest in 1986.\n\nAt the time of his arrest, Leasure was a traffic cop in LA who avoided violence and preferred to lecture traffic violators rather than issue tickets. Called \"Mild Bill\" by his more aggressive colleagues, they were shocked when he was arrested for participating in, and at times, heading, a yacht theft ring. Post-arrest searches of Leasure's property revealed an extensive collection of stolen vehicles as well as other stolen property later identified by the owners of the stolen yachts.  At the time of his arrest he was married to an L.A. County attorney who prosecuted criminal cases.. Apparently they are no longer married.\n\nLaw enforcement had Leasure dead to rights on the theft charges, but while he was in pretrial detention on those charges, investigators pursued accusations that \"Mild Bill\" was responsible for masterminding three contract murders in L.A. in 1980 and 1981. Leasure's chief accuser was none other than the admitted triggerman in two of the murders, [who got the deal of a century for his testimony against Leasure: complete immunity from three murder charges](https://murderpedia.org/male.L/l/leasure-william.htm).\n\nLeasure had been granted parole by a hearing panel in 2020, but the decision was reversed by Gov. Newsom on the ground that Leasure had not yet fully confronted the \"causative factors\" of his crime.   The 2020 decision on Leasure starts on page 42: [https://www.gov.ca.gov/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/2020-Executive-Report-on-Parole-Review-Decisions.pdf](https://www.gov.ca.gov/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/2020-Executive-Report-on-Parole-Review-Decisions.pdf)\n\nLeasure was granted parole again in late 2024 by a hearing panel. This time, Gov. Newsom referred the panel decision to an en banc hearing, where the panel decision was upheld in February.  Gov. Newsom took no action following the en banc affirmance, thus Leasure was processed for release.\n\nDespite the evidence against him at trial, Leasure dug in his heels and refused to plead to either the theft or the murder charges. He couldn't be a criminal, he argued, as he is “the nicest, quietest, mildest guy you’ll ever want to meet.” (as quoted by author Edward Humes in his 1993 book, \"Murderer with a Badge: The Secret Life of a Rogue Cop.\"   [https://diversionbooks.com/books/murderer-with-a-badge/](https://diversionbooks.com/books/murderer-with-a-badge/) ). \n\nBut after a divided jury voted 10-2 for conviction on the murders, and on the eve of another trial, Leasure agreed to plead \"no contest\" to two of the homicides.\n\nAuthor Humes reported that Leasure was aware that his refusal to accept responsibility could keep him in prison much longer than the 15-year minimum prior to parole eligibility. According to Addison “Bud” Arce, one of the detectives who put Leasure behind bars (quoted in the L.A. Times article), if Mild Bill had been willing to accept responsibility for his crimes, he probably would have been released on parole years ago. \n\nThe image below is from the VINE system:  [https://vinelink.vineapps.com/person-detail/offender/1728004;tabIndexToSelect=0](https://vinelink.vineapps.com/person-detail/offender/1728004;tabIndexToSelect=0)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ahcoz18ft2ne1.png?width=541&format=png&auto=webp&s=392a22af1eaa9ef9f1f2f86cbd410f1ed0bdad99",

Despite that, the board granted his parole request twice, only to have the decision reversed by California Governor Gavin Newsom on the ground that Leasure had not yet fully confronted the \"causative factors of his crime.\" The 2020 decision on Leasure starts on page 42: [https://www.gov.ca.gov/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/2020-Executive-Report-on-Parole-Review-Decisions.pdf](https://www.gov.ca.gov/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/2020-Executive-Report-on-Parole-Review-Decisions.pdf)\n\nIn September of this year, the parole board once again approved release for Leasure, now 78 years old. Apparently, Governor Newsom's review is still pending. Perhaps Mild Bill will have a Merry Christmas or a Happy New Year this year. \n\nLEASURE, WILLIAM,ERNEST\t\n\nH21376\tVideo Conference Los Angeles PC 3041.2\t\n\n09/10/24, Subsequent Suitability Hearing, Grant",

      "text": "Between the early 1990s and 2008, bestselling author Jude Deveraux was scammed out of more than $17 million by a South Florida psychic named Rose Marks. Jude was dealing with infertility, depression, and relationship issues when she first met Marks, who convinced her she was cursed and needed spiritual cleansing.\n\nMarks told her to hand over money, gold, and gifts so they could be “cleansed” and promised they’d be returned. She said Jude’s future child was spiritually blocked, and after Jude gave birth to her son Sam, she believed the psychic’s rituals had worked.\n\nThen tragedy struck—her son died in a horseback riding accident at age 8. Marks said his soul was trapped and that more rituals were needed to help him “cross over.” At one point, she told Jude to put a million dollars in a suitcase for a ritual. The money vanished. Jude eventually signed over power of attorney and became totally dependent on Rose and her family. The emotional grip was intense.\n\nWhen Jude finally tried to pull away, the threats started—spiritual danger, illness, Sam’s soul being lost forever. It was only when Jude found the courage to speak up that the truth unraveled. She went to the FBI and later helped them build their case. She even testified in court.\n\nIn 2013, Rose Marks was convicted on 14 federal counts, including wire fraud, money laundering, and tax evasion. She was sentenced to 10 years in prison. It’s one of the biggest psychic fraud cases in U.S. history.\n\nIt’s easy to say “I’d never fall for that,” but when you’re grieving and vulnerable, people like Marks know exactly how to twist the knife.\n\n**Discussion points:**\n• How do scammers like this gain such powerful control over people?\n• Should belief-based fraud be treated differently under the law?\n• What protections should exist for emotionally vulnerable people?\n\nSources:\n• https://abcnews.go.com/US/author-jude-deveraux-suicidal-losing-20-million-fortune/story?id=20324545\n• https://www.sun-sentinel.com/2013/08/27/jude-deveraux-testifies-she-was-scammed-by-psychic-rose-marks/",

      "text": "In 1987, Gray went on a burglary spree, and ransacked at least five trailer homes and apartments. He mostly took only took cash or jewelry from the affected residences and ignored the tenants’ credit cards. While breaking into one of the targeted trailer homes, Gray sodomized 87 year old Ruby Reed, and crushed her throat with a plank of wood. Before fleeing, Gray snatched jewelry from jewelry boxes and at least $20 from her purse. Reed’s daughter found her lying on a bedroom floor tied up with nylon stockings and covered in blood, and she was declared dead by paramedics at the scene. A few days after Reed's murder, Gray was captured and arrested in a botched burglary of an apartment.\n\nHe had other prior convictions of burglary, including a 1983 incident that involved him molesting a 64 year old woman and orally copulating her 8 year old granddaughter in an apartment. According to court records, the grandmother tried climbing out of a window for help as he was sodomizing her granddaughter in a bedroom. Gray quickly grabbed the woman to prevent her escape, but accidentally pushed her out after she bit him. The grandmother broke her leg on impact, and Gray fled with $370 in cash and her jewelry. For the incident, Gray received a six year term for burglary on a plea deal, but was released after serving less than four years in prison.\n\nAfter three years of proceedings, Gray was sentenced to death by the state of California for Reed’s murder. Before an execution date could be set, Gray died of unspecified natural causes in his cell in 2013.\n\nSources:\n\n1.https://scocal.stanford.edu/opinion/people-v-gray-33560\n\n2.https://law.justia.com/cases/california/court-of-appeal/3d/214/545.html\n\n3.https://web.archive.org/web/20150926053215/https://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-ln-death-row-inmate-dead-in-cell-20130506-story.html",

      "title": "France: Dominique Pélicot has been sentenced to 20 years in Avignon for inviting dozens of strangers to rape his drugged and sedated wife",
      "text": "Gisèle Pélicot met Dominique Pélicot in 1971 and married him two years later. Both worked in EDF, the state power monopoly, and had three children, today aged from 34 to 47. The household lived in Villiers-sur-Marne (Val-de-Marne) until retirement, in the 2010s. Starting from this time, Gidèle suffered more and more of memory losses and drowsiness, going to the doctors, who merely found that she suffered from overwork due to caring for her grandchildren; such issues became more severe when the couple moved to Mazas in 2011.\n\nOn September 12, 2020, in Carpentras,  a supermarket security guard arrested Dominique Pélicot, 71, for filming up women’s skirts.\n\nCondoms and a camera were found in his pocket; Dominique Pélicot claimed that he had “acted on impulses” he couldn't control.\n\nPolice seized his computers and found 20 000 sexual pics and videos: naked photos of Gisèle Pélicot, his wife, and videos of a sleeping Gisèle being raped by male strangers with titles such as \"ABUSE /night of 09 06 2020 with charly 6th time\" (\"\\*ABUS /nuit du 09 06 2020 avec charly 6eme fois\\*\"), dating from 2011 to 2020. 92 instances of rapes were counted by police. Nude pictures of his daughter Caroline Darian were equally found.\n\nAdditionally, records of discussions were found on Skype and Coco (the latter being an unmoderated platform infamous for allowing unlawful content such as paedophilia, child prostitution and drug trafficking and which was closed on June).\n\nFor exemple, in a forum \"Without her knowledge\" (*A l'insu*), when a member ask \"Do you still have her tested from time to time? Safe clean?\" and another asks \"She doesn't suspect anything?\", he answers that \"No, she puts it down to fatigue\", writing to another that \"You're like me, you like rape mode.\" (While some asked about STI testing, HIV-positive Romain Vandevelde still raped her six times without protection).\n\nOn this forum, a nurse gave Dominique advice on how to use Temesta; Jean-Pierre Maréchal proposed him to rape his wife too, resulting in both being also tried for these rapes, commited from 2015 to 2020.\n\nStrict rules were set by Dominique to the rapists: no perfume, no tobacco, hand-washing and heating themselves in order to not wake up Gisèle.\n\nOnce interrogated by police, Dominique confessed.\n\nAlthough 72 suspects were in the case, 50 persons, in addition to Dominique, are tried for raping Gisèle; most of them are regular people, working as journalists, police officers, soldiers, firefighters or prison wardens, whse ages range from 24 to 71. Most enjoyed excellent reputations. So numerous were the rapists that the courtroom had to be reamenaged to hold everyone.\n\nMost of the accused claim that they didn't knew that Gisèle didn't consent or thought that it was a sex game; other said that Dominique consented for her: one of them said that \"As long as the husband was present, there was no rape.\"\n\nDominique has been sentenced by the Criminal Court of Avignon (since 2021, in France, Criminal Courts can judge felonies not punished by more than 30 years; they don't have juries) to 20 years of prison, essentially a life sentence given his age.\n\nAll of the rest of the defendants were found guilty and sentenced to term ranging from three years (among them two suspended) to 15 years. Among them:\n\n* Romain Vandevelde, 63, has been sentenced to 15 years for rape\n* Cédric Grassot, 50, was sentenced to 12 years. He also was tried and convicted for possesing child porn\n* Jean-Pierre Maréchal, 63, was sentenced to 12 years. He also had his wife raped by his friends.\n* Charly Arbo, 30, raped Gisèle six times, including once on her 66th birthday. He also proposed drugging and raping his own mother with Dominique but it came to naught. Was sentenced to 13 years\n* Quentin Hennebert, 34, former prison warden, was sentenced to 7 years\n* Nizar Hamida, 40, went to Mazan as \"bachelor party\". Already sentenced for domestic violence, he was sentenced to 10 years\n* Thierry Postat, 61, has been sentenced to 12 years. During the investigation, child porn was found, along with a dialogue with an unknown partner who proposed to \"share\" his granddaughter with him\n* Hassan Ouamou, 30, has been sentenced *in absentia* to 12 years\n\nAs of today, Gisèle suffers from four STD, PTSD and had suicidal thoughts. She divorced from Dominique and their children doesn't want to deal anymore with their father.\n\nDominique Pélicot is also under investigation for the 1991 rape-murder of Sophie Narme, 23, in Paris, and the 1999 attempted rape of Estella B., his DNA having been found on Estella.\n\nSources:\n\n* [Daughter leaves French court during man’s trial over recruiting dozens to rape wife](https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/sep/03/daughter-leaves-courtroom-during-frenchman-trial-wife)\n* [Man, 50 others go on trial in France for rape of drugged wife](https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/man-50-others-go-trial-france-rape-drugged-wife-2024-09-03/)\n* [Procès des viols de Mazan : qu’est-ce que Coco.gg, le site de rencontre qu’utilisait Dominique Pélicot pour recruter des hommes qui violaient son épouse ?](https://www.ladepeche.fr/2024/09/03/proces-des-viols-de-mazan-quest-ce-que-cocogg-le-site-de-rencontre-quutilisait-dominique-pelicot-pour-recruter-des-hommes-qui-violaient-son-epouse-12173951.php) (in French)\n* [Vaucluse : ce que l’on sait de l'affaire des viols subis pendant dix ans par une femme, droguée par son mari](https://www.francetvinfo.fr/societe/violences-faites-aux-femmes/vaucluse-ce-que-l-on-sait-de-l-affaire-des-viols-subis-pendant-dix-ans-par-une-femme-droguee-par-son-mari_4789807.html) (in French)\n* [Affaire des viols de Mazan : le procès d’un long supplice](https://www.liberation.fr/societe/police-justice/affaire-des-viols-de-mazan-le-proces-dun-long-supplice-20240901_5KQYBPCTQNDAZN64LZMMYEZWPU/) (in French)\n* [Les autres « affaires Dominique P. », accusé d’avoir drogué sa femme pour qu’elle soit violée par d’autres hommes](https://www.lemonde.fr/societe/article/2024/09/02/les-autres-affaires-dominique-p-accuse-d-avoir-drogue-sa-femme-pour-qu-elle-soit-violee-par-d-autres-hommes_6302049_3224.html) (in French)\n* [Au procès des viols de Mazan, le cas à part de Jean-Pierre M., accusé d'avoir drogué et violé son épouse avec Dominique Pelicot ](https://www.francetvinfo.fr/faits-divers/affaire-des-viols-de-mazan/au-proces-des-viols-de-mazan-le-cas-a-part-de-jean-pierre-m-qui-a-drogue-et-viole-son-epouse-avec-dominique-pelicot_6776155.html)(in French)\n* [Procès de Mazan : son mari se fournissait chez Dominique Pélicot pour droguer sa femme, Véronique, une autre victime de viol sous soumission chimique témoigne](https://www.lindependant.fr/2024/09/12/proces-de-mazan-son-mari-se-fournissait-chez-dominique-pelicot-pour-droguer-sa-femme-veronique-une-autre-victime-de-viol-sous-soumission-chimique-12192491.php) (in French)\n* [The anonymous, anything-goes forum at the heart of the Pelicot rape case](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/oct/12/coco-website-pelicot-rape-trial)\n* [I too may have been assaulted, says ex-partner of Dominique Pelicot co-defendant](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/sep/23/dominique-pelicot-trial-new-defendants)\n* [Gisèle Pelicot rape trial: husband jailed for 20 years as all 51 men found guilty](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/dec/19/gisele-pelicot-trial-husband-jailed-for-20-years-as-all-51-men-found-guilty)\n* [Procès des viols de Mazan : de 3 à 20 ans, retrouvez les condamnations des 51 hommes accusés](https://www.laprovence.com/article/faits-divers-justice/2061545627741214/proces-des-viols-de-mazan-de-3-a-20-ans-retrouvez-les-condamnations-des-51-hommes-accuses) (in French)",

      "text": "On Monday, November 13, 2006, at approximately 6:15 AM, Gerald “Jerry” Dhamer, 48, was shot and killed in the driveway of his home in Park Ridge, Illinois. He was preparing to leave for work when he was ambushed by a masked gunman wielding a 12-gauge shotgun. The attacker said nothing, fired multiple rounds at close range, and fled on foot. Nothing was stolen. The murder appeared clean, silent, and professional.\n\nDhamer was a co-owner of Dhamer Mechanical Industries, a successful plumbing company. He was a father of four with no known enemies, criminal ties, or major disputes. The brutality and precision of the shooting stunned both his family and the Park Ridge community.\n\nDespite efforts by local police and the FBI, the case remains unsolved nearly two decades later.\n\n⸻\n\nKEY FACTS\n\nVictim: Gerald “Jerry” Dhamer, 48 years old\n\nDate: Monday, November 13, 2006\n\nTime: ~6:15 AM\n\nLocation: Driveway of his home, Park Ridge, IL\n\nWeapon: 12-gauge shotgun\n\nShooter: Masked, silent, escaped on foot\n\nMotive: Unknown. Robbery ruled out. Execution-style killing.\n\nReward: $50,000 for information leading to an arrest\n\n⸻\n\nINVESTIGATION NOTES & THEORIES\n\nProfessional Hit\n\nMethodical approach and lack of evidence suggest a professional assassin.\n\nVictim’s known routines may have been tracked.\n\nNo security camera footage or eyewitnesses directly identified the shooter.\n\nMistaken Identity\n\nSpeculation exists that the intended target may have been Salvatore Cautadello, a known mob figure and alleged informant who lived nearby.\n\nThe shooter may have confused addresses or vehicle models.\n\nOrganized Crime Link\n\nCautadello had ties to the Chicago Outfit and was known to be cooperating with law enforcement at the time.\n\nTheory: A mob enforcer sent to silence a “rat” hit the wrong man due to a logistical error.\n\nDisguised Personal Motive\n\nSome investigators considered whether someone close to Jerry used a staged professional hit to hide a personal motive.\n\nBusiness dealings, insurance, or personal grievances were all examined but never publicly substantiated.\n\nInside Knowledge\n\nThe killer seemed to know Jerry’s early morning routine.\n\nThe time and place of attack suggest careful planning rather than opportunity.\n\nLack of Forensic Evidence\n\nNo weapon recovered.\n\nNo shell casings found; possibly cleaned up or picked up by killer.\n\nNo fingerprints, DNA, or identifiable clothing fibers left behind.\n\n⸻\n\nCOMMUNITY IMPACT\n\nThe Park Ridge community was shaken, as violent crime is rare in the area.\n\nDhamer was well-liked and respected; his death generated local and regional media coverage but few credible leads.\n\n⸻\n\nHave you heard local rumors about this case? Do you have thoughts on the theories? Do you live in the area or remember something that never made it into the news?\n\nConsider these questions:\n\nCould this have been a mob-related mistaken identity case?\n\nWas it an inside job with professional staging?\n\nCould someone local have helped the killer escape unnoticed?\n\nAny theories, recollections, or even vague rumors could help rekindle attention to this case.\n\n⸻\n\nSOURCE LINKS\n\nhttps://abc7chicago.com/archive/7325950\n\nhttps://www.thechicagosyndicate.com/2006/12/plumber-victim-of-dyslexic-mob-hit-man.html\n\nhttps://groups.google.com/g/alt.true-crime/c/MSXEZOAccAg\n\nhttps://www.cbsnews.com/chicago/news/cold-case-gerald-dhamer-2006-park-ridge-murder-reward/\n\nhttps://www.chicagotribune.com/suburbs/park-ridge\n\nhttps://www.newspapers.com/article/chicago-tribune-dhamer-murder-coverage/89354039/\n\nhttps://isp.illinois.gov/ColdCases\n\n⸻\n\nLet’s not let this case remain forgotten.

      "text": "I learned about this case on the show Deadly Women (S7 E17) and it’s been stuck in my mind ever since so I wanted to do a write up on it.\n\nBackground:\n\n17 year old Katrina Sarkissian had everything a teenage girl could wish for. She was blessed with both beauty and money. Katrina lived in a wealthy Los Angeles neighborhood with her mother Angelique Bernstein and her younger half-sister, 15 year old Sabrina Bernstein. By all accounts Angelique spoiled her daughters rotten and over-indulged them with all the luxuries money can buy. \n\nGrowing up Katrina was a fairly normal child, but by the Eighth grade things started to take a turn for the worse. She became increasingly angry, started missing class and having “confrontational episodes” with other students. She also began abusing drugs and alcohol. \n\nShortly after withdrawing from Harvard-Westlake, the most prestigious school in the city, Katrina was sent to a therapeutic residential facility in Utah where she was involved in more altercations with girls and attempted to run away. Her mother decided to bring her back home for good, despite the schools recommended stay of 9 months to a year. After a therapist recommended that Katrina attend Alcoholics Anonymous meetings, her mother responded that she would not allow her daughter to associate with “low life”. \n\nEventually Katrina dropped out of high school at the age of 16. While being “homeschooled” by Angelique, she would sleep all day and party all night. She was put on antidepressants for a “sleep disorder”, when in all likelihood she just wanted to go to clubs and parties every night. She had also recently begun sneaking out of the house and engaging in indiscriminate sexual activity. Katrina had even assaulted her own mother on multiple occasions in the family home. It seems that Katrina was a textbook case of a child who needed parental guidance, but was instead allowed to do whatever she wanted. \n\nOn the other side of town, 15 year old Deanna Maran was the antithesis of Katrina. She was a student at Santa Monica High where she excelled academically and had many friends. Deanna was extraordinarily gifted at writing. She was also a great athlete and played on the schools volleyball, track, and water polo teams. Deanna came from a loving family. Both of her parents were hardworking immigrants. Her friends called her “daring Deanna” because she was known to always stand up for what is right, which sadly may have been her downfall.\n\nEvents of November 17-18, 2001:\n\nOn November 17, 2001 high schoolers from all over town arrived at a party in Westwood. No parents were home. Approximately 40 high school aged kids flooded the house and yard, drinking alcohol and smoking dope with no adult supervision. What could possibly go wrong? Deanna Maran hopped off a bus with a couple of her male friends. Sabrina Bernstein also arrived at the party with her friends. Deanna soon noticed Sabrina chasing a boy through the yard and breaking potted plants. This didn’t sit well with Deanna. She confronted Sabrina about it and told her to chill out and stop breaking stuff. The two girls got into a brief shoving match leaving Sabrina on the ground and in tears. \n\nHumiliated, Sabrina went to a corner of the yard and called her big sister Katrina.  As the party began breaking up, Deanna and others waited in front of the house for their rides. Suddenly a white car pulled up and out marched Katrina. “Who pushed my sister?” she shouted. Deanna bravely raised her hand and said “it was me”. The confrontation remained verbal for several minutes until onlookers began chanting for the two girls to fight. \n\nKatrina quickly punched Deanna in the chest, and the sisters ran back to Katrina’s car and drove off. Deanna stumbled and leaned against a tree, staring off into space and gasping for air. Once the terrified teen witnesses realized Deanna was bleeding they didn’t call 911. Instead they panicked and drove her to Santa Monica hospital where she was pronounced dead. \n\nNone of the witnesses ever saw a knife during the confrontation, how was this possible? Authorities later determined that Katrina had stabbed Deanna through the heart with a T-shaped punch knife, a knife that’s purpose is to be concealed in someone’s hand. \n\nThe next day at around 2 pm, Katrina Sarkissian and Sabrina Bernstein were picked up from their home by 2 detectives from the LAPD. During their interrogation, Katrina’s speech began to slur and she told the detectives that she felt sleepy. It didn’t take long before Katrina suddenly collapsed and stopped breathing. Little did the detectives know that Katrina wasn’t just evading their questions, she was committing suicide. \n\nOne can only imagine this young girl sitting in her room, feeling so tormented by whatever occurred at that party in her mind, that she decides to down an entire bottle of pills. Consumed with guilt, Katrina had taken 43 of her prescribed antidepressant pills that morning. Half that dose is lethal. And just like her victim Deanna, no one could save Katrina. \n\nWithin a span of not even 24 hours, two sets of parents have lost their daughters. It’s truly unimaginable. Nobody could imagine that what started out as a typical Saturday night would end with two girls dead. All the warning signs were there, yet Katrina’s rage was never dealt with, and it ended in an unspeakable tragedy.\n\nSources:\n\nhttps://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-2002-feb-02-me-coroner2-story.html",

      "text": "In 2011, Philadelphia teacher [Ellen Greenberg](https://people.com/crime/teacher-stabbed-20-times-2011-death-ruled-suicide-da-reopening-investigation/), 27, was found dead from [more than 20 stab wounds](https://people.com/crime/pennsylvania-teacher-death-ruled-suicide-family-wants-homicide/). Although authorities initially labeled her death as a homicide, the ruling was eventually changed to a suicide, shocking her parents who have long held the belief that Ellen was murdered.\n\nNow, the Pennsylvania Supreme Court has agreed to hear Ellen's parents' argument over her manner of death ruling, [Fox News](https://www.foxnews.com/us/suicide-ruling-teachers-20-stab-wounds-may-reexamined-family-secures-potential-major-win) and [CBS News](https://www.cbsnews.com/philadelphia/news/ellen-greenberg-philadelphia-pennsylvania-murder-suicide-manayunk/) report.\n\nEllen's parents, Joshua Greenberg and Sandee Greenberg, have long believed that Ellen died by homicide and that the investigation was mishandled. They have fought for years to have suicide removed as the manner of death on Ellen's death certificate. Despite losing past legal battles regarding the matter, they may have a chance now to get the ruling officially reexamined.\n\n\"They \\[judges\\] have blatantly said the investigation was faulty on the part of the police, on the part of the medical examiner, on the part of the district attorney,\" [Joshua told CBS News](https://www.cbsnews.com/philadelphia/news/ellen-rae-greenberg-death-court-ruling/) in 2023.\n\nAccording to CBS News, the arguments that will be presented to the Pennsylvania Supreme Court will determine if \"executors and administrators of an estate\" can challenge a medical examiner's findings on a death certificate.\n\n\"We couldn't be happier. If we're not going to use the word 'justice,' we're going to use the words 'undecided' or 'homicide' because that's what we believe this is — a homicide,\" Joshua recently told CBS about the decision. \"Ellen was brutally murdered.\"  \n\n\nIn early 2011, Greenberg's fiancé Sam Goldberg returned to their shared residence in Philadelphia, but told investigators he couldn't get inside of the apartment because the swing bar lock inside of the apartment was in use, blocking his entrance. Eventually he forced himself inside and discovered Greenberg deceased in the kitchen. She had suffered more than 20 stab wounds and a 10-inch knife was still in her chest at the time of discovery, according to the investigation report, which was previously reviewed by PEOPLE. She had stab wounds to her chest, abdomen, head and back of her neck as well as a gash on her scalp.\n\n[Teacher Had 20 Stab Wounds, Yet 2011 Death Was Ruled Suicide — Now DA Is Reopening Investigation](https://people.com/crime/teacher-stabbed-20-times-2011-death-ruled-suicide-da-reopening-investigation/)\n\nHer manner of death was changed from homicide to suicide after investigators said they only found Greenberg's DNA on the knife and clothing, according to [earlier reporting by PEOPLE](https://people.com/crime/ellen-greenberg-pennsylvania-teacher-death-ruled-suicide-family-suspects-murder/). They also claimed there were no signs of foul play.\n\nHowever, Joshua and Sandee's lawyer, Joe Podraza, claimed to Fox News that the knife was never fingerprinted and that there were, in fact, signs of a struggle in the apartment. The outlet also reports, citing unspecified court documents, that the scene was also cleaned before detectives came to investigate.",

      "text": "For my second case I have chosen to examine a case which I am surprised to find appears never to have been featured on Reddit, the unsolved murder of wealthy businessman John Luper in 2004, a case which really shook the Leeds community at the time and made national headlines in the UK.\n\n**\\~Background\\~**\n\nJohn Michael Luper was born in 1946 in the city of Leeds, West Yorkshire to parents Stanley Luper and his wife Olga (nee Black). John’s only sibling, younger brother Toby who was 8 years younger than John, was born in 1954. In 1981, aged 35, John married Turkish-born Lyican Karabag in Leeds, and the couple’s only child, daughter Liza-Rose, was born in 1983.\n\nJohn came from a well-known Jewish family in Leeds, and was part of the United Hebrew Congregation, an Orthodox Jewish community which worships at a synagogue in the city. His maternal grandfather, Isaac (Ike) Black, was a master tailor in one of the finest workrooms in Leeds in the 1940s-50s, when the city was still the hub of the UK textile and suit trade. He was followed into the trade by his son-in-law Stanley (John’s father) and son Norman (John’s uncle). Stanley and Norman founded Black & Luper, a textile factory employing hundreds of workers on Kirkstall Road, near to the famous Headingley cricket and rugby grounds, which was for some time the biggest single-story textile factory in the UK and manufactured garments for high-end brands such as Burton and Burberry. The firm also kitted out the Leeds United team that won the 1972 FA Cup.\n\nBoth John and Toby followed their fathers into the family business. Its success and his other ventures, such as in property, made John a millionaire and enabled him to buy a large mansion (worth approximately £1.6million today) in Alwoodley on Sandmoor Drive, one of the most exclusive streets in Leeds. Here he lived with his wife, daughter and the family au-pair. John was also a non-executive director of the Sports Entertainment Media Group and part of the consortium which bought out the business for £9.4m. The group represented sportspeople and celebrities such as Thierry Henry, Rio Ferdinand, Lennox Lewis and Jodie Marsh.\n\nToby, who was very close to his brother, said of John that, “He was loyal. He was a great family man. He would help anyone. He would go out of his way to help anyone, sometimes even at his own detriment.” Family friends described John as a colourful, forceful character, a ‘warm-hearted family man who was generous to charities’ and ‘a larger-than-life character who always had a cheeky grin on his face’ with a passion for sports, particularly football and golf.\n\n**\\~The Crime\\~**\n\nOn 16 February 2004 John set out from the family home at 11.30pm to walk the family dog. He only got as far as the pavement in front of his neighbour’s driveway on Sandmoor Drive before he was ambushed by a gang of four or five masked men, who dragged him up the gravel drive, through some bushes and back to the family home. After entering the house John was bound with silver duct tape by the gang. John’s wife, daughter (aged 20 at the time) and the family’s Turkish au-pair, who were in bed when the raid began, were also similarly bound and left in an upstairs room, separated from John downstairs.\n\nThe gang stole John’s wallet, which contained his credit cards and a substantial amount of cash which he had taken out of the bank in preparation for an upcoming business trip. Jewellery was also taken, including a number of watches, amongst which was a rare Cartier watch, one of only four sold in the UK at the time, made of platinum with vertical rows of diamonds either side of the watch face. Estimates suggest that the jewellery and cash totalled approximately £100k in value.\n\nAs John lay dying during the raid, an attempt was made by the robbers to feed him marmalade from a jar found in the family kitchen. The robbers, having completed their raid, then fled the home and, on hearing this, the ladies in the upstairs bedroom were able to free themselves from their bindings. On making their way downstairs they found John unconscious on the floor of the morning room. Police were called at 1.45am and, despite attempts by emergency services to resuscitate John, he was pronounced dead at the scene in the early hours of 17 February 2004.\n\n**\\~The investigation\\~**\n\nPathologists initially struggled to determine the cause of death for John. It was theorized that, due to the attempts to feed him marmalade, he may have suffered a diabetic attack which caused his death. However, it was eventually determined that he had died from asphyxia and that the marmalade had likely been given to him by the robbers as they became concerned about his health during the raid. Police revealed that John had a very mild diabetic condition which did not require medication and it appears that the robbers became aware of this, possibly through John telling them, and in an attempt to boost his sugar levels gave him the marmalade. The mode of asphyxiation John suffered has never been revealed, but police did state that there were only superficial injuries on John’s body and no signs of violence. Detectives also revealed that the women had received light injuries, including two having suffered light blows, as the robbers moved them from room to room as they meticulously searched the property for items to steal.\n\nDespite the lack of major obvious violence involved in the offence Detective Superintendent Bill Shackleton of West Yorkshire Police, who led the initial investigation in 2004, said of the raiders that “they came there determined to commit this offence. They were equipped to do so, and they knew exactly what they were going to do when they got there, and they were prepared to use a degree of violence.\" DS Shackleton confirmed that police believed John and the Luper home had been targeted due to wealth rather than any kind of business or personal grudge.\n\nAll the robbers had worn masks and gloves, and they were believed to have had a getaway car parked a short distance from the Luper home. The women in the Luper family were able to provide descriptions of two of the robbers. The first was described as a tall, muscular black man with a Yorkshire accent, while the second was between 5ft 3in and 5ft 6in, of slight build, and believed to be mixed race or a light-skinned black man. One was described as a somewhat reluctant participant in events, having been overheard by the women as apologising for what was happening and claiming he did not want to be there. However, the women could not be certain if there were four or five robbers in total and this appears to never have been established for certain by police.\n\nExtensive forensic searches were conducted of the Luper home and on Sandmoor Drive, in particular the area where John was ambushed whilst walking the dog. Numerous public appeals for information were made, including a reconstruction of the crime on the nationally broadcast BBC Crimewatch programme. Efforts were made to trace the jewellery stolen. It has never been made public whether any of this has been recovered but a number of appeals over the 20 years since the crime have focused on the Cartier platinum watch so it appears that this rare item in particular is still outstanding.\n\nDetectives came to believe from information received that the killers were from within the criminal fraternity of the Bradford and Spen districts. Spen is about 17 miles and 35 minutes by car from Sandmoor Drive, and central Bradford approximately 13 miles but around the same travelling time by car due to traffic and road differences. Ten months after John’s death, land and farm buildings at the Windybank estate near Liversedge (2 miles from Spen) was searched, but if anything of significance was recovered that information has never been made public and no charges have ever followed.\n\nOver the years since John’s murder the case continues to be reviewed. Since 2017 it has been overseen by the West Yorkshire Police Major Investigation Review Team, a team of specialist cold case investigators. The team undertook a full review of the case, specifically focusing on forensic evidence and any advances over time which could bring new lines of enquiry from the existing forensic material. It appears that nothing of significance has been uncovered by the review team, and appeals continue to be made, including most recently by John’s brother Toby and new lead officer Detective Chief Inspector Damian Roebuck on the 20^(th) anniversary of the crime in February 2024.\n\n**\\~Theories\\~**\n\nDuring the investigation it was revealed that the Luper home had been broken into some months prior to the February raid. Police learned that John had reportedly told his friends that the robbers in the previous raid had repeatedly demanded diamonds from him. This led police to speculate that both raids were committed by the same gang, who had returned in the belief that diamonds were kept in the home and determined to steal these. Whether the Luper family did actually own diamonds has never been revealed.\n\nIt seems clear that police believe the identity of the gang members is known to members of the criminal fraternity in the Leeds and Bradford areas. It even seems possible that the police themselves are aware of who the robbers likely were, given the raids on the property in Liversedge carried out soon after the crime, but have been unable so far to secure enough evidence to prosecute. Police appeals continue to focus both on asking for information from people approached and asked to buy jewellery from unknown people or people know who didn't have provenance or receipts for the jewellery, and on the changing of loyalties and allegiances within the community or criminal fraternity over time. This focus suggests some awareness within the police of who likely suspects may be, and a need for more evidence to tie them to the crime.\n\nThe police have stated publicly that John was targeted for his wealth rather than for a grudge. This may be true, but it seems possible to me that someone with some inside knowledge of the Lupers may have been involved in the crime. It is plausible that the family were picked as a target because of their home being on Sandmoor Drive, and their obvious resultant wealth, but if so why pick that home over any other on the road? To me, the gang seem to have had some information about John and the family which may have come from a degree of insider knowledge. For example, 11.30pm at night is a fairly unusual time to walk a dog so how did the raiders know this would be a good time to ambush John? They could have gained such knowledge from watching the family home for some time and learning their routines (if indeed such a late-night walk was routine for John) but the layout of the road and the security conscious nature of people in a wealthy neighbourhood would have made anyone spending any time watching a home fairly conspicuous.\n\nIn addition, why did the raiders think that there were diamonds in the Luper home? Could this have been from some (possibly incorrect) inside information. And if the raiders were from the Bradford/Spen area how did they come to target the Lupers at all – it is, after all, some distance to the Alwoodley area of Leeds from this area so how did they become aware of the Luper family and why would they not have focussed on similarly wealthy targets closer to home? It is possible the information made its way to them through a criminal network, but it seems to me more likely that some insider information may have been in play. I stress this is purely a theory of mine based on deduction and has never been suggested to my knowledge by police.\n\n**\\~Discussion points\\~**\n\nHow do you think the Lupers may have come to be targeted for this crime? And what do you think the chances are of it ever being solved now, given that the information the police need seems most likely to come from within the criminal fraternity?\n\n**\\~Sources\\~**\n\n[\\~https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2004/feb/19/ukcrime.martinwainwright\\~](https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2004/feb/19/ukcrime.martinwainwright)\n\n[\\~https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2004/feb/20/martinwainwright\\~](https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2004/feb/20/martinwainwright)\n\n \n\n[John Luper](https://preview.redd.it/ryhhriyqavfd1.jpg?width=1200&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=78e9988e5a361311489d7871c5cbab560b6e3fd4)\n\n[The Luper home on Sandmoor Drive](https://preview.redd.it/mzychnxqavfd1.png?width=768&format=png&auto=webp&s=59587b16cb8833452400e04e94e2bfbd3263e800)\n\n[Police searching Sandmoor Drive outside the neighbours home](https://preview.redd.it/yo3wn3zqavfd1.jpg?width=640&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=7fd655f1029227304d45d511cb2be2717bb0396e)\n\n[The watches stolen during the raid, including the rare Cartier watch second from left](https://preview.redd.it/xgfxnlyqavfd1.jpg?width=510&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=cf58dace98e380544d31a44c9ae5dce9f54d5411)\n\n[The Black & Luper factory](https://preview.redd.it/jkavvnxqavfd1.jpg?width=736&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=dc9f1f133ce810049f6321d4703badd01b8fb319)",

      "text": "This is my first post on Reddit, let alone this sub! I hope it meets the requirements.\n\nFor my first post I wanted to focus on a case which is close to my heart - the disappearance and murder in 1994 of Lindsay Jo Rimer. \n\n**Lindsay Jo Rimer**  \nLindsay Jo Rimer was born on the 17^(th) February 1981 to parents Geraldine (Geri) and Colin Rimer. Lindsay lived with her parents, older brother Daniel, older sister Kate and younger sister Juliet at a house on Cambridge Street in the town of Hebden Bridge, situated in the northern county of West Yorkshire in the UK and made famous recently as the setting for BAFTA winning BBC drama series Happy Valley. Lindsay was described by her mother Geri as a ‘*well-behaved, conscientious and happy kid’*, a girl so well organised and efficient that her family nicknamed her Saffy, after the character in British sitcom Absolutely Fabulous who displayed the same traits. She was a conscientious and popular student in Year 9 at the local Calder High School, and had expressed an interest in going to University to attain a degree once her high school education was completed. Lindsay had recently taken on a part-time job at local Forbuoys Newsagents delivering newspapers to earn some money, at least in part to fund what her Mum described as a developing interest in fashion.\n\nLindsay’s home life had not always been easy though. The family-run pub in Rotherham had gone bust and subsequently, under the strain of the resultant financial problems, her parents had separated. Following this Lindsay, her brother Daniel and father Colin lived separately from the rest of the family in caravans at Lower Rough Head farm, Hebden Bridge. For two years Lindsay and Daniel shared one caravan and Colin lived in another at the farm. Whilst Daniel apparently quite enjoyed the country lifestyle, and sometimes returned to help the farmer (he was sheep dipping the day before Lindsay’s disappearance), Lindsay appears to have been less keen on it and missed her friends. However, her parents eventually reconciled and the whole family was once again living together again by the time Lindsay disappeared in November 1994.\n\n**\\~Lindsey goes missing\\~**  \nOn the evening of 7^(th) November 1994 Lindsay was at home with Colin. Her sister Kate was 20 at the time and had already left home. Presumably, although it is not clear from information in the public domain, Daniel and Juliet (only a toddler at the time) were also at home on this evening. At approximately 10pm Lindsay left the house on Cambridge Street to go to a shop and buy a packet of cornflakes while her father Colin was having a conversation on the telephone which commenced at 9.45pm, and so no words passed between them. On the way to the shop Lindsay visited the Trades Club in Holme Street, where her Mum Geri was out having a drink with a friend. Geri offered to buy Lindsay a Coke, but Lindsay refused and left to continue her journey to the shop.\n\nCCTV at the SPAR supermarket on Crown Street captures Lindsay buying a packet of cornflakes at 10.22pm. This is the last footage of Lindsay alive and she appears to be acting completely normally, with no hint of any concerns. Nor is she carrying anything, such as a bag, other than the packet of cornflakes she had set out to buy. Lindsay never made it home, although this fact went unnoticed till the morning of the 8^(th) November as Geri had been out for the evening and, in her own words, made the ‘mistake of my life’ by not checking Lindsay had returned when she got home. Colin had been on the telephone from 9.45-10.20pm and had also not been aware of his daughter’s failure to return. On the morning of 8^(th) November Forbuoys Newsagents called the Rimer home as Lindsay had failed to turn up for her morning newspaper delivery round, and it was at this point that the alarm was raised.\n\n**\\~Search and Discovery\\~**  \nDespite family and friends strongly arguing that Lindsay was not the type of girl who would leave home, police initially believed it was likely that she was a runaway, speculating that she was unhappy at home (this was denied by her family). Despite this initial belief, there was an investigation unit set up, and extensive appeals and searches took place. Lindsay’s older sister Kate played the role of her sister in a televised reconstruction of Lindsay’s last known movements in the hope this would jog memories but the police received little useful information as a result. Hundreds of local people joined searches of the area and some parts of the Rochdale Canal and River Calder were also searched, but to no avail.\n\nLindsay’s family participated in a Channel 4 documentary called Deadline in the hope this would help generate information about their daughter’s whereabouts. However, the documentary caused more problems for the family when the demeanor of Colin was questioned. He was observed by some viewers to be ‘smirking’ and too happy/jolly given his situation, and some started to suspect he was in some way involved with his daughter’s disappearance. His wife Geri supported him unequivocally, and outlined how behind closed doors Colin was an emotional wreck, but his way of coping with the events was to put on a brave face and happy demeanor in public, as well as his observed ‘smirking’ being a result of nerves at being in front of the camera. The police do not believe Colin was involved in his daughter’s disappearance.\n\n**\\~Lindsay is found\\~**  \nIn the late morning of the 12 April 1995, five months after Lindsay went missing, her body was found by canal workers dredging Rawden Mill Lock 12 of the Rochdale Canal approximately one mile from the centre of Hebden Bridge. Police admitted that the section of canal where the remains were found had not been part of earlier searches of the canal, a crucial mistake made as the police had failed to search 'upstream' from Lindsay's home, and one which would cost the investigation a heavy price.\n\nLindsay’s body had been weighed down with a 20lb concrete boulder, the boulder having been taken from the side of the canal by the killer. It appears from an FOI request submitted to West Yorkshire Police in 2021 that the boulder was secured to her remains by rope, though I cannot find confirmation elsewhere that this was the case. Where the rope came from, if this was so, is unclear - perhaps the killer brought it with them, suggesting some form of premeditation, or perhaps this also was found by the killer close to the canal. Lindsay was still wearing the same clothing she was pictured wearing in the CCTV footage taken at the SPAR on the night she disappeared.\n\nLindsay’s remains were taken to the Royal Halifax Infirmary for post-mortem by Home Office pathologist Professor Mike Green, assisted by Dr Naomi Carter. The pathologist concluded that Lindsay had died as a result of strangulation, with the larynx slightly flattened against the spinal column and ‘*a prominent band of congestion across the middle area of the neck muscles’* (Halifax Courier article from 2000, quoted on HebWeb). Much of the content of the report has been kept confidential for investigative reasons, including information on the arrangement of Lindsay’s clothing when she was found, but the police did advise that no sexual assault was believed to have taken place.\n\n**\\~The investigation\\~**  \nDetectives believe that Lindsay was murdered the night she disappeared, and that she had already been placed in the canal by the time she was reported missing on the morning of 8^(th) November 1994. The part of the canal where her remains were found is situated fairly close to the Rimer family home, and so the police believed it likely that Lindsay was picked up by someone in a car on her walk home from the SPAR shop, probably someone she knew given that she was believed to be a sensible and cautious girl who was unlikely to get into a car with a stranger.\n\nPolice speculated that, whilst it was likely she knew her killer, Lindsay could have met him as recently as a few nights before her death, at a Bonfire Night celebration in the town on 5^(th) November. Close to the area of the canal where her remains were discovered was a working mill factory, now long since closed and demolished, where detectives theorized the killer, sexually attracted to Lindsay, had taken her with the aim of some form of liaison and, when rejected, he killed her, possibly by mistake.  \n\nIn the three decades since Lindsay’s murder police have spoken to over 5000 people, taken hundreds of witness statements and examined over 1200 vehicles. Lindsay’s murder was investigated as part of Operation Enigma, a national enquiry that reviewed the unsolved murders of 207 women across Britain, which eliminated any link between Lindsay’s murder and others. In 2016, police confirmed that a DNA profile, believed to be that of Lindsay’s killer, had been isolated by a team of Canadian forensics specialists. Two arrests were made in 2016 and 2017, but neither man has been charged and given the availability of a DNA sample to test against it appears likely they have been eliminated.\n\n**\\~Theories\\~**  \nPolice clearly believe that Lindsay was killed by someone she knew, but other possibilities have investigated or proposed by outsiders over the years, and I have summarized the main theories below:\n\n* 'Honda Man' - police discovered that a red Honda Civic stolen in Meanwood, near Leeds, on 6^(th) November had been spotted several times in Hebden Bridge near where Lindsay had last been seen and was again seen in the town during the evening of 12^(th) November. An e-fit was produced of the driver, described as a bearded male, and police attempted to trace both him and the vehicle. They discovered Honda Man had tried to talk to a number of teenage girls in the town around the time of Lindsay’s disappearance, including some of Lindsay’s school friends. He was spotted near the SPAR shop where Lindsay was last seen alive. The car was found abandoned in Sheffield ten days after Lindsay’s disappearance. Recent appeals in 2024 have focused on possible links between the murder and the red Honda, suggesting that police think the man in the car may have had a role to play in Lindsay’s death.\n* John Taylor – Taylor was convicted of the murder of Leeds schoolgirl Leanne Tiernan following her murder in November 2000 and a series of rapes. He is also a suspect in a number of other murders in the West Yorkshire area. Police have investigated him in Lindsay’s case but no evidence has linked him to her murder.\n* John Oswin – Oswin, from Halifax in West Yorkshire, was given an was given an indefinite life sentence after he pled guilty to two rapes and two indecent assaults involving teenage girls in the Halifax area from December 1993 to September 1997. At least one incident occurred along a canal towpath – a commonality with Lindsay’s case, and Hebden Bridge is only 9 miles from Halifax. Again, police investigated but could not link him to Lindsay’s case.\n* Tony King – in 2003 the press reported that police were investigating the so-called Costa Killer and Holloway Strangler, and had sought his DNA, in Lindsay’s case. However, police described this as ‘speculation’.\n* Jimmy Savile – one of the more outlandish theories about Lindsay’s murder is that it was committed by notorious celebrity sex offender Savile. The suggestion comes about as a result of Savile apparently regularly staying at a friend’s caravan situated at Cragg Vale, a mile from Lower Rough Head farm where Lindsay lived with her father and brother for two years, and Savile renting a garage in the town to park his Rolls Royce. In the month Lindsay went missing Savile’s whereabouts are unconfirmed and he was absent from the public eye, adding to the speculation of a link. However, the link seems tenuous at best.\n* Francisco Arce Montes – in 2007 true crime author Wensley Clarkson claimed in his book *The Predator: Portrait of a Serial Killer* that Montes, killer of 13-year-old British schoolgirl Caroline Dickinson -  murdered while she slept in a hostel in France, was responsible for Lindsay’s murder. Clarkson claimed that he was told by a retired police officer that Montes, working as a waiter in London in 1994, had visited York and was on a hunting trip in the West Yorkshire area on the date of Lindsay’s disappearance. However, Clarkson has never been able to provide any evidence to back up the claims and refuses to name the officer he says gave him this information.\n* Vince Robson – in 2017 a retired detective from Cleveland Police claimed that Vince Robson, a man questioned in relation to the murders of Julie Hogg and Tina Bell, had links to the Rimer family and the Hebden Bridge area. Robson moved to Hebden Bridge in 1990 and worked at the Trades Club, the place Lindsay visited to see her Mum Geri on her way to the SPAR shop. Robson is purportedly one of the last people to see Lindsay alive on the night she disappeared, and the detective concerned believes he should be a prime suspect. These claims were explored further in Channel 4 documentary In The Footsteps of Killers.\n\n**Sources**\n\n[\\~https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder\\_of\\_Lindsay\\_Rimer#cite\\_note-Times95-5\\~](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder_of_Lindsay_Rimer#cite_note-Times95-5)\n\n[\\~https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2006/nov/04/familyandrelationships.features\\~](https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2006/nov/04/familyandrelationships.features)\n\n[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-leeds-39704774](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-leeds-39704774)\n\n[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/av/uk-england-leeds-29954173](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/av/uk-england-leeds-29954173)\n\n**Discussion Points**\n\nWhat are your thoughts on this, and on the case as a whole?   \nDo you think one of the suspects listed above is likely?   \nWas Lindsay killed by someone she knew?\n\nThanks for reading  \n\n\n[Lindsay Jo Rimer](https://preview.redd.it/3c7jcbnr9ied1.jpg?width=670&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=9af1781f274dd7b4cbe26d46e1ffb7354be3a0c6)\n\n[The Trades Club](https://preview.redd.it/6xil646t9ied1.jpg?width=330&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=416b567873dcd62eb63e28a2ccbfa74e8c58de8d)\n\n[The SPAR Lindsay visited](https://preview.redd.it/37oh49iu9ied1.jpg?width=330&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e4c1730149f0048ff5393c6912d9149a8142f693)\n\n[The last sighting of Lindsay on CCTV](https://preview.redd.it/c6s421bw9ied1.jpg?width=670&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=acdb5bcbefb9e92548c802a99772855426ad86d2)\n\n[The suspicious red Honda](https://preview.redd.it/h4z6khgy9ied1.jpg?width=960&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c864e1166efa3167186b6cb07cd7494e314fa124)\n\n[The police e-fit of Honda Man](https://preview.redd.it/8m708n00aied1.jpg?width=670&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=563a6d70499055ee021093b01ea6654d871e3b4f)",

      "text": "My name is Charles Krause. In November 1978 I had just begun my first foreign assignment as The Washington Post’s South America correspondent when my editors in Washington sent me to cover Congressman Leo Ryan’s visit to the Peoples Temple in Guyana. Little did I know that 24 hours after we reached Jonestown, Jim Jones would send assassins to kill the Congressman and the rest of us who were with him as we were attempting to board two small planes at the airstrip in Port Kaituma. I was standing near Congressman Ryan when the gunmen started firing and was lying on the ground next to him when I was hit by a bullet and he was killed. Two days later, I was the first journalist to return to Jonestown, where I interviewed one of the few survivors of the mass suicide-murder that left more than 900 men, women, and babies dead. Why? Because they had put their faith in a false prophet whose paranoia, grandiosity and Narcissism killed them.\n\nMy book about Jonestown, *Guyana Massacre: The Eyewitness Account,* became a best-seller and, the next two decades, continued my work as a foreign correspondent, covering wars, revolutions and political upheavals for *The Washington Post, CBS*, and the *PBS NewsHour,* winning a number of awards, including an Emmy for my reporting from the Middle East. I now write and publish The Swamp Report online, which showcases the political art I’ve championed, along my views and analysis, which I humbly offer, about the important domestic and foreign events of our time.\n\nI took part in the National Geographic documentary “Cult Massacre: One Day in Jonestown,” streaming on Hulu, because I hoped the lessons we should have learned from Jonestown would not be forgotten.\n\nI will be answering questions starting at 1pm ET.\n\n**Edit:** I want to thank you all for your interesting questions. I hope you’ll want to watch CULT MASSACRE: One Day in Jonestown because I really believe Jonestown should be viewed as a cautionary tale for our times. CULT MASSACRE does an excellent job of explaining why.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/7wltm3hedpbd1.png?width=3024&format=png&auto=webp&s=ce479dd60b6bdfaa0b9ec95e3220d7ed554981f9",

      "text": "One case that has stood out to me for a while is the murder of Margaret Fetterolf in Woodlawn, Maryland. Margaret went missing from Alexandria, Virginia in summer 1975. She was found murdered in by the side of a road near a cemetery in Woodlawn, which is in Baltimore County, MD. Until September 2021, she was known only as Woodlawn Jane Doe. I've not found anything explaining how she ended up being found in the Baltimore area but IIRC she might have been a runaway (according to her brother after identification).\n\nEven though Margaret has been identified, he killer has not. If she went missing/ran away in summer 1975 and was recently murdered when her remains were found, I'm curious to know how she ended up murdered near Baltimore. Was it someone she was acquainted with? Could the perp have been a stranger or even a serial killer? I believe Samuel Little had victims in Maryland (among other states) so I've wondered if she might have been one of his victims. Samuel Little aside, were there any active serial killers in Maryland at the time Margaret was found? I don't know how likely this scenario is but I don't think it can be ruled out completely.",

      "title": "On October 24th, 1969, Gloria Moody went on vacation to William's Lake, Canada. That same weekend, her body was found just miles from her hotel. Her murder has never been solved.",
      "text": "Gloria Moody is the first known victim of the \"Highway of Tears,\" a name given to British Columbia's *Highway 16* and surrounding highways due to many deaths and missing persons cases that have occurred there over the years. She was an indigenous woman from the Bella Coola reserve in British Columbia. A mother of 2, Gloria was 27 years old when she went on a family trip to Williams Lake, a scenic area about 450 km from her home – at the time, a 12-hour drive. Her parents urged her to go on the trip to spend some time away from her unfaithful and abusive, common law husband. Her brother Dave and their parents were traveling with her while her kids stayed at their aunt’s house.\n\n[Gloria, via The Canadian Encyclopedia](https://preview.redd.it/2ci2tarmvf3d1.jpg?width=800&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=99cd55fedbd9b994ec4dd17bf284dbc5d0160bfa)\n\nOn October 23rd, 1969, the family left the reserve and spent the night at Anahim Lake before continuing to Williams Lake the next day. They arrived on the afternoon of the 24th and checked into the Ranch Hotel, a hotel and bar at their destination. The next day, Gloria and Dave decided to do some bar hopping, visiting a few local bars including *The Lakeview* and *The Maple Leaf* before returning to the Ranch Hotel. They were seen at the Ranch Hotel’s bar around 10 PM, after which time Dave left to go back to their room. While walking, Dave turned around to say something to Gloria, but she wasn’t there. Though he thought she was right behind him the entire time, she in fact wasn't. No one at the bar recalled seeing her leave either. \n\n[the Ranch Hotel in the 60s, Bob Samchuck, via Eve Lazarus](https://preview.redd.it/s2j7n3wuvf3d1.jpg?width=960&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a2e8efac0ac213bc0eaefe90b3831e9598282613)\n\nThe next morning, 2 people, a mechanic and his friend, drove out to a small lake just a few miles from Williams Lake. On the way back, they noticed Gloria’s body on a small cattle trail and immediately called the police. The description of the scene is horrific – when police found her, Gloria’s body was naked and beaten, her clothes tossed nearby, and she showed signs of a brutal sexual assault. The coroner determined that she bled to death, which may have taken as much as half an hour after the assault was done.  \n\nPolice conducted an investigation, but no one in town had seen Gloria leave the bar, so there weren’t any leads. To make things worse, the town was especially busy that weekend, as it was a paid weekend off for many workers, and a local 4H sale helped fill hotels to capacity. In short, there were too many potential perpetrators, and no way to narrow them down. \n\nGloria’s family was shaken by the murder. Her father blamed himself for her death. Gloria’s daughter Vanessa said that “He locked himself in my mom’s room, and he just lay there. He didn’t eat or sleep, and when he came out, everybody in the whole town talked about how his hair went pure white.” After Gloria’s death, her mother and father adopted and raised her two children.  \n\nThough police made an investigation into the murder, it took almost three decades for Gloria’s family to find out anything about it. When they did, Vanessa says, police gave them 3 suspect names who might have killed the young mother, including a bartender from Williams Lake. Unfortunately, no one was ever charged for the crimes, and all three suspects had passed away before the family was notified of their potential involvement, meaning no one knows whether they really committed the crimes. Vanessa said that some Williams Lake residents told her everyone knows who did it, but won't say for some odd reason, perhaps fear. To this day, Gloria’s murder remains unsolved. \n\nWhat do you think happened? Was Gloria a victim of a serial killer bartender, or did someone else kill her? Did the police cover up her death? Please leave your thoughts below and let's have a healthy discussion.\n\nSources:\n\n* [Missing and Murdered Aboriginal Women (cbc.ca)](https://www.cbc.ca/missingandmurdered/mmiw/profiles/gloria-levina-moody#:~:text=Moody%20had%20been%20travelling%20with,being%20beaten%20and%20sexually%20assaulted.)\n* [For decades, women have vanished or been killed near these highways.

Forty years later, DNA cleared him — and pointed to possible serial killers, a rare duo of them, who were only 20 years old themselves.\n\nTampa in 1983 was described by one cop as a [\"summer of hell.\"](https://www.tampabay.com/news/crime/2024/05/29/florida-tampa-killer-trial-murder-dna-mystery-innocent-prison-released/#Section-Three)\n\nA series of vicious slayings -- all women, dumped in conspicuous places around town with no immediate suspects -- stood out, even among all the other murder and crime those months brought to the region.\n\n[News from 1983](https://preview.redd.it/kmlpg44cqc3d1.png?width=1838&format=png&auto=webp&s=0b31fcc92e5b73e1cc79c2a2e4f751c19575432d)\n\nPolice told newspaper reporters over and over there was absolutely no connection between the crimes. In a few cases that proved true as they made arrests, but several remained cold cases for decades, such as the freelance photographer Linda Lansen, who disappeared the day after photographing the bunny of the year contest at the local Playboy club.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ibksoyhkpc3d1.png?width=238&format=png&auto=webp&s=3265cf4c4b16a3aef0439039f2bc3a2a7985d308\n\nAlso among the eight victims was a 19-year-old [mall worker named Barbara Grams](https://www.tampabay.com/news/crime/2024/05/29/florida-tampa-killer-trial-murder-dna-mystery-innocent-prison-released/#Section-One), found behind a dentist's office near a popular teen hangout called Hutto's Corner grocery, with a mysterious, so-called bite mark on her cheek. She'd been walking home from the mall, carrying her work clothes in a County Seat shopping bag.\n\nThere were no eyewitnesses and as police struggled to find leads, a gas station clerk gave officers the description of a neighborhood troublemaker named Robert DuBoise. After a sensational trial, he was sent to death row for Grams' murder, screaming that he was innocent. He maintained that claim of innocence for decades.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/p8snaksppc3d1.png?width=711&format=png&auto=webp&s=4eca1fba34b2bbc7162cfbf01cee1410e1aabecd\n\n[Robert DuBoise in court, 1983](https://preview.redd.it/35hzeiofpc3d1.jpg?width=520&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=5ca959c1e93ee34300931b2754f4b69f0796f946)\n\nNearly 40 years later, someone finally agreed to help him -- a new conviction review unit at the local state attorney's office. All the evidence had supposedly been destroyed, but a shocking discovery turned up DNA. \n\n[That DNA not only finally freed him, but pointed to a pair of alleged serial killers](https://www.tampabay.com/news/crime/2024/05/29/florida-tampa-killer-trial-murder-dna-mystery-innocent-prison-released/) who prosecutors now say murdered  other victims besides Grams during that dark summer, but the crimes had never been connected until now. \n\n[Robert DuBoise hugs his mother after being released from prison after 37 years.](https://preview.redd.it/j25oofbtpc3d1.jpg?width=4096&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=3b3302d424b5a55f057243a7afd8f6cf1111d6b0)\n\nDespite the DNA, the way that modern science has invalidated other evidence from DuBoise's trial, and the recantation of a jailhouse witness who now says flat out, \"I lied,\" there are still people in powerful positions who seem to refuse to let go of DuBoise's \"guilt,\" even now. \n\nMeanwhile, DuBoise has fought for compensation for the youth he lost behind bars. The state, at first, told him he was owed nothing, even though it normally pays exonerees $50,000 for every year they spent in prison. DuBoise had stolen tools and siphoned gas as a teen, which mean he was ineligible under the Florida’s \"clean hands\" law. \n\nAnd beyond that, DuBoise, now almost 60, has returned to a home town that he no longer recognizes, where he[ tries to figure out how to spend the rest of his life](https://www.tampabay.com/news/crime/2024/05/29/florida-tampa-killer-trial-murder-dna-mystery-innocent-prison-released/#Section-Four), and ponders whether his old dreams have to die. \n\nThe two men now charged with the murder of Barbara Grams have been charged in another cold case murder from that summer of hell, the photographer Linda Lansen, and are persons of interest in other murders from that era. The state attorney said they were on a \"sinister spree\" of \"serial rape and murder.\"\n\nOne confessed to Grams, and has agreed to testify against his old friend who is awaiting trial.",

      "title": "7 months apart two young boys would go missing and later be found mutilated and dismembered. The killer escaped while awaiting trial and remained on the run for 2 years working at a church band in a neighbouring country.",
      "text": "On January 11, 2012, in Koalabata Village, Lesotho, a 13-year-old boy named Moholobela Seetsa was reported missing to local police after he failed to return home from the Methodist Church High School. Witnesses were questioned and came forward who all claimed to have seen him riding his bicycle near a ravine. The police alongside locals conducted an extensive search effort of the surrounding area focusing mainly on the wildness and especially the ravines. Despite their best efforts. they came back empty-handed. His family grew even more worried when a local villager found Moholobela's bicycle but without Moholobela anywhere to be found.\n\nOn January 15, police were alerted by concerned locals who thought they had seen what looked to be a grave in one of the ravines due to an unnatural pile of soil. Officers arrived and slowly dug up the makeshift grave and the scene that greeted them was gruesome and horrifying. They found a human torso that was missing its head, arms and the legs were cut off at the knees. Also missing was the genitals of the torso determined to belong to a male. The torso had also been slit open and the heart was removed. Although the arms and legs were severed, they were still buried with the torso but missing the hands and feet. The officers questioned all the villagers and asked if they knew who the owner of the torso was but none of them could answer. The torso was later brought to a morgue and put in a cold storage room in case more body parts were found.\n\nLater that afternoon the police were called back to the area as not that far more body parts were found in a pit in one of the ravines. The villages had dug up the pit to see what had been buried and came across a human head, heads and feet. Also in the pit were three plastic bags. The body parts were brought to the morgue and the police used them to reassemble the complete body as they matched the torso. Moholobela's father who had been given leave from his job to return to the village and join the search was called in to identify the remains and he did positively identify them as his son. Blood and DNA tests further confirmed that the body belonged to Moholobela.\n\nBased on the nature of the crime it was suspected to be a ritual/muti killing which was not uncommon in Africa. On January 22, after a village meeting to discuss his death, the villagers had a suspect of their own and it was a local businessman who was believed to be responsible for the death of another boy and possibly many more ritual-based murders. And so an angry mob descended upon his property and began throwing stones at his home while he was still inside with his family and some even tried setting their home on fire. Police were called and they dispersed the mob and took this businessman into protective custody. After this incident, many expressed outrage toward the police and accused them of not doing enough to investigate the case. And these claims likely had some degree of truth as the police never seemed to have come out with any leads or suspects and the case would soon go unsolved and the businessman sued the police for negligence asking for 1 Million Lesotho Loti\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[The destroyed home of the businessman.](https://preview.redd.it/fen3c1w40klc1.png?width=2400&format=png&auto=webp&s=913455506b721e39aab6e4399d1e8ae24fab4030)\n\nOn July 10, 2012, 19-year-old Kamohelo Mohata a student at Limkokwing University in Maseru didn't return home from his studies. As his father worked in South Africa (and no mention is made of their mother) he and his younger brother had to live with their grandparents. Kamohelo was last seen getting dressed and leaving for University. A few hours later his brother received a text message from Kamohelo's cellphone informing him that he had gone to Johannesburg, South Africa on a school trip but left his passport behind and so asked to have the door to his home left unlocked as he didn't know when he'd return home. As he didn't have enough data/minutes to respond to him he had to buy some after school hours later and when he did finally respond to him and even tried to call, no one would pick up.\n\nAn hour later a stranger he didn't know went to the door and asked to see Kamohelo. He was informed that Kamohelo was away and his brother soon asked what his name was so he could tell Kamohelo that he was looking for him. The stranger gave his name as \"Lehlohonolo\" Two or three hours later Lehlohonolo returned and asked if Kamohelo was back. He was told that since he was in South Africa he likely would not be home anytime soon. On July 11th, Lehlohonolo yet again returned and this time asked for his South African phone number. His brother didn't know that information so Lehlohonolo yet again left. 2-3 hours later he yet again returned and this time revealed why he had been looking for him. He told him that he had lent Kamohelo his \"hard drive\" to which his brother said that he never saw him come home with such an item, have such an item at all and that he would've noticed if he did have one. Lehlohonolo again left.\n\n5 minutes after he left, he was sent another text message saying he should go to Khekhenene Bus Stop to pick up Kamohelo's school books. This time, his brother's suspicions were finally tipped off. Rather than doing as the text had instructed, he went to his neighbour's flat and with his permission was allowed inside. His reason for doing so was because he would be able to see the bus stop from his neighbour's window. There were no people waiting at the stop and no vehicles parked, driving towards or driving away from the bus stop. He stayed at his neighbour's simply watching the bus stop but nobody ever came. Eventually, he received a cellphone call from a man he didn't recognize telling him that he had been delayed and that his taxi left without him, with the books still inside and that he shouldn't bother wasting his time anymore.\n\nOn July 12, the police received an anonymous tip from someone who to this day still retains their anonymity. The tipster informed them that there had been a murder and body parts hidden at the home of 25-year-old Lehlohonolo Scott. Police went to the property and arrested Lehlohonolo's mother, 54-year-old Malehlohonolo Scott. Her son wasn't home at the time but Lehlohonolo would later be arrested after he returned home via a taxi.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Lehlohonolo Scott.](https://preview.redd.it/77uty4u80klc1.png?width=403&format=png&auto=webp&s=c67c6bc37d5189b88e144c24a104553b2e74879a)\n\nThe first thing the police took notice of was a green Corsa bakkie truck belonging to Lehlohonolo and parked outside of the house and already unlocked. Upon opening the driver's door they lifted and looked under the driver's seat and found a black and green tracksuit alongside some socks and green trousers covered in fresh blood. Behind the driver's seat, the police discovered a human penis and testicles which had been cut off from the rest of the body. Police then removed the tonneau covering the bed of the truck and discovered a black plastic bag leaking blood. Upon opening it the police found human arms missing their hands and a single leg missing its foot.\n\nThe police then entered the home and had Malehlohonolo lead them through the property. She eventually led the police to an outside toilet/latrine. The police observed a trail of blood stains leading toward the latrine. The Latrine was too dark to see down the toilet so the police had to remove the toilet from the floor and shine a flashlight down into the hole. At the bottom of the latrine pit, the police were able to see a number of bloodied plastic bags sitting on a pile of newspapers. Inside these bags were only blood and nothing else which the police poured into bottles for storage.\n\nOn July 13, Lehlohonolo led them to some more body parts. He led police to the Koalabata Primary School, He then pointed police towards the latrine on the school property with this latrine having two separate pits which had a bunch of tree branches shoved down the toilet in order to hide something at the bottom of the pit. The police again removed both toilets from the floor and cleared the tree branches. At the bottom, the police found a black plastic bag and a yellow plastic bag both at the bottom of the other pit.\n\nBoth bags were brought to the surface and opened. In the black bag, the police found human intestines, liver, heart and lungs. The liver had a piece of it cut off and the heart was also missing a piece of it. Inside the yellow bag, police found two human hands and feet. Lehlohonolo told police that there were more body parts deeper and to the side of the latrine so police had to break up a pair of concrete slabs behind the latrine and then dig down into it. There a human leg and human head resting on a pile of feces were removed from the latrine. After the head was cleaned off it was shown to local bystanders who identified it as Kamohelo Mohata.\n\nOn July 12, Kamohelo's brother was returning home from his high school only to see two strangers waiting at his home and asked him when he had last seen Kamohelo. The two men were police officers and they then began questioning him about the various text messages he had received. The officers asked for his cell phone which he gave to them. Lastly, they asked for a \"senior family member\" to which he provided him with the name of his uncle. The brother's uncle was contacted and he arrived soon later. The police then talked to him away from Kamohelo's brother and he later watched him leave with the police. He was shown the head and clothing and he too identified the remains as Kamohelo. Kamohelo's brother also identified Lehlohonolo as the man who kept visiting his home.\n\nOn July 14, the police conducted another search of the home and went to what looked to be a Storage Room, one that was messy and hadn't been cleaned in a while. It didn't take long at all for the police to notice a cardboard sheet with blood stains and a brown box with blood stains on it too. The police found a blood-stained knife, hacksaw and a blue school jersey with a badge on it which belonged to Kamohelo. Various other relevant items like a long thin wire and sellotape were found.\n\nLehlohonolo then led police to his bedroom and showed them blue jeans with dried blood stains on the knees and thighs, underwear with a Jockey label on it and a black belt. He told police that these belonged to Moholobela Seetsa and were positively identified as such by his parents. Lastly, he led police to the ravines and accurately pointed out the precise location where Moholoba's remains had been buried and led them to another region of the ravines and told them more remains were buried there. Police dug up that location and found a black plastic bag and upon opening it, they were greeted by Kamohelo's torso which had been slit open to remove the organs. According to some reports he confessed to eating a portion of Kamohelo's heart and as some of Moholobela's remains remained undiscovered, many drew their own conclusions.\n\nLehlohonolo was charged with two counts of murder while his mother, Malehlohonolo was charged with aiding him in these crimes with the prosecution alleging that the two murders were indeed ritual murders. After news broke and became public the two were already in police custody so the locals instead took their anger and rage out on their property with an angry mob destroying their home and setting it on fire.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[The Scott's destroyed home](https://preview.redd.it/puznl9ul0klc1.png?width=300&format=png&auto=webp&s=ecd7809ca317fa8b9c8b81a8e61ced581f4e09be)\n\nThe two were remanded to custody but on September 22, both applied for bail. Lehlohonolo, though, didn't feel like waiting. On October 14, 2012, a guard at Maseru Central Prison was walking by his cell to wake up the inmates for the morning when he found Lehlohonolo's cell empty. Exactly how Lehlohonolo managed to pull this off has still never been entirely determined but there is a reasonable suspicion and it is all but impossible that he did it alone and without any help.\n\nWhen his cell was investigated it was found that the bars to the cell were very greasy and an open container of Vaseline was lying on the floor. Lehlohonolo had likely covered himself in Vaseline and slipped through the bars of his cell. They also found greasy fingerprints on the prison roof, too greasy to actually lift the prints. This was a major embarrassment though and many including police believed that some prison officials likely aided in his escape to explain how he somehow walked out of the gate and walls of the prison without being seen. 8 prison officials were suspended as a result of his escape. Six out of those 8 would later file lawsuits of their own against the warden and the government for defamation and scapegoating them asking for 500 000 Loti each.\n\nRegardless of however Lehlohonolo pulled it off, his escape made him Lesotho's number one most wanted fugitive and later an international one as Lesotho filed an Interpol red notice and began working closely with South African authorities as police believed he fled to Lesotho's only neighbour. A massive manhunt was locally as well with next to no stone being left unturned and a reward of 60,000 Lesotho loti being offered for anyone who could provide information leading to his arrest. Meanwhile, despite her son's escape, his mother Malehlohonolo was granted bail in August 2013 and held in an undisclosed location with her relatives in order to protect her from lynchings.\n\nOn November 7, 2013, the people of Lesotho finally had hope that he had been recaptured when the Correctional and Justice Minister, Mophato Monyake went on record claiming that he was arrested in South Africa while working in Cape Town at a construction company and would be extradited in 2 weeks time. And yet, there was no news and Lehlohonolo was conveniently being held in an \"undisclosed location\" near Cape Town. The police also denied ever hearing about his arrest. As it turns out, he had likely lied to boost his political career, Especially since he took most of the credit for the arrest. Even Lesotho's own prime minister went on record to deny his arrest. The final nail in the coffin came when South African police likewise denied having Lehlohonolo in their custody.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[The picture used for Lehlohonolo's wanted notice](https://preview.redd.it/ephjeu0u0klc1.png?width=1356&format=png&auto=webp&s=8c9eb5b194bef90136223fe04656c7d3d6928432)\n\nThankfully, Lehlohonolo's real arrest wouldn't take much longer. On April 6, 2014, the residents of Amanzimtoti, located in the KwaZulu-Natal Province of South Africa were shocked when the police went to arrest a member of their Church Band, a man named Joseph Mokhele who lived on the Church Premises. People were in such disbelief that some parishioners and those working at the church even attempted to obstruct the police and prevent them from entering. But eventually they did and Joseph was placed under arrest. Was one may have guessed, Joseph Mokhele was the alias of Lehlohonolo Scott who was described as shocked when the police arrived. While in South Africa, not only did he use that fake name he also as mentioned lived in the church as a member of their band/choir and was attending a computer college course in Durban. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n[A picture of Lehlohonolo during his time in South Africa](https://preview.redd.it/vrffdxvw0klc1.png?width=482&format=png&auto=webp&s=6af060f619d123ef9167b66967aebd8a2f9e75a8)\n\nLehlohonolo's extradition hearing was held at the Durban Magistrate’s Court and his extradition dragged on for a year. First of all, before any hearings even began, the police in Lesotho had to give assurance that they would not pursue the death penalty, otherwise South African courts would refuse to extradite him. This became an even bigger problem once the South African Courts heard Lehlohonolo's defence, he insisted that Joseph Mokhele was his real name and that he was a South African national and even went so far as to provide identification and an alleged birth certificate to prove it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Lehlohonolo arguing against extradition in a South African court.](https://preview.redd.it/hkfxotoz0klc1.png?width=800&format=png&auto=webp&s=8ade8db03ea5972714d77462f2bdac2930867a8e)\n\nAccording to him, he lived in Ficksburg until he was 12 and that his parents divorced causing him to live with his mother alone. He continued by telling the judge that all of his relatives likewise lived in South Africa having a sister and younger brother in Ficksburg, and an aunt in Carletonville. To further prove his nationality he presented the court with a bursary which he claimed could only be received if South African citizenship was obtained. He further claimed that he wished to continue his studies if released. The prosecutor, meanwhile argued that all of this was forged and that these alleged relatives didn't exist. For proof, they provided attendance records from his primary school in Maseru which recorded him as a student. The extradition case didn't end until May 5, 2015, when sitting Magistrate Vanitha Armu, concluded that there was enough evidence that he was a citizen of Lesotho and ordered his extradition. But that extradition didn't take place until October 21, and when he returned to Lesotho it was under very heavy security. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n[The security around the car driving Lehlohonolo to court](https://preview.redd.it/fdrjw8g21klc1.png?width=308&format=png&auto=webp&s=ff24c78957b211edcd0a37a78fcf66c3103aab3d)\n\n[A picture of Lehlohonolo in that car](https://preview.redd.it/00n7nxi31klc1.png?width=219&format=png&auto=webp&s=db6a9ad1757491ac136a405248a13dbb9ff2675e)\n\nUpon arriving back in Lesotho, he was immediately brought to court to be charged with 2 counts of murder and one count of escaping from prison. His mother, Malehlohonolo Scott was also charged with two counts of being an accessory to murder. Afterwards, he was remanded back to prison but under 24-hour solitary confinement. Lehlohonolo made several bizarre claims during his hearings such as how he was somehow innocent and that the police beat and tortured him into confessing going so far as to place him into a metal drum and heating the outside of it. According to him, he was beaten as soon as he left the taxi with his mother being threatened if he didn't confess. He further added that they tried to goad him into implicating important and high-powered people, obviously, no one believed him and he threatened not to sue the police but instead to \"butcher\" them as a remedy. He also accused the police of planting the remains and clothing of the two and bringing Lehlohonolo over and instructing him to point them out.\n\nBut Lehlohonolo's defences got even more bizarre when he would go so far as to deny even escaping from prison. According to him a group of hooded men dressed in black tracksuits either snuck or broke into the prison and made it to his cell undetected. They then injected him with something causing him to pass out. When he woke up he was in South Africa. That claim was understandably dismissed as nonsense while witnesses were called to testify how Lehlohonolo was informed of his rights and that he was fully willing during the search. They were completely calm during their depositions in 2012 and medical examinations conducted after their arrest showed the two completely uninjured.\n\nThe trial began on April 12, 2016, but it would be delayed several times. Lehlohonolo and Malehlohonolo's lawyer who had been representing them since 2012 withdrew from the case. He accused the judge and court of having a bias against him, they held hearings without informing him they were to take place, allowed dubiously obtained evidence and wouldn't recuse himself despite his impartiality being in question, in fact, the lawyer took this a step further and said that no judge in Lesotho would be unbias and that a foreign judge needed to preside over the case. The judge for his part also admonished the prosecution for refusing to share evidence with the defence.\n\nThe departure of the Scott's lawyer from the case caused the trial to be delayed until a new attorney could be assigned to them. Lehlohonolo rejected the new lawyer and their original lawyer changed his mind about withdrawing from the case as Lehlohonolo and Malehlohonolo insisted that they only wanted him to represent them. Once the next court hearing began, his lawyer again did not show up to court. When he attended the next hearing Lehlohonolo's opinion of his lawyer suddenly changed as he did not want him to represent him anymore since he said he didn't trust him and didn't know how he came to be his lawyer despite being a government-appointed lawyer paid to represent them and then refused to let him represent him and his mother leading to another delay. Eventually, he would let his lawyer represent him again even when said lawyer was arrested for fraud in a completely unrelated manner and thus had to represent the two whilst undergoing his own trial.\n\nLehlohonolo continued his claims of being a scapegoat stating that the police targeted him on account of his political views. He said that when he left his house on the morning of July 12, 2012, that pick-up truck was not on his property and that he never owned such a vehicle with no registration papers ever provided to prove ownership. He was given a phone call saying that the police were waiting for him so he go a taxi to his home. The taxi came to a stop for repairs and so Lehlohonolo exited the vehicle when he saw two men running towards him. They began attacking him and insulting him although what exactly was said was stated to be so insane that the newspapers described them as \"unprintable\" and court documents don't elaborate either. He was ordered to lie down and was continuously attacked and insulted. They later forced him to his feet and began dragging him towards his house beating and hitting him the whole way there. Once they got close to his house they robbed him of his cell phone and loti. Lehlohonolo accused these men of being police. During his testimony, he made elaborate gestures and appeared to take joy in telling his story to the court.\n\nThe only witness called to support his claim of being tortured was another inmate who testified that when he first arrived at jail he was too injured to even do basic tasks himself and that he was heavily bloodied. But during cross-examination, he couldn't keep the story straight especially in regards to Lehlohonolo's face. He claimed that initially his face was heavily bloodied and still bleeding, only to later say that it was dried blood and after further prodding claimed that he was only slightly bleeding. Lehlohonolo's brother was also called to testify but he only described minor injuries that could not be proven to be from police torture.\n\nMalehlohonolo also testified, she claimed that she was arrested during her job at a nearby university and that after her arrest she was brought home where the police conducted a search of her home and according to her, they found nothing and thus also believed all the evidence and body parts were planted.\n\nThroughout 2017 the case would be delayed several more times for various reasons such as Lehlohonolo going on hunger strike, making severe allegations while in court and his mother's ailing health leading to her being deemed unfit to stand trial, at least on a temporary basis. On November 2, 2018, the judge finally ruled that his claims of police torture had no merit and on October 29, 2019, was the last day of the trial before the wait for the verdict and Lehlohonolo did not appear to be even slightly concerned and was even smiling during that fearing. On March 23, 2020, Lehlohonolo was found guilty on all charges while his mother Malehlohonolo could not be proven to have been an active participant in the killings beyond a reasonable doubt and thus was found not guilty of murder but was convicted of being an accessory.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Lehlohonolo in the Lesotho High Court](https://preview.redd.it/284q1vd61klc1.png?width=360&format=png&auto=webp&s=7862b33ea7e0599fc21fc24c1c94cdccbf48363e)\n\n \n\nOn June 23, 2020, the judge passed down the sentences. He stated that Lehlohonolo deserved the death penalty but respected the agreement made with South Africa and instead sentenced him to two life sentences with no possibility for parole as well as an additional 5 years for escaping from prison. Malehlohonolo was slapped with a 10-year sentence with three of those years being suspended. on November 14, 2022, he appealed this conviction. There have been no updates since this appeal but the judge chided him for being disrespectful.\n\n***Sources***\n\n[***https://media.lesotholii.org/files/judgments/lshc/2020/6/2020-lshc-6.pdf***](https://media.lesotholii.org/files/judgments/lshc/2020/6/2020-lshc-6.pdf)\n\n[***https://www.iol.co.za/news/south-africa/kwazulu-natal/fugitive-murder-accused-nabbed-in-church-1680282***](https://www.iol.co.za/news/south-africa/kwazulu-natal/fugitive-murder-accused-nabbed-in-church-1680282)\n\n[***https://www.thepost.co.ls/news/lawyer-says-scott-innocent/***](https://www.thepost.co.ls/news/lawyer-says-scott-innocent/)\n\n[***https://www.news24.com/news24/lesotho-man-who-chopped-up-2-people-seeks-bail-20140424***](https://www.news24.com/news24/lesotho-man-who-chopped-up-2-people-seeks-bail-20140424)\n\n[***https://sundayexpress.co.ls/unshackle-scotts-mum-says-lawyer/***](https://sundayexpress.co.ls/unshackle-scotts-mum-says-lawyer/)\n\n[***https://www.thepost.co.ls/local-news/ive-sinned-pray-for-me-says-scott/***](https://www.thepost.co.ls/local-news/ive-sinned-pray-for-me-says-scott/)\n\n[***https://www.maserumetro.com/news/news/court-orders-mrs-scott-to-answer-for-murder/***](https://www.maserumetro.com/news/news/court-orders-mrs-scott-to-answer-for-murder/)\n\n[***https://www.maserumetro.com/news/news/scotts-judgment-on-november-5/***](https://www.maserumetro.com/news/news/scotts-judgment-on-november-5/)\n\n[***https://www.thepost.co.ls/news/correctional-officers-sue-boss-over-scott-escape/***](https://www.thepost.co.ls/news/correctional-officers-sue-boss-over-scott-escape/)\n\n[***https://www.maserumetro.com/news/news/court-gets-closer-to-main-trial-against-scott/***](https://www.maserumetro.com/news/news/court-gets-closer-to-main-trial-against-scott/)\n\n[***https://maserumetro.com/media/digital-edition/scott-escapes-noose/20200625093812.pdf***](https://maserumetro.com/media/digital-edition/scott-escapes-noose/20200625093812.pdf)\n\n[***Guilty Scott to be sentenced - Metro News (maserumetro.com)***](https://maserumetro.com/news/news/guilty-scott-to-be-sentenced/)\n\n[***Scott guilty as charged, says judge - The Post***](https://www.thepost.co.ls/local-news/scott-guilty-as-charged-says-judge/)\n\n[***Scott to spend life behind bars - Metro News (maserumetro.com)***](https://maserumetro.com/news/news/scott-to-spend-life-behind-bars/)\n\n[***https://publiceyenews.com/2022/11/22/he-deserves-no-clemency/***](https://publiceyenews.com/2022/11/22/he-deserves-no-clemency/)\n\n[***https://www.news24.com/news24/lesotho-murder-accused-born-in-sa-20140515***](https://www.news24.com/news24/lesotho-murder-accused-born-in-sa-20140515)\n\n[***https://www.maserumetro.com/news/news/missing-scott-disrupts-judgment/***](https://www.maserumetro.com/news/news/missing-scott-disrupts-judgment/)\n\n[***https://www.thepost.co.ls/local-news/vaseline-story-nonsense-says-lawyer/***](https://www.thepost.co.ls/local-news/vaseline-story-nonsense-says-lawyer/)\n\n[***https://sundayexpress.co.ls/koalabata-villagers-still-live-in-fear-despite-scotts-arrest/***](https://sundayexpress.co.ls/koalabata-villagers-still-live-in-fear-despite-scotts-arrest/)\n\n[***https://www.saps.gov.za/newsroom/msspeechdetail.php?nid=1824***](https://www.saps.gov.za/newsroom/msspeechdetail.php?nid=1824)\n\n[***https://lestimes.com/?s=Lehlohonolo+Scott***](https://lestimes.com/?s=Lehlohonolo+Scott)",

      "text": "On the afternoon of February 5, 2024, 19 year old Conner Kobold was arrested for attempted murder and aggravated battery for strangling his mother, Shanelle Burns, in her bed. After strangling her, causing \"substantial brain damage\", he went outside and called police several times telling dispatch to send a car. The Valparaiso Police Department responded to the call.\n\nKobold told police as soon as they arrived to handcuff him and put him the back of a squad car. While in the vehicle he told an officer that there \"was a dead person in the house on the corner\" further saying \"I killed somebody in that house\".\n\nUpon entering the house that Kobold and his mother lived in, police found Shanelle in her bed, not breathing and with no pulse. Police noticed signs of a struggle in the room. She was rushed to the hospital where doctors determined her injuries \"put her in grave danger\". Shanelle unfortunately died two days later on February 7th. An autopsy revealed the cause of death to be asphyxiation secondary to strangulation and ruled a homicide.\n\nShanelle had served Kobold with an eviction notice that day (February 5th).\n\nKobold's charges were upgraded to Murder after the autopsy results.\n\nIn his mugshot you can see scratch marks on his face.\n\nHe has plead Not Guilty and has a pretrial conference scheduled for July 8th and jury trial set for August 6th.\n\nETA: I work in within the legal sphere (not in criminal law) so I may be able to keep up with this case and share updates as time goes on.\n\nSources:\n\n[https://truecrimedaily.com/2024/02/12/conner-kobold-murder-mother-shanelle-burns-strangle-battery-indiana-chicago-illinois/](https://truecrimedaily.com/2024/02/12/conner-kobold-murder-mother-shanelle-burns-strangle-battery-indiana-chicago-illinois/)\n\n[https://fox59.com/indiana-news/yeah-i-killed-somebody-indiana-man-accused-of-giving-mother-brain-damage-after-eviction-notice/](https://fox59.com/indiana-news/yeah-i-killed-somebody-indiana-man-accused-of-giving-mother-brain-damage-after-eviction-notice/)",

      "title": "Community Mourns as Unsolved Murder of Amelia Wilson Marks a Dark Chapter in Its History",
      "text": "Charles Town, WV – On August 27, 1969, Charles Town, a small town known for its serene landscapes and historic significance, was shaken by the brutal murder of 33-year-old Amelia Wilson. A beloved local and a mother of two, Wilson was attacked near her home after finishing her shift at the Charles Town Race Track. Despite immediate medical attention, she succumbed to her injuries, leaving a community in mourning and a case that remains unsolved to this day.\n\nWilson, who was returning to her apartment at the Fritts Apartments, suffered a severe head wound in an assault that left no witnesses and few clues. The Charles Town Police Department, alongside the West Virginia State Police, launched an investigation into the murder, which has perplexed authorities for over five decades.\n\nBorn Amelia Kathleen Braithwaite in Berkeley County, Wilson was a respected member of the Charles Town community, known for her hardworking nature and devotion to her sons. Her murder not only robbed her family of a loving mother but also exposed the vulnerabilities of small-town America to senseless violence.\n\nThe investigation uncovered a baffling scene: Wilson's clothing had been taken off and was neatly placed on a fence near where her body was found, deepening the mystery of the crime. Despite this, autopsy reports showed no evidence of sexual assault. Remarkably, a substantial amount of tip money Wilson earned that night was left untouched by her assailant. Without any clear motive or robbery, and no definitive evidence to connect anyone to the crime, police from both local and state departments followed numerous leads over the years. Various individuals came under suspicion, yet none were charged due to a lack of sufficient evidence.\n\nIn the aftermath of the tragedy, Wilson's sons, Gary and Steven, were left to navigate a world without their mother. The community rallied around the family, albeit briefly, with efforts to raise funds for the bereaved children. However, the long-term impacts of Wilson's murder on her sons' lives underscore the profound effects of such a loss. Gary's path veered into legal troubles, while Steven managed to carve out a stable life for himself after years of upheaval.\n\nRecent efforts to re-examine the case have been hampered by the lack of available records. The Charles Town Police Department, Jefferson County Sheriff's Department, and West Virginia State Police have all reported that documents related to the Wilson case have been lost or were never retained, severely limiting the chances of a breakthrough.\n\nAs the years have passed, the murder of Amelia Wilson has transitioned from a current investigation to a cold case, with newer generations in Charles Town largely unaware of the tragedy. Yet, for those who remember, and especially for Wilson's family, the quest for answers and justice continues. The story of Amelia Wilson remains a poignant reminder of the enduring impact of unsolved crimes on families and communities, highlighting the critical need for diligence and persistence in law enforcement's efforts to solve such cases.\n\n**Discussion Points**:\n\n* What are your thoughts on the peculiar detail of the assailant carefully removing and placing Amelia's clothing without any signs of sexual assault or theft of cash? How does this aspect influence your theories about the motive behind the crime?\n* Considering there were no similar crimes reported in the area before or after Amelia's murder, do you think it's possible that the attacker was not a local but someone who came for the race at the racetrack where Amelia worked? Could the assailant have followed her home that night?\n* With the apparent absence of case files and official records, do you believe Amelia Wilson's case is unsolvable? What impact does the lack of documentation have on the ability to revisit and potentially solve cold cases like this one?\n\n**Third Party Sources**:\n\n* [Project Cold Case](https://database.projectcoldcase.org/?name=amelia+wilson&gender=&race=&age=&city=charles+town&state=&zip=&county=&weapon=&offense=&status=&year=&lea=&reported_min=&reported_max=&more=)\n* [Mrs. Amelia Wilson Attacked, Killed By Unknown Assailant](https://imgur.com/lg0aW2T), Spirit of Jefferson Farmers Advocate, Thursday, August 28, 1969\n* [Charles Town Woman Is Murdered](https://imgur.com/Ppaguok), The Cumberland News, Friday, August 29, 1969\n* [Crime Apparently Paying: Two-Year-Old Murder Unsolved](https://imgur.com/Fltjco6), Doug Coombs, The Morning Herald, Tuesday, August 31, 1971",

      "text": "[Bell's mugshot on death row](https://preview.redd.it/xvupsif20lhc1.jpg?width=838&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=50269dfd1c0cdd7aa00fee00ffa9bffa91b05921)\n\nBell had a long criminal history. At the age of 15, he was convicted of sodomy, and was incarcerated in a juvenile detention center until he turned 21. In his adulthood, he developed an addiction to heroin and cocaine, and turned to any means necessary to acquire those drugs.\n\nOn one day in 1992, Bell made the decision to steal his girlfriend’s television set to sell for money that he intended to spend on cocaine. He snuck into their apartment and found her son, 11 year old Joey Anderson, watching a show on the TV he was after. To get him out of the way, Bell stabbed the boy to death, and ran off with his target.\n\nA day later, Bell randomly approached a traffic officer with a newspaper article on Joey’s murder in hand, and tried to deny that he was responsible for the killing. Due to the strangely specifically details that he included in his denials and his erratic behavior, the suspicious officer arrested Bell. After being questioned by the detectives, he confessed to the murder.\n\nIn the following trial, Bell tried to use an insanity defense. He claimed that the murder was committed while he was under a drug induced psychotic state. It failed to convince the courts, and his defense team’s proposed deal for a life without parole sentence was rejected by the district attorney.\n\nBell was condemned in 1994, and currently remains on California’s death row. Due to the stalemated battles among Californian legislators regarding the state’s capital punishment law, it currently remains uncertain if Bell’s sentence will actually be carried out.\n\nSources:\n\n1.[https://www.courts.ca.gov/documents/1-s151362-petitioner-amended-pet-writ-hc-062209.pdf](https://www.courts.ca.gov/documents/1-s151362-petitioner-amended-pet-writ-hc-062209.pdf) (see page 16)\n\n2.[http://www.metnews.com/articles/2007/bell021607.htm](http://www.metnews.com/articles/2007/bell021607.htm)\n\n3.[https://scocal.stanford.edu/opinion/people-v-bell-33702](https://scocal.stanford.edu/opinion/people-v-bell-33702)\n\n4.[https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1992-06-06-me-367-story.html](https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1992-06-06-me-367-story.html) (warning, paywall)",

What kind of degrees or background are best for this career? Also, what does the job market look like for civilian CSIs, and is it competitive?\n\nIf anyone here is in the field or has gone through the process, I’d really appreciate hearing your advice and experiences. \n\n(also what other jobs might I like)",

Some of you might know that in Britain we have quite a problem with gangs and unruly youths.\n\nIn the North, people often say that it's because we don't have \"bobbies on the beat\" anymore doing community policing, and also because the police don't have enough powers anymore so nerdowells aren't scared of them and do what they want.\n\nLately I've been wondering, would having these things make Britain safer? Is community policing and a more empowered police force that effective or is this folksy wishful thinking?\n\nI know that when I went to South Korea and China there were a lot of extra police around, and they say the crime rates are much lower there. But I wonder how much of that is down to policing technique as opposed to cultural differences.",

      "text": "I'm all for police. Are they all perfect? No. But they do a hard job, and most of them do it pretty good. Don't be an a-hole and you are not going to end up on a viral video about police brutality. Don't be a dick, and you probably won't be treated like a criminal (unless, of course, you are one).\n\nThat said, it seems police are unable to effectively combat violent crime and protect citizens. As an example, I submit the \"Whispering Pines\" apartment building that is being terrorized by a Venezuelan gang. Multiple instances of violent crime committed by this gang have been reported, included beatings, attempted murder, sex trafficking, illegal weapons possession, drugs, extortion, etc. This in addition to lesser crimes such as trespass and vandalism that seem rather paltry in comparison. At this point, reports coming out paint the picture of an apartment building that has been entirely taken over by the gang.\n\nYet, police are \"still investigating\". Come on! There are video's of armed gang members in the hallway banging on a tenants door! Reports from multiple people. Some gang members arrested on their way to murder the property manager who just wanted to collect past-due rent. So much evidence. What is there to investigate? It seems time to get in there and clear these criminals out so the tenants and property owners can live in peace!\n\nHowever, police departments are so tethered by red tape and other obstacles they seem impotent against such crime. Unable to respond to these situations in an appropriate and timely fashion.\n\nThis is being exasperated by the current politics that make it very difficult for a citizen to legally defend themselves against violent criminals, without facing severe legal consequences and fees if they effectively defend themselves. So, the police can't help you and you can't help yourself. At least not without facing possible financial ruin or even jail time. The system seems to be severely broken, with the citizens paying the price while the criminals win.\n\nWhat do you think?",

      "text": "Hi community, I have been a defendant (a litigant in person) in a case in the civil courts, against a ‘company claimant’, who I owed no debt to. I lost the case at trial upon a ‘document’ (which was never seen before), but turned up in the solicitor’s ‘trial bundle’ which was submitted by them as ‘key evidence’ against me.\n\nThe ‘document’ was a “print-copy,” allegedly written by the ‘claimant company owner’ to the solicitor, stating that I owed a debt to his company. After trial, I had received the “digital original” of that same ‘document’ in PDF format. On closer visual appearance, the “digital original” looked suspicious, with formatting and structural inconsistencies. On closer examination of the “print-copy”, (which is an exact copy of the “digital original”), I noticed the same issues.\n\nI contacted the claimant company owner, who stated that he did not write that ‘document’ which they submitted to the court, and he did not even undertake the claim against me, because there was ‘no debt’ owed by me to his company. (The company owner then kindly provided a Witness Statement confirming this, and that although his name and signature appears on the ‘document’; he did not write it!).\n\nI then had the digital document analysed forensically, and it was found that the ‘document’ is a forgery, with the internal data linking it to a solicitor in the firm who had forged it.\n\nThe Forensic Report and the Witness Statement I believe is “proof beyond all reasonable doubt”.\n\nThe police initially began the investigation, but was stopped by Action Fraud SPOC who advised them that ‘Forgery’ and ‘Perverting the Course of Justice’ are civil offences, and they should not investigate any further.\n\nBefore contacting the Police, I had begun a case with Action Fraud who advised me that this matter was “to serious for them to undertake”, and it must be sent to the Police directly. (Action Fraud also stated to me that as these Solicitors do not appear as having undertaken any past crimes, they cannot move forward), which is completely ridiculous, because if they have only been caught in the act now, how would there be any ‘past crime?’\n\nI then took it to the Police, and Action Fraud stopped the investigation, advising ‘them’ that these “crimes” are civil offences!\n\nI have made contact with the OPCC for the area, but they are telling me to make a complaint against the Police, which effectively comes back to the OPCC 28 days or so later, to look at - so I am trying to cut through red tape here.\n\nForgery and perverting the course of justice are clearly “crimes”.\n\nGiven that I live in London, should it be the Met who undertake this matter? The Met sent it to the area of the country which these solicitors reside in?\n\nIf these solicitors are not held accountable for their “crimes”, the public are being placed at significant risk of their further criminal actions! The law is in fact, allowing them to continue upon their criminal acts, without facing any criminal accountability whatsoever!\n\nAction Fraud, from my perspective; are inept service to handle such complex fraud, and the Police are a public body and need to catch these criminals.\n\nThe current sentencing guidelines state that Perverting the Course of Justice by someone in the public trust is a ‘culpability A’ offence, the highest of its kind!\n\nDoes anyone have any advice they can provide, as these solicitors cannot be allowed to “get away” with their crimes, and continue in the public domain without facing the criminal arm of the law’.",

It includes fear of crime and a variety of additional topics\n\nSee [**Violent and Property Crime Rates In The U.S.** ](https://www.crimeinamerica.net/crime-rates-united-states/)for the full report.\n\nI have close to 40 years of experience summarizing crime data for presidents, governors, organizations, the media, and everyday people. I provided crime and criminal justice data during thousands of media interviews.\n\nI summarized crime and justice issues for dignitaries and practitioners when I worked for two US Department of Justice-funded agencies, The National Criminal Justice Reference Service (senior specialist for crime prevention) and the National Crime Prevention Council (director of information services). \n\nI supplied overviews of crime and criminal justice topics to every national and international media source for 35 years as a director of public information for state criminal justice agencies and the national entities cited above.\n\nI take the complicated topics of crime and justice and offer observations and research summations that the non-criminologist can understand based on my academic and criminal justice experience including six years in law enforcement.\n\nThere is significant intricacy when discussing crime statistics.  Analyzing crime becomes complex because readers must go to multiple reports or locations to understand primary sources.\n\nI try to answer most crime and fear of crime questions [here](https://www.crimeinamerica.net/crime-rates-united-states/).\n\n**Contents**\n\nPage 1: Subsections Of This Report\n\nPage 2: Context For This Report–What You Need to Understand\n\nPage 3: Property Crime\n\nPage 4 Summations Of Recent Crime Data, 2021-2024\n\nPage 5: Historic Lows For Crime\n\nPage 6: Crime Data From City Police Crime Dashboards\n\nPage 7: FBI’s New Method Of Collecting and Reporting Crime Data\n\nPage 8: Explaining The Bureau of Justice Statistics (BJS) National Crime Victimization Survey\n\nPage 9: Who’s Impacted By Crime?\n\nPage 10: Violent Crime Never Increased?\n\nPage 11: We Have Never Lived In Safer Times?\n\nPage 12: The Complexity Of Crime Statistics\n\nPage 13: Fear Of Crime\n\nPage 14: Identity Theft-Cybercrime\n\nPage 15: Federal Crime Data Presented Before National Elections\n\nPage 16: Repeat Victimizations\n\nPage 17: Brief Summations of FBI and National Crime Victimization Survey Data By Year\n\nPage 18: Extended Summations Of FBI and National Crime Victimization Survey Data By Year\n\nPage 19: Links To Sources For FBI and National Crime Victimization Survey Data By Year\n\nPage 20: Data From Gallup\n\nPage 21:Three National Measures of Violence-The FBI, the National Crime Victimization Survey, And Gallup\n\nPage 22: Appendix-Media Reports on Crime\n\n**Conclusions**\n\nThis report was designed to be of service to the average reader.

      "text": "In June 2025, I tried to apply for disability-related support at the Employment and Income Assistance (EIA) office in Winnipeg. I followed instructions, attended appointments, and waited multiple days—10 days without help—to complete my file.\n\nOn June 16, a Winnipeg Police officer called me and said they wanted to “chat” about my visit to the EIA office. I told her I had waited peacefully and had documentation and recordings proving that I followed all the rules. She said I could return to the office the next morning to finalize my paperwork.\n\nI did exactly what she said.\n\nOn June 17, I went to the EIA office to speak with a manager. Instead, I was handed a letter barring me from the premises—as if I were a violent person. I went to 245 Smith Street, the Winnipeg Police office, to ask why I had been treated this way and to file a complaint.\n\nThere, a second officer told me:\n\n“Stop being the victim.”\n“You were a victim three years ago. That doesn’t mean you can act up now.”\n“You caused a disturbance. That’s why you were barred.”\n\nWhen I tried to explain what really happened, the officer refused to listen, refused to take a complaint, and refused to give me their name or badge number. I have audio recordings of everything. Their words were retraumatizing. I was calm. I was respectful. But because I am a trauma survivor who dared to speak up, I was labeled as “dangerous.”\n\nNot a single part of this process felt fair.\nNot a single public official protected me.\nInstead, I was isolated, gaslit, dismissed, and now cut off from public assistance—as if I had done something wrong.\n\nIf you’re a victim: know that you are not alone. And if you work in public service: remember that retraumatizing a victim can do more damage than the original crime.\n\nI will not be silent.\nI will not be erased.\nAnd I will keep telling the truth.",

I'm not an extremely alpha person so obviously military/ police officers are. Anyways, I've been on patrol since and when I first broke out I was very proactive. I began loving the job and was selected to go to a street crime unit shortly after for a while. I didn't like the kind of people there cause they were alpha times 100. I came back to patrol and tried other units. I started getting annoyed always talking about training. I noticed I don't enjoy that stuff as much as other officers. I became upset of still after the military working shitty hours, missing holidays, and family time. I was lucky enough to get 100% with VA a while after academy so I've always felt I'm just one bad day away. LONG STORY SHORT. If anyone else here had the financial stability like I do with VA and fell out of love with this job. Would you stay or leave? Or am I just being negative about everything? I put in my two weeks for an admin job I got hired for I'm excited for. It pays less but risk vs reward. I just need reassurance I'm not making the wrong decision.

      "text": "My city has changed policies to not policing petty crime as harshly. So, a bunch of small time petty scammers making very little money are getting replaced by violent hardened criminals making little money long term to a lot for a month, before going to prison for 20 to 30 years. But, people end up dead from waiting that long to address the problem. \n\nThe nation of Japan solved this problem like 500 years ago. Of course, their solution is unconstitutional. What the samurai did was summarily execute the violent criminals and rude people, while institutionalizing organized crime to be an arm of the government and the police. So today they have almost no crime, unless it's between Yakuza, or a politician does something the Yakuza views as bad for the people of Japan. (The Yakuza and police frequently work together to solve societal problems as the Liberal Democrat Party,ruling party of Japan, is closely tied to the Yakuza. Reforms have gone through to reduce Yakuza excesses.) Everyone is as polite and real nice to each other, and if someone steals your bike a relative will make him return it to you. Obviously Japan's solution does not work in the US.\n\nPreviously, there was a policy of containment to keep the criminals in specific ghettos by turning off direct public transit to where they live, and requiring multiple transfers to reach he heart of the city. So, how can this problem be solved long term by enabling the police to prosecute petty crime? Obviously, encouraging a culture where you don't rob people also helps. What else could be done?",

      "text": "Hello everybody and welcome to our little discussion, I really hope for great discussion and interesting opinions on this topic/video.\n\nI just came across this short on YouTube and what really caught my attention, isn't really the behavior (ofc the off duty officer acted like an absolut boss). But rather the comments and opinions on this post. I'll post some of them here, so everybody is able to understand what I’m talking about, or at least understand where I’m coming from. I’ll try to format, so if I fail please excuse my silly mistakes. \n\n>We need more men like this officer. Strong confident men create safe society.\n\n>100% understanding. 0% hesitation. What a GOAT\n\n> We need more Police Officers like him, smooth, confident and precise.\n\n> The officer really said \"not today buddy it's my Day off\"\n\nHere’s the link for the video so you can check it out yourself and get a better insight. \n\nhttps://youtube.com/shorts/jTs_OILkxDE?si=NsM15BVvJZWGsrQW\n\n**I support law enforcement officers, paramedics, firefighters… (been a Paramedic myself) I live in Germany and they generally try to do a decent job, of course i had some experiences, in which I felt uncomfortable or thought there might be a better way to behave and communicate. But we’re all humans after all. I support their work if they fulfill their procedures according to the law and treat people according to the situation.** \n\nSo know to the real topic of my post. After I watched the video, I thought to myself, “this guy got some serious balls, to be sure the thief wouldn’t try anything funny and put him or others in danger.” That’s when I read the comments I wanted to know what other people think and I stumbled across the ones I’ve posted. \n\nIn the current situation (ofc it depends on the country you’re from), I’ve kinda felt like there is an uprising in violent behavior and hate crimes towards people in uniform. Especially towards police in general. In Germany the outburst of knife attacks escalated and in recent months officers got critically injured more than ever. (Knife crimes are a rising problem in a lot of other places I know) but I feel like the hate shifted a lot towards police a lot. 12/13 year olds tag the city with “acab” and show their resentment towards officers. The far left extremism feels more  mainstream than ever before, same goes for the right wing. They all share hate towards the police. But the violence gotten worse imo and it’s become mainstream to openly share your hatred towards police. \n\nWith the uprise of Social Media (SM), more videos and pictures about misuse of power towards civilians receives a broader audience than ever before. Anytime I open any SM platform I feel like there has been an indoctrination of people that hating on the law enforcement officers is okay, calling them names, flipping them off, throwing things at them, attacking them, trying to harm them on purpose to do as much damage as humanly possible as soon as their is a chance to let out all the stored up anger towards police. \n\nBut why is that? Is it with the uprising and wildly accessibility to SM and the Internet, where people get unfiltered access to information and misinformations? Is it a narrative people try to paint towards police? Why are so many younger generations fell the strong urge to fight against well established systems, to not obey blindly? Have people gotten more aware about the long time power abuse and mistreatment for no apparent reason? \n\n**TLDR: what’s the reason for the uprising hate and violence towards police and people in uniforms (FF, paramedics,…), and why has it spread into so many’s different age and social classes. What could be the main cause and driving factor behind the sometimes blind hate?**\n\n **im not talking about the law enforcement officers which deserve to be treated like shit, rather about the general hate, which is not aimed at somebody particular but rather at the\nprofession at being part of the police** \n \nThank you so much for taking your precious time to engage in this discussion, I’d love to read your opinion and experiences with this topic. Thank you so so much for reading this long post and I’d really appreciate your comment and view on this topic.",

Sometimes it was the parents who did it, sometimes it was another family member who did it, and sometimes it was the babysitter who did it. But what blew my mind even more was the most recent one where a CPS worker (yes you read that right!) left a child to die in a hot car! Out of all people! A CPS worker! The people who are TRAINED to take care of kids and who take care of abused kids somehow managed to leave the kid in a hot car after the parents failed at protecting them. And now the CPS worker failed at protecting them too. Wtf!\n\nLast year the uprising news stories were more and more teachers and daycare workers being arrested for sexually assaulting the kids. But lately the uprising news stories have been people leaving kids in hot cars. What is going on!? Are people too high to remember how many kids they have!? Are people that overwhelmed with the work life and home life responsibilities? A child has to be in a car for HOURS to die like that! How does someone go that long without thinking \"Oh I haven't seen or heard the kid(s) in a while! Let me go check on them.\" Seriously. I have some some stories on here of parents saying they felt guilty because forgot their kids in the car for a few MINUTES (still not good but at least they caught them before it was too late). But how does someone leave their kid in the car for HOURS!? \n\nAnd last week I saw a video of a babysitter who let a 10 month old die in the car. She was babysitting for multiple families at the same time and somehow forgot the baby! Did she forget what her job was or something!? Her job was to watch the kids! The mothers reaction in the video was so heart breaking! The played the police body camera footage of the mother and the babysitter and the ambulace and the moment they got to the hospital. Oh my god... the mom and dad pressed charges on the babysitter and there are also videos of them in court. \n\nThere was also a video of a grandma with dementia who killed both of her grandkids. She killed one of them by letting them drown and she killed the other one by letting them die in a hot car. Everyone blamed the parents for the 2nd death because the parents were dumb enough to trust that grandma to babysit again after she already killed the 1st grandkid. And half the comments think the grandma did it on purpose. \n\nThere are also cars that have a setting that remind people to check the backseat because of how common it apparently is for people to leave kids in cars. \n\nBut the uprising in those incidents are making me wonder if either some of them did it on purpose and tried to make it look like an accident OR a lot of them were under the influence.",

When we talked to the bar, they said they’re pretty sure there is a pickpocketing ring that targets them frequently but that police won’t investigate since it’s nonviolent petty theft. \n\nI filed an online police report later that morning around 10. Throughout the day (Sunday) the thieves attempted to use my cards in person at multiple Targets with security cameras. Then later that day at 9PM I got a ping from find my iPhone with the location of the stolen phone. It was a private residence, so I didn’t feel comfortable retrieving on my own. \n\nUnfortunately since it was a non emergency and all the stations were already closed, I wasn’t able to report the address until today (Monday). \n- I called the detectives assigned to my case first thing in the morning and left a message with the address that pinged. \n- I then called non emergency line to request a dispatch since time is of the essence, and they told me I’d have to go to the station in person. When I asked which station, they said whichever was closest it didn’t matter. \n- After waiting 1.5 hours at the closest station, they told me I was misinformed and had to go to the station that was assigned my case. \n- At the assigned station, they told me I’d have to talk to the detectives, but they already left for the day (it was 3PM, detective voicemail says they’re open til 4PM). He recommended I go to the station closest to the address my phone pinged at, since the address was less than a 5 min walk to the station, and see if they had patrol to check.\n-Obviously, the last station told me that even though they had patrol officers to check on the location of my phone, they couldn’t because it wasn’t assigned to their division, and that they wouldn’t do it any way because it’s petty theft. \n\nHere’s the thing, I get that it’s petty theft and they’re understaffed. However, the bar my items were stolen from is a historic gay bar in Los Angeles. And after talking to friends as well as the bar, and reading google reviews ripe with other pickpocketing complaints, it just seems like a small criminal network is terrorizing this bar every weekend and no one will stop them because a) petty theft and b) gay people. \n\nWhile my case is only one phone/wallet, it seems like if you have the address or where a frequent criminal might live, that you would at least go check it out? Every cop I’ve spoken to has said even though I have the address, it’s too small of a crime to investigate. All of the police officers I’ve interacted with have been very nice so far, so I don’t want to be combative, but would it be worth it to mention that I will go to social media/press with the story that they refuse to send even one patrol car to check on a potential criminal ring targeting the gay community?\n\nAny advice from others successfully navigating the same scenario, or from any law enforcement personnel would be very appreciated!! Again, normally wouldn’t bother but the memories of my dad are invaluable.",

      "text": "I’ve seen plenty of stories where police are sent to shut down kids’ lemonade stands or cite a nonprofit for feeding the homeless because some obscure city ordinance says it’s not allowed. Sometimes it’s a six-year-old selling a few cups to neighbors. Sometimes it’s a soup kitchen handing out meals to people in need. And yet, officers still show up, follow orders, and hand out citations.\n\nI’m not talking about violent crime, theft, or dangerous situations. I mean these small, harmless acts where there’s no real victim. If I had a job where my boss told me to punish a child for selling lemonade or fine people for giving food to the hungry, I wouldn’t do it. I’d find a way to avoid it — claim I went to the call when I didn’t, or just show up, make small talk, and leave without shutting anything down. But that’s not what happens. They actually enforce these rules.\n\nHow do they still see themselves as “protecting and serving” the public when they do things that obviously go against common sense and basic decency? How do you sleep at night knowing your job sometimes requires you to hurt people who aren’t hurting anyone?",

      "text": "AI is a hidden gem if used correctly. It has the potential to make law enforcement more efficient—helping with crime analysis, reducing paperwork, and improving response times. But we all know AI isn’t perfect. It sometimes generates incorrect information—what we call AI hallucination. This happens when the model struggles with too much context and starts making things up or ignoring instructions. But despite its flaws, AI is improving rapidly.\n\nFor example, one of the best open-source AI models right now is **Deepseek R1**. It’s free and even outperforms OpenAI’s o1 in many benchmarks. What’s even crazier is that Deepseek R1 was developed in just **two months with only $5 million**, while models like o1 took **over $2 billion and years** to develop. That shocked both individuals and companies in the AI space. And before anyone brings up concerns like *\"It’s made by a Chinese company\"* or *\"What about data privacy?\"*, here’s the thing—since it’s open-source, you can download and run it completely offline, without any internet access.\n\nI’ve tested Deepseek R1 on my own PC (I tested the **R1-Distill-Qwen-7B** model and compared it with the **Mistral**, **Mistral Nemo**, **Llama 3.1 8B** and **Gemma2 9B** models), and I can say the model is promising, especially when it comes to creative/critical thinking, text generation, image interpretation, and other cognitive tasks. However, R1 does act a bit *paranoid* when things get too complex. It starts to become overly cautious or even fails to process instructions correctly when the input is too much for it to handle. I believe, though, that this issue will be fixed in the future as the model continues to evolve and improve.\n\nOkay, okay, I'm going off topic here. Let me sum up: What do you think? Will AI be a useful tool for the police in the next ten years, or will there be more problems than benefits? Would you trust AI-assisted tools in policing, or is it still too unreliable?",

He told me that they came over just to get the serial number off of his gun he just bought legally at the store. Wasn't even 2 months ago that he bought it. But I guess the cop came over and told him he wanted to see the gun and that if he didn't comply things would get ugly for him real fast. Can they do this? Don't they have to have a real good reason to be able to come to your house and demand to see your gun without a warrant? I'm lost as to why they would harass him that way. At least that's what he called it. I do know he had a past charge on his record for a analogs. He pled it down to a misdemeanor. So it's not a felony. But even if it was, I'm under the Impression that as long as it wasnt a violent crime a felon can own a gun again now anyways. So why would they need to come over specifically just to get the serial number off his gun?I'm very curious . I think the guy is in trouble and is lying to me about it but I'm not sure.

I had way too much to drink (police bac was .25 maybe 2-3 hours after my last drink). \n\nBefore ubering home, I frantically (and drunkenly) was on a mission for food. Checked McDonald’s…doors locked. Went to the next place, a lovely national diner. Lights were on, opened the door, walked in, waited to be served. Fell asleep (er…passed out?). \n\nWoke up to police screaming and banging the table, and alarms blaring. I was placed in handcuffs, and was informed that I was being detained for suspected burglary. \n\nI was questioned further by police outside. I was being respectful and courteous, which was reciprocated with professionalism. At this point, they knew I was “drunk as fuck”. They cleared the building, found no accomplice, and no forced entry. The concluded the door was just unlocked and I walked in. \n\nPolice tried to get a bac here, I insisted that I did not drive, nor do I need medical assistance, and kept declining. \n\nWas then informed that I was being placed under arrest for criminal trespass (misdemeanor, 2nd degree). Police conducted a thorough search, and ripped the laces off of my Jordans. Cuffs were loose, as I was being complaint. The officer who transported me said they would write the fact that I was being cooperative in the report, maybe this helped later. Upon reaching jail, the officer said putting a bac in the report would help me. I fell for it, that’s when I found out I was at a .25. \n\nAfter the rest of the night in jail (which felt like a dmv, no cells, large room, TVs, bathrooms), I saw a judge and was released on my own recognizance. \n\nI immediately hired a lawyer, as I was charged with crime.\n\nLawyer found the entire thing ridiculous, and kept asking the DA to reconsider the whole thing. DA reached out to restaurant owner, however, owner wanted me to face consequences, and didn’t want me to get an outright dismissal. \n\nDA and lawyer negotiated more, and filed a motion to stop further prosecution. I didn’t have to plead guilty. I was offered diversion and dismissal upon completion. \n\nI finished the class before the court date. During the court date, the judge told me how hard they worked to offer me this deal. Apparently it’s rare to stop prosecution, and enter diversion without a guilty plea. \n\n A week later, I was sent a mail, that my case is dismissed with prejudice. \n\nThank GOD it’s over!",

      "text": "I live in Ohio and 2 months ago signed lease with a friend. She moved in her make friend (we’re both female) and this violates our lease we share. Her friend is annoying our neighbors, pissing off landlord, and ultimately is making me uncomfortable in my own home. I’ve told her multiple times to make him leave and she won’t which escalated to him being upset with me for telling her make him leave. So, because of this, he now has at this point has put household cleaners onto the makeup brushes I use on my face daily (luckily I caught it before using), put hot sauce into my feminine hygiene shower products (luckily caught before using), spray painted my personal items, stolen from my bedroom while I’m away, and also cut huge slits down the middle of my clothing that was expensive and valuable to me. Newly-he has now caused eviction for us upon me giving my landlord intent to vacate notice due to safety concerns and my daughter not being allowed in n my home because I don’t feel comfortable with her and him here same time but roommate still refused to listen and make him leave. Shouldn’t have to leave my own home pay rent at am on lease at because she wants to violate our lease and continue letting him live here against landlords wishes and mine and best interests of my six year old daughter. I’ve vacated own home. How that were being evicted, he still shows up pounding on the door disturbing neighbors yet again seeing if roommate is at home-landlord even called police on him other day for it and being obnoxious. I came to apartment alone to finish getting rest of my things out of here last night, only to find more of my things stolen and destroyed deliberately and intentionally by him. All this happened over the course of last 2 weeks. I’m fed up. Plan on calling police when I am about to leave apartment and report it all to them. If I have the evidence, is it still acceptable to report to police his acts that he committed after the fact? As in, can he still be charged for the initial thing he did to me if I have the evidence to support it to give to them if it happened about 2 weeks ago? And all other incidents in between that up until now? Asking because I don’t deserve any of this. It’s stupid and childish and I’m over it at this point. Also what can he even be charged with I’m curious if I can still report it all?",

I had to change lanes into the middle lane to go around a car who turned on their hazards and slowed to a stop, and as I’m accelerating to get back to speed, a large truck comes speeding from behind me and swerves around me, laying on his horn. I think he thinks I cut him off. Anyway, he then gets into the lane next to me and intentionally side swipes my car, leaving scuff marks. He tries to do this multiple more times. When I tried to move away from him, he would follow and try to hit me again. Needless to say I was terrified, this guy was in a giant lifted truck and I’m in a tiny sedan, and we’re in the middle of the highway. I was able to get a photo of his license plate but I couldn’t see his face, all I saw was his arm flicking me off so I at least know his skin color and that it was a male. He drove off and I got off on the exit for my destination.\n\nHighway patrol responded and I provided them with the license plate. He told me there was no insurance registered to the vehicle that hit me and he identified a driver. He told me he will attempt to interview the guy and basically can only take action if he admits to it or if I can point him out in a lineup. Obviously I can’t do the latter (I only saw his middle finger) and I don’t think this guy’s going to be quick to admit he tried to run someone off the road.\n\nIs this a serious crime? Am I SOL? Luckily I’m okay and there’s minimal damage to my car, but that could have gone very very bad. If he hit me in the wrong spot I could have ended up in a really serious accident. That felt like an attempt on my life and if I can I’d really like to press charges.",

Finished PelletB, gonna be wrapping up WSTB soon and sending in apps as soon as I get those scores. I am torn on where I want to work (assuming I receive any offers from these agencies).\n\nIve done ride-alongs almost everywhere I can. I know that what I want out of my career in law enforcement includes this:\n\n•\t⁠A career somewhere I can experience every crime out there, and have the opportunity to develop strong skills in being able to respond to any scenario (obviously that comes with time, but also you might just not experience specific crimes at some agencies)\n•\t⁠The ability to have a variety of special assignments like K-9, SWAT/SRT, property crimes, homicide, etc.\n•\t⁠Decent support on most calls, I understand this can change by season/time of day, but I’m also aware some agencies are better at having cover units than others\n•\t⁠Decent support from community and command staff\n•\t⁠The ability to find a family like feel at the agency (if that makes sense)\n\nI want to be a cop because I want to get out and put myself between criminals and the community, arrest assholes, and build strong rapport between the community and the PD. I know that I’m ready to do this, but I have been feeling so unsure about where.\n\nI feel like Berkeley PD and SF are two great options to get all these things. I know a lot of people see Berkeley and think “politics” but if you separate the city from the PD, you’ll see that the PD is full of some very solid people who are just as patriotic and ready to arrest people as many other cops are.\n\nI know this is super long winded and kinda specific, but I’d love any input and support. I want to get out and start learning today. I also understand that lateraling is always a practical option a couple years into a young career. Please feel free to provide any and all feedback, ask any questions, or humble me a bit. I appreciate you all.",

      "text": "I was pulled over tonight by a traffic Patrol unit because of very dark tints on my new model Mercedes-Benz crossover vehicle and in the Suburban yet metro area I'm in police are always out and always always sitting in speed traps and watching for traffic violations because there is no crime in the area. That being said I was pulled over because of my tints, but it ends up that I have a suspended driver's license because on a road trip a few months ago I received a speeding ticket going through West Virginia on my way back up north. The ticket got buried in the glove compartment and I never paid it, so West Virginia somehow has the power to suspend my license in another state. So there I am completely taken off guard pulled over at about 9:30 almost 10:00 at night and the police officers only know I have a suspended driver's license I have a heavily tinted new Mercedes Benz, a man of color I'm a second generation immigrant half Cuban and half Sicilian all of my grandparents were born in their respective countries paternal grandparents born in Cuba maternal grandparents born in Sicily, very simple. But the point is I look Hispanic and I'm in a white suburb with a suspended license, and to the officers, my vehicle probably looks like I'm a drug dealer or criminal...so they pull me out of the car start searching the vehicle and the whole time these two younger white male officers I would say both were between 29 and 34, I'm 46 but look 34.... These guys found a 9 mm which I have stored in the backseat storage compartment, so they did put cuffs on me put me in the back of their car but they were very respectful, talking to me the whole time, and treating me like a man and at the end of the day after about a 30-40 min. ordeal they ran my name got my background check, searched the vehicle thoroughly where they did find an open bottle of tequila which was left in the back of my Mercedes SUV by some other people the other day after a birthday party, and these officers even though I had a suspended license and an open bottle of tequila and a 9 mm ( it wasn't loaded the magazine I keep in the glove compartment, the handgun I keep in the back storage compartment, I keep them separated for safety) point is these officers could have taken me to jail and given me a ticket for driving under suspension.... they could have charged me with an open container they could have charged me with a firearm near an open container, improper storage of a firearm or I don't know what else, however I know I live in a concealed carry state so we have constitutional carry rights in this state, but I know I was still guilty of a few minor crimes. These two awesome guys talked to me for a half hour, felt me out and based on a man to man human to human interaction they took the cuffs off of me and let me go and said \"call West Virginia, pay your ticket, and next time when you get pulled over let the police know you have a gun in the vehicle and for Gods sakes throw the tequila away!\" Now this my friend is what we need from police officers I was completely sober and was not drinking I'm 46 years old I make six figures I own several properties, my wife works for NASA and is out of state right now she's in Massachusetts working on a project for NASA at MIT in Massachusetts....we are by every definition of the word \"successful and productive Americans\" my wife is a white European, blonde haired green eyed woman and like I said I'm a second generation immigrant... Cuban and Sicilian who is a business owner of over 12 years and we are very blessed to make a very very good living! our children are adults all of them are out of the home, we're empty nesters all 3 of our children are in their mid to late twenties and the policemen that I encountered tonight saw that in me!!!!  They understood me, they got to know me enough in about a half an hour from talking to me,  looking at my background check, and asking me a ton of questions along with chit chatting and talkingto me.... these officers knew I was not a criminal I have no record I've never been to prison I've never been convicted of any serious crimes or felonies, only minor stuff as a kid & young adult ....so they did the right thing and instead of ruining my life, (btw I have a very important business meeting in the morning regarding a very important project Im working on)....these officers could have ruined not only my day or my week, but these guys could have cost me thousands upon thousands of dollars and easily given me some trumped-up charges snd threw me in jail! I would have had to pay a ridiculous Bond and go back and forth to court etc etc etc.... but these two gentlemen acted and behaved like trained professionals 💯💯💯 they deescalated the situation and made a judgment call that they both talked about as I watched them and listened to them talking about my fate😨....they talked about it and said yeah let's let this guy go he can pay the ticket in West Virginia and other than that let him know not to do that again, he's a good guy so he's good to go..... When I left I looked to the sky and thanked God first and foremost because I'm not a criminal I was not drinking and driving I had no idea West Virginia suspended my license they have not sent me anything in the mail or anything.... So I had no idea my license was suspended I was not drinking because I didn't even know that tequila was back there I had let relatives drive my car home from a birthday party so point is I didn't deserve to go to jail and these gentlemen saw that and treated me accordingly again as a man of color in a white suburb, that's known for very hard ass Irish and Eastern European cops who don't like brown guys.... these guys displayed nothing but professionalism humanity and just straight up treated me like a man like an equal and they didn't use their power even when they did put cuffs on me and put me in the back of their SUV for a little bit they were super cool about it kept me informed every step of the way, they talked to me about what they were doing and researching as far as getting my background info....when they ran my name they did a deeper more in depth search I guess because I had the gun on me and I don't have a CCW I live in a constitutional carry state which means you don't need a permit or a license anybody in this state can carry a gun and they just displayed nothing but respect for the Constitution and for the law!  I conducted myself respectfully showed them nothing but respect and they did the same for me so just saying there's one for the good guys 💯💯💯🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽",

      "text": "This is a question for any police interrogators out there: In your job you investigate some very heinous crimes. We often hear during police interrogations the detective will say, “Everyone makes mistakes” even when someone has dismembered an ex or someone, in order to put them at ease and get a confession. My question is, Do you personally go into an interview believing this? Are you persuaded that every person has the capacity to commit horrible crimes, in the heat of a moment? I personally could never see myself murdering someone no matter what (w the caveat that self defense or defending someone is not a murder). I imagine if I was an investigator it would be helpful to have the mindset that treats everyone as capable of making a “slip-up” like murder under intense pressure… in order to get to the truth and gain the trust of a  suspect… but I’m curious about opinions out there: Do you personally believe every normally intelligent person is capable of committing heinous crimes?",

You attempt to call the victim, however, the victim's phone number they provided you goes straight to voicemail. The suspect is not holding the purse. The suspect refuses to identify himself.

I’m just wondering from anyone else that has experience in both worlds what their take is on pros and cons, which they preferred, if they could go back. \n\nEver since I was a kid I wanted to be in the military, a police officer and a firefighter. I joined the military as a medic, went to the 82nd and was placed with an infantry unit back in 2011, now a combat vet. Got out in 2014 and considered firefighting and police but ended up doing neither till 2021 when I got my EMT cert back and that led into a full time fire job at a busy department. Don’t get me wrong, I like the job but something about police work is always lingering in the back of my head. As we all know, fire is mostly an EMS job which is rewarding at times but part of me wants to do more, investigate crimes, catch criminals, eventually go into specializations to catch real criminals. So anyone that has experience in both worlds with an opinion would be much appreciated. Edit: State of Ohio",

      "text": "Hi all, I got a citation by a NYS Trooper for driving 80MPH on a 65MPH. I know I should have been careful and I am usually a very responsible driver. I guess I had just over taken a vehicle and going down a slope and didn't realize I was over speeding until I saw the Trooper behind me. This is the first time I have encountered something like this. The citation doesn't state any amount and I am supposed to either plead guilty or not guilty and mail it in. The print is kind of scary and making it sound as if I have committed a major crime. Any suggestions? I want to do the right thing and pay the fine, but don't want to plead guilty to something that I don't even know the penalty of? Your input and guidance is appreciated.",

My partner fell asleep, and when police buzzed the flat he didnt answer so they landed up taking me to my parents house (where i still spend time when working in office near thetmre house) as he had my phone and keys to our flat. They told my dad they couldnt find my partner (he is fine was just asleep but they must have thought wandering around like me) but worrying like mad they will call his family who live nearby abd they will kick off at him. We all don’t get on, so it would be a disaster. If they were going to contact his parents would they have done it by now? Also, will the police come back to my house and charge me with anythibg or would they hace done it at time?\n\nNot proud of what i did but scared now I might get charged with something or will get my partner into trouble with his parents. He is a vulnerable adult since a bad skiing accident left him with memory issues due to a brain injury.\n\nThis is something I'm really ashamed of so pls don't lecture me, my anxiety is off scale and i could not be more upset with myself but if police were going to contact his family or i have committed a crime by being drunk and them having to bring me home they would have done it by now right?",

Everything seemed normal, except when the officer was about to handcuff her. He said he was going to put a 'belly belt' on her so she wouldn’t be cuffed with her hands behind her back. I didn’t know what he meant until he pulled out a belt with handcuffs at the front and fastened it around her waist. I don’t know... it seems like something meant for a dangerous criminal. In fact, the girl was very cooperative and polite the entire time, and showed no signs of resistance.\n\nIt's not the first video I've seen like this. Many times, they put chains and shackles on arrested people even when they haven't committed violent crimes. Simply for driving under the influence or shoplifting. I would simply like to understand the origin of this, as I haven't seen anything like it in other countries",

      "text": "This time with details so people don't think I'm sketch, I just originally didn't want all this out there for hundreds to see at once. Mostly because I want to discuss what would happen so I can be prepared (I have a fear of cops from trauma with my now deceased father so talking through things with cops before they storm over is something I was definitely hoping for as well as to prepare my small siblings and my mother in case something happens because the man involved (my stepfather) supposedly has a gun and friends he can call if something happens)\n\nSo:\nFor about ten years now my stepfather has been abusing my family mentally and emotionally, he molested me at 16 but I was too afraid to say anything, here recently he's been making my sister uncomfortable and making sexual remarks and commenting on her ass and tits and shit all the time. He's been trying to scare my mom into thinking she has nowhere to go, forced her to marry him ten years ago, and has been throwing threats around like he's an ex gang man and knows people. My mom has been too afraid to say anything for so long and she feels like telling a cop or getting them involved will get my siblings taken away, which we don't need. We simply need him gone because none of us can take it much longer. I'm in college and away from it all now but I came back this week for break and found out my stepfather (Tim) is getting worse, and found out he has multiple previous charges of supposedly neglect, domestic abuse, molestation/rape, etc. nobody feels safe in the house anymore and my mom is terrified of saying anything at all so she's trying to make a plan to get people involved later instead of calling now but with how much they've been fighting since I've been home I don't know if it's safe for her. She has congestive heart failure and the more stressed she gets with this the worse her chest hurts and shit and she isn't sure what to do because he's also financially fucked her over and she's broke. It's all just a clusterfuck and that's the small amount of details but there's just so much and I wanted to talk to a cop to talk through what could possibly happen in this situation and if there's a way we could just get him out of the house.",

      "title": "Question regarding driving a DUI suspect involved in a fatal crash home?",
      "text": "TLDR: skip to the question section of the post to avoid the lengthy backstory/context \n\n\nSo, a video was posted a day or so ago pertaining to a crash one of my former coworkers was involved in - and because all the info/evidence was released within a month of her crash occurring, this video was met with much criticism in the comments and also had me wondering why she was even driven home in the first place. \n\nContext: Latoya Hayes was involved in a crash in the early morning of New Year’s Day. She was drunk, speeding down I-95, came up behind another vehicle, rear-ended them, careened into a road ranger vehicle (with lights and the arrow sign on as he was in the process of clearing a previous accident). This caused a domino-effect of the RR truck being pushed into a FHP cruiser, which was then pushed into a 2nd FHP cruiser, and ultimately struck the road ranger walking in front of the 2nd cruiser. He unfortunately died. \n\nI worked with Latoya from March 2023-March 2024. I always thought she hated me. She was very professional, kept to herself, especially about her personal life, unless she needed to talk work-related business, very intimidating (in a way, more so in my eyes because again, I thought she hated me), and did everything to a T like I’m talking above and beyond, above and beyond type of a thing. She was well respected and honestly very fucking responsible in many ways. At least that’s what I thought… (but more on that later). Turns out she just doesn’t care to make friends with people she works with but she ended up actually being quite friendly with me and only two other coworkers. I never expected her to do something so stupid, so foolish, so preventable, so absurd. I was in absolute shock when another former coworker (whom still drives for that company, while I drive for another now - and was also one of the two other coworkers she was friendly with) saw me at the airport during one of our work runs and told me the news. I drove in complete silence with my mouth wide open the whole way back to my job. There was no way this was the same woman I worked with for a year. I was in utter disbelief but also sad and angry with her for what she did. \n\nQuestion: \n\nWhy was Latoya allowed to be driven home? Why was she allowed to sit in the front seat of a cruiser, not cuffed? It was reported that she smelled of alcohol whilst speaking to officers, had bloodshot eyes and was trying to conceal the smell with gum at the scene of the crime. Hell, she fucking killed a man for fuck sake. In the video, she’s even sitting face to face, being asked questions in a closed car with the same officer who drove her home. How the hell did he not smell it? She also had been driving with an expired license since 2005. Why did she leave the scene and not get arrested till almost a month later? \n\nhttps://www.local10.com/news/local/2025/05/10/video-shows-woman-whispering-to-herself-after-fatal-dui-crash-in-broward/\n\nAll body-cam footage I’ve seen of police officers pulling over DUI drivers, have always resulted in an immediate arrest and at least the night in jail, if not more. These folks didn’t even crash, let alone kill someone, and they’re still taken to the slammer on the spot.",

      "title": "Local Police Stop Investigating an Armed Rapist until He Provides a Confession ",
      "text": "I am reaching out to share my experience and seek your support regarding a deeply troubling situation that not only affects me personally but has broader implications for our community.\n\nOn March 17, I was sexually assaulted in my home by a man armed with a knife and a gun. Despite the presence of these weapons and his history of harassing others, I was able to maintain the survival of myself and my dog during this traumatic event. However, this experience has left me feeling vulnerable and unsafe. \n\nI reported the crime on March 21 and have since fully cooperated with law enforcement, providing extensive evidence, including physical evidence, DNA samples, phone records, and the identity of my attacker. I also fully cooperated with a pre-text investigation after the man asked for a lawyer.\n\nDespite this strong evidence, including video footage of the assault, I faced significant obstacles in getting the police to investigate. I often found myself having to advocate for progress, initiating contact with law enforcement to ask for updates and push for action. There were instances where officers missed scheduled appointments with me, further delaying the investigation.\n\nAdditionally, there was a month-long delay in the police picking up the requested evidence from my home. To this day, that evidence has never been tested. \n\nExactly seven months after the attack, I was notified by the police that they were officially closing the case due to my lack of success when they asked me to contact my attacker to ascertain his motive. Given the circumstances, it is unlikely that I would be able to obtain a confession from him, especially considering that law enforcement has not interviewed any of his associates who may have information pertinent to the case. They stated that they could not proceed without a confession, which seems increasingly improbable.\n\nWhen I reminded them that he recorded part of the assault, they asked if I had said \"no\" or \"stop\" on video. I had to explain that while he did not have the gun in his hand during the assault, the presence of the weapon made me feel powerless to resist. When I inquired whether they could search for the video on his phone, they told me no, asserting that it would not be considered a crime unless he posted it online.\n\nCompounding this situation, the man has threatened my career if I chose to take legal action against him. In August, after six years of dedicated service at my job, I was laid off without explanation or severance pay, leaving me in a precarious financial situation and unable to afford legal representation.\n\nI am currently seeking a protection order due to ongoing safety concerns; however, I learned that obtaining the necessary evidence to file this order could take 14 to 16 weeks. The police also indicated that I would need to pay fees to access the evidence and reports, adding to my financial burden during this already challenging time.\n\nThe statistics surrounding sexual assault are alarming: approximately 1 in 5 women experience sexual assault in their lifetime. Of those incidents, only 23% are reported to law enforcement, with charges filed in just 25% of those cases or less than 6% of total attacks. Ultimately, the conviction rate hovers around a mere 2%. These figures highlight the systemic challenges victims face in achieving justice.\n\nGiven the clear evidence, prompt reporting, and the severity of my situation, I am reaching out to you for guidance and support. I believe that with community advocacy and awareness, we can address these issues more effectively and work towards creating a safer environment for all.\n\nThis experience has raised concerns about how sexual assault cases are handled by law enforcement, particularly within Fort Collins Police. I believe it is important for us as a community to discuss and address these challenges openly.\n\nI would like to connect with anyone who has had similar negative experiences while reporting incidents to Fort Collins Police or other law enforcement agencies. Sharing our stories can help shed light on the systemic issues we face and advocate for meaningful change within our community.\n\nEdit: I added in some details some had questions about. \n\nFrom the beginning I requested support from the Victims Advocate. I had to insist they were present in my interview. Due to the lack of funding for these roles, they were not always available. The VA is very enmeshed and reliant on their relationships with the officers. The hierarchy limits them from challenging or correcting the officers. \n\nI have emailed the Assistant Chief of Police who oversees the victim services and evidence department. I asked for the evidence request to be expedited.\n\nI have emailed SAVA for additional support. I am privileged to have supportive people in my life and my own therapist.\n\nThank you all for your support! I am so devastated by the pattern of disrespect and negligence so many of you have experienced as well! I appreciate you sharing your own experiences!",
