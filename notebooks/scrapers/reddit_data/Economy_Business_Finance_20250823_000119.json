      "text": "Well, I guess I've gotten past the freak-out phase, past the panic, past the weekly (then bi-weekly, then almost daily) strategy/pivot meetings with my team, and past the difficult conversations with my wife. I'm over thinking I can \"knowledge\" my way out of it, leverage my way out of it, *get advice* my way out of it. I'm even past the hardest stage of them all - acceptance. ***I've accepted that my bread and butter over the last decade and a half is essentially on life support.***\n\nIn some ways, I was lucky. In 2013, I was early to the freelance platforms like Upwork (Elance), Fiverr, and PeoplePerHour. Shortly before joining these platforms, I started writing business plans and pitch decks for a few startups. This translated well to the freelance sites, and I quickly grew my reputation and became one of the top sellers on PeoplePerHour. I scaled that into a business (a startup consultancy), and success followed there too. My marketing background allowed me to implement an SEO strategy that actually worked.\n\nEvery day, I was answering new inquiries. My team was growing. I was creating systems and processes and training new hires on how to create high-quality assets for our startup founder clients.\n\nAnd I did this for over a decade. Every year, growth. Every year, a higher salary. Every year, more employees. Partnerships with incubators and accelerators. Clients were closing investor deals in the high six-figures and leaving us rave reviews.\n\nBut things change. New technology comes out. Trends shift. I was used to times where the economy would get better temporarily, and people would get comfortable in their jobs and focus less on their entrepreneurial ideas. In these years, maybe there'd be a bit of loss in revenue --- but nothing I couldn't recover from.\n\nHowever, I never expected that **AI** would change EVERYTHING the way it did. I saw AI coming, I adopted it, still use it to this day. But what I didn't see coming was – AI would pretty much eliminate the need for my entire business. No one needs a team of startup experts and consultants when you can type \"Write a business plan for X\" and fulfill your goal. I thought our quality would hold us over, but the value just no longer supported our pricing (and costs). I also didn't see that it would completely change how Google provides information, which in turn, would also kill my SEO traffic that I relied on.\n\nJust like that, my $400k/yr business turned into a $300k, then a $200k, then a $150k business - held on by the few incubator/accelerator clients who still stuck with us. Those daily inquiries went to zero, as did my hopes and dreams.\n\nNow... my business isn't a business. It's a well-crafted website that barely drives traffic and no longer drives leads. It's a reduced team that is just holding on to faith, while looking to me for the solution; knowing that eventually I'll have to pull the plug on the business and their livelihoods. It's all my ideas over the last decade, left to die. It's anxiety, depression, tough conversations, and doubt. It's.... failure.\n\nFailure in business... not failure in life. And more so, failure in THIS business, not failure in me as a founder. Because we're entrepreneurs, and the whole reason we exist is to solve shit. Find a problem. Solve it. This is the problem the universe has put before me, and no matter how painful it is, I will survive. I will make it through... and probably do it better.\n\nHow? Well, during all this period of doubt and stress, I also started building two MVPs for new startups I've been researching and planning. I'm not starting from Square 1 - I'm starting from Square 15, with all the knowledge, experience, and connections I've been fortunate to secure over the last decade. And I'll win again, because that's what I do, **that's what we do.**\n\nWhat is the lesson here? I have no idea. I literally just don't have other people in my life who will understand this, but I feel like someone here will. I'm venting, damnit.\n\nMaybe the lesson is, failure is never really failure. Sometimes you just have to turn the page to see the rest of the story.",

      "text": "I've co-owned a digital marketing agency for landscaping and lawn care businesses with my partner since 2019. That was when we set our original pricing.\n\nHowever... after 6.5 years of never increasing prices and an inflation rate this generate has never seen, we were no longer financially viable; so we had to increase prices.\n\nOur agency has two costs:\n\n* Onboarding\n* Monthly Services\n\nWe've raised prices on onboarding in the past because that only affected new clients. This was the first time we'd be adjusting our monthly costs.\n\nWe started our agency a little over 6 years ago. This spring was the first time we raised them on our clients and it was by 30% -- basically overnight.\n\nWe did everything to prepare for the worse churn possible but also make sure things went as smooth operationally as possible.\n\n* No one was grandfathered in\n* We gave a 60-day notice\n* We also changed our pricing structure (instead of only 30%, some clients ended up paying 100% more)\n* We spent a considerable amount of time planning when to announce it and when it should go into effect\n   * Increasing prices in a down season (winter for us) makes cashflow tight for our clients and makes cutting marketing more justifiable.\n   * Increasing prices in an up season (spring) is manageable by our clients as both cashflow and lead flow is up\n   * Additionally, clients are less likely to spend time to find new agencies when they're gearing up for the spring (landscaping and lawn care businesses) vs in the winter when they have 3-4 months to prepare\n\nThe payoff was a 20% client churn but a 24.4% increase in YoY revenue.\n\nThe growth percentage doesn't totally make sense because we onboarded 9 clients in the span of the announcement and the time of recording the aftermath/damage.\n\n(lost 6, gained 9).\n\nDespite all of the planning, we still made a few mistakes (imo) and although the timing was perfect from a seasonality perspective, coming off an election year with a crap economy did NOT help us.\n\nHowever, the churn mitigation tactics we implemented, I think, prevented us from losing a lot more clients.\n\nThere's way too much to say about all we did regarding the increase, how, and why we did it in this post. But we recorded an episode on our podcast detailing every step of it.\n\n20% churn is *usually* what I see when agencies increase their prices. Having said that, I am a little disappointed we did this much prep work and saw what I consider, \"the standard\".\n\nI'm also not confident that a 20% churn is proportional to a 30% price increase. When these agencies I'm talking about see a 20% churn with price increases, is it by 30%? Is it less? Is it more?",

      "title": "Many Small Businesses Feeling The Tariff's But What's Really Going On? Hear Me Out!",
      "text": "So before this community decides to lynch me, hear me out on what i am trying to say. Many businesses were doing very well before the years leading up to 2020 and actually did very well even during a pandemic as the government was sending out checks to help Americans through such a devastating situation.  Fast forward to 2025 here we are and all you are hearing is the economy this, the economy that.  A possible recession looming and interest rates this and inflation that. It is impacting consumer's financials and many small businesses are closing. Major retailers filing for bankruptcies and for those small businesses that are hanging on literally have no parachute if they let go.\n\nSo my focus is not so much on the fact that things are not looking good but what does not make sense to me is how other things changed that you would not expect to be affected by an economic downturn at the same time everything is happening.  For this i am referring to social media platforms like youtube, and google which is a platform that displays many business profiles.  A huge shift happened where many business owners reported a huge drop to their site traffic after this algorithm update and youtube channels that would get 1M views just dropped to like 9,000 views.   Looking at google trends it gives insight as to what people are looking for but it's as if people disappeared.\n\nWe have shifted from so many videos on youtube showcasing some type of tutorial or how-to, to now almost every video being about the struggle, the closing, or how the cost of living has got Americans in a frenzy.  You see popular tourist destinations on the news as ghost towns.  It's crazy because July was my best month this year and then August it's like my business crashed with not 1 call, no inquires or anything so i am not the one to get into politics but all of this can not just be from tariff's.\n\nEverything that's happening is like it just synchronized together at the perfect moment to f\\*ck everybody.  August is surely popular month for vacation and a last minute one before back to school but even vacation trends are down so where the hell is everyone if they're not on vacation?",

      "title": "Why is it so tough for a young person with a college degree, that's who's getting hurt right now, why is it so hard for them right now?",
      "text": "**Prof G Markets Podcast 06/13/2025**\n**Hosts** Scott and Ed\n**Guest:** Katherine Anne Edwards, PhD Economist, Economic Policy Consultant, Columnist for Bloomberg News, and Co-host of \"Optimist Economy\" Podcast\n\n**Ed Elson:**\nSome data that I found really interesting from the jobs report. One super interesting what you say about what's happening in healthcare where that's basically what's leading the report and what it really tells us is that America is just very old and sick, which is not great. But the other thing that I found really interesting is that employment for young people with college degrees is at its lowest level in years. And this is some other data from LinkedIn, which is that entry-level hiring is down 23% compared to March 2020. If you're a recent grad and you're part of Gen Z, that's my generation, your unemployment rate right now is 1% higher than the rest of the working population. So what is going on with the job market for young people and for entry-level workers? **Why is it so tough for a young person with a college degree, that's who's getting hurt right now, why is it so hard for them right now?**\n\n**Katherine Anne Edwards:**\nThe unemployment rate of young people is always higher than the unemployment rate of older people. And the less experience you have, the harder it can be to be hired. So this is a typical relationship between the unemployment rates. Young people, even if they have a college degree, have higher unemployment rates. But it's the highest in years. So, the positive spin on this that I would be remiss if I didn't bring up is that the unemployment rate being higher amongst young people does have good interpretations. Like in your first 5 years out of college, you should go find a bunch of different jobs. You should figure out what you like. You should constantly be searching. If something doesn't fit, we consider it to be a really beneficial, intense period of learning about the labor market that's associated with a lot of job jumps as well as a lot of wage growth. And so if you are looking for a job more often, you will have a higher unemployment rate. So there's an argument here that it's not all bad. But of course, younger people with less experience will have the hardest time in a recession getting hired. And what we are seeing is really these two labor markets that I told you about, the labor market for people with a job and the labor market for people who want one. The labor market for people who want one looks much more like a recession, and you would not expect the unemployment rate to be so low overall.\n\nSo all of that said, as preface, one of the most interesting studies in the Great Recession about unemployment and job search was that this group of economists looked at job postings and the educational requirements and experience requirements for them. And they looked at how that varied for the same job based on the unemployment rates. And it goes exactly how you would expect in an unfortunate way for young people, which is that when the unemployment rate is high and a lot of people are looking for jobs, a job that two years ago required a college degree and no experience would require a master's with five years of experience. And you would see these jumps in what you needed in an entry-level job as the unemployment rate got up. I think what we're seeing now is a version of that without the unemployment rate going up, that there are a lot of people looking for jobs. The hiring rate is low and you're seeing just this bar being higher even though the unemployment rate is still low. It's a historically odd labor market for unemployment and hiring to be declining in their typical patterns.\n\nI can say for Gen Zers like yourself, I am deeply empathetic having graduated from college in 2007 and looking for a job in 2008 and 2009. It's a really harrowing awful experience to feel like the labor market is telling you through every application you send out the door that you don't hear anything back, that you are not good enough. Even the best students, I mean, these MBA students at Stanford and Harvard, no one can find a job right now. I've seen it in the data and then I also have friends who go to these schools and they literally can't find a job. It's unbelievable to me. And I think that because the rest of the economy is not experiencing it, it's really easy to minimize other people's experience because it's not yours. And unemployment in particular is something that America has been, I think, verging on cruelly unempathetic. We make it easier for me as a person with a job to say if you can't find one it's because of your own personal failing, like you're not working hard enough, you're not searching hard enough, you weren't a hard worker to begin with, or maybe your degree was no good. Because if you were a hard worker who searched really well for a job, who put yourself out there, who has a good degree and you can't find one, that means I'm at risk too. And there's this degree of self-preservation that people bring to the labor market that if they admit really good, hardworking people can be out of luck, it means they could too. And so it's easier instead to say people who aren't doing well simply aren't as good as me because the consequences of them being just as good are pretty scary. And so I would say to the Gen Zers who can't find a job, you would be right in being suspicious that there's a lack of empathy for your position, and that it's a lot easier to just blame you for being on TikTok than it is to understand that you are representing a fundamental weakness in the US labor market right now.",

I have the money to do it outside of bank loans and we are currently negotiating a price for it. Everything is included. \n\nThe only thing holding me back is the fear of the changing landscape of the economy come the new year. My family keeps sending me articles about tariffs and price hikes etc and it’s killing my once bright outlook. I could be my own boss, have 4 part time employees and profit between 50-80k a year. The only thing is the leasing company that rents the space has to approve the transfer of the business and check my financials etc. \n\nCurrently I have just under 200k and I’m trying to buy it all for 130k. Her asking was 140k. Is now the right time to buy? The lady selling is ready to retire and is getting old. They want to move quickly. It would be a dream position for me. Be my own boss and run my own space. Just wondering if there is anything I am not thinking of currently about the economy that could cause a hiccup in making my money back for me. \n\nAny help or advice would be appreciated. It’s in a great neighborhood where people value the arts. The customer base is top notch. \n\nDo I go all in on my dream or is it a bad time with economic uncertainty?\n\nThank you.",

We found a great lcoation in a town/small city where they were hoping for this specific fast food franchise (their local news paper spoke about the specific fast food franchsie they were looking for). I have been reading articles and watching YouTube videos about how fast food has become more expensive and how a lot of people are prefering to forego fast food (around 62%).\n\nWhat I am looking for in terms of guidance and advice is, should my aprents and I open a fast food franchise or should we focus on a coffee shop? The goal of doing this \"franchise jounrey\" is to create an income stream that will allow us to have additional income (I know this is not a get rich quick investment) \n\nAre there signs of the economy bouncing back and are there also signs of fast food making a comeback? \n\nThis is our first franchsie endeavor.... So, any advice on the the articles/reprots about \"more people are foregoing fast food\". Should we open a fast food chain or a coffee shop, or should we focus on some other \"income producing\" endeavor such as rental properties, a franchise restaraunt (Applebee's, Chilli's, etc.) or get into something else that we may have not thought about?\n\n**Any and all advice/guidance is welcome.**",

The economy is people. If the people are en masse going to be unmotivated, socially-inept, unable to communicate, with much lower standards of conduct, then there is no business than can function properly. I've noticed that once people socialize in-person all those things return very quickly so we know what the answer is. \n\nI myself literally do doordash deliveries in the morning just to meet people before I start my work at home, and of course I perform a lot better than those who don't do something similar.",

I posted a gig on Fiverr for fun and in two years I was able to generate 15k. I had months where I would make 2-3k then I would fail to deliver the orders because there was too much work, clients canceled their orders, the Fiverr algorithm shadowban me for 2-3 months then I would start getting clients again and the cycle repeats. \n\nSo in total I think I worked for about 6-7 months in those two years. \n\nI’m a college student and I work 16h on weekends in a warehouse so I was only able to allocate a couple hours a week to this gig. \n\nThe thing is I have no education in this field. I’m a mechanical engineering student (yeah totally different field) and everything I learned about web design is through YouTube. \n\nSeems like in this economy you need a job + a side hustle to get by so was wondering what are my options. \n\nIt wouldn’t really make sense to drop out or switch majors to something design related since in other to match the salary I would have as an engineer I would need to be able to make  6k+ every month CONSISTANTLY.\n\nI thought about leaving my part time job and focus on this gig but I would need to make 1.3k+ every month (my part time job salary) for this to make sense. \n\nI tried outsourcing the work and take a 10-20% cut but it is really difficult to find someone that can deliver quality work and be paid only 70-100$ per website (I charge clients 100-140$ per website). \n\nMaybe I could enroll in a web design online course so I can deliver better work and charge more (400$+).\n\nWhat do you think?

Low crime rate – I want a safe area for both customers and employees.\n\n\n2. Good business potential – A location with strong demand for shipping services and steady foot traffic.\n\n\n3. Sustainable revenue – A place where operating costs are reasonable and profit margins make sense.\n\n\n\nFrom what I’ve researched:\n\nPlano seems to have low crime and a solid economy.\n\nDallas is a major hub but has some crime concerns.\n\nPhiladelphia has a big market but also higher crime rates.\n\nNew Jersey varies a lot by city, so I’d need to choose wisely.\n\n\nDoes anyone have experience running a shipping/logistics business in these areas? Which would you recommend, and are there any hidden pros/cons I should consider? Would love to hear from locals or business owners who know the scene!\n\nThanks in advance!",

      "text": "*If you’re building something in the dark, just know you’re not alone.*\n\nNot sure why I’m posting this here. Maybe just needed to let it out somewhere. Maybe to leave something better behind than just another quiet day lost to the scroll.\n\nTwo years ago, I decided to start over. I put everything i had — savings, time, all of it — into rebuilding a life that felt like it had slipped through my fingers. No team. No safety net. Just me and a laptop.\n\nI live in a country where the economy keeps tightening its grip. Prices climb, opportunities shrink. I’m lucky because I have a roof over my head — my parents' old house — but beyond that, it’s been a daily fight to keep going. Most days feel like pushing a broken-down car uphill barefoot, hoping the engine kicks in before nightfall.\n\nI’m also carrying some old scars. PTSD has been a quiet passenger for a long time.  \nIt doesn’t announce itself. It doesn’t ask permission.  \nSome days it’s a cold weight in my chest before I even open my eyes.  \nSome nights it’s lying awake with a brain that wont stop replaying old battles that should’ve been long buried.  \nIt’s the sudden tightness in your throat when nothing’s even wrong.  \nIt’s the missed opportunities, the unanswered messages, the invisible walls you build around yourself without meaning to.\n\nAnd when you're building something alone — no boss, no steady paycheck, no teammates to remind you why you started — those days can get loud.  \nYou wonder if you’re crazy.  \nYou wonder if it’s selfish to even try.  \nYou wonder if maybe everyone else got a manual you missed.\n\nI’m not sharing this because I think my story is special.  \nI'm sharing it because I think some people need to see that *imperfect, messy building* is still worth it. That progress doesn't always look like winning. Sometimes it just looks like **not quitting**.\n\nSomewhere along the way, i found myself working on a newsletter business.  \nA small project at first — something real, something that could stand on its own, without needing hype or shortcuts.  \nIt wasn’t planned like a startup deck. It started as a lifeline.  \nWrite a little. Build a little. Try to create something useful out of the chaos.\n\nI never really introduced myself before, but I've been around crypto since 2013.  \nBought my first coins off forums back when Bitcoin still felt like a science experiment.  \nIn 2018, I started working full-time in the space — helping projects grow, writing, trying to contribute to something bigger than just price charts and speculation.\n\nThis new chapter, though — it’s different.  \nIt’s slower. It's smaller.  \nBut maybe, in some strange way, it’s stronger too.\n\nI’m not asking for sympathy or a handout.  \nMaybe just... if someone stumbles across this post, sees the road I'm trying to walk, and finds a little extra strength for their own journey — that would be enough\n\nI’ll leave you with something Tom Hanks once said that I keep tucked in the back of my mind on the hardest days:\n\n\"I wish I had known that; this too shall pass.\n\nYou feel bad right now, you feel pissed off, you feel anxious — yes, this too shall pass.\n\nOh great, you feel great, you feel like you know all the answers — yeah, this too shall pass.\n\nYou feel like everybody finally gets you — and there you are — yeah, this too shall pass.\n\nTime is your ally.\n\nAnd if nothing else... just wait it out.\"\n\nThanks for reading  \nReally",

I've been considering the idea of expanding this B2B SaaS business into Chinese market. Given China's massive economy and the rapid growth of its tech sector, it seems like there could be huge potential there. \n\nHowever, I did some research about their \"data  sovereignty\" and I'm aware that entering the Chinese market isn't straightforward. There are too many challenges like strict regulations, potential censorship issues, and significant cultural and language differences etc. Many of them have never joined global community due to Internet autarky, this could be a huge problem. I don't know if they can see our product or do we have to do some paperwork with their bureau or sth. If it's needed, the legal landscape can be complex, and building trust with local businesses might require a different approach than in other markets(I've seen that they may steal your product and make a similar one to take your clients).\n\nHas anyone here looked into or attempted selling B2B SaaS products in China? What advantages did you see, and what obstacles did you encounter? Is it worth pursuing, or are the barriers too high to overcome?",

      "text": "Hey everyone. I guess I’m not even sure why I’m writing here, I guess to vent and connect with people in a similar field. \nFor some context, I’m 21 years old, and I’ve been running a business for 4 years. I started it myself, we make pet supplements, last October I finally moved out of my room and into a warehouse. The expenses have been a bit more than I was used to but I’m doing ok. \nI hired an employee to help manufacture the product and it took a massive load off of my back. However, lately it seems as thought I’m hitting a rough patch. I got into a fight with my brother, who was essential in helping to package  thousands of jars to send out to retailers. That work fell on me now. My worker producing the product has produced pretty ugly products lately, and its stressing me out. It’s still fully functional, but I’m worried what customers might be upset at the change in aesthetic consistency. I can’t throw the product out because it’s two weeks worth of work and I’d fall very far behind. In addition, the jars I pack the calcium into where delayed and I was not able to send out product for almost a month (usually its done on a weekly basis). My Amazon stock is doing ok, and I still had some inventory from before, but I’m getting really low. I also got a massive order from one of my huge retailers. It’s 100x what they usually order and was totally unexpected. I was finally able to ship it to them after waiting for the jars. However, now my product manufacturer suddenly quit on me. He was working part time for me and I know he want something full time - well he found it and quit on me. I can’t be upset, I know he has to do what’s necessary to survive in this economy. Now I’m stuck with extremely low inventory, minus two employees, and to top it all off I’m still in college and organic chemistry has been beating my behind. I know it gets better, I know I’m not quitting, but I guess I just have no one to share this with who will understand.",

Teams and ubiquitous high speed internet have been battle-tested by COVID, and they work.  RTO is not green, and it is not great for the economy. When employees are OE, and they get limited to ONE JOB, the  economy contracts by the income from J2 & J3 that is NOT being generated! And when they fire you from J1, your unemployment benefits do not make up for J1 and certainly not J2 & J3. The severity of the contraction in the economy from RTO is not going to be predicted by the Fed, and I am sorry about THAT! The system should be enhancing #WFH not decimating it! Time to prove it by accounting for exemplary annual income statements from #WFH by industry and age cohort. I am very sure that the utility of the labor force in the next generation of human workers is in peril. In many ways routine work tasks are being supplanted by \"good-enough\" AI routines. AI does not need food, clothing or housing. Thud the link between income and regional economic health is broken.  Furthermore, regional economic growth that benefitted from enhanced job growth and higher per worker income from the OE, is reduced by RTO.  The economic jump-start to regional growth from higher employment, has been minimized. The multiplier impact of higher local household income is consolidated in EBay and Amazon and BigBox sales. Last time I looked, there were no Seasonal light shows or high school performances in the warehouse District. With FedEx, UPS, USPS & Amazon delivery usage replacing the need for anchor stores, shopping malls and centers of commerce, domestic order clerks in brick & mortar retail watch their jobs shift first to domestic #WFH, and then to abroad #WFH service agents in lower wage countries routed through data centers in the USA. The time will come thanks to Watson, SIRI & Alexa when AI & ChatGPT will be the only ones partying up-n-tha-club--because no humans that are not trust fund babies will have jobs that pay enough discretionary income to pay the cover!",

I have $100k ready to invest into my business.  My plan is starting a Turo fleet of probably right around 10 economy cars with my initial investment, and then as time progresses, use revenue from this fleet to purchase a few rental properties.\n\nI am planning on taking 25% of my total cash flow from the rentals as my salary, setting aside 30% for taxes, and then taking the remaining 45% for maintenance, repairs, insurance, and then reinvesting back into the business.  This would either be buying more cars for the fleet, or making the leap into rental properties.\n\nMy end goal would be a rental fleet of around 50 cars (looking to bring in around $50k total cash flow per month), and own 5 or so rental properties, and then possibly expanding into niche vacation Airbnb rentals (tiny homes in the canyon, unique type of stay experiences).\n\nI am just very nervous because I have always just worked for a company, and got paid by the hour for whatever time I put in.  I am very excited for this step, but also a bit scared.  So any advice, tips, anything at all that could possibly help me in this venture would be very appreciated.  \n\nThanks so much everybody!",

Not a little bump, but a full-on wall. I mean, how are we supposed to deal with that? We’re already barely keeping up with US suppliers on price, and now we’re just… out. I’m sending out quotes and getting nothing but crickets. Our customers don’t want to pay more, and we can’t just eat the cost. There’s literally nowhere to go.\nI had to hit pause on hiring, forget about expanding, and even tell my family that the home reno we were planning is off the table for now.\nI’ve spent way too many late nights Googling for solutions—different suppliers, new pricing tricks, trying to bundle shipments. I even started looking at some of these AI tools that promise to track tariffs or help with sourcing. Some of them sound cool, but honestly, most are either way too expensive or just don’t get what it’s like for a business our size.\nSo, I’m just throwing this out there:\nHas anyone actually found a tool or platform that helps with this stuff?\nAnd how are you dealing with this?\nI can’t be the only one who feels like this is going to mess with way more than just my business. If you’re in the same boat, or just want to vent, I’m all ears. This whole thing feels like we’re getting hit from all sides, and nobody’s talking about it.",

      "text": "I'm an old timer. I began work in the US around 1980. I was there during the monopolies of AT&T, IBM, etc. I had gone to technical school after getting my degree in English and became a programmer. Initially, I worked for AT&T. I was expected to do my work and once a week, submit a status report. This I did easily and happily. I loved the system I was working on. I had worked on that system for years, but more often than not, a man would be promoted over me. Only once did I approach my boss's boss about this and was dismissed like nothing happened. Also, the company played games. Once upon a system, the company was developing an employee data base. Those who worked on it were expected to work as many hours as humanly possible. This system ended up costing three lives. One programmer fell asleep driving home and crashed his car. Two more programmers committed su\\*cide. More than one marriage broke up because of it. \n\nThe thing about corporations at this time is that (despite fatalities working on the system) they did not expect your life and soul. There were none of these \"Employee Days\" where you were expected to show up at a park and solve a murder. They didn't try to mess with your mind. This was back when the disgustingly-named \"Human Capitol\" was called \"Personnel.\" \n\nI moved from a state that had plenty of well-paying jobs back to my home state, where jobs have always been scant and precious. When I went back into the work force, the only job I could get was as a CSR at an insurance company. I was paid $16.25/hr whereas before I usually got $35+/hr. I have never been micromanaged before as I was at that company. And, they lied to all of us. One fateful day, they said that CSR work was going to go away and invited us to become agents for the travel insurance part of the company. I rested easy.\n\nThey lied. On November 14, everyone in my department was told that their last day would be November 15 and our benefits would end on November 30. The only severance was to pay out what remained of your PTO.\n\nThat's happening all over the US now. But I believe - well, along with AI - the majority of the blame belongs to people with MBA degrees. Their sole focus is the bottom line/shareholder value. It doesn't matter how many people they'll leave jobless. All that matters is squeezing every last dime out of the corporation.\n\nI could rant on - and have. Beware going into American business. The sharks are swarming and they're after YOU.",

      "text": "I will be seeking legal and a CPA, just trying to do research a bit first. You can check my post history for my last post for details. But long story short I am a WOSB and a person I initially brought on to be an employee, instead now wants to provide my business a $100,000 loan with 8% APR for me to use as working capital and for him to be paid back usually within 30-60 days which is the standard repayment time frame that I’m okay with. If he does this, he wants 49% of my company and access/control of the business bank acct. \n\nOn top of this, he doesn’t want me to have any control of that loan for the reason that it’s his money and he doesn’t know if I’ll pay it back or not, which is why he wants 49% ownership. We are friends outside of work. I know, never do business with friends. But I don’t have excellent credit to get any business loans at this time, so he would be my only option. He knows that in the world of worst case scenario where I ran off with the funds, at this point in time he wouldn’t get it back because I have nothing if he sues me. This is a fair and scary thought, I would feel the same. So I want to do everything legally possible to ensure and give him piece of mind that he won’t get screwed over, but also have it be reasonable, legal, and fair to me as well.\n\nThe business is for government contracting where you get profit on each bid you win. Does this mean if he owns 49% of my business, that he is entitled to 49% of profit? \n\n\nUpdate:\n\nWelp, I just wanted to provide an update to this. Before he came to me with his list of demands, he was going to provide a loan for our first contract if I put in the bid for it. I actually didn’t even want to submit for that bid if our only option was using his money. But he really wanted this contract and told me to do it. After we put in the bid and won, is when he said wanted the 49%, control of my bank acct, etc. \n\nWhen I told him I wouldn’t do the terms, he ended up being the one to screw me over on the contract by reneging where I was left with fronting $35k that he said he would. Even though he was the one who kept telling me yes to do the bid and that he would cover it. I reminded him him what would happen if it went unfulfilled (debarred, fines, etc because it was a gov contract) and he still said yes let’s do it. After I said I would offer him partnership at a lower percentage and that I didn’t feel comfortable giving him access to my bank acct, he came back at me saying “I don’t feel comfortable to do the loan”. When I reminded him that he was the one who wanted to do the bid in the first place, and not me, he told me to figure out another way and ghosted me. \n\n10+ years of friendship down the drain. But at least I found out who he truly is. He would screw over friends just to “get rich quick” off of their hard work.",

      "text": "I invested an entire year developing software, staying up late every night, working until midnight, sometimes even until 1 AM, which disrupted my biological clock a lot. I spent time understanding shop owners' needs, writing code, communicating with the team, and gradually building the entire e-commerce system.\n\nThen I started promoting it to shop owners one by one. Friends who own shops said they were already using competitors' products and couldn't easily migrate to my system. Most shop owners I found online didn't respond to my messages. The few who did respond and tried my software, I gave them a free one-year trial, they logged in once and never used it again.\n\nYesterday, my wife asked me to bring soy milk for our child. I remembered to take it when leaving home, but forgot to give it to my child when dropping off at kindergarten. My wife said I was too unreliable. During our argument, she complained that I was putting so much effort into a business that wasn't making money, and was actually losing money.\n\nFrom full of confidence to feeling desperate, I really suffered too much. It's a good software that provides better user experience than Shopify at a much lower price. It has so many advantages. Despite investing so much time, money, and effort, no one is using it.\n\nI have a dream to use my technology to improve the society and support my life, I believe in my ability, I want to be successful someday. After 10 years’ endeavor in technology industry, now I’m 32, the hope is really smaller and smaller, nearly fading.  \n\nA successful elder told me that personality determines destiny, and maybe I just have the kind of personality that can't succeed.\n\nHow can I do the marketing? How can people know my business?",

When I audit the code, it's not always pure spaghetti (though sometimes it is), but the structure is almost always... odd.\n\nWeird libraries, no constants, zero reusability, magic numbers everywhere, one massive Git branch, manual deploys - it’s all there. I get that early-stage teams don’t always have the budget for top-tier devs, but saving money upfront often means hiring someone who’s never worked in a team, never had their code reviewed, and never touched a scalable product.\n\nSure, the app “works” but it’s built in a way that only the original dev can maintain - and even that won’t last long.\n\nAnd guess what happens next?\n\nThe original dev disappears, and I’m left staring at code that barely holds together. No docs, no design files, no CI/CD - just chaos. It can take weeks just to understand what’s going on.\n\nCommon issues I keep seeing:\n\n\\- Massive functions doing 10+ things\n\n\\- No comments, no documentation, No Figma, just vibes\n\n\\- “Tests” is a foreign concept\n\n\\- Numbers everywhere in a code\n\n\\- Prints/console.logs everywhere - NO logger at all Least popular libraries being used, Like literally sometimes I think they wrote these libraries and promoting usage this way :D\n\n\\- Backend returning 200 OK even on errors\n\n\\- and so on..\n\nHonestly, I don’t blame the devs. Most of them were just never taught how to build maintainable software and trying earning money freelancing. They were focused on getting something out fast, and they did—just not in a way that scales.\n\nAnd the founders? They usually don’t know what to look for until it’s too late.\n\nFor cases like this, we started using a simple internal checklist that I put into book for 40+ pages to catch red flags early (management + tech side) - even for non-technical folks. If anyone wants a copy, I’m happy to share it. Just DM me.\n\nHope this helps someone avoid the same trap.",

We specialize in vinyl wraps for regular vehicles, custom graphic design wraps for commercial vehicles and fleets—all done in-house, from design to installation. \n\nI’ve got a solid team: one to two full-time wrappers and a receptionist/manager who handles *a lot* of roles, including answering calls, closing deals through our CRM, following up with customers, taking photos, and generally keeping the shop running smoothly. I pay him a 4% commission on revenue after expenses, so he's definitely motivated.\n\nThat said, we’ve hit a plateau, and I’m struggling to figure out why we can’t break past this $50k/month ceiling. I feel like the market is there for us to grab, but something is holding us back. I know customer acquisition is key, but how can we do a better job of attracting new clients for our vehicle wrapping services? \n\nI also wonder if my manager/receptionist is taking on too much, which might be limiting our growth, but I can't afford to bring in additional staff until we hit around $100,000/month in revenue. \n\nSome specific questions:\n- How can we get creative in finding new customers?\n- Are there specific marketing strategies that have worked for others in niche industries like vehicle wrapping?\n- Should I be hiring for certain roles to offload tasks from my manager, or is this setup working fine for now?\n- Any other advice or perspectives would be hugely appreciated!\n\nThanks so much for any help or suggestions you can offer. I know there’s a lot more potential here, I just need to figure out how to unlock it.",

We’re running Instagram and Facebook ads, but it’s not going the way I hoped. First couple of days had a few sales (probably from friends, family, and early followers), but since then… crickets. Every day I’m checking the store, the ad dashboard, and I just feel more anxious and defeated.\n\nIt’s starting to hit me how much I’ve invested in this, financially, emotionally, and time-wise. I don’t want to give up, but I also don’t know if I’m just throwing money away at this point.\n\nHas anyone here been through the same early-stage struggle? How did you push through it? Any tips on how to actually get strangers to care and buy would be appreciated.\n\nI’m proud of what I built, but right now, it’s hard to see past the fear of it failing.\n\nThanks in advance to anyone who takes the time to share advice or even just a few encouraging words.",

      "text": "Feels like back in the day, getting a business degree was the move if you wanted to start a company or get a solid job. But now? With so many resources and just actually doing stuff, do we really need four years of lectures on “market trends”?\n\nMost schools still teach business like it’s 1995, textbooks, case studies, and zero real-world experience. Meanwhile, the people actually making moves are out there building, failing, and figuring it out as they go.\n\nWhat do you think? Are business degrees still worth it, or is hands-on experience the real way to go?",

      "text": "Hello! My boyfriend has been working at a small town bar for about a year and a half. It’s been his dream forever to own a bar. Well, the owners just broke it to him last night that they are moving, and they want him to take over. We only have a few months to figure this out, and of course I will be doing research, but I need some help helping him plan - I know nothing about this, so please be nice.\nThe bar itself will need to be renamed (and I assume relicensed). I know about the terms LLC, etc., and know there’s something there we will have to do, but I have no idea what.\nAs well as, what are some things that are smaller that are very important to starting up a new business (it is already ‘established,’ we will remain with the furniture as well as the liquor selection)? Stuff like getting onto google maps, a square subscription, etc? \nAnd advertising - this is a small town but we do get tourists and have some big factories nearby so a lot of people stop in from out of town as it’s a very nice bar. I don’t imagine we’ll be doing TV ads or anything like that, probably just social media posts, but I’d love some advice!\nA website to design menus? Any YouTube channels or websites with courses about starting a business? Anything you did while starting your business that you wish you didn’t?\nReally anything will help. This is his dream, and I want this to go as smoothly as possible. We luckily will have a lot of free help, as well as a lot of TOPPP shelf liquor that we won’t be restocking, but will make us a good amount of money before we run out. I know there’s a big chance this won’t work out but it would be insane to not give it a shot. \nThank you to anyone who offers any help or advice here! Seriously, anything helps.",

      "title": "Hot take - Most businesses shouldn't use AI for customer service",
      "text": "I run a voice AI company, and I regularly tell potential customers not to buy our product. My sales team thinks I'm crazy. But after implementing AI for dozens of companies, I've learned that forcing AI into the wrong situation creates more problems than it solves.\n\nLast month, a law firm called us. They wanted AI to handle client intake calls. After listening to their recordings, I told them they weren't ready. Their intake process involved nuanced legal questions, emotional clients describing traumatic events, and complex eligibility assessments. An AI handling these calls would have been a disaster.\n\nThis happens more than you'd think. The hype around AI has convinced every business they need it yesterday. But here's the reality: AI works brilliantly for specific use cases and fails spectacularly for others.\n\nHere are the 3 boxes your business needs to check before even CONSIDERING voice AI:\n\n**Box 1: Your calls follow predictable patterns**\n\nI analyzed transcripts from 10,000+ customer calls across different industries. In some businesses, 80% of calls are variations of the same 5-10 conversations. Appointment scheduling, FAQ responses, status updates, basic troubleshooting. These patterns are perfect for AI.\n\nBut if every call is unique, stop right there. A mental health clinic we evaluated had no two calls alike. Each patient had complex, personal situations requiring empathy and careful listening. AI would have been harmful, not helpful.\n\nWe built a pattern analysis tool that reviews your call transcripts. If fewer than 70% of your calls follow recognizable patterns, AI isn't ready for you. One home services company discovered 85% of their calls were just booking appointments. They were perfect candidates. A B2B software company found only 30% of calls followed patterns. They needed humans.\n\n**Box 2: You have clear escalation triggers**\n\nAI fails gracefully only if you've defined what \"failing\" means. I watched one company implement a chatbot without escalation rules. The bot kept trying to help increasingly frustrated customers who were asking for managers. It was painful.\n\nBefore you implement AI, map out exactly when calls should transfer to humans. Specific phrases, sentiment thresholds, topic boundaries. One of our most successful implementations is a dental clinic that transfers immediately when patients mention pain levels above 7/10, insurance complications, or emergency situations.\n\nThe escalation can't be an afterthought. It needs to be core to your design. We recommend starting with aggressive escalation rules and loosening them over time. Better to transfer too many calls initially than to trap frustrated customers with an inadequate AI.\n\n**Box 3: Your economics support the investment**\n\nHere's the uncomfortable math most vendors won't share. A proper voice AI implementation costs between $50,000-$200,000 in the first year, depending on complexity. That includes the technology, integration, training, and ongoing optimization.\n\nIf you're handling fewer than 1,000 calls per month, the ROI rarely works. One small retailer wanted AI for their 20 calls per day. I showed them the math. They'd pay $5,000/month to save $2,000 in labor costs. It made no sense.\n\nBut scale changes everything. A property management company handling 5,000 calls monthly was spending $45,000/month on call center staff. AI reduced that by 60% while improving response times. The investment paid for itself in 3 months.\n\n**From everything I’ve seen, these are the businesses that I think should run toward AI:**\n\n* High-volume appointment scheduling (healthcare, home services, salons)\n* Basic customer support with clear FAQ patterns (e-commerce, utilities)\n* After-hours coverage for predictable inquiries (any business missing calls)\n* Multilingual support for simple interactions (expanding businesses)\n\n**The businesses that should wait:**\n\n* Complex technical support requiring deep expertise\n* Emotional or sensitive conversations (healthcare diagnostics, financial hardship)\n* High-value B2B sales conversations\n* Regulated industries with strict compliance requirements\n\nThe best implementations I've seen don't try to replace humans entirely. A dental chain uses AI to handle appointment scheduling and basic questions, freeing their staff to focus on patient care. Their human agents now handle complex insurance issues and patient concerns instead of repetitive booking calls.\n\nAnother success story: A home services company that only uses AI after hours. During business hours, humans handle everything. But from 5pm to 8am, AI captures leads and books appointments they used to miss entirely. They added $200K in annual revenue just from previously missed calls.\n\nMost businesses approaching us fail at least one of these three boxes. That's okay. AI technology is improving rapidly. What doesn't make sense today might be perfect in 12 months. But implementing too early is worse than waiting.\n\nI'd rather have 50 happy customers using AI appropriately than 500 frustrated ones forcing it where it doesn't belong. The technology is powerful, but it's not magic. Know your use case, understand your economics, and design for graceful failure. Only then does AI transform from an expensive experiment into a competitive advantage.",

I hear the same thing every time:\n\n\"Actually, tbh, it might be a good idea to just build this with a real software engineer and then maintain it in-house\"\n\nThe real reason you haven't done this yet is either:\n\n• complacency - i.e. another business offers a service to do it for me, so I won't do it myself  \n• changeability - i.e. its too expensive right now to switch from this expensive service to an in-house solution that I pay for **once.**  \n• uncertainty - i.e. idk who to trust, what the actual cost after a few months will be, and how much of a headache my solution would be compared to the SaaS\n\nThe reality is that the uncertainty, complacency, and changeability mindset keeps you trapped in a technofeudalist society, where every feature you need is locked behind a paywall that egregiously benefits corporations who barely maintain their own products relative to what they charge.\n\nI think it is far smarter to hire a high-context growth agency than to handle all the subscription payments for the rest of your life. The tradeoff you make by living in complacency to ready-built subscription tooling isn't real. There is no real reason to keep things the way they are. I propose that we as business owners should always put our finances first and stop handing dollars over to greedy corporations who offer half-baked software products.\n\nI build these in-house solutions for local businesses and so far, it has been *insanely successful.* Not by a shadow of a doubt do I recommend ever staying with SaaS subscriptions -- your data should be yours, your solutions should be yours, and your system should be custom-fitted to the problems you solve.\n\nvladusatii\\_ is my handle on IG if anyone wants to chat more about this.",

      "text": "Hello fellow business lords. Ill try and keep this short and sweet.\n\nI love my friend dearly. I consider and call him my brother. We've been through alot together including the passing of his wife a decade ago and my mother last year. We have always been there for each other. \n\nHe told me he was unhappy at his job in texas and said something that alarmed me so I said if you want Ill come get you and we can open a kava bar together. I'll put up all the capital I just need you to find a place to stay down here in florida and ill give you 20% if you run it for me. \n\nHe says hell yeah. A month later I fly down there and drive him here. We arrive at my house and it turns out he hasn't locked in a place even though he told me not to worry about it. I would have let him stay at our house but he moved to Seattle to be near one of our other \"brothers\" and it was 6 or 7 months before he landed a job. My fiance did not want that to be the case so I had him stay with a coworker of mine. She agreed to let him stay if he paid half the rent. \n\nI asked him to find a job while we put together the kava bar. He said he put in over 1000 applications but couldn't find anything. Multiple times I offered him a position at margaritaville since my friend is the GM there. He ignored the multiple requests. \n\nFast forward. We open the bar.  It goes gang busters. Were doing considerably better than we expected. We get to talking about numbers and how we're crushing our percantages which leads me to ask you remember our agreement ya? And he says no. We never talked about a percentage. And that he assumed after we paid me back the \"70k\" i put in Wed be 60/40. I said no. I put in over 90k but I wasn't going to mention the other 30k because I never would have imagined him trying to back out of our deal and me handing him keys to a new life. \n\nThere was even a point in this making of the bar where I literally BEGGED him for help. His excuse was that he was not in a good head space and that's why he didnt do anything for a few months. Not being in a good headspace is a luxury. I did not get to not be in a good head space.  I had to make money to make our dream a reality. \n\nSo my TLDR is this. \n\nWhat percentage would you give someone if you put 100% of the capital. You sourced 100% of the products you sell. Hired and paid every contractor. Went to city hall and attained all of the permits. Came up with the theme, idea and brand of the bar. Made every purchase order for all of our products. Went to resteraunt depot every time we were low on supplies And allowed him to take first draw of the money the bar has generated because he hasn't paid my friend in 3 months?\n\nIn his defense he did paint the bar's walls, ran the track for the led lights that surround the perimeter and helped one of the construction workers lay tile on the floor. Hes also been my proxy waking up early and letting the contracors in the building while I was either busy working or asleep from working 3 jobs making money to fund the bar. He does work opening shifts 2 to 8 and I work the night shift 8 to 2. He's also built our website but my fiance does all of the marketing and social media. He also says he will do all of the back end stuff like payroll and taxes which he says business taxes cost 10 to 15k but I own an another business and it doesn't cost near that. \n\nWhat in your mind would be a fair split?",

But right now, I feel like i am hitting a wall.\nI even catch myself thinking about going into scam methods. I know its wrong, but when nothing seems to work and I see other people making money fast, its hard not to think about it.\nI dont want to ruin my life or end up in jail. I just want a way to build something real\nHave any of you been in a similar situation? How did you get out of this mindset?

My old boss has taken a new opportunity in another state and has offered the business to me for $325,000. Right now the business is doing $40k a month in sales with $13k profit, which includes the 2 owners car payments and their salary. If I purchase the business I am positive I can be selling $60k monthly within 90 days of taking over. The company comes with approximately $80,000 in assets, and an existing customer base. I feel like I could pay it off inside of 4 years as it sits now. Does this sound like a good investment? I'd be buying on contract with no money down.

      "text": "Hi All, I live in San Diego and am 43 and work for the federal government but am so tired of all the headaches at times and I work extremely hard. I make about $195k and max out my 401k.  I seem to save about $50k cash each year right now. No kids and never married and at this pace with how bad dating in my city is I’m sure I’ll be single for the foreseeable future!\n\nI currently own a home worth about 1.15 million and owe $225k on it.  I have $300k in my 401k which id like to leave alone and another $300k I saved on the side currently in VOO ETF.\n\nI did the math and my living expenses are $70k a year being super conservative (with $1200 a month saved for house maintenance/remodel).  This makes me think I need about $100k of income minimum.\n\nWhat would you do with $300k to get closer to financial independence?\n\nI thought of the following but I don’t know if they’re a pipe dream:\n\n1.  Expand my home to have a studio in the rear and live in it and rent the rest of the house but that still wouldn’t let me quit my job.\n\n2. Partition my home (strategically) so I can use the majority of it as an air bnb… I still can’t quit my job.\n\n3. Start a coffee shop or two near a high density development.. I read coffee shops may take $200k to open up and owners make $48k on average..\n\nMaybe open a surf shop (can be inland) combined with coffee shop to make more profit and draw more people?\n\n4. Open a surf academy near one of the inland wave pools.. Waco Texas has a wave pool even professional surfers are traveling to surf man made waves… although I’m sure it’s just a matter of time before others do just this if they haven’t already.\n\n5. Sell my house and buy a 1 bedroom and put the remainder in VOO\n\n6. Just leave my $300k in VOO and hope my stress levels go down with my federal job and let time do its thing and keep putting $50k a year in s&p 500\n\n\nI’m somewhat risk adverse… I realize I could also put myself in an even more stressful situation with a coffee shop or other business but I also like control and hate being told what to do all the time in my current line of work.\n\nBottom line is my work life balance is awful right now and I want to surf more.. I’m happy to work hard especially if I can bring my passion into it (surfing is one of my passions) but want more flexibility and control but not be living totally on the edge either if I leave a stable job like I have now.\n\nAny advice?",

      "text": "Hey Reddit, need advice.\n\nI’ve been planning a small smash burger setup with my sister for about a year. It’s in my home yard on a main road near schools, gyms, paddle courts — good spot. I own the grill, tables, chairs, and I’m the cook. Me and my sister are 50/50 partners.\n\nI told a friend about it recently. First, he said, “It’s hard, you’ll face issues.” Then just days later, he wants in. He’s offering 10k PKR but already acting like a co-founder — telling me how to price, what to add, asking for Instagram access, talking about buying bikes from profits.\n\nHe can only help 3 days a week, but seems confused how I’ll manage the rest. Honestly, he’s bossy and acting like he owns it, even though I’ve been planning this solo for a year.\n\nI said “we’ll work it out” but now I want to shut it down without wrecking the friendship.\n\nShould I just be direct and say no? Anyone been through this?\n\n\nEdit: 10k pkr=40bucks\n\nWe are students around 17 so yeah and in Pakistan \n\n\nEdit2: talked to him still asking for a percentage in business. \n           But saying that discuss with your sis and then finalize         everything\nTo clarify further - I asked him what unique input he brings that I haven't already handled. He said \"recipes, new items,\" and claimed that \"cooking is his thing\" and that \"he's good at it.\" He also said if we add shakes, he'll make those too, and mentioned \"investment.\"\n\nBut honestly, I already developed the core recipes and wrote all the ratios myself. I acknowledged he mentioned shakes - no doubt - but that's the only new suggestion. After that, he just repeated \"new recipes\" and \"new items\" without anything concrete.\n\n\nEdit 3: I told him it's not possible to have him as a partner with just 10kpkr\nCause all the assets I currently have are worth well over 600k\n10k would mean 1.6% SMTH EQUITY SO YEAH NO",

We are starting to think about opening a second company which would focus on leasing. For exemple 3200 cashdown 887 per month for 5 year with 500 buyback at the end. (36500 truck that I sold). Plan would be to use our own cash for the first 2M then after 2-3 years try and raise capital at 5-6%. Is it as simple as that? Does the bank do this kind of financing or we need to raise money privately? Anyone has any experience? \n\nFor us it would be really easy to deploy 2M considering half our customers do some kind of leasing on the stuff we sell and all the rates are between 9-14%.",

However, I currently don’t have the resources.\n\nSo, I am raising $15K, which will help me build teams and create a predictable acquisition system that can help me scale faster.

The only problem is that even though my dropshipping venture was successful, I did not gather enough money to buy my own place(It is very important to buy it, because it serves a s scrap value in case this whole thing crashes and burns ).\n\n \n\nI tried to get a loan from Chase, but they were not sold on the idea, regardless of how many successful months I had. This is why I decided to explore smaller banks. One of them is https://fairfigure.com/. They are selling themselves on the idea that the bank aims to get the funding quickly. All I had to do was to sign up, verify my business, and secure the funding. I decided to test it out for myself, and it went mostly as advertised. The only thing left to do is to sign the final paperwork. Yet this is the part where I got cold feet. I really need your opinion. Did you have any experience with this bank, or any other smaller bank for that matter? Are they as reliable as bigger banks? Is there any infamous fine print I should know about?\n\n \n\nThanks in advance for any support!",

      "text": "So I have a business of over 5 years in NY with my brother. It started out as 2 rental properties and in the last 2 years we also went into construction and built a new short-term rental property in PA. This was very expensive and me and my brother financed it ourselves over several credit cards. We had opened several new credit cards with 0% interest rate so it wasnt bad. But now those are gone and I have about 188k on credit cards or loans for the build. I want to get a loan for about 200k to consolidate all these personal credit cards and personal loans into just the business cards and reduce my interest rate and put some excess money into the business.\n\n  \nThe airbnb is now up and is already in the top earners in the area. It makes (gross) over 10k a month and can go over 20k a month in busy season. Me (200k) and my brother (100k) both make high salaries and me (650) and lemont (750) have good credit scores, I would like to get it under the business name as well so that I can build the business credit but I am fine with my brother getting it under his personal.\n\nI'm wondering if someone could give me some advice into some loans or lines of credit I could take out. Should I go to a big bank and just ask for a general business loan?",

But I’ve recently applied to ASU as an instate student for Business in Finance BS and Financial Planning BA as a second major option initially thinking it’d be easy getting in because of ASUs high acceptance rate, however now learning that wp carey school of business has a 30 percent acceptance rate in their BS majors \n\nThen I received an email stating I was admitted into ASU but put into business BA instead, and upon rexamming the admission information \n\n“ Students who are not admissible to a W. P. Carey business BS major and who did not select a second major or are not admissible to their second major choice are placed in a business Bachelor of Arts program in the W. P. Carey School of Business.” \n\nClairfys this, however I’m now wondering how come I was declined?\n\nIm thinking it’s becuase I’m a bare minimum student and the only admission requirement that I actually fulfill in is my GPA. Being a 3.36 unweighted but a 3.7 weighted (however a 3.5 in competency courses thus hitting the mark) though I lack in every other area, (no extracirculars also) \n\nSo my question is, dispite being initially declined from pursing finance BS my first year as an undergraduate. If I do well enough in business BA could I apply for a transfer to BS? I’ve done some research and this seems to be my best option but could I get some more elaboration please? Is there any downsides in this for the long run? And what major should I be pursuing in the mean time to make the transition smoother? \n\nAs for now, I’ve submitted a email to the school with an unofficial transcript attached hoping they’d reconsider me into the major though I feel that’s an unlikely chance of happening.",

I need help with sales, I don’t know what to do, as we need to cover the loss we might incur in the future before it happens\n\nI’m in early twenties, it’s a family business, I’m 1 year in and my father has been running this for 30, grandad same product different company and was the largest fsctory in the country, I have a lot to live up to, I’ve owned successful businesses since 16+ yrs old so I know how to run a small business, but this is on another scale for me, my largest business did like 200k/in a completely different industry so i’m out of my league a bit. My dad’s occupied with my grandma who has dementia for the past 5 years still on the phone to factory from morning at 5am to be on time for when the factory opens up, I need to support my father in this so I’d love some help as he’s suffering mentally too. I’m in a different country by myself managing the factory ~ 50 employees.\n\nWe are a clothing manufacturer, we supply to a very big company, they are big for us as we do 1-1.5m/year ish at 30%ish margins I’d say net around 300-450 - I do not lnow the finances, this is a guess/estimate, I only look at the production side\n\nNow these guys we have been working with for 15 years, always good, constant orders compared to other customers, if a product hits they order continuously,  good brand placements, the parent company is suffering (we work with 4 of their child companies) - our payment terms went from 30 days, to 60 days, and now they are paying 2 months late on 60 days, and I’ve heard they are paying up to 5 months late from my cousins who also work with them. \n\nNow I need to get sales up, and I don’t know how to, and I also don’t know how to deal with this customer. We work in a very niche part of clothing, but it’s expensive, and people love it, I can dive into B2C, i have the ability to make very very interesting pieces of clothing to say the least that people would pay top $$ for. I’ve been handed a business on a silver platter I do admit but I am kind of stuck on what to do. I have a very very good product, I would say our factory is one of the only in the country to be doing what we do (very high quality and high fashion).\n\nedit - i already know what’s wrong, my dad’s business was 5x bigger, he had to scale down because of my grandma, this big customer is very easy to deal with in every other way except this.",

Lately, I’ve been going through a bit of a quarter-life crisis. I’m starting to realize that I don’t enjoy coding as much as I used to. I still like the theory side of CS, but the constant grind—both in school and the job market—combined with the saturation and brutal technical interviews, is really burning me out. I’m struggling to find an internship for months now.\n\nI also have a family to support, so stability is a big priority for me. I’ve always had a strong interest in business and entrepreneurship, and want to own or run a business one day. ’m looking for a path that’s a little more stable,  helps me build capital early, gives me valuable skills, and also works as a solid fallback if things don’t go as planned.\n\nHere are the two options I’m currently considering:\n\n1. Double Major in Econ:\nThis would let me finish my CS degree and add some versatility for business/finance roles. I’ve also noticed a lot of successful people have econ degrees. To do this, I’d need 48 extra credits on top of the 98 required for CS, for a total of 146 credits. \n\n2. Switch to Business (Accounting focus):\nThis route would take more time—about 75 additional credits (for a total of ~152)—so probably an extra semester or two. But it might offer more stability and make more sense given I’m at a mid-tier school. Accounting seems like a safer bet career-wise, and it aligns more directly with my interest in business. Although i’ve heard accounting skills are easy to learn/pickup.  I also heard a masters might be better for this? not sure.\n\nI’m stuck between finishing CS with an econ double major (and keeping the door open to tech roles) vs. going all-in on business/accounting even if it means taking longer to graduate. Unfortunately, I can’t do a CS + business double major at my school.\n\nWould love to hear some thoughts",

I feel as if I know a lot about finance, but this seems beyond me. \n\nI work Food Service and will soon be promoted to General Manager (within a year hopefully). I don't expect much of an income increase at this point unfortunately, but it sets me up to be able to buy into ownership of this fast food franchise within 3ish years.\n\n\nA little bit about my current situation.\n\n     I have no debt.\n     I have credit cards that I spend on and pay off each month.\n     I own my car outright and expect another 4 years out of it.\n     I am 20 years old, turn 21 in January and will then be able to contribute to my company's 401(k).\n\n\nI currently make about 2800 a month net, and overall expenses is about 1500 a month.\n\nHere is my dilemma. When the time for ownership comes, it will easily be a six figure buy in. Any money I don't have I will have to take a loan from my boss and pay back out of ownership draws.\n\nDo I:\n1) Max out my Roth IRA and build a savings of 7.5k\n2) Take the company match on the 401k (6%) and contribute no more\n3) Save extremely aggressively for this business opportunity with 3-5 years, all money into an HYSA\n\nI appreciate all the help you can give me. I'm a nerd for math, so if there is a mathematically correct solution that would be awesome.\n\nTLDR: Do I put my $1,300 a month extra into savings to buy into a franchise fast food restaurant, or contribute to retirement and max Roth and contribute to 401k? \n\nEdit: I don't have an exact cost or interest rate on the buy in or loan process. My bosses keep their contracts very secretive and say that each contract is independent. If I bring more money to the table I get more ownership and bargaining power. I'm expecting upwards of $200k for a total buy in",

Secondly the claims there making of MRR, which not only might not be true, they probably are in there first month of revenue and do not realize MRR is monthly reccuring revenue hence if they have only had revenue for a month it is not reccuring.  \nAnyways back to the titile of the post, i think Charlie Munger says fish where the fish are. Clearly here everyone is building the same thing like a lead tool, or a project management tool, and the worst part is they have no differentiation, or they haven't even validated and there just building.  \nOn the other hand, those that are building and solving real problems, which is a lot harder than copying everyone else are the ones seeing success. Recently, i heard Andrew Wilkinson, the founder of Tiny a very successful holding comapny sometimes known as the Berkshire Hathaway of the internet mention a company on lennys podcast, that helps poeple that need government assistance with filling forms and they are doing like 30m a year.  \nSo yeah i figured i would just bring this up because i thought it was relevant feel free to correct me if i am wrong.",

      "text": "Hi all, I wanted to get an opinion from anyone on here that is a parent or that could offer any insight into my question. I know this is long, but I would really appreciate it if someone could give me an opinion.\n\nIf you see me as immature (or an idiot) please let me know and why, im hoping to use this post to help guide me in the right direction and mentality.\n\nBelow are details of how I got to the point where I am now.\n\n\\-----------------\n\nEver since I was 13, I wanted to be an entrepreneur. Back then I thought it would all be sunshine and rainbows and from immaturity I pitched ideas to my dad without a business plan that he naturally rejected.\n\nWhen I was 15, i got tired of constant rejection from my parents and decided to venture into Day trading with the view that I would only need my parents acceptance once (as i viewed that as the biggest bottle neck). I only had a demo account and never invested live money out of a combination of not making consistent returns on demo and my parents thinking that my ideas were \"distractions\" from school.\n\nwhen I was a junior in highschool, I had friends in the entrepreneurship club that were sneaker resellers and they offered to help me get started, I made a half decent list of the things I would need and pitched it to my parents to see if they would let me resell sneakers.\n\nI needed their approval since I would have needed a bank account to buy the sneakers when they were released and I didnt have one at the time.\n\nMy family, again, was against it and after multiple arguments at home where I was told I was just wasting my time I felt the immense negativity get to me around senior year which I later carried into college. This was worsened by seeing my friends being recognized at their new university's entrepreneurship club for achieving $200,000 in sales.\n\nI went to college to study finance as I liked the concept of learning about investing but I struggled in many classes and as a student with 2 semesters left my GPA is 2.9...\n\n\\[I managed to get a good internship when my GPA was better and I worked overtime for free so I can outwork the other interns, and by the 2nd week they asked me to help train the other interns, and they called me back to return this coming summer 2025\\].\n\nearlier in college, I still had multiple arguments with my parents about why they were against me starting that reselling business, the response would normally be either they didnt think i had enough money to make it worthwhile or they saw it as a distraction from school.\n\n**In my school assignments I would either commonly get stuck between 2 answers or I would forget a part of a math calculation that ends up making the whole problem wrong.**\n\n**I would study for 2 weeks in advanced for an exam, where I would often reteach my self the notes before doing practice problems and it still wasnt enough.**\n\n**After getting humbled constantly in my classes and the earlier rejection from my parents, I was in a very poor mental state last Nov/Dec that left me feeling like no matter what I did, I had no control over my life. A  problem that has been growing overtime and impacted me also in social settings (as you can see from my other posts).**\n\nThere was an accounting class that I ended up doing poorly on 3 times and nearly got kicked out of the finance major, I managed to get an appeal to take it a 4th time this summer but I also got the option to just do switch to a BS (Bachelor of Science) of Business with a focus in finance so i could graduate in May.\n\nI decided to stay in Finance so I could prove to myself, my family, and the amazing advisors that with a great heart accepted the appeal, that I could be successful.\n\nI found out that my university has a Academic success center and the counselor there offered me some advice that I never really thought about, but I resonated with tremendously.\n\nShe taught me about the forgetting curve and the importance of doing practice problems regularly. She also advised me to stop focusing on taking detailed notes and to instead focus on understanding the lecture while in class so that I can focus on just recalling information instead of LEARNING it when I should be studying.\n\nI am taking this semester light so I can focus on another class as a test run for how good I improve so I can have a better view if I should take the accounting class and finish my finance degree or if I should instead just take the remaining class I would need for the BS Business.\n\n\\-----\n\n**Now for my question**\n\nI was considering that when I get better I could learn how to program and make an app that helps people to study better? I figured that if I manage to improve then I would have an edge in helping people who had similar problems in studying????\n\nHow could I have faced my situation with my parents better? How could I avoid these types of conflicts with them in the future? How would you suggest coping with the rejection and moving forward?\n\nIf you had a son in my position, what would you tell him is the path forward? Or what lessons would you have hoped that he learned in college?\n\nThank you, I really appreciate anyone who took the time to read my massive post.",

      "text": "So recently i have been debating adding some formal education to my resume...\n\n  \nHere is the backstory,\n\nI am a Journeyman (Red Seal in Canada) Heavy duty mechanic, i have been in the trade for over 15 years and have recently dove into the business side quite heavily.\n\nI started as a contractor and was extremely successful with it, after 3 years i branched out, brought on a partner (another journeyman with extensive operations experience but no business side experience) and opened a shop in august of 2024, with very little start up capital and no debt we have grown the business to 7 people (5 employees), a fleet of service trucks and a fairly well equipped shop, things are going extremely well for how early on we are, and we are experiencing about 20% growth monthly, i expect we will be at about 225k gross monthly sales by the end of the year. \n\nI can feel a crossroads coming with the business, where we either go big, or start to stagnate and continue on as a healthy small business. There is massive growth potential in the market and i am confident in our formula to continue on so i am quite confident in the go big option but i am noticing a small hiccup.\n\nWith big business comes big finance, and after approaching financial institutions i have come to realize my lack of formal education is noteworthy, although i consider myself somewhat intelligent, i am just a tradesman and clearly come across that way in the boardroom. It has yet to be a major hold back, but i am wondering if the time has come to get a degree, obviously this is not a short term solution as this takes years, we have brought in a fractional CFO for the time being to provide guidance and appease the banks. \n\nSo here's my question, for people with or without a degree in business or something similar....\n\nDo you find that a degree has helped you grow your business at a high level? Obviously there is the educational value, but also the simple fact of the letters after your name on an email signature.  Should i soldier on and just keep absorbing business books and podcasts daily which has gotten me this far, or do i buckle down and pursue a formal degree?\n\n  \nThanks Reddit!",

I have 0 interest in climbing the ladder in hotels and ive been always interested in business related topics (accounting, marketing, finances etc…) so now im thinking of going that way and hopefully one day get a decent job or start my own business (own business would be the end goal but i dont know shit about the business world nor do i have any idea what kind of business i would want) \n\nMy question is: do i spend 3y (european university) on a BBA to then eventually get some experience in a company and work in a field that is interesting to me and make my way up there and eventually start my own thing OR do i enroll in some courses (like coursera) and just collect certificates of different topics (business related) and try to find a job this way. I guess jobs prefer bachelor degrees over certifications but it is possible getting jobs this way?\n\nMy ‘problem’ is that i am not 100% sure on what it is i actually wanna do and i found this one BBA with a very interesting curriculum that is broad in topics so i could ‘use’ it as a way to figure out what it is im most interested in and secure a degree which will probably help me alot later on in life. Or should i test out online courses instead and try to get a job this way? Im worried getting jobs with certifications wont be as easy \n\nAnyone who went this route and can tell me their story? Or someone who worked for a few years in one specific field but ended up switching over, if so, did you go for a new degree or courses to get jobs in this new field?\n\nIf anyone has any advice about the ‘wants to start a business but doesnt know what kind’ please tell me how you ended up starting your business!!",

      "title": "Looking for input on difficult family business dynamics",
      "text": "I will try to be as concise as possible here, being as this is a topic that unfortunately dominates most of my mental energy these days.\n\nI got involved in my father’s business in teenage years, probably right around 16 years old. It’s a highly labor intensive and demanding industry of local manufacturing and delivery of wood products. Being in high school, it wasn’t a place I’d choose to be involved with voluntarily, unless I needed to make some money or unless I was forced to go to work as a punishment for bad behavior (it was that bad).\n\nAfter graduating HS, I went off to college out of state. In my sophomore year, I returned home on Thanksgiving break to news of my father getting stopped by police, arrested for a 3rd DUI offense, lost his driving privilege, and was facing jail time. Turns out Dad’s business wasn’t doing so well, new competitors in town and losing customers, his drinking and depression worsened and his business was failing.\n\nMyself, somewhat knowing the ropes of this thing, offered to take a semester off and help him get himself/business back on their feet. If he couldn’t drive, he couldn’t make the deliveries, and ultimately would have been the end of that livelihood.\n\nSo that’s what I did. I offered to become the safety net until things improved. I got involved and learned a lot about the business. I built us a website to gain new customers and it literally took off like gangbusters. This was exciting and I began to see a lot of potential in the industry - large local demand and large potential customer base.\n\nSo, in that semester off from college, we essentially started a new venture with a new name and new goals. Dad never got his license back, but it was okay because we were going to hire a driver to handle the distribution and he could focus on production. We got things as in order as possible and I returned to finish the next 2.5 years of college one semester behind.\n\nWhile finishing my studies, I still managed the new website and spent time advertising and researching the market. My interests were continuing to grow and after graduating I ultimately decided to go all in on the business instead of going to graduate school.\n\nComing into this business, the EARLY years… those were ROUGH. The finances were in shambles, all equipment and essential tools broken down in one fashion or another. It was one disaster after another. However I had a clear vision for where we needed to be and was prepared to make the necessary sacrifices to get there.\n\nI went without any pay (still living at home under mom and dad’s roof), took out personal loans in my name to get newer or better equipment (they had a massive tax lien and so could not get approved for any financing), and even would use some “inheritance” money that I received from my Grandmother after finishing college to tide us over during slow periods. Mind you I was always responsible for making sure I was reimbursed afterwards.\n\nYears go on and problems persist. We got evicted from rental properties multiple times due to trust issues between my father and landlords. However my vision was strong and hopes for a better future remained. In spite of evictions and difficulty retaining employees because of conflicts with my father, our sales continued to grow. I continually stuck it out and put aside all the BS to keep the business afloat.\n\nFacing our third eviction in 2019, I realized we needed our own property for the business to keep growing. Because their finances were terrible, they weren’t able to secure funding for this property on their own. My mother ended up asking her father for help. He agreed to give them money for the land purchase. I fully believe that he wanted ME to be successful and have a sense of stability and security and was happy to help out.\n\nHowever, the land was purchased and is now deeded in my Mother’s name. I never thought that was the plan and that it should be owned by the company or a protected entity, not just an individual. They claimed we’d cross that bridge later on.\n\nFast forward a few more years, the business is now 100% a product of my creation. Our customers, methods, standards, and employee retention have all been accomplishments set forward by myself. Customer satisfaction is growing and I feel as though I should have an interest in ownership of the company. After lots of string pulling we finally established our LLC as 50/50 business partners.\n\nAs you can imagine this had its difficulties. I made the decision to hire my wife as a full time social media and marketing director with a good salary. He made the retaliatory decision to agree paying $2500 in monthly rent to my mother.\n\nNot happy with it, but in a 50/50 you’re unfortunately going to have to go along to get along sometimes to keep things running smoothly.  Jump ahead a few months and I walk up to my father watching porn in one of the equipment control cabins. He tries to laugh it off and then actually shows me what he’s watching! Disgusting to have your father doing this to you at 34 years of age. Can you imagine the conversations that ensued with my family!?\n\nUltimately this leads to him agreeing to give me majority ownership of the company. So now, I own 75% and he owns 25%.\n\nAlthough I am calling the shots, the problems still persist. He still drives around without a license, damages equipment at work, and has a poor working relationship with all of my employees.\n\nHe is 73 years old. I have tried to talk with him about retirement and he has firmly pushed back saying that he feels good and wants to keep working and running equipment. When I bring up liability and safety issues, he firmly balls up and doesn’t like to hear it. The accountability does not exist in him. He won’t own up to the fact that he’s getting older and needs to get a retirement plan in action.\n\nThey have no “nest egg” or retirement savings. It sounds like he wants to take his 25% in perpetuity until end of life. So he still needs income but his ability to do this kind of work is rapidly diminishing.\n\nI have presented the option of signing the land over to me, letting me set up a new business that I can lease out property that we’re not using to generate rental income to take care of them in retirement (essentially buying it from her and guaranteeing recurring monthly rental income). I don’t want to have the burden of taking care of them financially in perpetuity after he stops working.\n\nThey don’t seem too receptive of this plan. Also, he just went out and got himself a “new” pickup truck over the weekend. I had offered to provide him a company truck if he would get his license back first. But that was too much to ask I guess, because they went out and got one anyway (MOM must have bought it and registered it, she is just as complicit in this as he is. He always drives anywhere they go. It’s ludicrous! Then she claims she’s tried to talk to him about getting it back but he won’t do it. I can’t understand for the life of me!)\n\nThis 15 year long pattern has me highly concerned about the future of my business and my relationship with my father/business partner. I would like to start distancing myself from their toxic behaviors but I fear retaliatory actions. For instance, if I am to place my dad on unpaid leave, I fear she will simply hike the monthly rent cost to get their money. If I refuse to pay she might evict us. We’re supposed to have all of that behind us.\n\nI have no doubt that his egregious and self serving behavior has violated some terms of our operating agreement. I have worked so hard to build this business and don’t want to see it fail. At this stage, an eviction wouldn’t serve us well.\n\nWhat are your thoughts on this? Any helpful advice that anyone can offer? I’m currently in the process of finding an attorney to review our operating agreement. Figured that would be the best place to start.",

      "text": "We import around 80% of our finished apparel from India and China. I already have wholesale orders and corresponding finished POs locked in through December. Unfortunately, our factories are unwilling to renegotiate pricing, and I can’t raise prices on our retail buyers due to contractual and market constraints.\n\nThe newly announced tariffs will cost us at least **$450K** to our bottom line through the end of the year — that’s about a **28% hit to EBITDA**. We’re a seasonal business and have been in a growth phase, so **cash flow has been tight**. We’re maxed out on short-term lending and don’t have room for more financing right now.\n\nLonger term, we’ve already started developing with factories in other countries (including the U.S.), so next year we should be in a much better position. But surviving until then is the issue.\n\n# Here’s my question:\n\n**Would it be viable (or legal) to help our overseas factories set up U.S. LLCs and have them import finished goods into the U.S. at cost instead of sale price to reduce the import duties/tariffs?** The idea being: they’d pass those savings onto us, and we could reduce our landed costs through year-end.\n\n* Would CBP flag or disallow this kind of structure as an abuse of transfer pricing or related-party rules?\n* Even if it’s allowed, would these newly formed U.S. entities then be subject to corporate income tax on any U.S.-source profits, potentially offsetting the duty savings?\n* Is there a legal or accounting structure that could make this work short-term?\n\nI realize this may be a naïve question — I’m spitballing here. Just trying to keep a business alive that a lot of good people have worked hard to build. I’d welcome any input, strategies, or pointers to professionals (e.g., customs brokers or international trade attorneys) that could help us figure this out fast.\n\nThanks in advance.",

However, in all the companies I've worked for and all the processes I've observed that use these AVM tools, they do use them, but it's never a 100% automated appraisal. We always end up checking the samples to ensure the comparisons make sense for the property we're trying to appraise.\n\nDespite technological advancements like machine learning, LLMs, OCR, among others, I still feel that these appraisals can't be fully trusted. For some property types, like apartments in large metropolitan areas, they might offer a bit more comfort. But for other types, such as warehouses or even houses in certain locations (including large metropolitan areas), I feel that these automatic appraisals, without any human intervention, simply can't be relied upon. And here, I'm talking about the entire process, from document verification to the final appraisal.\n\nI would really like to know how these technologies and appraisals are being used in the companies and countries where you work, and if there are any cases where appraisals are done 100% reliably without any human touch at all.\n\nThank you all in advance!",

And each business partner will get a 7-14% profit like 3-4 crores in next 4-5 years. He said microsoft is also one of the partner and it looks their software. He said many big people are involved in it (like people from IITs), he said he is working with model executive, sales director MR digvijay Singh, MR Bansal (flipkart CEO cousin), motorola executive CEO Rohit lakit etc.. all of them are director's. And he works with IIT people on field. And currently they are making turnover for companies like kit, sharp (japan company), swizz watchs (Switzerland one), Arabic companies etc.. They sees sales of a company, customer acquisition, market growth, market research, finance, global growth. Some those people working with him in it earns ₹1.5 lakhs per day (and he said something they'll have turnovers weekly based). And his meetings are held in Novotel at different places. And btw, he's currently in Hyderabad, Telangana, India. I asked my friend to let me know if there is any opportunity for me too, he said he'd surely.\nI asked him what's the organisation his is in, but he kept saying its on his name and its his own. \n\nCould, anyone who knows/heard about this, detail me please !! Like what's this organisation might be, and what is this work called, or if you know, how to apply to these and are there any similar ones, etc..\nThanks a lot in advance!",

I've already got the website registered, and am ready to start rolling features out to try to make an income. Note that this would be the first time either of us would be starting a business.\n\nI have bad credit so a business loan for me is pretty much out of the question, but she (the partner) has great credit, can get an SBA loan, and is willing to register the business in her name (under the brand I came up with) in my state to get financing, then hire me as an employee (and as a secondary business bank account user)... but isn't sure when she can move here. I could move to her state months from now but it seems like a bigger gamble and she may have less startup opportunities there with it.\n\nWhile I'm working on the website and all the resulting tech stuff, I just want to get things hooked in and trying things out to see what makes income. The current plan is sort of stalling things. She isn't tech savvy, and the brand idea and vision is mostly mine.\n\nI just want to register the business with the brand under my name, in my state, get the bank account (I already have a dedicated phone number and virtual street address), and just get things rolling. I've told her that she could register her own company in her state as something like \"Flower Ventures LLC\" and then invest in me or do a partnership or affiliation or something (she's good at networking and has gotten some clients so far but they're waiting for me to finish building out infrastructure). She's said she doesn't really want to do her own separate, and may drop the whole thing if I insist on it.\n\nSo... I'm back in limbo 😅 Thoughts?!",

At the same time, I’m planning to build a small business flipping cars. \n\nRight now, I’m focused on three immediate moves:\n\t•\tMoving into my own home or apartment\n\t•\tBuying a personal SUV (separate from business)\n\t•\tPreparing the groundwork for my car flipping operation\n\nThis won’t be a side hustle I rush into, I’m building it methodically to scale.\n\nThe Plan:\n\t•\tLaunch business officially in 2026 as an LLC with clean separation between personal and business assets.\n\t•\tFlip one car at a time, up to five cars total (private sales only), to build capital.\n\t•\tUse a custom website + in-person networking to move inventory faster without relying on third-party platforms only \n\t•\tReinvest profits to fund a dealer license, then scale.\n\t•\tEventually use capital to buy or invest in real estate later down the road not just for wealth, but for long-term asset security.\n\t•\tAll profits will be split between savings, business reinvestment, investing (stocks, Roth IRA), and personal use.\n\nWhat I’m Looking For:\n\t1.\tWhat are the biggest pitfalls when transitioning from hobbyist to legit dealer?\n\t2.\tAnyone here grow from one-car flips into a full dealership? What was your funding strategy?\n\t3.\tIs it smarter to buy cars in cash under $7K or work up through small financing to build business credit?\n\t4.\tAnyone here successfully use a self-built website to generate leads/sales without paying marketplace or auction fees?\n\t5.\tFor those who used flipping to move into real estate — what helped you cross that bridge faster (business credit, personal credit, investor partnerships, etc.)?\n       6.\tFor future growth, how could I eventually offer in-house financing or third-party financing partnerships? Is that something smaller operations can realistically manage, or does it require significant capital or licensing?\n\n\nI’m not looking to get rich fast. I’m playing the long game and trying to set this up the right way from the jump not cut corners, not co-mingle funds, not burn out. Just want solid advice from people who’ve done this before or could give me some good advice\n\nThanks in advance.",

It can be stocks, critpo (i know its with \"y\" and not \"i\" but that word is banned here), futures, forex maybe, and insert some context, like stock name, timeframe, risk level. It sends chart image, context and pulls data from live market (yahoo finance api or some python librabries) and sends it to chatgpt along with custom prompt, and chatgpt generates a strategy and analyzes trend.\n\n  \nI know there are 2 ios apps for that, but i thought of this like 2 years ago, when AI came out, and there isnt web version yet.\n\n  \nLet me know what u think. making the MVP wont take longer than a month. there are gonna be only 2 api connections and basic functionallity",

We have a plan to get off the road in 4-5 years but we aren’t how we’ll afford to live once we get there. Non-travel welding jobs don’t even pay a third of what he’s making now.\n\nHis idea is to start a business (mobile welding, fabrication, CWI, something along those lines) and I’m taking business classes so that I can learn how to manage the “business” side of things while he focuses on the craft. But I wonder if maybe I should narrow down my major to help me bring in money while the business is in its early stages and as a backup in case it fails. \n\nI’m stuck on working from home because we want more kids but don’t trust the daycare system. I hope to make enough to hire an in-home babysitter/ nanny so I’m still there with my children while being able to focus on my work. \n\nSo my question: What business-related career paths have the most WFH positions?

      "text": "I am a 22 years young data science student in a private university in Germany. I paid off my tuition fees with my jobs and side-hustle and didn't study much (around 26k€). I am dumb to be in this trap and lost my motivation in studying IT and coding. After all, private universities in Germany are kind of scam as their professors have no skills of teaching. 1 or 2 lectures per week and many other things to not recommend to anyone studying in these.\n\nI was extremely passionate about IT, and now everything vanishes, but I am good at business, project management, and know some coding logics. I launched 3 dropshipping stores in 2018, did forex trading, sold goods online, and joined an insurance company as a business partner in finance (private pension)(earning well from here) and learned B2-C1 german without courses in 1.5 year. \n\nI always think about business and validate many ideas as well. I created business plans and product designs with Gemini or other AIs in the market and did market research using deep research in Gemini. I have recently completed an entire product and e-portfolio and given the CEO role to myself. As a CEO, I have no idea how can I make this product real, I thought about hiring a freelancer, but still, this product involves custom Ai models from real restaurant data and much more. \n\nI am seeking advice on \"how can a young guy proceed with the idea with no coding experience and manage to build a start-up?\" I am earning better than most students out there, but I don't want to do jobs, I want to build business with genuine product and solution. Some people might say that I am dumb and I accept it. I seek advice to make this product real.",

      "text": "Hi **Reddit**, LONG POST COMING... / ANY ADVICE OR FEEDBACK IS HIGHLY APPRICATED!\n\nI am 24 years old and lost. I have always knew that sooner or later I will be successful. It's not just a dream of mine, it's more like hearing a spoiler about your favorite TV-show and now you are just waiting for it to happen.\n\nI want to be clear - in **no means** I'm just waiting for fortune to fall in my lap. I am ready to outwork, outthink and outplay everyone. I don't just want to get rich. I am meant to be successful and meant to help as many to success as possible.\n\n**CURRENT SITUATION: (I try to keep it short and simple)**\n\n\\- I have 2 kids and a beautiful wife. - Cant just take a big risk and quit my 9-5 fully  \n\\- I have decent job as Team Lead in fintech field. - Could invest maybe 1500-2000$ per month and have like 5-6 million in investments when I'm 63. What I'm gonna spend that money on? Buying gold chains for grandchildren and throwing around 100's in gentleman clubs? Jokes aside I just cant be slave for other people/companies anymore.  \n\\- I am in a situation where I could trade my full job for a part time job and still be able to pay the bills and buy the food for the family. I would work 2 long days per week and have 5 days off.\n\n**Day Off = Grinding the heck out of my own projects.**\n\n**WHAT I HAVE DONE THIS FAR IN PAST 3 YEARS:**\n\n\\- I have already tried dropshipping and faceless content on Tiktok. I've opened up at least 7 different dropshipping stores and marketed 3 of those. For other 4 I gave up before even posting any ads. No success.\n\n\\- I also started online course for improving personal finance - but stopped it as ads did not bring any customers.\n\n\\- I have spent hours to be in good spot mentally. I have studied laws of universe, focused on manifesting, cut out all of the unmotivated persons and bad habits.\n\n\\- Started to understand how the world and money actually works. See how we are being led into system that pulls you deeper that you can ever understand.\n\n\\- Spent hundreds of hours on learning about investing.\n\n**MY PROBLEM IS THAT I DO NOT KNOW WHAT TO DO NEXT?**\n\nI worked 12 hours per day / 6 days a week for a 13 months to get from customer service to current position at my  9-5. I've also fought in MMA so I would say that hard work and discipline are not the issue for me.\n\nI am 100% ready to work 14-16 hours a day but I have **no clue what I want or should be doing** to earn first 100, 1000, 100 000 and 1 000 000$?\n\n**ABOUT ME:**\n\n\\- My only passion this far in life has been MMA. I love to smack the s\\*\\*t out of other people, in good spirits of course.\n\n\\- I love to entertain and I have always got emotions out of people. They either hate me or love me, but they see me wherever I go. I am not selfish or delusional, but I have that aura that people notice.\n\n\\- I love the chaos. Diamonds are born under the pressure - 100% true. My life has been stressful for a long time and I love that hectic place to place, always moving - lifestyle.\n\n\\- As 24 years old I completely understand that I am **really young**, but I have much experience. Tragic losses, children, many accomplishments, many failures.\n\n\\-  Im not book smart in any means! **But I am really good at following things:**\n\n\\*People. Reading and learning other people. Making impression. Motivating. Being a leader.\n\n\\*Finding out of box resolutions for problems.\n\n\\*Going my own path and doing things differently.\n\n\\*Selling, anything to anyone. I'll get your trust OR your respect and solve the the problem that we now both believe in.\n\n\\*Combat sports.\n\n\\*Understanding how the world actually works.\n\n\\*Sacrificing almost anything to reach my goals.\n\n**WHAT DO I ACTUALLY WANT FROM LIFE?**\n\n\\- Feel that im on the right path and not wasting my life.\n\n\\- Change the understanding of life and norms in my family.\n\n\\- Help to get other people who wants success as much as I - to their destination.\n\n\\- Continuously work and bring value to something that I have built, but enjoy the process in meanwhile.\n\n\\- Last but not least Lamborghinis and Rolexes are cheesy, but I want both. Lambo in black and white, Rolex in gold. Penthouse in Miami and house in Nordics - Finland or Sweden, not sure yet.\n\n\\- Be able to choose what to I put my time on.\n\n**MY QUESTIONS FOR YOU ARE:**\n\n\\- How did you got the idea that you managed to turn into working business?  \n\\- Did you followed your passion and if so, then how you found it?\n\nANY advice regarding this topic is highly appreciated! If you even red this - THANK YOU!  \nI wish you all the best and if there is anyone just wanting to chat about this - reach out to me!",

      "text": "In a 1970s TV series about a British family transport business [there is an episode when the company discusses a merger with its Dutch partner company](https://m.imdb.com/title/tt0878930/?ref_=ttep_ep_12).\n\nThe head of the Dutch company has skimmed enough off the turnover of his company to build a big warehouse in a suitable location for use by his company. The warehouse is in the head's own name, i.e. it is a personal asset. So if he sells it to the company he runs, he will be forced to pay capital gains tax (CGT) by the Dutch revenue authorities. There are tax advantages for overseas investors in Holland and these apparently include low/no liability to CGT on approved investments in Dutch assets. The Dutch company head wants the British company to buy his warehouse and later sell it free of CGT to his company. The British company head suggests reducing the Dutch company's tax liability by their selling their old trucks to the British company at a small markdown and buying new trucks from the British company at a small profit. This last part I do not understand. In selling 50 old trucks and buying 50 new ones, surely the Dutch company is simply making a capital outlay and reducing their working capital. In any case the Dutch company head will still have to pay CGT on his selling the warehouse regardless of whom he sells it to . . .\n\nThis is the high end of finance and not something I'm familiar with, so I'm probably missing something here. Can anyone enlighten me on this asset swapping trick and its application in tax reduction ?",

      "text": "For starters, I was wondering if there's resources that've helped you in this situation.\n\nLet's just say according to online research there's an Aluminum Boat Welding business with \\~15 employees & $1.2M Revenue that has 40+ year in the business around the area I would be content with settling down in.\n\nLooking at this business i see they make tons of custom work, an outdated website, & poor marketing. I think there could be huge room for improvement purchasing it. Especially since the size could be within striking distance of something I could finance. They have proven designs that work, and a good reputation for the custom boats they do make. If I worked toward improving marketing/sales, standardization of a few boat profiles, and made an more efficient line to assemble this could be something.\n\nI'm a 26 year old manufacturing engineer with a broad range experience that has 4 years experience, and it's a dream of mine to own and operate a factory. I believe this sizing I could potentially get financing given I have $100k Liquid currently and some in a Roth IRA I could pull from. This is an extremely ambitious goal, but I'll be kicking myself in the nuts later if I don't go for it. I'm young enough where I don't have kids, and can afford to take a high shot risk and bounce back from if it alls goes south too.\n\nI understand there's ducks I need to get in a row, for I don't have a relationship with a bank yet for this, there's a lot of learning on the industry/market I would need to do prior to the purchase, etc. i'm trying to take a calculated approach at this, all without looking a bonehead.\n\nWould I write a letter of interest stating that I'm interested in purchasing the company at fair market value given I can get a 3rd party Accounting Audit completed, I can secure the financing, & a year long transition period with the current ownership so I could smoothly accept the handoff? Stating that this is a begging step to see if the shareholders even would have any interest in selling before I pursue forward? This may all be a pipe dream because they may not have interest but I also think if there's a .5% chance of this working out it's worth a shot. I'd even be interested in working at this place if they somehow put in writing that I could get the place in like 4 years.\n\nWhat's the communities thoughts?",

      "text": "Hey guys - \n\nI wanted to get some outside opinions and figured this might be a good place to ask. I'm a 3D Artist and with the CG industry being what it is at the moment, I’ve been strongly considering making some sort of pivot or adding on an additional masters degree. The one I’m most seriously thinking about right now is a MM business masters in Organization Management.\n\nThings to consider:\n\n* Tuition cost is not a huge factor in this decision. I’m lucky enough that my home country offers university studies at a very affordable prices but it's important choice I want to consider carefully\n* The course would take 1.5 years, can be be done remotely and paused if necessary\n* I have an existing bachelor's degree in 3D Animation, Media & Communication\n* One of the reasons I'm drawn to this course is because I'm hoping to pivot from the artist's department into more of a production or management role\n* Currently I’m more or less region locked to my current location, given that there’s only so many industry hubs when it comes to 3D. My hope is that maybe, if I manage to segue into a broader field, it would offer me way more options when it comes to living in different parts of the world \n* I have previous experience with organization, team management, leadership and mentoring\n\nConcerns:\n\n* My main goal is to find something that would hypothetically synergize well with my previous career experience working in animation production. It would be nice not to have to restart my career completely, even if it’s just so I present myself as an established professional\n* My main concern is future financial stability and job security. I’m okay with moving away from CGI into any other industry that would provide this\n* I would also like to prioritize something that would hopefully be AI future proof. I know that some of these things are likely to become automated with time, but I can also imagine that sensitive company data and important corporate decisions will still require human oversight\n\nThe course in question would include a focus on, amongst other things:\n\n* Leadership\n* Corporate governance\n* Project management\n* Business communication and negotiation\n* Positive work environments\n* Applied finances for managers\n* Human resources \n\nI would deeply appreciate any and all advice and opinions, especially from those of you who may have a background in similar fields. Is there anything I’m not considering? Anything you would suggest instead? What would be the best path forward?\n\nThanks a lot for your help!",

I’ve already put in a lot of work — finalized the right teams, built a working system, and there’s solid early traction. I’ve also prepared a detailed pitch deck and can go as deep as anyone wants. This is something I’ve poured all my energy into, and I’m fully committed to taking it further.\n\nRight now, I’m raising $15K–$30K — this is the core capital needed to start scaling steadily. That said, if I’m backed with a six-figure amount, I could scale much faster by putting more teams and systems in place right from the beginning rather than building them out later.\n\nI’m also very flexible on terms and open to having a real conversation with anyone who’s genuinely interested or who might be able to point me in the right direction. I’ve tried communities like Discord and Facebook to find Investors, but a lot of people there are also founders looking for capital, so it hasn’t been very fruitful.\n\nIf you know of any communities, individuals, or investors who might be open to looking at something serious, I’d be truly grateful if you could connect me or point me toward the right places to pitch. Any help means a lot at this stage.\n\nThank you 🙏",

If Powell is pushed out “this credibility will be harmed even more, with developments in the bond market.”\n\nThe result would be higher costs to service the debt and “a profound disorganization of the country’s economy,” Lombard said, adding that the consequences would bring the US sooner or later to talks to end the tensions.\n\nLombard’s comments come after Trump, frustrated with Powell’s caution to cut US interest rates, posted on social media Thursday that Powell’s “termination couldn’t come quickly enough.” It wasn’t clear whether he meant he wanted to fire Powell or was eager for the end of his term, which is May 2026. National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett said Friday Trump was studying whether he could fire him.\n\nPresident Emmanuel Macron has opposed Trump on a series of issues including Ukraine, trade and even offered refuge in France for US-based scientists whose federal research funding has been cut.\n\nEven so, Lombard’s comments are unusually direct about US domestic matters.\n\nOn tariffs, France’s finance minister said the 10% tariffs Trump has imposed on imports from the EU don’t constitute “common ground” and that Europe’s goal is for a free trade zone with the US.\n\nThe 10% level is “a huge increase that isn’t sustainable for the US economy and represents major risks for global trade,” Lombard said.\n\nThe finance minister also called on European CEOs to show “patriotism” and work with their governments so the region doesn’t lose out.\n\nOn Thursday, French billionaire Bernard Arnault, whose group LVMH owns Champagne labels like Moët & Chandon and Veuve Clicquot as well as Hennessy Cognac, seemed to suggest that EU leaders weren’t pushing hard enough for an accord on tariffs.",

      "title": "Bloomberg: Trump China tariffs to unleash supply chain jolt on economy",
      "text": "We are standing on the beach paralyzed as a giant unstoppable economic wave is on its way to pummeling us. Trump is following through on his promises that he made over and over again on the campaign trail. And a majority of Americans voted for him. Now come the repercussions: \n\nBloomberg: President Donald Trump’s tariff onslaught has roiled Washington and Wall Street for nearly a month. If the trade war persists, the next upheaval will hit much closer to home.\n\nSince the US raised levies on China to 145% in early April, cargo shipments have plummeted, perhaps by as much as 60%, according to one estimate. That drastic reduction in goods from one of the largest US trading partners hasn’t been felt by many Americans yet, but that’s about to change. \n\nBy the middle of May, thousands of companies — big and small — will be needing to replenish inventories. Giant retailers such as Walmart Inc. and Target Corp. told Trump in a meeting last week that shoppers are likely to see empty shelves and higher prices. Torsten Slok, Apollo Management’s chief economist, recently warned of looming “Covid-like” shortages and significant layoffs in industries spanning trucking, logistics and retail.\n\nWhile Trump has shown signs in recent days that he’s willing to be flexible on the import taxes imposed on China and others, it may be too late to stop a supply shock from reverberating across the US economy that could stretch all the way to Christmas.\n\n“The clock is absolutely ticking,” said Jim Gerson, president of The Gersons Companies, an 84-year-old supplier of holiday decorations and candles to major US retailers. The company, based in Olathe, Kansas, sources more than half its products from China and currently has about 250 containers waiting to be shipped. \n\nEven when hostilities ease, restarting transpacific trade will bring additional risks. The freight industry has reduced capacity to match weaker demand. That means a surge of orders sparked by a detente between the superpowers will likely overwhelm the network, causing delays and boosting costs. A similar scenario unfolded during the pandemic when container prices quadrupled and a glut of cargo ships jammed up ports.\n\nTrump China Tariffs Set to Unleash Supply Jolt on US Economy https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-04-28/trump-s-china-tariffs-set-to-unleash-supply-shock-on-us-economy",

      "text": "[https://finance.yahoo.com/news/trump-considers-pausing-auto-tariffs-175103303.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/trump-considers-pausing-auto-tariffs-175103303.html)\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump on Monday suggested that he might temporarily exempt the auto industry from [tariffs he previously imposed](https://apnews.com/article/autos-tariffs-trump-tax-imports-ford-gm-e53823ef7bbb7b3c46d11eca90aaa638) on the sector, to give carmakers time to adjust their supply chains.\n\n“I’m looking at something to help some of the car companies with it,” Trump told reporters gathered in the Oval Office. The Republican president said automakers needed time to relocate production from Canada, Mexico and other places, \"And they need a little bit of time because they’re going to make them here, but they need a little bit of time. So I’m talking about things like that.”\n\nThe statement hinted at yet another round of [reversals on tariffs](https://apnews.com/article/trump-reciprocal-tariffs-higher-rates-china-9645cf4608a8c153e90bdd10263ccb01) as Trump's onslaught of import taxes has [panicked financial markets](https://apnews.com/article/trump-tariffs-pause-businesses-reaction-a61a1adcaf6332f6188ae1d70664b898) and raised deep concerns from Wall Street economists about [a possible recession](https://apnews.com/article/recession-tariffs-economy-inflation-5a24ff198dcd6813b53f44c662354b6a).\n\nWhen Trump announced the 25% auto tariffs on March 27, he described them as “permanent.” His hard lines on trade have become increasingly blurred as he has sought to limit the possible economic and political blowback from his policies.\n\nLast week, after [a bond market sell-off](https://apnews.com/article/treasurys-bond-market-yield-tariff-46b4818710f01b8cc93fd002081167b0) pushed up interest rates on U.S. debt, Trump announced that [for 90 days](https://apnews.com/article/trump-tariffs-stock-market-china-recession-deals-e8e54a68397e6829e1d27552a1d7bfb9) his broader tariffs against dozens of countries would instead be set at a baseline 10% to give time for negotiations.\n\nAt the same time, Trump increased [the import taxes on China](https://apnews.com/article/china-us-trump-tariffs-2e05057e973e1e26d1b95c5be003b4cd) to 145%, only to temporarily exempt electronics from some of those tariffs by having those goods charged at a 20% rate.\n\n“I don’t change my mind, but I’m flexible,” Trump said Monday.\n\nTrump's flexibility has also fueled a sense of uncertainty and confusion about his intentions and end goals. The S&P 500 stock index was up slightly in Monday afternoon trading, but it's still down nearly 9% this year. Interest rates on 10-year U.S. Treasury notes were also elevated at roughly 4.4%.\n\nCarl Tannenbaum, chief economist for the Northern Trust global financial firm, said the whiplash had been so great that he might have to “get fitted for a neck brace.”\n\nTannenbaum warned in an analysis: “Damage to consumer, business, and market confidence may already be irreversible.”\n\nThe U.S. president also said that he spoke with Apple CEO Tim Cook and “helped” him recently. Many Apple products, including its popular iPhone, are assembled in China.\n\nThe Trump administration has suggested that its tariffs had isolated China as the U.S. engaged in talks with other countries.\n\nBut China is also seeking to [build tighter relationships in Asia](https://apnews.com/article/xi-visit-vietnam-china-us-trade-d7046613bff2c9ef31162ae8dd436263) with nations stung by Trump's tariffs. China’s leader, Xi Jinping, on Monday met in Hanoi with Vietnam's Communist Party General Secretary To Lam with the message that no one wins in trade wars.\n\nAsked about the meeting, Trump suggested the two nations were conspiring to do economic harm to the U.S. by “trying to figure out how do we screw the United States of America.”",

Noted tariffs have only a temporary impact on inflation. These dissents are the first time two governors have done so since 1993.\n\nBowman (who also serves as the Fed’s vice chair for bank supervision) stated, “I see the risk that a delay in taking action could result in a deterioration in the labor market and a further slowing in economic growth.”\n\nTheir statements, as well as Powell's statement, came before the huge correction in the job data. The Labor Department report on Friday showed that nonfarm payrolls rose by just 73,000 in July, below expectations, while the June and May counts were revised lower by a combined 258,000, which showed virtually no growth for both months.\n\nSome suggested that the Fed might have cut rates if the July jobs report had come before this past Wednesday's meeting.

      "text": "From Bloomberg:\n\nDonald Trump’s combative trade policies have tipped the world economy into a downturn, with the US among the hardest hit, the OECD said.\n\nThe Paris-based organization slashed its global forecasts for the second time this year, citing the impact of the American president’s tariff onslaught. The combination of trade barriers and uncertainty are hitting confidence and holding back investment, it said, while also warning that protectionism is adding to inflationary pressures.\n\nThe OECD now forecasts global economic growth to slow to 2.9% this year from 3.3% in 2024. It expects the rate of expansion in the US will tumble further, to 1.6% from 2.8% — an outlook that is significantly lower than its projection in March.\n\n“Weakened economic prospects will be felt around the world, with almost no exception,” Chief Economist Alvaro Pereira said. “Lower growth and less trade will hit incomes and slow job growth.”\n\nThe assessment indicates how Trump’s policies have become the most pressing problem for the global economy, with no easy solution in sight. The situation could yet be exacerbated by retaliation from US trading partners, a further erosion of confidence, or another bout of repricing on financial markets, the OECD said.\n\nThe club of 38 rich countries published its forecasts just as its members’ ministers convene in Paris for an annual meeting. Top commerce officials are expected there include US trade representative Jamieson Greer and EU trade commissioner Maros Sefcovic. Lin Feng, a representative from China’s Ministry of Commerce, is also scheduled to attend.\n\n“Agreements to ease trade tensions and lower tariffs and other trade barriers will be instrumental to revive growth and investment and avoid rising prices,” the OECD said. “This is by far the most important policy priority.”\n\nhttps://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-06-03/trump-s-tariffs-plunge-us-and-global-economy-into-slowdown",

      "text": "**U.S. economy added 12,000 jobs in October, far less than expected; unemployment rate at 4.1%**\n\n[https://www.cnbc.com/2024/11/01/us-jobs-report-october-2024.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/11/01/us-jobs-report-october-2024.html)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n*Job creation in October slowed to its weakest pace since late 2020 as the impacts of storms in the Southeast and a significant labor impasse dented the employment picture.*\n\n*Nonfarm payrolls increased by 12,000 for the month, down sharply from September and below the Dow Jones estimate for 100,000, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported Friday. In what had already been expected to be a downbeat report, October posted the smallest gain since December 2020.*\n\n*The unemployment rate, however, held at 4.1%, in line with expectations. A broader measure of unemployment that includes discouraged workers and those holding part-time jobs for economic reasons also was unchanged at 7.7%.*\n\n*In the report narrative, the BLS noted that the Boeing strike likely subtracted 44,000 jobs in the manufacturing sector, which lost 46,000 positions overall.*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n*Along with that, the report noted the impact of hurricanes Helene and Milton but said “it is not possible to quantify the net effect” of the storms on the jobs total.*\n\n*Elsewhere, the bureau said average hourly earnings increased 0.4% for the month, slightly higher than the estimate, though the 4% 12-month gain was in line. The average work week held steady at 34.3 hours.*\n\n*Markets, though, largely ignored the bad news, with stock market futures poised for a strong open on Wall Street while Treasury yields plunged. The meager jobs numbers along with wages about in line with expectations help cement another interest rate cut from the Federal Reserve next week.*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n*The release comes just days ahead of the presidential election in which Democrat Kamala Harris and Republican Donald Trump are in what most polls show to be a deadlocked race. With the economy at the forefront of the battle, the light jobs number “casts a murky shadow heading into next week,” said Lisa Sturtevant, chief economist at Bright MLS.*\n\n*The weak October report also included substantial downward revisions from previous months. August was cut to just a gain of 78,000 while September’s initial estimate came down to 223,000. Together, the net revisions lowered previously reported job creation totals by 112,000.*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n*Health care and government again led job creation, respectively adding 52,000 and 40,000 positions. Several sectors, though, saw job losses.*\n\n*In addition to the expected pullback in manufacturing, temporary help services saw a drop of 49,000. The category is sometimes seen as a proxy for underlying job strength and has seen a decline of 577,000 since March 2022, the BLS said.*\n\n*Another leading sector, leisure and hospitality, saw a drop of 4,000, while retail trade and transportation and warehousing also reported modest declines.*\n\n*The report covers a month in which hurricanes Helene and Milton slammed the Southeast – Florida and North Carolina in particular – while the Boeing strike also hit what had been a vibrant though slowing labor market. Recent developments indicate that the Boeing impasse, which sidelined some 44,000 workers, could be near an end.*\n\n*Prior to the release, job creation had averaged close to 200,000 a month during 2024, about 60,000 below the pace for the same period a year ago through still indicative of solid pace of hiring.*\n\n*Some cracks in recent months have raised concerns at the Federal Reserve that while the year-over-year pace of inflation is slowing, elevated interest rate could impact the labor market and threaten the ongoing economic expansion.*\n\n*As a result, policymakers in September took a step unprecedented for a growing economy and lowered their benchmark short-term interest rate by half a percentage point, double the customary quarter-point increments in which the Fed usually likes to move.*\n\n*Financial markets are pricing in a strong likelihood that the central bank cuts by a quarter point at each of its two remaining meetings this year. The rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee will announce its decision next Thursday.*",

For their homes. For their wallets. For their futures.\n\n“Of the five components of the Index, only consumers’ assessment of present business conditions improved, albeit slightly. Views of current labor market conditions weakened. Consumers became pessimistic about future business conditions and less optimistic about future income. Pessimism about future employment prospects worsened and reached a ten-month high,” Stephanie Guichard, senior member of the Conference that issued the statement.\n\nThe labor market conditions wouldn’t be too bad if people were willing to get off their butts and replace all the undocumented workers who have been piled off back to their homes in the back of an armored truck and work in construction or farming, but people aren’t willing to do that.\n\nOf course Johnny American is worried about future income. All companies seem to be doing is firing, firing, firing, firing and more firing, because they want to be please their beloved shareholders.\n\nAnd the 401Ks — a way of almost guaranteeing their future happiness — are getting eroded while their credit card debts [are flying upwards](https://www.newyorkfed.org/microeconomics/hhdc).\n\nSimply telling people to throw in some beans and hope they’ll come out magic soon is quite simply a bad idea.\n\nFood prices are expected to rise again in 2025, and the price of eggs — something that’s given a lot of headlines and used by the Democrats as a way of thumping Donnie but isn’t actually his or ANYONE’S fault — continues its exponential rise ($8-a-dozen, and you can’t kill off all the chickens in America).\n\nOne of the biggest employers in America — the construction industry (8 million workers — is on its knees at the moment. Among what is happening is that housing companies are blaming labour costs. That’s because of the difference between how many jobs have been lost thanks to Homeland Security, and how many visas have been produced. Combined with the fact that people are scared for their future, it’s a perfect storm.\n\nThe other reason is why people are scared — and you’ve guessed it — is AI. A [very recent poll](https://www.pewresearch.org/social-trends/2025/02/25/u-s-workers-are-more-worried-than-hopeful-about-future-ai-use-in-the-workplace/) by Pew Research said that 52% of US workers are scared crapless about computers taking their jobs. The techbros who try and tell you that there will be loads of jobs around the AI space are actually lying, it seems. 6% of the current workforce thinks that AI will create more job opportunities for them in the long-run, and 32% said that it will make for less. And the middle bit are lying to themselves.\n\nAnd worse — the guys at the top have done absolutely nothing to reassure them. I’m sorry, but blasting out a few tweets isn’t going to help the American people in their immediate problems.\n\nThe current administration needs to work out how to get people happier about their current situations now, before it gets worse.\n\nAnd it won’t be by making deals abroad.",

      "text": "Sales shrank almost 4%, at 3.6%.\n\nIt's concerning when fast food and retail businesses start seeing contracting sales from the US consumer. Especially staples that are concerned with affordability like Walmart and McDonalds. If Consumers are pulling back spending on \"cheap\", low cart value items like a McDonalds meal then it signals to me a budget constrained, worried consumer who won't spend on higher price discretionary categories like electronics, home reno, travel, etc.\n\nThe flip side of this - other fast food companies like Domino's have been doing fine. So maybe this is also a combination of McDonald's price hikes, lack of promotions, declining affordability, and increased competition. It could be both the macro and the company specific issues that created this result.\n\nhttps://www.reuters.com/business/mcdonalds-global-sales-post-surprise-drop-tariff-chaos-hits-consumer-confidence-2025-05-01/\n\nhttps://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/mcdonalds-sales-drop-economy-recession-covid-pandemic-b2743029.html",

      "title": "US tourism officials sound alarm, tourist flights to US sink 70% and could impact up to 140k hospitality jobs and $14B in economic spending",
      "text": "Here is my way of trying to find alpha in an erratic stock market - how I'm trading the US tourism dip.\n\n**1. Canada is the US's largest source of tourism**: In 2024, 20 million Canadian tourists visited the US, spent $20.5 billion, and supported 140,000 US jobs. Canada's population is 40 million, so 50% of the entire country visited, and the US had 77 million tourists so 1 country is contributing 26% of visits.\n\n**2. Recent US policies is leading to a tourism boycott from Canadians, and the rest of the world**: Tourists are boycotting US tourism due to tariffs, annexation threats, new travel barriers, and stories of visitors being unlawfully detained with no due process (in March a Canadian citizen was denied entry due to an expired visa, while this was a worker and not a tourist, instead of being allowed to return to Canada, as is the norm, she was shackled in chains and sent to a private ICE facility for 2 weeks without being able to contact a lawyer or get a bed).\n\n**3. Analysts previously predicted policies would decrease tourism by 5%, new numbers released this week show that it's 14x higher:** For Canada alone (26% of US's entire tourism industry with 20 million visitors) - airline travel is **down** **70%**, land travel is **down** **45%**, and **85%+** of tourists survey say they cancelled their US trips.\n\n**4. Here's how I'm planning on using this information to make stock trades into specific companies both long and short:** I'm shorting airlines that have high exposure to Can-US routes (it's been reported that airlines are slashing these routes due to 0 demand, and they is no clear way they can cover this revenue gap with a lower utilized fleet). I'm shorting select hospitality chains (hotels, restaurants) with high exposure/retail foot print in US states that border Canada like Niagara Falls. The US travel association says that even just a 10% dip in tourists will lead to $2 billion in economic losses and 140,000 jobs at risk (assuming 70% decrease from air travel happens across the board, that's $14b), I expect hospitality to have lower revenues. I'm shorting all non-essential or higher price retailers with a big footprint in hostility states, all these workers being laid off by lack of tourism + the gov worker job cuts won't have as much to spend (not my specific trade, but an example would be short Target, long Dollar General).\n\nI'm long, and buying, non-American/Europe hotel chains and travel booking platforms that get most of their revenue outside the US, as I expect Canadian and international tourists to concentrate their spend to Europe/Asia/Oceania travel this summer.\n\n**Edit 5. How do the European/International figures play?**\n\nIt's important to note that the Canadian tourism numbers dipped after the policies that happened in point 2. And we're seeing what those numbers are a few months later now. The US admin is rolling out these policies across the board tomorrow during \"Liberation Day\". The point here is that we won't see the true vector of an internal tourism boycott both in terms of magnitude and direction until the policies that were enacted on Canada are enacted globally, and consumers have time to adjust behaviour. But if the Canadian consumer is any indication, I have more conviction in my trades. **A glimpse into this being a trend is a French travel company reporting to Bloomberg their Europe to US travel bookings are down 25%.**\n\n**Edit 6. Example of the airline play**\n\nYes I know US airlines are already down a lot. Rode that wave and exited my shorts. Now I'm shorting Air Canada and ONEX (parent company of WestJet), since they have much more exposure to US-Can routes, and are cutting routes dramatically with no increase in capacity elsewhere\n\nAlso looking to short airline maitence companies, the food suppliers specific to flight food, and fuel refineries/storage those two airlines use, and retail stores with large exposure to airports that only see US/Canada travel.\n\nBut going long on regional air craft hangers since their smaller fleets are used the most for US/Canada travel, while their bigger fleets will still be active for the europe/asia flight routes that havn't seen impact on demand.\n\nWould like to hear what everyone thinks about this trade play. Thanks!\n\n**Source for numbers used**\n\n* [https://theconversation.com/tourists-are-cancelling-trips-to-the-us-heres-how-this-could-affect-its-economy-252858](https://theconversation.com/tourists-are-cancelling-trips-to-the-us-heres-how-this-could-affect-its-economy-252858)\n* [https://www.ustravel.org/press/potential-results-decline-canadian-travel-united-states](https://www.ustravel.org/press/potential-results-decline-canadian-travel-united-states)\n* [https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/28/world/canada/air-canada-flights-seats-us.html](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/28/world/canada/air-canada-flights-seats-us.html)\n* [https://financialpost.com/news/canadian-us-shopping-trips-dwindle](https://financialpost.com/news/canadian-us-shopping-trips-dwindle)\n* [https://www.discovercars.com/blog/us-travel-tourism-statistics](https://www.discovercars.com/blog/us-travel-tourism-statistics)\n* [https://globalnews.ca/news/11080371/canadian-woman-detained-ice-example-immigration-border/](https://globalnews.ca/news/11080371/canadian-woman-detained-ice-example-immigration-border/)\n* [https://www.express.co.uk/news/world/2028592/us-tourism-suffer-billion-drop-donald-trump](https://www.express.co.uk/news/world/2028592/us-tourism-suffer-billion-drop-donald-trump)\n* [https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-04-01/european-tourists-start-avoiding-the-us-as-unknown-territory](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-04-01/european-tourists-start-avoiding-the-us-as-unknown-territory)",

      "text": "https://www.cnbc.com/2025/06/27/deep-inside-economy-more-sticker-prices-start-to-go-up-due-to-tariffs.html\n\nKEY POINTS\n\nThe latest inflation data came in hotter than expected, and Nike warned in its earnings on Thursday that prices will be going higher due to tariffs.\n\nAcross the U.S. retail and manufacturing distribution chains, inventory has started to be re-ticketed with higher prices, by between 8%-15%, according to ITS Logistics, including\n for apparel and consumer product goods.\n\nThe footwear industry says it expects prices to rise by between 6% and 10%.\n\nOn the surface of the U.S. economy, prices are higher. The latest inflation data out on Friday from the government showed a bigger uptick than forecast. On Thursday, Nike said it took a $1 billion hit due to tariffs and the fact that price increases have yet to be implemented.\n\nInside the U.S. economy, within distribution networks that manage inventory, there are fewer items overall due to the trade war, but more goods on which sticker prices are going up.\n\nDepending on the product, price increases range from 8%-15%, he said.\n\n“This is creating additional inflation,” Martin said. It is happening in e-commerce as well, he said, though the price change is reflected online, not on the product.\n\n“The overall inventory footprint is smaller,” said Martin. “You are looking at three months of inventory on hand now versus six.”\n\nZachary Rogers, associate professor of supply chain management at Colorado State University, explained the mild expansion seen earlier in the month was consistent with the containers that were processed at the ports. U.S. importers have been hesitant to pull forward full ocean freight orders because of the tariffs. The 50% tariff on Chinese goods is still too high for many retailers, even after a recent pause in higher tariffs President Donald Trump has threatened on Chinese goods.\n\nThe West Coast ports are now seeing a small bump in containers starting to arrive for the holidays. But based on the Port of Los Angeles Optimizer, which tracks the ocean trade destined for the Ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach, July imports will be lower than July 2024.\n\n“This is notable because July moving into August is when we would expect to see the numbers going up,” Rogers said. \n\nAnother warning sign is a dramatic fall in the ocean freight rate average on the trans-Pacific route from the Far East to the U.S. West Coast since an earlier spike in June. Average spot rates have plummeted from the Far East to the U.S. West Coast by 39% since June 1, according to Peter Sand, chief shipping analyst at Xeneta. “The Transpacific into U.S. West Coast is the key battleground for carriers when it comes to China exports, so spot rates have fallen harder and faster as they prioritized bringing capacity back onto this trade in the immediate aftermath of the lowering of 145% tariffs,” he said.\n\nSand said it is only a matter of time before shippers do the same on the U.S. East Coast, and spot rates begin to fall sharply there as well.\n\nThis pullback in orders is being closely watched by economists. Oxford Economics wrote in a recent note that on the import side, consumer goods continued to trend lower with a $4.3 billion decline after the $33 billion fall in April. “This was partially offset by a gain in autos, while other categories were mostly unchanged. We expect imports will trend lower over the course of the year as effective tariff rates remain elevated and the economy slows,” it stated.",

It's like getting told \"you have cancer!\" will send negative impacts to you and your family, but the real pain comes when symptoms start to show on your body. The expected symptoms in overall, such as higher inflation, less jobs, less consumer spending, and more, will most likely take US through a recession/depression, if not stagflation at worst. \n\nSo what happens when Trump caves and lifts all tariffs? Can we assume bond and dollar drop may slow down (or will they continue since US lost its trust from others), and will expected inflation start to drop? Will our economy have an outlook anywhere close to before, or will it still have an ugly outlook due to the damage done by Trump's politics?\n\nI personally think we'll see something similar to Apr 9th, tariff lifts will send markets through the roof due to sentiments, but only for people to realize what actual state our current economy is in and slowly continue to drop for some time. But I'm just an average person and know nothing lol. Curious to hear what everyone's' thoughts are.\n\nThanks",

      "text": "* President says he is still weighing 10% tariffs on China\n* Canada, Mexico tariffs threaten to upend auto, energy sectors\n\n**Thoughts:** We will literally see a decision from Trump tonight regarding whether or not oil will be exempted from the tariffs, otherwise the stocks I'm watching on the OVERNIGHT exchange are F/GM/TM and TSLA/LCID (stands to lose rather than gain if oil is exempted) in addition to all the oil stocks that are standard (OIL, BP, XOM, etc). We might also see some volatility tomorrow at the open, VIX has already spiked but went back to preannouncement levels.\n\n~~EDIT: TARIFFS ARE DELAYED UNTIL MARCH 1ST~~\n\n# [EDIT 2: ANNOUNCEMENT OF TARIFF DELAY HAS BEEN DEBUNKED, STILL CONTINUING ON SATURDAY ACCORDING TO WH PRESS SECRETARY ](https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/north-america-braces-new-trump-tariffs-saturday-deadline-nears-2025-01-31/)\n\n>President Donald Trump President Donald Trump said he would follow through on his threat to impose 25% tariffs on imports from Canada and Mexico on Feb. 1, citing the flow of fentanyl and large trade deficits as among the reasons for his decision.\n\n>“We’ll be announcing the tariffs on Canada and Mexico for a number of reasons,” Trump told reporters Thursday in the Oval Office as he signed executive actions in response to a deadly airplane collision.\n\n>“Number one is the people that have poured into our country so horribly and so much. Number two are the drugs, fentanyl and everything else that have come into the country. Number three are the massive subsidies that we’re giving to Canada and to Mexico in the form of deficits,” he said.\n\n>West Texas Intermediate oil futures climbed above $73 a barrel following the comments. The US dollar wiped out an earlier loss to touch the day’s high after the remarks, while the Canadian dollar and Mexican peso both plunged. US Treasuries pared their gains.\n\n>Trump indicated the 25% rate could represent a floor, saying that the tariff levels “may or may not rise with time.”\n\n>But the US president did suggest he was still considering if one significant import — oil — would be exempted. Trump said would be making a determination as soon as Thursday evening, basing his decision upon the price of oil.\n\n>“We don’t need the products that they have. We have all the oil that you need. We have all the trees you need,” Trump added, referring to major imports from Canada.\n\n>Trump’s move was closely anticipated by markets as well as global business and political leaders who have scrutinized his words and actions for any indication on whether the US president would deliver on his levy threats or use them as the starting point for negotiations on trade.\n\n>Trump in recent days threatened and then pulled back on tariffs against Colombia in a dispute over deportations of undocumented migrants, leading some to speculate that he was using trade levies merely as leverage to seek policy concessions.\n\n>Trump also indicated that he would proceed with tariffs on China. He didn’t specify the levy, though he’s previously said it would be 10%. Trump has said Beijing failed to follow through on promises to prevent fentanyl and the chemicals used to make the deadly drugs from flowing into the US.\n\n>“With China, I’m also thinking about something because they’re sending fentanyl into our country, and because of that, they’re causing us hundreds of thousands of deaths,” Trump said Thursday. “So China is going to end up paying a tariff also for that, and we’re in the process of doing that.”\n\n>Trump has ordered his administration to investigate whether China complied with a trade deal struck during his first term, setting the stage for tariffs against the world’s second largest economy.\n\n>Following through on tariffs against Canada and Mexico, who are US neighbors, major trading partners, and export markets, threatens to have dramatic economic consequences, rattle markets and potentially launch a trade war by undermining protections from a three-nation free trade agreement.\n\n>Both countries have pledged to respond to any trade levies, including with retaliatory tariffs, even as their leaders sought to assure the US they were addressing border concerns in a bid to defuse the conflict.\n\n>“If these tariffs go into effect, Canada will respond,” Canadian Ambassador to the US Kirsten Hillman said Thursday. “This is not something that we want to do. We do not want to get into a tariff-back-and-forth with the United States. It’s not good for Canada, Canadians and Canadian workers and it’s not good for the United States, Americans and American workers.”\n\n>Hillman said that Canada has responded to Trump’s concerns about the border by clamping down and announcing new security measures, including added drones and helicopters.\n\n>Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau visited Trump at his Mar-a-Lago resort even before the president was inaugurated in a bid to ease tensions between their nations, and Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum spoke to Trump to try to avert the levies.\n\n>In the first 11 months of 2024, US trade with Canada totaled $699 billion and $776 billion with Mexico. And the magnitude of tariffs Trump will enact could have stark impacts on particular industries, such as the auto industry and the energy sector. Shares of US automakers Ford Motor Co. and General Motors Co. turned negative on the announcement, erasing earlier gains.\n\n>“President Trump’s tariffs will tax America first,” Matthew Holmes, executive vice president at the Canadian Chamber of Commerce, said Thursday. “From higher costs at the pumps, grocery stores and online checkout, tariffs cascade through the economy and end up hurting consumers and businesses on both sides of the border. This is a lose-lose.”\n\n>Trump is also promising sectoral tariffs, such as on pharmaceuticals, semiconductor chips, steel, aluminum and copper, which could apply widely to many countries, including Canada and Mexico.\n\n>The US president is an avowed believer in tariffs, saying they will force a renaissance in domestic manufacturing, though industry groups warn that it will upend supply chains and endanger existing factories by raising costs of source materials.\n\n>He’s hailed tariffs as a source of revenue as lawmakers move to renew and expand expiring tax cuts and approve other credits and benefits the president promised on the campaign trail. Trump wants to reduce the corporate rate to 15% for firms that manufacture goods in the US, compared to the current 21% rate.said he would follow through on his threat to impose 25% tariffs on imports from Canada and Mexico on Feb. 1, citing the flow of fentanyl and large trade deficits as among the reasons for his decision.\n\n>“We’ll be announcing the tariffs on Canada and Mexico for a number of reasons,” Trump told reporters Thursday in the Oval Office as he signed executive actions in response to a deadly airplane collision.\n\n>“Number one is the people that have poured into our country so horribly and so much. Number two are the drugs, fentanyl and everything else that have come into the country. Number three are the massive subsidies that we’re giving to Canada and to Mexico in the form of deficits,” he said.\n\n>West Texas Intermediate oil futures climbed above $73 a barrel following the comments. The US dollar wiped out an earlier loss to touch the day’s high after the remarks, while the Canadian dollar and Mexican peso both plunged. US Treasuries pared their gains.\n\nLink: [https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-01-30/trump-says-he-ll-hit-canada-mexico-with-25-tariffs-on-saturday](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-01-30/trump-says-he-ll-hit-canada-mexico-with-25-tariffs-on-saturday)",

      "text": "Today the Trump administration announced new visitation barriers for Canadian tourists. Any tourists staying longer than 30 days must register and provide fingerprints to authorities. How many Canadians actually vacation longer for 30 days+ in the US you may ask?\n\n* **1 million snowbirds (Canadian tourists** travelling to the US to avoid Canadian winters) reportedly **contributed $6.5b** to Florida's economy **during just a 6 month period** (typical duration of their stays)\n* **Canadians were the largest visitors to the US** comprising of **\\~30% of all US tourist visits** in 2023.\n* Those tourists with billions in combined disposable income just had it harder to come to the US to spend their money\n* While this policy in isolation may not have a material impact, combined with instigating a trade war and threats of annexation seemed to have turned off many Canadians (rightfully so) on spending a single penny in the US.\n* Since Canada was the only country previously exempted from this rule, reversing this is policy is leaving many Canadians feeling further alienated by the US, especially given their economic contributions to local US economies\n\nI'm bearish for Q2, Q3, and potentially Q4 for the following industries\n\n* **REITs**: NNN REIT, Drop in tourism will bankrupt many small US businesses with thin margins in the restaurant industry. While you can't make investment moves on small businesses, this will lead to defaulting on their leases and commercial REITs that focus on restaurants will have high vacancy rates.\n* **Travel Bookers**: Expedia? Not sure how much of their revenue concentration is based on US bookings vs. global\n* **Hotels:** Marriott, Hilton, Hyatt, Air Bnb, Caesars Entertainment\n* **Airlines:** American, Delta, United, Air Canada,\n* **QSRs:** Darden Restaurants, Texas Roadhouse, Brinker International (food chains primarily with US locations attract tourists due to the novelty factor of not being able to go in Canada)\n* **Amusement Parks**: Disney, Six Flags, Cedar Fair, United Parks & Resorts\n* **Car Rentals:** Enterprise, Hertz, Avis\n* **Retail**: TJX Companies, Ross, Macys, Kohls, Target (retail stores with no presence in Canada are often attract tourists who are interested in shopping at retail stores they can't back in Canada)\n* **Energy**: Shell, Chevron, Exxon (lots of Canadian tourists do road trips and gas up in the US, but since these companies also operate in Canada and Canadians are just going to replace their US road triups with Canadian ones, I do not believe they will be impacted\n\nOther factors to consider before making moves\n\n* Can US consumer spending or tourists from other countries fill the economic void Canadian tourists will leave in the tune of billions of dollars?\n* Will other countries follow suite, either as a response to the US administrations polices, or in a sign of solidary with Canadians?\n* Even if positive relations are restored between US-Canada by the end of the year, will that change souring Canadian consumer sentiment to US businesses and travel?\n\nEdit: In no way is this post a dig at Canadians for deciding to stop visiting. I am also Canadian. This post is a purely from a finance/stock perspective on which industries will get negatively impacted by this administrations policies the most so that people here can adjust their portfolio allocations accordingly if they have exposure into said industries.

      "text": ">The US economy contracted at the start of the year for the first time since 2022 on a monumental pre-tariffs import surge and softer consumer spending, a first snapshot of the ripple effects from President Donald Trump’s trade policy.\n\n>Inflation-adjusted gross domestic product decreased an annualized 0.3% in the first quarter, well below average growth of about 3% in the prior two years, according to the government’s initial estimate published Wednesday. Net exports subtracted nearly 5 percentage points from GDP, the most on record, the Bureau of Economic Analysis report showed.\n\n>Consumer spending — which accounts for two-thirds of GDP — advanced at a 1.8% pace, the weakest since mid-2023. Business outlays for equipment, the lone bright spot in the report, increased an annualized 22.5%.\n\n|Indicator|Actual|Estimate|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|GDP|\\-0.3%|\\-0.2%|\n|Personal consumption|\\+1.8%|\\+1.2%|\n|PCE price index, excl. food, energy|\\+3.5%|\\+3.1%|\n\n>The GDP data highlight the scramble by companies to secure merchandise ahead of expansive tariffs. Looking ahead, many economists anticipate the higher duties will cause a supply shock, challenging businesses and leading to a pullback in demand as higher prices push cash-strapped Americans closer to the brink.\n\n>Forecasters currently see nearly even odds of the US falling into a recession in the next year. Consumers are also growing increasingly anxious that tariffs will take a toll on the labor market and drive up the cost of living.\n\n>The latest GDP figures showed imports surged an annualized about 41% — the biggest advance in nearly five years. Because these goods and services aren’t produced in the US, they are subtracted from GDP. Economists see the sharp widening of the trade deficit reversing in the second quarter.\n\n>Typically, imported merchandise moves into warehouses or directly to storefronts. However, the report showed business inventories contributed 2.25 percentage points to GDP during the quarter, the most since the end of 2021. The recent flood imports may instead show up in higher inventories in coming months and, along with a narrowing trade gap, provide a lift to second-quarter GDP.\n\n>Because swings in trade and inventories can sometimes distort overall GDP, economists prefer looking at final sales to private domestic purchasers for a better snapshot of demand. This measure increased at a 3% pace in the first quarter after rising an annualized 2.9% at the end of 2024.\n\n>Growth in consumer spending was driven by services and nondurable goods.\n\nLink: [https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-04-30/us-economy-contracts-for-first-time-since-2022-on-imports-surge](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-04-30/us-economy-contracts-for-first-time-since-2022-on-imports-surge)\n\n**My take:** As is commonly said, we haven't even begun to feel the effects of Trump's trade policy yet- shortages of products haven't begun hitting American consumers, but we're going to start feeling the effects this summer. We're likely in for a painful day in the markets today.\n\nI'm mainly interested in consumer discretionary companies to day trade (SBUX mainly) and also watching tech names like SMCI (earnings), NVDA/DELL/AMD (off of the new Deepseek news).\n\nCurrently long VXX but may kick that out at the open depending on how we open.",

The ticker tape is just one indicator of an economy, and other signs are growing more and more ominous—including at the Port of Los Angeles, where high tariffs on China are crushing maritime traffic. “Essentially all shipments out of China for major retailers and manufacturers have ceased,” Eugene Seroka, the executive director of the port, said on April 24.\n\nTrump views tariffs as essential to rebuilding the manufacturing economy that the United States once had. But his erratic tariff announcements have badly disrupted the economy that the country has today, and that pain is already being felt in the world of logistics.\n\n“These are big, massive bullwhips that have not been seen since COVID,” Evan Smith, the CEO of the supply-chain-management company Altana Technologies, told me. “The tariffs themselves are a shock to the system, and the shock is echoed and amplified across the entire chain. Even if there is resolution, it will take nine to 12 months to work out these bumps.”\n\nThe Port of Los Angeles, the busiest in the Western Hemisphere, processes about 17 percent of everything the United States imports or exports in shipping containers. The adjoining Port of Long Beach accounts for another 14 percent. Over the years, a whole ecosystem has arisen to support the loading and unloading of the cars, clothes, electronic gadgets, and other things that people want. There are workers and warehouses, trucks and loading pads, security structures and rail lines.\nSeroka estimated that cargo arrivals would soon be down 35 percent over the same time last year. At the moment, the drop in traffic seems likelier to accelerate than to reverse. \n\nThe number of cargo ships canceling port calls or entire voyages is on the rise. A number of shipments now under way were instigated before Trump’s so-called Liberation Day tariff announcement, on April 2. According to Forto, a cargo-management and -tracking company, reservations for shipping products must normally be placed two weeks before a cargo vessel launches. The trip from China from California typically takes two or more additional weeks. In other words, the full effects of U.S. tariff policies on maritime traffic may not be apparent for some time.\n\nThe economy, and the supply chains that allow it to function, can adjust fairly quickly to certain shocks, including weather disasters and even a pandemic. Early in the COVID shutdowns, toilet paper was in short supply as Americans spent more time at home and less at workplaces and schools. The problem eased as manufacturers ramped up production, transportation systems adapted, and consumer anxiety decreased.\nBut Trump’s trade war is different because it is unpredictable and indefinite. Even if he were to renounce tariffs tomorrow, Trump has already shaken global confidence in American economic-policy making. No one can comfortably make business decisions based on what he does. Unless the Republican-controlled Congress steps in to quickly take away the president’s ability to impose import duties at will, a failed effortso far, even foreign trading partners who believe they have a deal with the United States could be at risk of capricious new taxes on their products.\n\nTariffs don’t just reduce the flow of goods coming into the country; they also cause an atrophying of the logistics system that moves products into, out of, and around the United States. “Less cargo volume, less jobs. That’s the rule here,” Mario Cordero, CEO of the Port of Long Beach, said recently, describing how one in nine jobs in the greater Los Angeles region arises directly or indirectly from its ports. “Port complexes are like your baby toe on your foot,” Peter Neffenger, the former commander of the Coast Guard sector that includes Los Angeles and Long Beach, told me. “You don’t think about it until you break it one day and realize, ‘I can’t walk.’”\n\nLike the shipping business into and out of Los Angeles, the nationwide trucking industry is slowing down, because drivers have a lot less cargo to move. Without inventory arriving or en route, small businesses will falter; bigger industries will shrink; shelves will be empty.\nThis week, Trump blamed former President Joe Biden, rather than his own policies, for the recent turmoil on Wall Street. What’s happening in Los Angeles suggests that, if anything, financial markets have yet to fully price in how much Trump’s tariff war is hurting the economy. The stock market goes up and down. Maritime indicators keep on sinking.\n\n————————————————————————-\n\n12 MONTH POSSIBLE TIMELINE  CHATGPT (updated)\n\nHere’s a detailed 12-month timeline outlining what could happen to the American people if the current tariff-driven trajectory continues without intervention:\n\nJune–July 2025: Recession Declared, Public Pressure Builds\n\t•\tRecession officially confirmed as GDP shrinks in Q2 2025.\n\t•\tUnemployment rises to 6.2%; layoffs concentrated in logistics, manufacturing, and retail.\n\t•\tPort of LA traffic down 35–40%; national import flow craters.\n\t•\tConsumer Confidence Index drops below 80.\n\t•\tProtests begin in port cities (e.g., LA, Seattle) over job losses and inflation.\n\t•\tSocial media disinformation spikes, fueling confusion and outrage.\n\t•\tEarly signs of coordinated labor strikes in supply chain sectors.\n\n⸻\n\nAugust–September 2025: Economic Inequality Ignites Frustration\n\t•\tBack-to-school inflation hits 12–15%; families can’t afford supplies.\n\t•\tSmall business bankruptcies up 30% YoY; Black and immigrant-owned businesses hit hardest.\n\t•\tRent delinquencies rise 25%, especially in urban areas.\n\t•\tLocal governments face budget gaps from reduced tax revenue.\n\t•\tStreet protests expand, including union walkouts and flash strikes.\n\t•\tIsolated clashes with law enforcement reported in at least 3–5 major cities.\n\t•\tMilitia rhetoric and anti-government organizing increase online.\n\n⸻\n\nOctober–November 2025: Civil Unrest Threatens Stability\n\t•\tHoliday inflation hits 10–14%; shelves partially empty.\n\t•\tUnemployment nears 7%, youth unemployment >10%.\n\t•\tMass protests erupt in response to perceived government inaction; occupy-style encampments reappear.\n\t•\tSeveral cities impose curfews or call in National Guard due to escalating unrest.\n\t•\tDisruptions to public transportation and commerce in urban centers (e.g., Chicago, NYC, Atlanta).\n\t•\tSocial fabric frays: increase in thefts, flash mobs, and property damage.\n\n⸻\n\nDecember 2025–January 2026: Widespread Social Strain\n\t•\tWinter heating + food costs overwhelm low-income families.\n\t•\tFood insecurity hits 1 in 5 households; federal relief delayed.\n\t•\tRural and working-class frustration grows, with localized protests against both state and federal governments.\n\t•\tCyberattacks or hacking threats to state infrastructure increase amid anti-government activism.\n\t•\tPolice morale and staffing shortages worsen in high-conflict zones.\n\n⸻\n\nFebruary–March 2026: Fragmentation & Institutional Erosion\n\t•\tSustained unrest becomes normalized in certain cities; protest fatigue met with radicalization in fringes.\n\t•\tVoter trust in all branches of government drops below 25%, lowest in modern history.\n\t•\tRecession continues, but recovery delayed by unrest, instability, and low global confidence.\n\t•\tMilitia groups, separatist rhetoric, and conspiracy movements gain traction, pushing disinformation.\n\t•\tCalls grow for a national unity response, but partisan deadlock remains.\n\n⸻\n\nThis is a highly pessimistic scenario, but it’s modeled on how prolonged economic distress and leadership vacuums historically create conditions for widespread unrest—seen in the 1930s, 1960s, and at moments during the COVID-19 pandemic.",

      "text": "Two months into Donald Trump’s second term, the pillars of American financial hegemony — erected over the best part of a century — have rarely looked shakier.\n\nTrump’s renewed tirades against the Federal Reserve, including the most explicit threats yet to fire Chair Jerome Powell, only amplified the shockwaves from his declaration of trade war on pretty much everyone. It’s forcing a reappraisal of the assets fundamental to US economic dominance. The dollar and Treasury bonds, traditional havens at times of stress, suddenly look much less appealing. It’s not long since investors were anticipating a so-called Trump trade, essentially turbocharging US exceptionalism, but now it looks more like a sell-America trade.\n\nAnd that’s just part of an even broader and likely painful shift. The role of US households as goods-buyers of last resort for the global economy, and the American military as linchpin of security and political alliances, are being called into question too.\n\nCompounding the concerns, Trump is now escalating his war of words against the Fed, demanding immediate interest-rate cuts. Lawyers doubt he’s authorized to fire Powell. But the damage to investor confidence in the central bank’s independence — part of the bedrock appeal of US markets, along with a wider faith in the rule of law — may already be done.",

      "title": "President Trump calls for the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates by \"one full point.\"",
      "text": "https://srnnews.com/trump-says-fed-should-lower-rates-by-one-full-point/\n\n\"By Michael S. Derby\n\n(Reuters) -U.S. President Donald Trump reiterated his call for the Federal Reserve to push through a major rate cut in the wake of the release of new data Wednesday on consumer inflation.\n\nTrump called the May Consumer Price Index a “great” number and wrote on Truth Social that the “Fed should lower one full point. Would pay much less interest on debt coming due. So important!!!”\n\nThe May CPI showed a modest increase in inflation relative to a year ago, as many forecasters expect price pressures to accelerate due to the president’s massive increase in import taxes on a wide range of goods. The overall CPI for last month rose by 2.4% relative to May 2024, a touch above the April year-over-year reading, while the CPI stripped of food and energy costs was up by 2.8% over the same time period.\n\nThe CPI readings arrive ahead of a Fed policy meeting next week where officials are virtually certain to keep the central bank’s interest rate target range fixed at between 4.25% and 4.5%. Fed officials have signaled they are in a wait-and-see mode right now as the chaotic nature of the Trump administration’s trade policy has made it very hard to know what lies ahead for the economy.\n\nA wide range of economists, as well as Fed officials, believe the tariffs will increase inflation while lowering growth and depressing employment. Some of those risks have moderated as Trump has backed away from some of the most draconian tariffs.\n\nThe main question facing the Fed is whether the tariffs will drive a one-time price increase that can be ignored, or create something more persistent.\n\nA recent report from the New York Fed showed factory and service firms passing through a notable amount of tariffs. But at the same time, a separate New York Fed report released on Monday showed the public has become less worried about future inflation, which could reduce the risk of an enduring increase in price pressures.\n\nFollowing the CPI data release, futures markets increased odds the central bank will lower rates at its September meeting.\n\nCitibank economists said the CPI data “should give Fed officials further confidence that underlying inflation has been easing more rapidly this year ahead of upside risks from tariffs, and that the risk of more persistent inflation resulting from tariffs is low.” They added “we continue to pencil in 125 basis points of consecutive rate cuts from the Fed starting in September.”\n\nOther economists, however, were more cautious about the longer-run outlook for inflation.\n\nSkanda Amarnath, executive director of Employ America, said “we are likely to see a material acceleration in goods inflation and electricity inflation later this summer, both of which threaten to keep interest rates higher for longer and raise recession risk as a result.”\n\nTrump’s call for a full percentage point interest rate cut advocates for a policy action central bankers usually reserve for economic emergencies. The president has been pressing for easier monetary policy for some time even as Fed officials have shrugged off his commentary.\n\nTrump’s comment on how a Fed rate cut would lower government interest payments alludes to the massive bill high short-term interest rates have imposed on government borrowing.\n\nThat said, the Fed is mandated by Congress to set interest rates to keep inflation low while promoting maximum sustainable job growth. The Fed is not charged with managing government borrowing costs and officials have said that is not a factor in how they deliberate on the future of interest rate policy.\n\n(Reporting by Michael S.

      "text": "https://www.reuters.com/business/warren-buffett-says-us-should-spend-wisely-plans-increase-investment-japan-2025-02-22/?utm_source=reddit.com\n\nNEW YORK, Feb 22 (Reuters) - Berkshire Hathaway (BRKa.N), opens new tab on Saturday reported record annual profits and boosting its cash stake to $334.2 billion, as Warren Buffett used his annual shareholder letter to caution Washington to spend money wisely and take care of those who get the \"short straws in life.\"\n\nBuffett's admonition came as many investors worry U.S. lawmakers won't rein in soaring fiscal deficits, and could make them worse by extending tax cuts backed by President Donald Trump.\n\nThe 94-year-old Buffett, the world's sixth-richest person and arguably its most famous investor, also acknowledged his advanced age, telling shareholders he uses a cane and will spend less time fielding their questions at Berkshire's annual meeting on May 3.\n\nHe nonetheless assured shareholders they would be in good hands after he turns over the conglomerate's reins to Vice Chairman Greg Abel, saying the 62-year-old Abel has \"vividly shown his ability\" to deploy capital.\n\n\"It won't be long\" before Abel takes over, Buffett said.\n\nBuffett's letter was accompanied by Berkshire's annual report, where it reported a third straight record annual operating profit, rising 27% to $47.44 billion.\n\nQuarterly operating profit rose 71% to $14.53 billion, also a record, and which analysts viewed as solid.\n\nNet income for the full year totaled $89 billion, including gains from Berkshire's common stock investments such as Apple (AAPL.O), opens new tab and American Express (AXP.N), opens new tab.\n\nBerkshire's cash stake reflected high business valuations and nine straight quarters of selling more stocks than it bought. The selling included Apple, which remained its largest stock investment.\n\n\"Often, nothing looks compelling; very infrequently we find ourselves knee-deep in opportunities,\" Buffett wrote.\n\n'FISCAL FOLLY'\n\nThis year is Buffett's 60th at the helm of Berkshire, which he transformed from a failing textile company into a $1.03 trillion conglomerate with dozens of businesses in insurance, railroad, energy, industrial, retail and other sectors.\n\n\"Berkshire's activities now impact all corners of our country. And we are not finished,\" Buffett said.\n\nBuffett said Berkshire will continue preferring equities, primarily U.S. stocks, over cash, even as it resists paying a dividend to shareholders, which it has not done since 1967.\n\nHe said reinvesting in Berkshire is one reason the Omaha, Nebraska-based company paid $26.8 billion of federal taxes last year, 5% of all payments by corporate America. Buffett himself is worth $149.5 billion, Forbes magazine said,\nBut he also sent a cautionary message to Washington, lamenting how capitalism \"has its faults and abuses--in certain respects more egregious now than ever,\" with malfeasance by \"scoundrels and promoters\" in full force.\n\nHe urged lawmakers to help preserve a stable U.S. dollar, saying \"fiscal folly\" can destroy the value of paper money and the country has at times \"come close to the edge.\"\n\nBuffett said long-term success of Berkshire and the American economy, which he called the \"American miracle,\" has depended on people's ability to participate.\n\nThat, he said, is something Uncle Sam can encourage, or take away.\n\n\"Take care of the many who, for no fault of their own, get the short straws in life. They deserve better,\" Buffett wrote, addressing the government.\n\"And never forget that we need you to maintain a stable currency and that result requires both wisdom and vigilance on your part,\" he added.\n\nCathy Seifert, an analyst at CFRA Research who rates Berkshire \"hold,\" said: \"Talking about the business of America being messy was his way of addressing the political landscape and its impact on the macroeconomic environment. He is warning Washington: Be careful where you tread.\"\n\nFEWER BUYING OPPORTUNITIES\n\nWhile Berkshire has not made a major purchase of an entire company since 2016, Buffett said it is likely to increase its combined $23.5 billion of investments in five Japanese trading houses: Itochu (8001.T), opens new tab, Marubeni (8002.T), opens new tab, Mitsubishi (8058.T), opens new tab, Mitsui (8031.T), opens new tab and Sumitomo (8053.T), opens new tab.\n\nOther stocks appear pricey, with the Standard & Poor's 500 (.SPX), opens new tab hitting a new high on Wednesday and the Nasdaq (.IXIC), opens new tab just 3% below its December 16 peak.\n\nBerkshire's size also inhibits its shares from trouncing the indexes, as they did decades ago.\nThe company's stock price has risen 15% in the last year, while the Standard & Poor's 500 rose 18%.\n\nOver the last decade, Berkshire's stock price has risen 225%, while the index rose 241% including dividends and 185% excluding dividends, Reuters data show.\n\n\"They will have lots of buying opportunities but Berkshire will never be the large double-digit compounder it had been,\" said Bill Smead, chief investment officer at Smead Capital Management in Phoenix.\n\nAt Berkshire's annual meeting, Buffett will spend less time on the stage in a downtown Omaha arena where he, Abel and Vice Chairman Ajit Jain will answer shareholder questions.\n\nTens of thousands of people attend the meeting and a weekend of shareholder events, including shopping.\n\nBuffett told Fortune magazine last month that he was still having fun and able to do a few things reasonably well, while other activities had been \"eliminated or greatly minimized.\"\n\nThe meeting will also not feature the traditional movie created by Buffett's daughter Susie.\nIn discussing his age, Buffett said he talks regularly on Sundays with his 91-year-old sister Bertie, using an old-fashioned phone.\n\n\"We cover the joys of old age and discuss such exciting topics as the relative merits of our canes,\" he said. \"In my case, the utility is limited to the avoidance of falling flat on my face.\"",

Pardon my ignorance on this subject I just don't really know if it's possible or if it would even have any upsides or what the downsides would be?\n\n  If it matters to anybody I have never voted for Trump.

Powell would likely fight such an action in court. Investor faith in the U.S. could also be shaken. Monday’s slump in stocks and the dollar and rise in bond yields might be a foretaste.\n\nThat prospect has some Republicans warning Trump against threatening to oust the Fed leader.\n\n“The president has already created tremendous uncertainty concerning international trade policy, forcing every business in America to figure out what his policies are,” said Gramm, who chaired the Senate Banking Committee from 1999 to 2001. “Suggesting that Powell could be removed through presidential action creates a whole new uncertainty.”\n\nEven if Trump doesn’t ultimately oust Powell, his efforts to discredit him could do lasting harm to an institution that has long sought to remain apolitical and technocratic.  \n\n“This is a real disaster” for the Fed, said Peter Conti-Brown, a Fed historian at the University of Pennsylvania. “The very integrity and buy-in on a bipartisan basis that the Federal Reserve is going to be a straight shooter is what gives the Fed its authority, its maneuverability.”",

As Goldman Sachs analysts note, the average tariff rate on imports from China is now 34% and the increase is already roughly twice as large as that in the first Trump administration. Nobody wants to bet anymore that there will be swift compromises or deals.\n> \n> \"It is difficult for markets to get on with aggressive positioning given the risk of U.S. tariff policies turning on a dime,\" said Chang Wei Liang, currency and credit strategist at DBS.\n> \n> \"In credit markets, spreads certainly look too low given the change in risk environment and a more adverse and uncertain trade backdrop.\"\n> \n> Volatility gauges for Treasuries (.MOVE), and for U.S. (.VIX), and Japanese stocks (.JNIV), hit their highest levels of the year this week and implied volatility in currencies ticked higher.\n> \n> Stocks and bond yields slid on Tuesday as investors globally ducked for cover.\n> \n> Defence stocks ran higher, while shares in technology companies slumped. As China announced retaliatory tariffs and Mexico and Canada prepared their responses, investors reckoned on a global growth slowdown and upped expectations for U.S. rate cuts.\n> \n> Futures pricing still implies about 75 basis points of U.S. cuts this year, up from about 50 bps two weeks ago, while 10-year yields hit a 4-1/2 month low of 4.115%.\n> \n> Investors see an uncertain outlook where shelter lies in defensive sectors such as real estate or healthcare. And, while protected companies such as U.S. steelmakers may prosper, higher prices will flow along supply chains with unpredictable effect.\n> \n> \"I'm spending a lot of time talking to CEOs who are really trying to understand the consequence of some of this,\" said Goldman Sachs CEO David Solomon at conference in Australia.\n> \n> \"Until there's more certainty, we have a little bit more runway time. I think we're going to live with a slightly higher level of volatility. But I think he (Trump) has a purposeful direction that he's pursuing, and we should take him at his word that he's going to pursue that direction.\"\n> \n> **DIFFICULT TO TRADE**\n> \n> The fall in the dollar has been one of the most eye-catching reversals as conviction turns to confusion in currency trade.\n> \n> What had, in January, been speculators' largest long-dollar bet in nearly a decade has rapidly unwound - so much so that, as of last week, speculators were short dollars against emerging market currencies and held a record long yen position .\n> \n> Against the euro , the dollar is down nearly 1% in two trading sessions as the fall in U.S. yields has coincided with rises for European yields since the continent prepares to ramp up defence spending while Trump backs away from Ukraine.\n> \n> At the White House, Trump took aim at China and Japan for holding their currencies too cheap. In fact, the yuan , against a basket of trading partners' currencies, is historically firm and Japan has been intervening in recent years to buy the yen .\n> \n> But on Tuesday, as the dollar fell, Nomura's global head of foreign exchange flow, Hoe Lon Leng, said it seemed like the \"final blow\" for those hoping for a higher dollar.\n> \n> \"That argument is waning and we keep seeing the price action move the other way,\" he said, noting that if both China and the U.S. did not want to see the dollar go higher against the yuan \"then it is going to go lower\".\n> \n> To be sure, market gyrations have not been enormous and plenty of analysts do still see room for trade negotiations and an exit ramp from escalation. But the policy whiplash has gnawed away at hopes investors had in a breakthrough deal.\n> \n> And nobody can say they are sure Trump is bluffing.\n> \n> \"The threat of tariffs has run its course for now, so the next phase is to endure them,\" said Jamie Cox, managing partner at Harris Financial Group in Richmond, Virigina.\n> \n> \"Markets have to price in that reality, and those numbers are painted red.\"",

If each sailing was carrying 8,000 to 10,000 TEUs (twenty-foot equivalent units), that would equal a decline in freight traffic of between 640,000-800,000 containers, and lead to decreased crane operations at the ports, lower fees that could be collected, and declines in container pick-ups and transports by trucks, rails, and to warehouses for storage.\n\nBooking volumes from the last week of March to first week of April across global and U.S. trade lanes plummeted. There were sharp decreases in bookings across several categories, including apparel & accessories; and wool, fabrics & textiles, both down over 50%. Major product categories from China that are moved in containers include apparel, toys, furniture, and sports equipment, all of which are subject to steep tariffs.",

      "text": "he world’s most widely followed stock-market benchmark slid into a correction on Thursday, a drop that underscores how the two-year-long bull market is running out of steam in the early days of the Trump administration.\n\nThe move stems from investors’ growing pessimism about the whipsawing policy pronouncements from Washington over the past few weeks. On-again, off-again tariffs and mass layoffs of federal workers have fomented unease on Wall Street.\n\nOn Thursday, the S&P 500 fell 1.4 percent. After weeks of selling, the index is now down 10.1 percent from a peak that was reached less than one month ago and is in a correction — a Wall Street term for when an index falls 10 percent or more from its peak, and a line in the sand for investors worried about a sell-off gathering steam.\n\nOther major indexes, including the Russell 2000 and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite, had already fallen into correction before Thursday.\n\nThe deeper worry among investors is that uncertainty around the effects of Mr. Trump’s policies is causing consumers to spend less and discouraging businesses from investing. That reticence could, in turn, drive the economy into a downturn, forcing investors to re-evaluate company valuations.\n\n“I think what markets are telling us is that they are very concerned about the potential for a recession,” said Kristina Hooper, chief global market strategist at Invesco. “That is certainly not what markets expected going into 2025.”\n\nSo far, the administration has brushed off the market turmoil. Scott Bessent, secretary of the U.S. Treasury, said on Thursday that he was focused on the “real economy”, downplaying signals sent by business leaders and investors. “I’m not concerned about a little bit of volatility over three weeks,” he said.\n\nAs stocks have been falling in recent weeks, the Trump Administration has emphasized that its economic policies are designed to promote job growth over the long term, but could cause some market turmoil in the near term.\n\nSeema Shah, chief global strategist at Principal Asset Management, said the economy has already begun to be “negatively impacted.”\n\nThe pain has been acutely felt among the behemoth tech companies that had driven the market higher in recent years but have since reversed course. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite index has fallen roughly 14 percent from its peak in December.\n\nThe sell-off has also spread to other corners of the market, signaling broader concerns than simply a re-pricing of highly valued technology companies. The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies, which are typically more exposed to the ups and downs of the economy, has fallen 18 percent from its peak in November, close to a fully fledged bear market, defined as a drop of 20 percent or more from its peak.\n\nSectors of the stock market exposed to tariffs, like food producers, have slumped. The effects are being felt on other companies, like airlines, that are worried about a pullback among consumers should the economy enter a downturn.\n\n“So far in 2025, the U.S. economy has only faced headwinds,” Ms. Shah said.\n\nOn Thursday, Mr. Trump threatened to impose 200 percent tariffs on European wine and champagne, one day after the European Union announced retaliatory tariffs on imports of U.S. whiskey and several other American products. The president has already added tariffs on steel and aluminum imports, and a wide swath of products from China.\n\nThe constantly moving goal posts have left investors so rattled that even recent good news about the economy hasn’t had a calming effect. On Thursday, a report on weekly unemployment claims came in lower than expected. On Wednesday, a better-than-expected reading of the Consumer Price Index had briefly helped bolster stocks.\n\nInvestors are worried that tariffs, once in full effect, will push prices higher — hurting business and consumers. Mr. Trump’s immigration policies and firings of federal employees through the so-called Department of Government Efficiency are also looming in the backdrop, as is the threat of an impending government shutdown.\n\n“The outlook for inflation depends more on tariffs, deportations and DOGE than the backward-looking data releases right now,” Bill Adams, chief economist for Comerica Bank, said on Thursday.\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/13/business/sp-500-stocks-market-correction.html?smid=nytcore-android-share",

However, this is not due to a market reversal catalyst (e.g. interest rate cuts, full tariffs abolition etc.). Apart from some good earnings published this week, two catalysts might be:\n\n1) China renouncing to tariffs on chips, medical devices etc. since they are too important to their economy\n\n2) Trump' s administration hinting at negotiations on tariffs.\n\nHowever, even if there are negotiations, they might take years until the agreements are implemented, and tariffs might be lowered but still be there. The rally of this week cannot have been triggered by retail investors: Banks and other institutions must have been the drivers of the rally and they for sure have more \"insider\" information than retail investors. If we assume that the rally has been triggered by institutions and bank, could this be a sign that something will certainly come out soon and turn the market into bullish again?

      "text": "https://www.ft.com/content/d7d2f3f4-d681-4a3a-974c-ff2885e98663\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\nDonald Trump has declined to rule out either a recession or higher inflation while dismissing the concerns of business over a lack of clarity on tariffs, after a tumultuous week in which he watered down elements of his aggressive trade agenda. \n\nThe president insisted industry had “plenty of clarity” and lashed out at “soundbite[s]” from companies expressing confusion over his plans. \n\n“They always say that — that’s like almost a soundbite — they always say that: ‘we want clarity’,” Trump said in an interview aired on Fox News on Sunday. \n\n“It sounds good to say, but for years, the globalists, the big globalists, have been ripping off the United States. They’ve been taking money away from the United States, and all we’re doing is getting some of it back.”\n\nThe president declined to rule out a recession hitting the US economy this year after the Atlanta Fed warned of an economic contraction in the first quarter of the year. \n\n“I hate to predict things like that. There is a period of transition, because what we’re doing is very big. We’re bringing wealth back to America. That’s a big thing, and there are always periods, it takes a little time.”\n\nAsked whether tariffs could fuel inflation again, Trump said: “You may get it. In the meantime, guess what? Interest rates are down.”\n\nThe comments come after a week of about-turns and an equity market sell-off as markets scrambled for clarity over Trump’s brewing trade war and companies warned of rising prices.\n\nThe president imposed 25 per cent tariffs across the board on imports from Canada and Mexico on Tuesday before backtracking later in the week.\n\nOn Wednesday he granted carmakers a carve-out from the levies and on Thursday extended that to all goods that met the rules of the 2020 USMCA free-trade deal. Separate 25 per cent tariffs on steel and aluminium imports are set to take effect this week.\n\nThe levies have already caused significant upheaval in the market as companies stockpile materials, review operations and prepare to raise prices. Trump reiterated that the tariffs could rise in future.\n\n“The tariffs could go up as time goes by. They may go up, I don’t know if it’s predictability,” he said.\n\nTrump said in the interview that he had “wanted to help the American carmakers” this week but insisted that no such leeway would be shown on reciprocal tariffs set to be imposed next month. \n\n“I gave them a little bit of a break for a short period of time . . . It’s a transition into April, and after that I’m not doing this . . . I told them, I said: Look, I’m going to do it this one time but, after that, I’m not doing it.”\n\nSeparately on Sunday, Howard Lutnick, Trump’s commerce secretary, conceded some of the tariffs would cause inflationary pressures, echoing Trump’s warnings of “a little disturbance” when he addressed Congress on Tuesday.\n\n“So, will there be distortions? Of course, foreign goods may get a little more expensive, but American goods are going to get cheaper.,” Lutnick told NBC’s meet the press.",

      "text": "I’ve been thinking about where we are in the economic cycle and what comes next. In my opinion, the future looks grim, and US equities will have to reconcile with reality at some point. I’ll try to break down the reasons below, in no particular order. Writing this out helps me structure my thoughts and hopefully anyone interested can add to the discussion.\n\n* Cracks in the job market\n\nOfficial BLS data doesn’t look *that* terrible, but I think it misses a lot of what’s happening on the ground. Some people are working part-time because they cannot find full-time positions. Some people are surviving on gig type jobs altogether (Uber, food delivery etc). Some people are not collecting unemployment benefits, so they don’t show up in the statistics. Just look around: ghost jobs, 7 interview rounds for one position, tens of thousands of people being laid off at once.\n\nSources back up anecdotal evidence:\n\n[US Hits Highest Layoffs since COVID](https://www.newsweek.com/us-hits-highest-layoffs-since-covid-2111794)\n[US labor market cracks widen as job growth hits stall speed](https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-labor-market-cracks-widen-job-growth-hits-stall-speed-2025-08-01/)\n[US job openings, hiring decrease in June](https://www.reuters.com/business/world-at-work/us-job-openings-hiring-decrease-june-2025-07-29/)\n\n* Cracks in the housing market\n\nSales are down, inventory is up. We’re all aware only the very rich can afford to buy a house right now. Prices will have to come down, at least a little bit.\n\n[US existing home sales hit nine-month low in June](https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-existing-home-sales-hit-nine-month-low-june-2025-07-23/)\n[July 2025 Monthly Housing Market Trends Report](https://www.realtor.com/research/july-2025-data/)\n\n* AI bubble\n\nI’m not an AI hater, but it’s clear that people have overestimated its capabilities. We’re not getting anything close to AGI anytime soon. Also, GPT5 is not much better than GPT4 in terms of quality, the advancements were made in efficiency – for good reason: AI companies are moving away from market acquisition and into figuring out how to monetize all of this, so investors get their money back. Even if the bubble doesn’t pop in the traditional sense, we can certainly expect some form of plateau and investor reluctance going forward.\n\nBig tech is 40% of the S&P500 and all of them are riding the AI wave.\n\n* Tariffs\n\nTariffs damage the economy. They are inflationary and reduce trade. Anyone thinking US workers are going to be assembling phones is delusional, so all they will do is increase the cost of doing business. Eventually, this will be transferred to the consumer. \n\nOne reason this hasn’t truly happened yet is because companies stocked up on inventory before the tariffs hit, while other companies paid their mob protection tax to Trump to avoid tariffs, at least in the short term.\n\n[Tariff effects on consumer prices](https://www.federalreserve.gov/econres/notes/feds-notes/detecting-tariff-effects-on-consumer-prices-in-real-time-20250509.html)\n[Deposco data reveals 228% surge in inventory levels as supply chains brace for tariff impact](https://deposco.com/blog/statistics-supply-chain-tariff-impact/), but this stocking cushion will disappear by early 2026.\n\n* Cracks in car market\n\n[While overall car sales seem to be up from 2024](https://www.carpro.com/blog/first-half-of-2025-u.s.-auto-sales-all-automakers-reporting), it's [fueled by credit](https://www.edmunds.com/industry/press/a-record-1-in-5-new-car-shoppers-committed-to-a-1000-monthly-payment-in-q2-2025-according-to-edmunds.html) and [panic-buying before tariffs](https://www.investopedia.com/have-americans-been-panic-buying-cars-to-get-ahead-of-tariff-driven-price-hikes-11709204), not a financially healthy consumer. Anecdotal evidence from various dealers around the country seem to support a slowdown in the past couple of months. Otherwise they [wouldn't be dropping prices](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/CUSR0000SETA02).\n\n* Consumer credit bomb\n\nAnyone saying “consumer is still strong” isn’t paying attention.\n\nThe [buy-now-pay-later market growth looks like a staircase](https://www.grandviewresearch.com/industry-analysis/buy-now-pay-later-market-report). \n\n[41% of BNPL consumers made at least one late payment in the past year](https://www.emarketer.com/content/bnpl-popularity-among-young-risks). The [US household debt has been skyrocketing as well](https://www.newyorkfed.org/microeconomics/hhdc) in recent years. I concede that this chart looked similar after covid as well, but consumer credit bomb is a factor and it has to explode at some point. \n\nEven if it doesn't explode in the traditional sense, all of this is essentially pulling demand from tomorrow.\n\n* US tourism decline\n\nWho the hell wants to go to the US to be detained at the border for a JD Vance meme? It’s simply not worth it. [U.S Economy Set To Lose $12.5BN In International Traveler Spend this year](https://wttc.org/news/us-economy-set-to-lose-12-5bn-in-international-traveler-spend-this-year).

I don’t know what form this will take. Maybe Ukraine falls and Russia has to deal with guerilla warfare for years to come, maybe the Russian government collapses instead, causing a power vacuum and crisis in the process. Whatever form this will take, it will negatively impact the world economy in some way. This is on top of the general outlook held by everyone that global tensions and trade distortions means growth decelerates or even stalls.\n\n* The fed has no wiggle room\n\nSome might say that the fed will just cut rates and that will fuel the stock market. I disagree. The fed cannot cut rates meaningfully in an inflationary environment. The [CME FedWatch Tool](https://www.cmegroup.com/markets/interest-rates/cme-fedwatch-tool.html) says 90% chance of rate cuts. Hot take: I disagree. They won't cut rates. They can't. [Fed officials agree with me](https://www.reuters.com/business/feds-kugler-no-rate-cut-some-time-tariffs-pass-through-prices-2025-07-17/), for what it's worth.\n\n* Institutional collapse of credibility\n\nNobody trusted the government before Trump either, but it seems we reached new highs. Every single position in the US government has been filled by phony, unqualified charlatans. One thing they have in common is that they’re loyal to Trump. He just fired the head of the BLS after he didn’t like the numbers they published. Making data-driven decisions will become increasingly difficult. \n\nThe ripple effects of all this are unquantifiable and probably too vast to list here. Some come to mind: risk premiums explode, capital flees, big corporations freeze and employ a “wait for this to blow over” strategy (stockpile cash, freeze hiring etc). Institutions are the backbone of democracies.\n\n* **Let’s talk timeline**\n\nAll in all, everyone knows things are bad. I just listed some of the issues I could think of. There’s probably more.\n\nHere’s what I’m thinking in terms of how and when this will play out:\n\n**Phase 1 (Q3 2025 – Q4 2025): Late Cycle Euphoria**\n\n- AI narrative still holds for the moment. S&P500 continues to grind higher fueled by big cap tech giants keeping the AI dream alive.\n- Firing workers still boosts a company's stock price as they are perceived to be “trimming the fat” from the covid over-hiring as well as thinking that AI will fill the gaps.\n- Effects of tariffs not yet in full swing. Previous over-stocking holds.\n- Overall market inertia keeps things going for a bit.\n\n**Phase 2 (Q1 2026 – Q2 2026): Trump Rally Peak**\n\n- Tariffs are fully embedded in prices, squeezing the consumer to the max.\n- By now, even the most dedicated supporters are starting to realize that Trump will not “fix it”. Tariffs aren’t being rolled back. \n- The belief that Trump is “good for the stock market” begins to fade as reality sets in.\n- AI hype cracks as monetization disappoints and people realize it’s not all it’s cracked up to be.\n- Market peaks, investors begin to sell every bounce on the way down, but some people still hold on to the belief that these are just normal market fluctuations, no need to panic.\n\n**Phase 3 (Q3 2026 – Q4 2026): Sentiment Crack**\n\n- Political pressure mounts as economy continues to deteriorate.\n- Fed can’t cut meaningfully due to sticky inflation. “Fed is stuck” narrative takes shape.\n- Consumer spending falls sharply.\n- “Sell the Trump rally” sentiment begins to dominate. \n- S&P500 goes down 20%.\n\n**Phase 4 (Q1 2027): Capitulation event**\n\n- Trump either dies or is impeached, or some other major political shock happens.\n- Credit-sensitive sectors go bankrupt.\n- Inflation finally subsides as demand collapses.\n- VIX up 50%.\n- Fed signals “emergency measures” as unemployment skyrockets even in worthless government statistics.\n- S&P500’s final leg down is 35-45% from the current top.\n\n**How does recovery look like?**\n\nWell, not great. What are the factors that would fuel a rally back up? The only one that I can think of right now is that stock prices will overshoot the bottom and some things may just be “too cheap to not buy”.\n\nWould a political change help? Maybe, but I don’t see the government suddenly reforming. \n\nAI-fatigue followed by a return to human-centric work? We might see a short-lived “human over machine” sentiment but I don’t think that’ll be enough to fuel any meaningful economic recovery.\n\nTariff rollback and a big enough collapse to give consumers some breathing room might also be a helping factor in the recovery, but still, I feel like it’s lacking the systemic impact we’re looking for in a V shaped recovery.\n\nRather, I think that the recovery is L shaped, similar to Japan 1990s or US 2000 - 2007. We slowly grind upwards from the bottom and we get back to current prices by 2030. However, if you account for inflation, you'd still be underwater if you bought the S&P500 now.\n\n**TL;DR:** Stock market has to reconcile with reality in the next couple of years, causing a massive correction. “Sell the Trump rally” narrative takes shape next year. Recovery is shit.",

And he made it clear he wasn't yet sure whether the inflationary effects from tariffs would be temporary or long-lasting.\n\n\"Tariffs are highly likely to generate at least a temporary rise in inflation,\" he said, but \"the inflationary effects could also be more persistent.\"\n\nPowell also underscored the Fed's obligation is to keep long-term inflation expectations well anchored and to prevent a one-time price increase associated with higher tariffs from becoming an ongoing inflation problem.\n\nAll of this seemingly hit a nerve with the president, who spent much of Thursday lashing out at Powell on social media and during a press event in the Oval Office.\n\n\"Powell's termination cannot come fast enough!\" the president wrote on Truth Social. Trump said Powell \"is always TOO LATE AND WRONG\" and should be cutting interest rates alongside other central banks.\n\nAt the White House later on Thursday, Trump reiterated he was \"not happy\" with Powell and that Powell would leave his position \"if I ask him to.\"\n\nThe Wall Street Journal reported Thursday that Trump has for months privately discussed firing Powell, but he hasn’t made a final decision about whether to try to oust him before his term ends in May 2026.\n\nPowell has shown no signs of blinking. On Wednesday, he again reiterated the independence of his institution and his own job, saying it’s \"a matter of law,\" and pledged not to act in response to any political pressure.",

Trump also urged China to open its markets to U.S. products, emphasizing that \"closed markets don't work anymore.\"\n\n[Full Article Here](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/05/09/trump-china-tariffs-trade-talks.html)\n\nWhat do we actually think the result of this is going to be?

I honestly don't know why they're bothering to negotiate with this buffoon.\n\nIf it's the same as the UK deal (which essentially reversed the tariffs on the UK economy as it protected all key industries involved), then we'll basically see tariffs be essentially rolled back to what they were a few months ago with some extra steps thrown in.\n\n[Edit] I just checked what the average tariff was before this year, and it was about 20%.

      "title": "Trump set to meet with Wall st execs and Top CEOs on Tuesday",
      "text": "Donald Trump meeting with top CEOs and Wall Street executives on Tuesday, March 11, 2025, comes at a time when the stock market is jittery—$1.75 trillion wiped out, recession odds climbing to 39%, and uncertainty over tariffs shaking investor confidence. The Business Roundtable meeting is a chance for Trump to pitch his economic vision directly to the heavy hitters of American business. How this affects the stock market, and why it might actually be a good thing, depends on a few key factors.\n\nHow It Could Affect the Stock Market\n1. **Short-Term Volatility**: Markets hate uncertainty, and right now, Trump’s tariff policies are a big question mark. If he doubles down on aggressive tariffs during this meeting—say, sticking to the 25% on Canada and Mexico or the 20% on China—stocks could take another hit. Investors might see it as a signal of prolonged trade wars, higher costs for companies, and squeezed consumer spending. The S&P 500, already down 8.5% from its February peak (per Reuters data from today), could slide further, especially in sectors like tech and retail that rely on global supply chains.\n\n2. **Confidence Boost (or Bust)**: If Trump uses this meeting to clarify his plans—maybe signaling flexibility on tariffs or emphasizing tax cuts and deregulation—markets could rally. CEOs and Wall Street execs want predictability. A strong, coherent message about long-term growth could calm nerves and reverse some of the selloff. But if he’s vague or combative, expect more panic selling.\n\n3. **Sector-Specific Impacts**: Certain industries might react differently. Financials and energy could benefit if Trump pushes deregulation and domestic focus, while multinationals and importers (think Walmart or Target) might lag due to tariff fears. The Nasdaq, already down over 4% today, is especially vulnerable given its tech-heavy weighting and those “extended valuations” analysts are worried about.\nWhy It Could Be a Good Thing\n1. **Resetting Expectations**: The market’s been running on fumes of post-election hype—lower taxes, less regulation, the “Trump trade.” This meeting could force a reality check. A selloff now might flush out overinflated valuations (like in tech) and set the stage for a healthier climb later. Think of it as a painful but necessary detox, as Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent hinted at recently.\n\n2. **Long-Term Focus**: Trump’s doubling down on “long-term economic strength” suggests he’s willing to weather short-term turbulence for bigger gains—like bringing manufacturing back to the U.S. If CEOs buy into this and signal support, it could shift investor sentiment from fear to patience. A $1.75 trillion wipeout sounds brutal, but markets often overreact; the S&P 500’s still up historically over longer horizons.\n\n3. **Bargaining Power**: Tariffs might just be a negotiation tactic. If Trump convinces CEOs he’s using them to extract better trade deals (not crash the economy), Wall Street might see it as a win. Lower bond yields—already dropping today—could ease borrowing costs, helping businesses and consumers down the line. Plus, a weaker dollar (contrary to textbook tariff effects) could boost U.S. exports, offsetting some pain.\n\nThe Catch\nIt’s not all rosy. Recession fears aren’t baseless—consumer confidence is tanking, the Atlanta Fed’s GDPNow model predicts a Q1 2025 contraction, and layoffs are creeping up. If Trump’s meeting flops—say, he clashes with CEOs or doubles down on chaos—those 39% recession odds could jump fast. Markets might not give him the benefit of the doubt like they did in his first term when the “Trump put” was a thing.\n\nBottom Line\nThe stock market’s immediate reaction will hinge on Trump’s tone and clarity tomorrow. More uncertainty = more selling; a strong, unifying pitch = potential rebound. Why it’s good? It could force a needed correction and align markets with a longer-term vision, assuming Trump’s not bluffing about strength. But it’s a gamble—39% recession odds aren’t trivial, and CEOs might not be in the mood for vague promises. Watch the headlines tomorrow; they’ll move the needle more than any forecast.",

      "text": "Bloomberg) -- US consumer confidence unexpectedly declined in June on concerns about prospects for the economy, labor market and personal finances due to trade policy.\n\nThe Conference Board’s gauge of confidence decreased 5.4 points to 93, data showed Tuesday. The figure was below all estimates in a Bloomberg survey of economists. \n\nA measure of consumer expectations for the next six months dropped 4.6 points to 69, while a gauge of present conditions fell 6.4 points to 129.1.\n\nThe retreat in confidence erased nearly half of the prior month’s rebound, underscoring lingering anxiety about the potential impacts on the economy from higher US import duties. While inflation over the past three months has been modest, some consumers have become more guarded about their spending.\n\n“Consumers were less positive about current business conditions than May. Their appraisal of current job availability weakened for the sixth consecutive month but remained in positive territory, in line with the still-solid labor market,” Stephanie Guichard, senior economist at The Conference Board, said in a statement.\n\nThe cutoff date for the Conference Board survey was June 18, five days after Israel launched a series of strikes on Iranian targets. References to geopolitics increased only slightly in write-in responses, according to the survey.\n\nThe share of consumers expecting higher interest rates in the year ahead increased to 57%, the highest since October 2023, the Conference Board data showed.",

      "title": "The private sector lost 33,000 jobs in June, badly missing expectations for a 100,000 increase, ADP says",
      "text": ">Private sector hiring unexpectedly contracted in June, payrolls processing firm ADP said Wednesday, in a possible sign that the economy may not be as sturdy that investors believe as they bid the S&P 500 back up to record territory to end the month.\n\n>Private payrolls lost 33,000 jobs in the June, the ADP report showed. Economists polled by Dow Jones forecast an increase of 100,000 for the month. The May job growth figure was revised even lower to just 29,000 jobs added from 37,000.\n\n>“Though layoffs continue to be rare, a hesitancy to hire and a reluctance to replace departing workers led to job losses last month,” Nela Richardson, ADP’s chief economist, said in a press release published Wednesday morning.\n\n>To be sure, the ADP report has a spotty track record on predicting the subsequent government jobs report, which investors tend to weigh more heavily. May’s soft ADP data ended up differing significantly from the monthly jobs report figures that came later in the week.\n\n>This week, the government’s nonfarm payrolls report will be out on Thursday with economists expecting a healthy 110,000 increase for June, per Dow Jones estimates. Economists are expecting the unemployment rate to tick higher to 4.3% from 4.2%. Some economists could revise down their jobs reports estimates following ADP’s data.\n\n>Weekly jobless claims data is also due Thursday, with economists penciling in 240,000. This string of labor stats comes during a shortened trading week, with the market closing early on Thursday and remaining dark on Friday in honor of the July 4 holiday.\n\n>**Service roles hit hardest**\n\n>The bulk of job losses came in service roles tied to professional and business services and health and education, according to the ADP. Professional/business services notched a decline of 56,000, while health/education saw a net loss of 52,000.\n\n>Financial activity roles also contributed to this month’s decline with a drop of 14,000 on balance.\n\n>But the contraction was capped by payroll expansions in goods-producing roles across industries such as manufacturing and mining. All together, goods-producing positions grew by 32,000 in the month, while payrolls for service roles overall fell by 66,000.\n\n>The Midwest and Western U.S. saw the strongest contractions in June, declining by 24,000 and 20,000, respectively. Meanwhile, the Northeast shed 3,000 roles. The Southern U.S. was the sole region tracked by the ADP to see payrolls expand on net in the month, recording an increase of 13,000 positions.\n\n>The smallest firms tended to see more job losses this month than their larger counterparts. In fact, businesses with more than 500 employees saw the biggest payroll growth in the month with an increase of 30,000, per the ADP. By comparison, businesses with fewer than 20 employees accounted for 29,000 lost roles on net.\n\n>Annualized income growth decreased modestly from May for both job stayers and hoppers. The rate of pay increase for those staying in their jobs ticked down to 4.4% from 4.5%, while those getting new roles slid to 6.8% from 7%.\n\nLink: [https://www.cnbc.com/2025/07/02/adp-jobs-report-june-2025.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/07/02/adp-jobs-report-june-2025.html)\n\nMy thoughts: Labor data significantly influences Fed policy (of course they might revise this later down the road) which leads to rate changes, market adjusts as a result of those rate changes, and affects volatility as a result, etc etc. So... rate cuts became a lot more likely.",

Now the pressure will be on to convince voters that Trump’s achievement will make the U.S. economy stronger. Americans thus far aren’t convinced.\n\nThe House voted 218-214 to pass the bill, which extends the individual tax cuts that Trump originally signed into law in 2017, among other provisions.\n\nOver the past two days, fiscal conservatives have lambasted the bill for adding a projected $3.4 trillion to the $36.2 trillion national debt over the next decade. Meanwhile, some GOP moderates expressed concern about the bill’s cuts to Medicaid that the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office has said will likely result in nearly 12 million people losing their insurance coverage.\n\nIn the end, both groups folded without any changes. Some previous holdouts said the White House made assurances on how they would enforce certain provisions in the bill, while House leadership also suggested Republicans would have a chance to pass another bill to make changes later in the year.\n\nRead More:\nhttps://www.barrons.com/articles/trump-tax-bill-house-pass-9e230859",

Not every business will be affected right away, or even majority.\n\nNo, just because you aren't feeling/seeing it in your every day means there will be or not be a recession. \n\n\nTo prove my point let's look at the 2008 Recession:\n\n - When did the 2008 Recession actually start?\n\nTry December 2007\n\n - When did people start feeling that Recession?\n\nWhile it depends on the person most will tell you Summer/fall 2008\n\n - When did the Bear market Start?\n\n October 09, 2007\n\n - When did is end?\n\nMarch  2009, 17 months later.\n\nEven in the 2008 Recession, we had full quarters with positive growth. 2008 Q2 GDP growth was around 2.3%\n\nAlso the 2008 Recession had multiple dead cat bounces. Some as high as 25% back up. \n\nSo in other words, you all need to calm down.\n\nIt's not going to crash overnight, but it also isn't going to be all roses and sunshine either.\n\nThis isn't a black swan event like COVID, it's being caused by an Administration with severely bad policies that will catch up to us sooner than later.",

      "text": "\"People were getting a little queasy.\" Trump says he was watching bond market reaction to tariff measures\n\n President Donald Trump said he was watching volatility in the bond market in recent days and appeared to indicate that it was among the factors that led to his decision to institute a 90-day pause on some tariffs.\n\n“I was watching the bond market. The bond market is very tricky. I was watching it. But if you look at it now, it’s beautiful. The bond market right now is beautiful. But yeah, I saw last night where people were getting a little queasy,” he said.\n\nCNN reported prior to the president’s decision that US Treasury yields had risen in recent days as investors sold off bonds. The benchmark 10-year yield Wednesday morning was 4.4% – up from 3.9% before Trump unveiled his tariffs.\n\nTrump also said he watched JP Morgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon on Fox Business Network this morning.\n\nThe CEO “made the statement to the effect that something had to be done with the tariffs and trade. … He understood it,” Trump said. “It wasn’t sustainable what was happening. Somebody had to pull the trigger. I was willing to pull the trigger.”\n\nDuring that appearance, Dimon warned that a recession was a “likely outcome” of the escalating trade war resulting from Trump’s tariff policies.\n\n“No one’s wishing for (a recession) but hopefully if there is one it’ll be short,” he said. “I do think fixing these tariff issues and trade issues would be a good thing to do.” \n\nhttps://www.cnn.com/politics/live-news/trump-tariffs-cnn-town-hall-04-09-25/index.html",

      "text": "Tesla reported a miss on the top and bottom lines in its first-quarter earnings report on Tuesday as automotive revenue plunged 20% from a year earlier.\n\nHere are the key numbers compared with LSEG expectations.\n\n* **Earnings per share**: 27 cents adjusted vs. 39 cents estimated\n* **Revenue**: $19.34 billion vs. $21.11 billion estimated\n\nTotal revenue slid 9% from $21.3 billion a year earlier. Automotive revenue dropped 20% to $14 billion from $17.4 billion in the same period last year.\n\nTesla said one reason for the decline was the need to update lines at its four vehicle factories to start making a refreshed version of its popular Model Y SUV. The company also pointed to lower average selling prices and sales incentives as a drag on revenue and profit.\n\nNet income plummeted 71% to $409 million, or 12 cents a share, from $1.39 billion or 41 cents a year ago.\n\nIt’s been a brutal start to the year for Tesla, with CEO Elon Musk spending much of his time in President Donald Trump’s White House, overseeing an effort to dramatically downsize the federal government. The president’s sweeping tariffs plan has led to concerns that costs will increase for parts and materials crucial for electric vehicle production, including manufacturing equipment, automotive glass, printed circuit boards and battery cells.\n\nTesla shares are down 41% so far in 2025, and suffered their worst quarterly drop since 2022 in the period that ended in March. The stock was little changed in extended trading on Tuesday.\n\nThe company refrained from promising growth this year and said it will “revisit our 2025 guidance in our Q2 update.”\n\nIn its shareholder deck, Tesla cautioned investors that “uncertainty in the automotive and energy markets continues to increase as rapidly evolving trade policy adversely impacts the global supply chain and cost structure of Tesla and our peers.” The company said this “dynamic,” and “changing political sentiment” could have a meaningful near-term impact on demand for its products.\n\nTesla has faced widespread protests in the U.S. and Europe, where Musk has actively supported Germany’s far-right AfD party. Earlier this month, the company reported a 13% decline in first quarter deliveries from a year earlier to 336,681.\n\nTesla has been struggling to keep pace with lower-cost competitors in China, and is a laggard in the robotaxi market, which is currently dominated in the U.S. by Alphabet’s Waymo. The company has promised to launch its first driverless ride-hailing offering in Austin, Texas, in June.\n\nThe company reassured investors on Tuesday that it remains on track for a “pilot launch” in Austin by that point, and to begin building its humanoid robots on a pilot production line in Fremont, California, this year.\n\nOperating income in the quarter slid 66% to $400 million from $1.17 billion a year earlier, resulting in a 2.1% operating margin. The company cited an increase in expenses tied to artificial intelligence projects as one factor in the decline.\n\nThe company would have lost money on automotive sales without environmental regulatory credits during the quarter. Revenue from the credits, which Tesla receives for selling fully electric vehicles, increased to $595 million from $432 million in the same quarter last year.\n\nEnergy generation and storage revenue jumped 67% in the quarter to $2.73 billion from $1.64 billion a year ago. The company said growth in AI infrastructure is “creating an outsized opportunity for our Energy storage products to stabilize the grid, shift energy when it is needed most and provide additional power capacity.”\n\nTesla uses foreign suppliers for its energy business. The company said “increasing tariffs may cause market volatility and near-term impacts to supply and demand.”\n\nSource: [Tesla (TSLA) earnings report Q1 2025](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/04/22/tesla-tsla-earnings-report-q1-2025.html)",

      "text": "https://www.wired.com/story/trump-us-cloud-services-europe/\n\n\n#Trump’s Aggression Sours Europe on US Cloud Giants\n\n###Companies in the EU are starting to look for ways to ditch Amazon, Google, and Microsoft cloud services amid fears of rising security risks from the US. But cutting ties won’t be easy.\n\n> The global backlash against the second Donald Trump administration keeps on growing. Canadians have boycotted US-made products, anti–Elon Musk posters have appeared across London amid widespread Tesla protests, and European officials have drastically increased military spending as US support for Ukraine falters. Dominant US tech services may be the next focus.\n\n> There are early signs that some European companies and governments are souring on their use of American cloud services provided by the three so-called hyperscalers. Between them, Google Cloud, Microsoft Azure, and Amazon Web Services (AWS) host vast swathes of the internet and keep thousands of businesses running. However, some organizations appear to be reconsidering their use of these companies’ cloud services—including servers, storage, and databases—citing uncertainties around privacy and data access fears under the Trump administration.\n\n> “There’s a huge appetite in Europe to de-risk or decouple the over-dependence on US tech companies, because there is a concern that they could be weaponized against European interests,” says Marietje Schaake, a nonresident fellow at Stanford’s Cyber Policy Center and a former, decade-long member of the European Parliament.\n\n> The moves may already be underway. On March 18, politicians in the Netherlands House of Representatives passed eight motions asking the government to reduce reliance on US tech companies and move to European alternatives. Days before, more than 100 organizations signed an open letter to European officials calling for the continent to become “more technologically independent” and saying the status quo creates “security and reliability risks.”\n\n> Two European-based cloud service companies, Exoscale and Elastx, tell WIRED they have seen an uptick in potential customers looking to abandon US cloud providers over the last two weeks—with some already starting to make the jump. Multiple technology advisers say they are having widespread discussions about what it would take to uproot services, data, and systems.\n\n> “We have more demand from across Europe,” says Mathias Nöbauer, the CEO of Swiss-based hosting provider Exoscale, adding there has been an increase in new customers seeking to move away from cloud giants. “Some customers were very explicit,” Nöbauer says. “Especially customers from Denmark being very explicit that they want to move away from US hyperscalers because of the US administration and what they said about Greenland.”\n\n> “It's a big worry about the uncertainty around everything. And from the Europeans’ perspective—that the US is maybe not on the same team as us any longer,” says Joakim Öhman, the CEO of Swedish cloud provider Elastx. “Those are the drivers that bring people or organizations to look at alternatives.”\n\n> Concerns have been raised about the current data-sharing agreement between the EU and US, which is designed to allow information to move between the two continents while protecting people’s rights. Multiple previous versions of the agreement have been struck down by European courts. At the end of January, Trump fired three Democrats from the Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board (PCLOB), which helps manage the current agreement. The move could undermine or increase uncertainty around the agreement. In addition, Öhman says, he has heard concerns from firms about the CLOUD Act, which can allow US law enforcement to subpoena user data from tech companies, potentially including data that is stored in systems outside of the US.\n\n> Dave Cottlehuber, the founder of SkunkWerks, a small tech infrastructure firm in Austria, says he has been moving the company’s few servers and databases away from US providers to European services since the start of the year. “First and foremost, it’s about values,” Cottlehuber says. “For me, privacy is a right not a privilege.” Cottlehuber says the decision to move is easier for a small business such as his, but he argues it removes some taxes that are paid to the Trump administration. “The best thing I can do is to remove that small contribution of mine, and also at the same time, make sure that my customers’ privacy is respected and preserved,” Cottlehuber says.\n\n> Steffen Schmidt, the CEO of Medicusdata, a company that provides text-to-speech services to doctors and hospitals in Europe, says that having data in Europe has always “been a must,” but his customers have been asking for more in recent weeks. “Since the beginning of 2025, in addition to data residency guarantees, customers have actively asked us to use cloud providers that are natively European companies,” Schmidt says, adding that some of his services have been moved to Nöbauer’s Exoscale.\n\n> Harry Staight, a spokesperson for AWS, says it is “not accurate” that customers are moving from AWS to EU alternatives. “Our customers have control over where they store their data and how it is encrypted, and we make the AWS Cloud sovereign-by-design,” Straight says. “AWS services support encryption with customer managed keys that are inaccessible to AWS, which means customers have complete control of who accesses their data.” Staight says the membership of the PCLOB “does not impact” the agreements around EU-US data sharing and that the CLOUD Act has “additional safeguards for cloud content.” Google and Microsoft declined to comment.\n\n> The potential shift away from US tech firms is not just linked to cloud providers. Since January 15, visitors to the European Alternatives website increased more than 1,200 percent. The site lists everything from music streaming services to DDoS protection tools, says Marko Saric, a cofounder of European cloud analytics service Plausible. “We can certainly feel that something is going on,” Saric says, claiming that during the first 18 days of March the company has “beaten” the net recurring revenue growth it saw in January and February. “This is organic growth which cannot be explained by any seasonality or our activities,” he says.\n\n> While there are signs of movement, the impact is likely to be small—at least for now. Around the world, governments and businesses use multiple cloud services—such as authentication measures, hosting, data storage, and increasingly data centers providing AI processing—from the big three cloud and tech service providers. Cottlehuber says that, for large businesses, it may take many months, if not longer, to consider what needs to be moved, the risks involved, plus actually changing systems. “What happens if you have a hundred petabytes of storage, it's going to take years to move over the internet,” he says.\n\n> For years, European companies have struggled to compete with the likes of Google, Microsoft, and Amazon’s cloud services and technical infrastructure, which make billions every year. It may also be difficult to find similar services on the scale of those provided by alternative European cloud firms.\n\n> “If you are deep into the hyperscaler cloud ecosystem, you’ll struggle to find equivalent services elsewhere,” says Bert Hubert, an entrepreneur and former government regulator, who says he has heard of multiple new cloud migrations to US firms being put on hold or reconsidered. Hubert has argued that it is no longer “safe” for European governments to be moved to US clouds and that European alternatives can’t properly compete. “We sell a lot of fine wood here in Europe. But not that much furniture,” he says. However, that too could change.\n\n> Schaake, the former member of the European Parliament, says a combination of new investments, a different approach to buying public services, and a Europe-first approach or investing in a European technology stack could help to stimulate any wider moves on the continent. “The dramatic shift of the Trump administration is very tangible,” Schaake says. “The idea that anything could happen and that Europe should fend for itself is clear. Now we need to see the same kind of pace and leadership that we see with defense to actually turn this into meaningful action.”\n\n**Credit:** *(Matt Burgess is a senior writer at WIRED focused on information security, privacy, and data regulation in Europe.

      "text": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/money/investing/american-exceptionalism-over/?ICID=continue_without_subscribing_reg_first\n\nNearly three quarters of fund managers think that US exceptionalism has peaked. The prevailing trend of the last decade – a belief in the continued success of US markets far beyond that of other regions – is over, according to the Bank of America’s latest survey.\nOver the past two months, fund managers have dumped US equities at a record pace as President Trump’s tariff war and uncertainty over global economic stability continue. For those watching closely, it should not come as a shock, although it has happened perhaps a little faster than anticipated.\n\nWhile it has come to feel like business as usual, US exceptionalism isn’t the historic status quo. In the 1980s, for example, the rapid rise of Japanese stocks challenged the US dominance of global markets.\nTom Stevenson, investment director at Fidelity Personal Investing, explains that ultimately, the stock market bubble was over-inflated and had a long way to fall – a scenario today’s US market is particularly vulnerable to.\nOne of the most notable pinpricks came at the start of this year with the release of DeepSeek, a sophisticated AI tool developed in China. The extremely cheap development cost of the model has sparked concerns that the AI moat of the American tech giants may not be as wide as had been assumed.\n\nSince 2012, average earnings from US stocks have risen 145pc – over the same period, European and UK markets have each seen earnings increase by just 37pc and 30pc, respectively.\n\nHugh Gimber, global market strategist at JP Morgan, says: “Technology has been the leading sector globally and the US has been overweight in that sector. In an environment where technology [stocks] have been standout it has been hard for other regions to out perform.”\nHowever, the performance gap between the Magnificent Seven (Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, Alphabet, Tesla, Meta and Nvidia) and the rest of the S&P 500 has narrowed of late. A year ago, the tech giants were outgrowing the rest of the US market by 30pc, a figure that has plummeted to just 6pc. That is expected to halve to just 3pc in 2026.\n\nThe upset is apparent in other metrics, too. While the Magnificent Seven accounted for 50pc of the S&P 500’s earnings in 2024, this share is projected to fall to a third for 2025.\n\nAll of this adds up to a simple fact: US equities are unlikely to outperform the rest of the world to the extent that they have done in the recent past.\nIn fact, Mr Stevenson warns they may underperform.\nMarkets are also becoming suspicious of US government debt, which could have dramatic consequences for the stock market.\nMr Gimber explains: “One of the big parts behind the US economic outperformance is the size of the government deficit that has been running.\n“This has been an expansion built on US government debt, and although levels are still rising the market is getting wary of US government debt, especially in the context of inflationary pressure from tariffs.”",

      "text": "Hims & Hers Health shares plunged 18% in extended trading on Monday after investors looked past better-than-expected revenue and earnings and focused instead on the disappointing gross margin.\n\nHere’s how the company did:\n\n* **Earnings per share:** 11 cents vs. 10 cents expected by LSEG\n* **Revenue:** $481 million vs. $470 million expected by LSEG\n\nRevenue at the telehealth company increased 95% in the fourth quarter from $246.6 million during the same period last year, according to a release.\n\nHowever, the company’s gross margin, or the profit left after accounting for the cost of goods sold, was 77%, while analysts polled by StreetAccount were expecting 78.4%.\n\nIt’s the second big stock drop for Hims & Hers in a matter of days. The shares tumbled 26% on Friday after the U.S. Food and Drug Administration announced that the shortage of semaglutide injection products has been resolved.\n\nIn May, Hims & Hers started prescribing compounded semaglutide, the active ingredient in Novo Nordisk’s blockbuster GLP-1 medications Ozempic and Wegovy. The company was a breakout star within the digital health sector in 2024, in part because of the success of its popular new weight loss offering. The stock climbed about 200% for the year.\n\nCompounded drugs are custom-made alternatives to brand-name drugs designed to meet a specific patient’s needs, and compounders are allowed to produce them when brand-name treatments are in shortage. The FDA said Friday that it will start taking action against compounders for violations in the next 60 to 90 days.\n\nHims & Hers also offers treatments for skin care, mental health, sexual health and hair care.\n\nExcluding its GLP-1 offerings, revenue increased 43% to $1.2 billion for the full year, “meeting our previous 2025 revenue target a year early,” CFO Yemi Okupe said in a release.\n\n“The success we are experiencing is a direct reflection of our improving ability to democratize access to high quality, personalized care across each of our specialties,” Okupe said.\n\nNet income climbed to $26.01 million, or 11 cents per share, from $1.25 million, or 1 cent per share, a year prior. The company reported adjusted earnings of $54.1 million, meeting analyst estimates, according to StreetAccount.\n\nFor the first quarter, Hims & Hers expects to report revenue of $520 million to $540 million, while analysts were expecting $497 million. Adjusted earnings will be between $55 million to $65 million for the period, the company said. \n\nSource: [https://www.cnbc.com/2025/02/24/hims-hers-health-hims-q4-earnings-2024.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/02/24/hims-hers-health-hims-q4-earnings-2024.html)",

      "text": "Tesla CEO Elon Musk said Sunday that his involvement in the Trump administration could be hurting the automaker’s stock price.\n\nSpeaking at a town hall event in Wisconsin, Musk said his role with the so-called Department of Government Efficiency — which is pushing for widespread government job cuts — is creating backlash against his electric car company and hurting the stock.\n\n“What they’re trying to do is put massive pressure on me, and Tesla I guess, to ... stop doing this,” Musk said, according to Bloomberg News. “My Tesla stock and the stock of everyone who holds Tesla has gone, went roughly in half. I mean it’s a big deal.”\n\nShares of Tesla entered Monday already down more than 34% year to date, and the stock has been cut nearly in half from its peak in December. Shares were down an additional 6% in premarket trading Monday.\n\nThe drop for the stock could be a “buying opportunity” for the long term, said Musk, who was in Wisconsin ahead of a state supreme court election there. Musk has campaigned for the conservative candidate and spent more than $12 million on the race, in addition to giving $1 million each to two voters at Sunday’s rally for signing a petition against “activist judges.”\n\nThe slumping stock isn’t the only sign of public anger with Musk for his political work. Protesters demonstrated at Tesla dealerships over the weekend, and there have been reports of vandalism against vehicles and dealers across the country.\n\nMusk’s role in politics is not limited to DOGE. He publicly campaigned with Trump in 2024 and has been a regular presence at the White House since the new administration took over in January. He also regularly comments on many different political topics on X, the social media company he owns.\n\nThe CEO’s rising political profile comes amid signs that Tesla’s core business is slowing. The automaker’s vehicle deliveries declined in 2024, and preliminary data has shown that sales are down again early this year, especially in Europe. In a note to clients Sunday, investment firm Stifel trimmed its price target on the stock and lowered its sales projections for Tesla.\n\nMusk’s political dealings may not be the only reason for Tesla’s struggles. Other U.S. auto stocks have also labored in recent weeks, partly because of threats of higher tariffs on imported goods into the U.S. and retaliation from overseas trading partners, adding uncertainty to an industry whose supply chains are tightly woven among the U.S., Canada and Mexico.\n\nSource: [Elon Musk says backlash against DOGE government cuts hurts Tesla stock](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/03/31/elon-musk-says-people-against-his-doge-cuts-are-trying-to-pressure-tesla.html)",

      "title": "Trump aide says tariffs will raise $6 trillion as White House readies plan",
      "text": "White House aide Peter Navarro claimed Sunday that President Donald Trump’s new tariffs would raise more than $6 trillion in federal revenue over the next decade, a figure that experts said would almost certainly represent the largest peacetime tax hike in modern U.S. history.\n\nAppearing on Fox News, Navarro said the president’s tariffs on auto imports, set to take effect Wednesday, would raise $100 billion per year. Meanwhile, a regime of additional tariffs — details of which have yet to be released — would raise another $600 billion per year, or $6 trillion over the next decade, Navarro said.\n\nNavarro’s remarks suggest Trump is preparing dramatic new measures for Wednesday, which the president has referred to as “Liberation Day.” Navarro is known to be among the most hawkish voices in the president’s inner circle on trade, and it was not immediately clear if he was speaking to official administration policy or for one side of an internal debate over the tariffs. But Navarro’s comments are sure to rattle markets amid intensifying fears about the global trade war that Trump’s tariffs have started.\n\nAlso speaking on Fox News on Sunday, Kevin Hassett, director of the White House National Economic Council, declined to outline Trump’s plans. Hassett is widely regarded as more skeptical of tariffs than Navarro.\n\n“I can’t give you any forward-looking guidance on what’s going to happen this week,” Hassett said. “The president has got a heck of a lot of analysis before him, and he’s going to make the right choice, I’m sure.”\n\nTariffs are taxes imposed on foreign goods imported into the United States. A tariff regime that generated $600 billion per year would amount to the biggest increase in federal tax revenue since World War II, according to Jessica Riedl, senior fellow at the Manhattan Institute, a center-right think tank.\n\nBy way of comparison, the U.S. is set to spend roughly $900 billion per year on the Pentagon this year. Extending Trump’s 2017 tax cuts is projected to cost roughly $4 trillion over the next decade, adding roughly $400 billion a year to the national debt.\n\nGenerating $600 billion a year in fresh revenue theoretically would cover the cost of those tax cuts and then some. But economists say new taxes of that magnitude also could deepen instability on Wall Street and further increase the risk of a U.S. recession, and experts are extremely skeptical the tariffs would raise as much as Navarro claimed.\n\nThe Trump administration argues that steep tariffs are necessary to bring production and manufacturing jobs back to the United States. “The message is tariffs are tax cuts. Tariffs are jobs. Tariffs are national security,” Navarro said. “Tariffs will make America great again.”\n\nNavarro did not disclose details of the additional tariffs coming Wednesday, but Trump [has in recent days revived the idea](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2025/03/29/republicans-trump-tariffs-trade-war/?itid=ap_jeffstein_2) of imposing a single universal rate on all imports to the United States, regardless of the product or the country of origin. During the 2024 presidential campaign, Trump proposed setting this flat tariff rate as high as 20 percent.\n\nBecause the U.S. imports more than $3 trillion worth of goods per year, simple math suggests that a 20 percent import tax on all goods could raise close to $600 billion in annual revenue. However, economists argue that such a tax ultimately would raise far less because the costs would be passed on to American consumers in the form of higher prices and consumers would therefore purchase fewer imported goods. In an interview with NBC on Saturday, Trump nodded to this effect, [saying](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/03/29/trump-auto-tariffs-prices-rise/) he “couldn’t care less” if his auto tariffs raise prices, because higher prices on imports would encourage people to buy American-made cars instead.\n\nA universal flat tariff has been heavily criticized by economists in both parties, who argue that it would raise prices indiscriminately, striking even some goods — such as food and cheap consumer electronics — that either cannot be produced in America or make little sense to produce domestically.\n\nThis month, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent outlined a more moderate approach to “Liberation Day” that calls for the United States to determine a new tariff policy for its each of its key trading partners, leaving room for negotiations and dealmaking. But Trump has told advisers in recent days that he is wary of being insufficiently ambitious with his tariff policy, and it remains unclear precisely what Wednesday will bring.",

      "text": "I had a similar analyses, but this coming from most respected business paper should have more weight.\n(Quote)\n\nMarkets are trying to figure out the implications of upending this system. Here are four:\n\nMore expensive stuff, and less choice of stuff. Increasing saving means reducing consumption. The tariffs amount to the largest tax increase in decades, which counts as government “saving”—as well as pushing up the price for almost everything imported.\n\nHigher interest rates. The capital inflows that offset the trade deficit help fund a big chunk of federal government borrowing. Slash the trade deficit and the net inflow of foreign money dries up. Bond yields will need to rise to attract domestic savers to buy Treasurys instead of stocks or corporate bonds, which will hit share prices and raise the cost of borrowing for companies.\n\nLower stock prices. Only a small chunk of foreign investments goes into building factories. If there were more foreign direct investment, it could finance at least some of the reconstruction of manufacturing. But we’ve assumed Trump succeeds in shrinking the trade and current-account deficits, so there will be less foreign money coming in (remember: balance). So more foreign factory building means less foreign buying of stocks and bonds, so lower stock prices.\n\nA weaker dollar. In economic theory the dollar is the variable that moves when savings and investment don’t balance. If the U.S. saves too little to cover its investment, the dollar should weaken to make U.S. investments more attractive to foreigners.\n\nIn practice the dollar has been in demand for foreign reserves and for use in trade, as well as a safe place to stash the world’s savings. All three are now being questioned: reserve holders worry they could be cut off from their reserves the way Russia was, trade is likely to shrink thanks to tariffs, and investors are worried that U.S. law might no longer be the reliable protector of their assets.\n\n(End quote)\n\nThis is the most important part, and the full article under paywall can be found here:\n\nhttps://www.wsj.com/finance/investing/who-will-pay-the-price-for-trumps-economic-goals-37a7df15?st=8oqUME&reflink=article_copyURL_share",

      "text": "From: https://www.timesunion.com/state/article/schumer-says-democrats-force-vote-end-trump-20286193.php \n\n\nALBANY — Democrats plan to force a floor vote in the U.S. Senate next week to reverse recent tariffs imposed by President Donald J. Trump on imports from other countries. \n\nSenate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer told reporters in Albany Monday that he thinks Democrats can secure the four Republican votes necessary for the resolution to pass.\n\n“American families, restaurants and manufacturers will be able to breathe a sigh of relief if we can get that done,” Schumer said.\nA similar resolution sponsored this month by U.S. Sen. Tim Kaine, a Democrat from Virginia, wound up passing the Senate after four Republicans crossed party lines to support it. Schumer is trying to repeat that result.\nThe resolution would reverse the blanket 10% tariff on all goods imported into the U.S. by ending the emergency declaration Trump has issued to impose them. It would also prevent Trump from using the same declaration to impose new tariffs.\n“We believe the administration’s claim of an emergency is not justified,” Schumer said.\nBut the harder fight — and one in which Schumer has no control — is in the House of Representatives, where a majority of lawmakers would have to approve the resolution for it to become binding.\nRepublican leadership in the house, including Rep. Elise Stefanik from the North Country, has made clear that they don’t plan to stand in the way of Trump’s tariffs. Some lawmakers have offered support for his economic strategy.\nThe goal of the tariffs is to pressure other countries into trade agreements more favorable to the U.S. while providing a disincentive for consumers to purchase products imported from other countries.\n“I strongly support President Trump’s America First economic policies to strengthen American manufacturing and create millions of American jobs,” Stefanik said earlier this month.\n\nStefanik is one of seven Republicans that represent New York in the House, where Republicans currently hold a seven-member majority.\nSchumer employed a strategy on Monday that’s been used by several other Democrats from New York in recent weeks to apply pressure to Republicans, framing them as the final arbiters on whether prices will climb because of tariffs.\nHe called on the Republicans representing New York in Congress to bring his planned resolution to the floor of their chamber for consideration.\n“If those seven went to (House Speaker Mike) Johnson and said to put it on the floor, he’d be under real pressure to do it,” Schumer said.\n\nBut at least one Republican is siding with Stefanik on Trump’s tariffs. Rep. Mike Lawler has said that Republicans are focused on other actions to lower costs as well, like removing regulations for businesses and boosting domestic energy production.\n“This is about leveling the playing field, bringing tariffs down across the globe,” Lawler said in a televised town hall earlier this month.\nThat makes Schumer’s request unlikely at this point, leaving the tariffs in place. They’ve already started to have an impact on certain industries, including restaurants, which may have to raise their prices to maintain profits.\n“Tariffs on food and beverages will place an additional strain on restaurants, ultimately leading to higher prices that will be passed on to consumers,” said Melissa Fleischut, president of the New York State Restaurant Association.\n\nOther industries also haven’t been immune to the tariffs. That includes Latham Pool, a local business that happens to be the largest manufacturer of in-ground residential pools in North America. \nTariffs on aluminum and steel have had the most impact on the business, said Scott Rajeski, the company’s CEO.\n“We’ve created an ecosystem where we use the Canadian operations and our upstate New York operations to ship goods back and forth between the two countries,” Rajeski said. “It’s a difficult situation.”\n\nBoth chambers of Congress are scheduled to return to Washington, D.C., next week after two weeks off from session.",

After its engineers and executives studied the results, the company concluded the manufacturing process is not yet viable to move to high-volume production.\n\nReuters could not determine the current relationship between Broadcom and Intel or whether Broadcom had decided to walk away from a potential manufacturing deal.\n\n\"Intel 18A is powered on, healthy and yielding well, and we remain fully on track to begin high volume manufacturing next year,\" an Intel spokesperson said in a statement. \"There is a great deal of interest in Intel 18A across the industry but, as a matter of policy, we do not comment on specific customer conversations.\"\n\nA Broadcom spokesperson said the company is \"evaluating the product and service offerings of Intel Foundry and have not concluded that evaluation.\"\n\nIntel's contract manufacturing business was launched in 2021 as a key part of Chief Executive Pat Gelsinger's turnaround strategy.\n\nBroadcom is not a household name but makes crucial networking gear and radio chips that helped generate $28 billion in overall chip sales in its last fiscal year. It has benefited from the boom in spending on artificial intelligence hardware, and J.P. Morgan analyst Harlan Sur estimated it will bank $11 billion to $12 billion from AI this year, up from $4 billion last year.\n\nSome of its chip sales are from agreements with companies such as Alphabet's (GOOGL.O), Google and Meta Platforms (META.O), to help produce in-house AI processors, which can include arrangements with a manufacturer, such as Intel or Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co (2330.TW),.\n\n**CRUCIAL SETBACK**\n\nAs part of a disastrous second-quarter earnings report that shaved more than a quarter from the company's market value, Intel announced a 15% job cut and a reduction in capital spending related to its factory construction. Gelsinger and other executives will present a plan to the board of directors in mid-September on possible cuts to business units and teams to reduce costs, Reuters reported on Sunday.\n\nIntel has committed to about $100 billion of expansion and new factory construction at several sites in the U.S. A crucial part of the company's expansion includes attracting big customers such as Nvidia (NVDA.O), or Apple (AAPL.O), to fill up capacity at all its new sites.\n\nIntel reported a $7 billion operating loss for the foundry business, wider than the $5.2 billion in losses the year earlier. Executives expect the contract chip business to achieve breakeven in 2027.\n\nTypically fabricating an advanced chip requires more than 1,000 separate steps inside a chip factory, or fab, and takes roughly three months to complete. Production success is determined by the number of working chips on each silicon wafer. Achieving a substantial yield is crucial to move to producing the tens of thousands or hundreds of thousands of wafers demanded by big chip designers.\n\nBroadcom's engineers had concerns with the viability of the process, the sources said. Typically that refers to the number of defects on each wafer or the quality of the chips fabricated.\n\nFor an advanced manufacturing process used by TSMC, the Taiwanese giant charges roughly $23,000 per wafer at high volume, according to two sources familiar with wafer pricing. Reuters could not determine Intel's wafer pricing.\n\nTSMC declined to comment on its wafer pricing.\n\nMoving a chip design from a manufacturing process used by a company such as TSMC to another vendor such as Samsung (005930.KS), or Intel can take months and requires dozens of engineers, depending on the complexity of the chip and the differences in manufacturing technology.\n\nBetting on a new manufacturing process such as Intel's 18A is impossible for some smaller chip companies because doing so would require resources they do not have.\n\nIntel released its manufacturing tool kit for its 18A process to other chipmakers over the summer, Gelsinger said on an earnings call last month.\n\nThe company plans to be \"manufacturing-ready\" by the end of this year for its own chips and begin high volume production for external customers in 2025, Gelsinger said. At an investor conference last week, he said there are a dozen customers \"actively engaged\" with the tool kit.\n\nhttps://www.reuters.com/technology/intel-manufacturing-business-suffers-setback-broadcom-tests-disappoint-sources-2024-09-04/",

But his unpredictable and frequently shifting policy rollouts have stirred turmoil in the stock market and left business leaders uncertain about how to plan for the future.\n\nTrump has hyped April 2 as “liberation day” and “the big one.” His plan, as originally described, would slap reciprocal tariffs on all countries that have their own import duties on U.S. goods, while also imposing tariffs in response to other disfavored trade policies, such as the use of value-added taxes.\n\nBut Trump and his officials have recently suggested that the tariffs coming April 2 could end up being softer than they first appeared.\n\nTrump said Friday that “there’ll be flexibility” on those tariffs, and on Tuesday night suggested the duties will be more “lenient than reciprocal.” Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said last week that countries can pre-negotiate with the U.S. to avoid facing new tariffs on April 2.",

Behind his nearly $20 billion jump in wealth was a deal that shot up Musk’s rocket company SpaceX’s valuation to roughly $350 billion, Bloomberg reported Tuesday. SpaceX and its investors agreed to purchase as much as $1.25 billion of insider shares. Tesla shares closed at a record high on Wednesday, hitting $424.77 at market close. Musk, who is Tesla’s largest individual shareholder, has also enjoyed the stock propelling higher in part due to the broader market — NASDAQ topped 20,000 for the first time ever Wednesday. Since Election Day, the EV maker’s stock has rallied roughly 65% on investors’ belief that Musk’s influence in the Trump administration will usher in an era of deregulation that will benefit the company.\n\n> His artificial intelligence startup, xAI, also more than doubled in value in November amid a new funding round, surging to $50 billion from a few months ago, according to the Wall Street Journal. The world’s wealthiest man is now roughly $136 billion richer since November 5, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. While the top spots on the billionaires index typically switch around, Musk is racing past his wealthy peers. As of December 10, before his wealth skyrocketed to $400 billion, he was already $140 billion richer than the second-richest man on Earth, Amazon founder Jeff Bezos.\n\n> Musk’s record-breaking Tesla-shareholder-approved pay package, which was worth $101 billion, was rejected by a Delaware court last week. Bloomberg’s calculation still seems to include the pay package, which is now worth as much as $120 billion based on the current value of Tesla shares.",

      "text": "From Bloomberg. Of course this Billionaire actively supported Trump and donated millions. Somehow he never heard Trump say over and over again that “the US was getting ripped off” and the best way to fight that was high tariffs? Trump has been saying this since the 1980’s when Japan was ascendant. \n\n“Citadel founder Ken Griffin extended his criticism of the Trump administration’s trade policy, saying that tariffs won’t bring back American manufacturing jobs the way that the president anticipates and the country should play to its strengths instead. \n\n“He dreams of giving people their dignity back, and I have to applaud him for having that dream,” Griffin, speaking Friday at Stanford University’s Graduate School of Business, said of President Donald Trump. The dream of creating more manufacturing jobs, however, “is not going to come true.”\n\n“These jobs are not coming back to America,” Griffin said. “And to be clear, with an unemployment rate of 4%, America has moved on.”\n\nThe Citadel billionaire, who earlier this week said the trade war has devolved into a “nonsensical” place, has warned that the US is putting its global brand at risk as a result of the tariff policies. On Friday, he said the administration has embraced a transactional mindset that runs contrary to the best interests of the country. \n\nSpeaking as part of Stanford’s “View From the Top” series in Silicon Valley, Griffin argued the US should try to play to its strengths, such as creating intellectual property and content, rather than bringing back jobs in factories that are rapidly automating their production anyway. \n\nKen Griffin Criticizes Trump Tariffs: ‘These Jobs Are Not Coming Back’ https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-04-25/ken-griffin-says-trump-tariffs-won-t-bring-back-manufacturing-jobs",

      "text": "More than eight out of every 10 respondents to a Morgan Stanley survey believe Tesla CEO Elon Musk’s controversial political activities are hurting his business.\n\nIn total, 85% of the 245 participants polled by the firm believe Musk’s foray into politics has either had a “negative” or “extremely negative” impact on business fundamentals. The majority of respondents also expect Tesla deliveries to fall this year, according to the survey.\n\nWhile a small sampling, these results offer the latest sign of mounting frustration with the billionaire entrepreneur as he’s become a rising figure in international and American politics. It also comes at a pivotal point for Tesla’s stock, with shares plunging nearly 40% this year.\n\nWhen asked about Musk’s efforts with U.S. government efficiency and other political activities, 45% of respondents said these actions had a “negative” effect on the company. Another 40% said they were having an “extremely negative” impact.\n\nOn the other hand, 3% said they were “positive” for the business. Meanwhile, 12% called them “insignificant.”\n\nTo be sure, Morgan Stanley analyst Adam Jonas reported that his survey respondents are drawn from his email distribution list and should not be taken as a random representative sample. He also noted that the respondents are not necessarily owners of Tesla stock. The survey was taken over a 17-hour period, starting on Tuesday afternoon.\n\nJonas also asked about expectations for the company’s performance. In a separate question, 59% said they anticipated Tesla would deliver fewer cars to customers in 2025 compared with the prior year. What’s more, 21% of total respondents said they expected a decline of more than 10%. That comes as some analysts have raised alarm that recent reports of vandalism could spook potential customers.\n\nJust 19% of responders said they forecasted deliveries to rise in 2025, while another 23% said they would be flat between the two years.\n\nMusk’s political profile has grown after his public support of President Donald Trump in the runup up to last year’s election and his subsequent role leading the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE. The Tesla executive’s efforts to slash the federal government’s spending and workforce has drawn the ire of critics who see his team as working too quickly and haphazardly.\n\nMusk acknowledged in an interview with Fox Business on Monday that his high-profile role in Trump’s administration meant he was running his businesses, which also include X and SpaceX, “with great difficulty.” That day, Tesla shares tumbled more than 15% for their worst session since 2020.\n\nDespite the recent nosedive, 45% of respondents said they anticipate Tesla shares will be at least 11% higher by the end of the calendar year. Around 36% expect the stock to tumble another 11% or further by year-end, while 19% see the stock staying within 10% of its price around $220.\n\nAfter a New York Times report last week unearthed criticisms of Musk’s team from members of Trump’s cabinet, the president offered a vote of confidence on Tuesday. Trump evaluated five Tesla models parked at the White House after the president said on social media that he would buy one as a symbol of support.\n\nTrump also said he would declare violence at Tesla dealerships to be acts of domestic terrorism.\n\nSource: [https://www.cnbc.com/2025/03/12/tesla-investor-survey-shows-85percent-believe-musks-politics-are-hurting-company.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/03/12/tesla-investor-survey-shows-85percent-believe-musks-politics-are-hurting-company.html)",

His absence at Tesla’s manufacturing facilities is being felt as share prices continue to trend downward.\nMusk has lost a lot of money as TSLA stock falls, but he could end up losing something else.\n\nTesla CEO Elon Musk may be in for a difficult decision if TSLA stock keeps declining. \n\nMusk’s intertwined business empire could be in trouble \nTesla may be the company for which Musk is best known, but his assets include several other prominent tech names, including SpaceX and X (formerly Twitter). This wide array of responsibilities concerned investors long before he accepted his new position at DOGE.\nNow that he has this new position, Musk is spending even less time running his companies, and things haven’t been going well for any of them. While Tesla stock fell last week, a SpaceX rocket exploded during a test flight, and a cyberattack took X down, although users regained access fairly quickly.\n\nTesla Bull sounds the alarm on Elon Musk’s leadership\n\nThis week, reports surfaced that TSLA stock’s poor performance has resulted in significant losses for Musk. On Monday, March 10, he lost roughly $4.7 billion for every $10 the stock price declined, amounting to a total loss of $18.8 billion.",

      "title": "Skype to Shut 14 Years After Microsoft’s $8.5 Billion Purchase",
      "text": ">Microsoft Corp. is signaling the end of the line for Skype, the iconic internet calling and chat service it bought almost 14 years ago.\n\n>Once a byword for digital calls that bypassed long-distance charges, Skype was surpassed in recent years by smartphone-native communication apps and Zoom video calls. When Microsoft tried to stretch the Skype brand into the workplace, it lost out to Slack Technologies Inc.\n\n>Microsoft’s response was to start from scratch and build Teams, a chat, voice and video communication service for the workplace, which gained ground as part of its software bundle. The Redmond, Washington-based company will offer Skype users the option of migrating to Teams, which is now its strongest rival to Salesforce Inc.-owned Slack, before it shuts down in May.\n\n>“I’ve been at Microsoft for over 30 years, and there’s a lot of software that we’ve done that was incredibly valuable in its era, and then the next era came and it was the foundation,” said Jeff Teper, a Microsoft president who oversees communications and collaboration tools.\n\n>Microsoft said there were more than 300 million monthly Skype users in 2016, but its daily user count had dwindled to 36 million in 2023. Teams, by comparison, has risen to 320 million monthly users.\n\n>Founded in 2003 by Nordic entrepreneurs, Skype at one time was owned by eBay Inc. and was in the hands of a private equity-led consortium when Steve Ballmer came knocking. The then-Microsoft boss made an uncharacteristically splashy bet on the market leader in online calls, paying $8.5 billion, a 40% premium to Skype’s internal valuation. The May 2011 deal was the largest acquisition by Microsoft at the time, and Skype became a key piece of its strategy for the emerging mobile age.\n\n>It didn’t pan out as Ballmer would have hoped. Upstarts like Telegram, Snapchat, WeChat and WhatsApp solved problems that Skype didn’t. Microsoft’s center of gravity in corporate software ultimately ensnared Skype, which found itself in the Office division and under orders to build tools geared toward a workplace audience as well as a consumer one.\n\n>By the time Slack arrived on the scene, Skype users were complaining that elements of the core experience had started to break down. They cited missed or phantom calls and failures to sync information on different devices. The company worked to improve the service’s reliability, but some loyal users were put off by frequent redesigns, including a short-lived effort to fashion Skype in the mold of Snapchat.\n\n>Microsoft, which also saw its acquisition of Nokia Oyj’s mobile phone business end in failure, is far from alone in encountering rejection by a fickle consumer market. Alphabet Inc.’s Google has cycled through several iterations and brands for its online communications tools, which are today known as Chat and Meet. And this month, Amazon.com Inc. said it would be winding down Chime, the video and voice calling service it tried with little success to sell to corporate clients.\n\n>The Windows maker is shuttering Skype to focus on developing new features for Teams, including artificial intelligence tools, Teper said. The company is working to infuse AI into its product suite, while keeping a lid on spending that isn’t part of that effort. It’s reassigning staff that had worked on Skype to other areas of the business and will not lay anyone off, Teper added.\n\n>At one point, Skype played host to one of Microsoft’s biggest AI demonstrations: a real-time translator. Chief Executive Officer Satya Nadella had nudged researchers to bring the product to market as quickly as possible and heralded it as “magical” in a 2014 demonstration early on in his tenure.\n\n>Teams is “going well and this is a step to double down on it,” Teper said, adding that Microsoft wanted to keep Skype running until it was confident that the Teams version for individual users was fully ready. “It’s the most successful product in its category by far,” he said.\n\n\n\nLink: [https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-02-28/microsoft-msft-to-shut-down-skype-as-zoom-teams-dominate-video-calls](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-02-28/microsoft-msft-to-shut-down-skype-as-zoom-teams-dominate-video-calls)\n\n**My Take:** Thank god. ZM might stand to be a major benefactor from this. MSFT already has Teams that serves as a workplace call tool, but Skype has tried to expand into the workplace forum space (like Slack) and has failed. MSFT is citing this more as a doubling-down on Teams rather than admitting ZM has eaten their lunch here.",

      "title": "Trump aides prep new tariffs on imports worth trillions for ‘Liberation Day’",
      "text": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2025/03/19/trump-tariffs-imports-liberation-day/\n\n> White House aides are preparing to impose new tariffs on most imports on April 2, laying the groundwork for an escalation in global economic hostilities that President Donald Trump has called “Liberation Day.”\n> \n> Through his first two months in office, the president has raised tariffs on roughly $800 billion in imports from China, Mexico and Canada, although estimates vary widely. These tariffs have sent the stock market careening and raised the risks of a U.S. recession, while inviting retaliation against domestic industries by trade partners.\n> \n> Despite the blowback, senior Trump advisers are now publicly pledging to create a new tariff regime that would impose new duties on trade with most countries that trade with the United States. A person familiar with internal planning, speaking on the condition of anonymity to reflect private deliberations, confirmed administration officials are preparing tariffs on “trillions” of dollars in imports.\n> \n> The potential to more than double the scope of Trump’s tariffs has alarmed economists and some congressional Republicans, while other White House allies are concerned about the logistical challenges of a complicated new import tax regime. The precise nature of these new duties has spurred extensive discussions at the highest levels of the administration, with Vice President JD Vance, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, White House aide Peter Navarro and Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent all playing a role in the talks, the person familiar with the plans said.\n> \n> \"The last two months have already hurt American businesses and consumers, but the April 2 deadline seriously could make all of that look like a tempest in a teapot,” said Joseph Politano, an economic policy analyst at Apricitas Economics. “We don’t know exactly what they’re going to do, but from what they’re saying, it sounds functionally like new tariffs on all U.S. imports.”\n> \n> The internal preparations suggest Trump remains unbowed in his push to upend the global trade order, despite deepening unease among allies on Capitol Hill and Wall Street and outright fury from overseas. Trump has said the tariffs are necessary to encourage companies to move production back to the U.S. and force concessions from foreign trading partners, but the fallout has rattled investors and consumers, leading to declines in several key economic indicators.\n> \n> “It’s a liberation day for our country because we’re going to be getting back a lot of the wealth that we so foolishly gave up to other countries, including friend and foe,” Trump told reporters on Monday.\n> \n> Trump has dubbed the next stage of his trade war “reciprocal tariffs.” The president first embraced the idea during his 2024 presidential campaign, arguing that other countries impose far higher trade barriers on U.S. exports than the U.S. government charges on imports. Trump has said the U.S. should match these tariffs with “reciprocal” duties that he believes will force other countries to lower their duties on U.S.-made products.\n\nMore in the article, it's quite a long one\n\nWhat's the play here? Obviously if this goes forward as planned I expect quite the hit to the broader market",

      "title": "Serious question: why do people think Tesla will survive?",
      "text": "This isn't a highly technical question, but I think it is critical all the same. Why do people think Tesla will survive Musk?\n\nTesla is already grossly, wildly inflated beyond any other car company--and yes, it's still a car company--and has spent years failing to deliver FSD. That's starting to become a very, very large problem.\n\nAnd Musk has now deeply and irrevocably alienated some 10-50% of potential investors and customers, some of whom were previously diehard Tesla fans. Those people are never buying a Tesla product. Ever. And you might think they are overreacting, or the salutes where just \"Roman,\" etc., but none of it changes the fact that they are forever boycotting Tesla.\n\nThe only two bullish arguments I can think of are, first, that Musk will create such uniquely amazing technology that everyone will forgive his indiscretions. But even if Musk has some unique, amazing magically technology--which he doesn't--who is going to use it? If Hitler has a monopoly on magic carpets, you don't reluctantly buy one. You just walk. Because if you buy the carpet, everyone else is going to think you're a Nazi. Even if you fire Hitler, no one is going to buy magic carpets from former Nazi carpet merchants, not for a very long time at least. And Tesla doesn't even have a monopoly. It's pretty far behind in some key areas.\n\nThe second argument would be that his affiliation with Trump will forever protect Tesla stock price. But Trump doesn't have a trillion dollars to give Musk, not that he would, and government largess isn't going to get you very far with extremely limited customers and investors.\n\nSo what's the case I'm missing here? Why wouldn't you short the hell out of this stock?\n\nEdit: Thanks for the feedback, this has been productive. The best answer I'm seeing is that Tesla can get rid of Musk once he starts hurting the bottom line. That's a logical line of thought, but I think it is already too late. We shall see when and if it happens.\n\nEdit 2: Friends, you don't have to do this, but please don't think Tesla will just be able to wash all of this with the right PR team and a new CEO. This isn't like Anheuser-Busch having a bad quarter because of a trans model. Tesla and its board apparently let a \\*\\*\\*\\* remain CEO. That's on Tesla, not just Musk. \"Never forget\" means never forget.\n\nEdit 3: For stats: [32% of US car buyers today would not consider a Tesla versus only 17% in 2021](https://amp.cnn.com/cnn/2025/02/17/business/tesla-sales-elon-musk-politics); [Tesla favorability perception drops from 33% in 2018 to 9% by Jan. 2024 to 3% in Jan. 2025](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/tesla-sales-elon-musk-reputation-brand-damage-trump-doge/); [Tesla ranks least favorable among consumers interested in buying an EV](https://insideevs.com/news/749741/tesla-ev-buyers-favorability-rating/?utm_source=chatgpt.com); [Republicans like Musk but 48% don't like EVs](https://www.newsweek.com/republican-change-tune-elon-musk-not-tesla-2029028); [60% of UK car buyers refuse to consider a Tesla](https://cleantechnica.com/2025/01/30/uk-survey-finds-60-of-car-buyers-turned-off-by-elon-musk/); [one in three Dutch Tesla owners want to sell](https://insideevs.com/news/747944/tesla-owners-musk-survey-netherlands/), etc.\n\nThose are brutal numbers. And maybe all of that damage can heal if Musk ever gets ousted. But with tightening competition, there's a point of no return.\n\nEdit 4: Ok, so hard no on the \"but it isn't a car company\" angle. About 88-93% of Tesla's revenue is tied to automotive, meaning  it's actually more of a car company than other car companies, like, say, Volkswagen (15% financial services). Or BYD, which is \\~80% automotive with the rest being electronics, energy, batteries, and semiconductors. So basically its a better Tesla.  And Tesla isn't a tech/AI/robot/home company for the same reason that McDonald's isn't: neither of them sell those products.",

They already released Genie 3, which nobody is even close to yet on world models. I think it will be trivial for them to surpass or at least catch up to OpenAI on the intelligence front for frontier LMM. And they have always been better than other AI companies from a context length and cost perspective. \n\nJust from an AI front, Google is killing it. Their narrow AI is winning Nobel prizes with Alphafold. Discovering algorithms with AlphaEvolve. Advancing robotics. \n\nEven if you don’t think Google will win the AI race to general intelligence or don’t even believe anyone will get there (which is the long term “this stock will absolutely explode if they hit AGI” bet):\n\n\nlet’s just look at valuations:\n\nIf OpenAI is valued at $500b then Deepmind is easily $500b. \n\nIf Netflix is $500b then Youtube is easily $700b. \n\nSearch is easily $1-2T. \n\nNow we are sitting around Googles current $2.5T valuation. \n\nBut there’s more! \n\nHow much is Google Cloud worth?

Short answer is: a lot. \n\nIf Tesla is worth $1T partly off self driving car hype, how much is Waymo worth? Easily $100-200b. \n\nHow much is the Android/Google Play business worth? \n\nHow much is every app that we all use daily worth? (Chrome, Maps, Gmail, Docs, Drive, etc)\n\n\nI know this has been said before but Google is literally a competitor to every single major Tech companies business. They have their hands in every single pot. Whilst, they have historically had issues with marketing and selling their product, their product suite *is good*. They don’t just have a useless competitor like bing is to their search, they actually put up real competition like Google Docs is to Word. \n\nPeople talk about the risk of Google getting broken up but that might be the best thing for investors. The individual parts of Google are so valuable that forcing the market to value them separately might actually unlock value. It wouldn’t be crazy if a breakup made investors richer, not poorer (at least in the short term). The market would finally have to pull its head out of its ass and price these pieces properly. (Edit: This part is hyperbole to make a point, I don’t actually think a breakup would be good for investors)",

Along this thought, Trump posted this on truth social in September 2024 leading up to the most recent election:\n\n>As President, we will continue to focus on research to unlock the medical uses of marijuana to a Schedule 3 drug, and work with Congress to pass common sense laws, including safe banking (sic) for state authorized companies, and supporting states rights to pass marijuana laws, like in Florida, that work so well for their citizens.\n\nDespite those comments, the major US cannabis ETF, $MSOS, dropped by over 50% overnight on election day after Trump won, showing that investors had little to no confidence in any positive reform measures coming from the new administration.\n\nSince late June there has been a notable shift. Mike Tyson, a long time friend of Trump for over 30+ years, has been on a media campaign pushing him to finish the rescheduling process that Biden started. This is something that Trump can do on his own without congress. Along with this in the past 2 weeks, there has been a coordinated messaging campaign amongst MAGA social media influencers with millions of followers saying almost identical messaging about how they support Trump's promise to reschedule cannabis to 3 and how it's a good compromise between keeping criminal penalties but allowing more medical research\n\nJust a few examples from the past week alone:\n\n[https://nitter.net/GuntherEagleman/status/1942586646685249971](https://nitter.net/GuntherEagleman/status/1942586646685249971) (1.4M+ followers)\n\n>As a former police officer, I strongly support President Trump on wanting to reschedule marijuana from schedule I to a schedule III.\n\n>Foreign nations are outpacing the U.S. in medical marijuana research, and we must take the lead. Rescheduling is an effective compromise it maintains illegality while enabling critical studies to advance our understanding and innovation in this field.\n\n[https://nitter.net/DC\\_Draino/status/1942325611672056152](https://nitter.net/DC_Draino/status/1942325611672056152)  (2.2M+ followers)\n\n>Cannabis is absurdly classified alongside heroin as a Schedule I drug and treated more harshly than fentanyl\n\n>Does anyone actually think that makes sense?\n\n>Trump’s campaign promise to move cannabis to Schedule 3 seems like a good compromise\n\n>It maintains criminal penalties while also unlocking critical medicinal research that can save lives\n\n[https://nitter.net/alexbruesewitz/status/1942679927855133017](https://nitter.net/alexbruesewitz/status/1942679927855133017) (Trump Advisor 500k+ followers)\n\n>It's illogical that cannabis is classified as more dangerous than fentanyl. During the campaign President Trump expressed support for rescheduling cannabis to Schedule III, maintaining its illegal status but clearing the path for more robust medical research in our country. Nearly 70% of Republican voters support Trump on this. No brainer!\n\nThere are many more, and even the prohibitionist group, SAM (Smart Approaches to Marijuana) today claimed that rescheduling was coming very soon in a call to action before swiftly deleting their post  [https://nitter.net/tomangell/status/1943760858821406804](https://nitter.net/tomangell/status/1943760858821406804)\n\nWhile nothing is confirmed yet, this aligns with recent chatter that this is all a \"soft launch\" to prepare everyone for cannabis rescheduling\n\n>Based on what we’re hearing from multiple sources, rescheduling is essentially a sure thing that'll be heavily promoted by Trump in the coming weeks, with a soft-launch underway by many of his supporters/advisors. Given past delays, nothing is set in stone, but optimism is high.\n\nFollowing this shift, $MSOS has double bottomed off of all time lows in late June at around the $2.00 level and is up 43% since, yet to this day, $MSOS is still down nearly 60% from it's price on election day and 46% down from the gap down open that followed election night which was never retested. IMO, any confirmation of rescheduling directly from the administration would quickly bring us back to those levels.\n\nIf rescheduling does occur, it would remove the 280e tax burden on US cannabis companies, a tax law that currently prevents them from taking tax deductions which forces them to pay 70%+ tax rates and prevents many from ever being profitable, and would bring their tax rates down to levels comparable with other businesses. It would also mean that the federal government acknowledges that cannabis has actual medical uses which would have a wide array of benefits like more research and federal medical cannabis regulations.\n\nMy favorite US cannabis company stocks are $GTBIF, which is already profitable and growing among a sea of money losers, and to a smaller extent $TCNNF, which has great margins but is playing a tax game where they're not paying 280e now in hopes that it gets removed which is a larger risk but that's reflected in the stock price",

That trailed Wall Street estimates of 103.1 million. A Google search algorithm change caused some “volatility” with user growth in fourth quarter, but the company’s search-related traffic has since recovered in the first quarter, Reddit CEO Steve Huffman said in a letter to shareholders. “What happened wasn’t unusual — referrals from search fluctuate from time to time, and they primarily affect logged-out users,” Huffman wrote. \n\n> “Our teams have navigated numerous algorithm updates and did an excellent job adapting to these latest changes effectively.” Reddit has benefited from Google search updates and internal site improvements that have helped it gain a significant amount of new and returning users, which the social company refers to as logged-out users, over the past year and a half. Reddit has said it is working to convince logged-out users to create accounts as logged-in users, which are more lucrative for its business. Global logged-in DAUq grew 27% year over year to 46.1 million in the quarter while global logged-out DAUq rose 51% to 55.6 million, the company said.\n\n> Despite missing on user number, the company otherwise reported a strong quarter and provided optimistic guidance. Reddit’s sales jumped 71% in the quarter from $250 million a year earlier, the fastest rate of growth for any quarter since 2022. The company said first-quarter sales will be between $360 million to $370 million, ahead of the average analyst estimate of $358 million. Net income almost quadrupled to $71 million or 36 cents a share, from $18.5 million, or breakeven on a per-share basis, a year earlier. Reddit reported adjusted earnings of $154 million in the fourth quarter, topping analysts’ expectations of $128 million.

The job cuts were announced in conjunction with the Detroit automaker announcing the completion of Cruise becoming a wholly-owned subsidiary within GM.\n\nAbout 88% of remaining employees are in engineering or related roles, and impacted employees were given 60 days’ notice, according to the company.\n\nDuring the remainder of their time with Cruise, the affected employees will receive full base pay, as well as eight weeks’ severance. Employees who had been with Cruise for more than three years will receive an additional two weeks’ pay for every additional year spent at Cruise, the company said.\n\n“While not an easy decision, we are focused on combining efforts with General Motors to accelerate autonomy at scale on personal autonomous vehicles,” Cruise said.\n\nGM cited the increasingly competitive robotaxi market, capital allocation priorities and the considerable time and resources necessary to grow the business as reasons for its decision to exit the business.\n\nIn January 2024, a third-party probe into Cruise revealed that culture issues, ineptitude and poor leadership were at the center of regulatory oversights and coverup concerns that had plagued the company since October of that year.\n\nThe report addressed, in part, controversy that had swirled around Cruise since an Oct. 2, 2024, accident in which a pedestrian in San Francisco was dragged 20 feet by a Cruise robotaxi after being struck by a separate vehicle. Results of the investigation, which reviewed whether Cruise representatives misled investigators or members of the media in discussing the incident, were published months later in a 105-page report.\n\nSource: https://www.cnbc.com/2025/02/04/gm-cuts-50percent-of-cruise-staff-after-ending-robotaxi-business.html",

The permitting process is now centralized in Interior Secretary Doug Burgum’s office.\n> \n> Renewable companies fear that projects will no longer receive permits that were once normal course of business. The president’s comments Wednesday will likely heighten those concerns.\n> \n> Trump blamed renewables for rising electricity prices in the U.S. Prices have risen on the nation’s largest grid, PJM Interconnection, as rapidly growing demand from data centers and other industries faces a tight power supply as resources such as coal plants are retired.\n> \n> PJM Interconnection saw prices for new power capacity rise 22% compared to last year in an auction held last month. PJM covers 13 states across the Mid-Atlantic and parts of the Midwest and South.\n> \n> But solar and battery storage are the power sources that can ease the supply-and-demand gap the quickest, as they make up an overwhelming majority of the projects in line to connect to the grid, according to data from Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory.\n> \n> Trump has launched a sweeping attack on renewables since taking office. His One Big Beautiful Bill Act terminates the investment and production tax credits for wind and solar by the end of 2027. Those credits have played a key role in the expansion of renewable energy in the U.S.\n> \n> The president’s steel and copper tariffs have also increased the costs of solar and wind projects, renewable companies say.\n> \n> The U.S. Department of Agriculture on Tuesday ended its support for solar on farmland.\n\nWhat companies do you think will be negatively impacted beyond the obvious? $RUN and $FSLR are both down quite a bit today (-7.82% and -6.51% respectively at the time of posting)\n\nObviously right now the US power grid needs more power to feed the AI datacenter demand growth and nuclear isn't some magic solution that can be realistically applied nationwide, so I expect this to have downstream impacts beyond just the renewable infrastructure providers",

You frequently hear about Google's reliance on Search in investing subs across reddit but it's nowhere near 98% of their revenue ($46.6b of $47.5b) and yet I don't hear much about Meta's reliance. Is advertising really that sticky of a business model? How would Meta even 'win' AI by making Ads that much more effective?",

      "text": "Alphabet reported Thursday that Waymo, its autonomous vehicle unit, is now delivering more than 250,000 paid robotaxi rides per week in the U.S.\n\nCEO Sundar Pichai said Waymo has options in terms of “business models across geographies,” and the robotaxi company is building partnerships with ride-hailing app Uber, automakers and operations and maintenance businesses that tend to its vehicle fleets.\n\n“We can’t possibly do it all ourselves,” said Pichai on a call with analysts for Alphabet’s first-quarter earnings. \n\nPichai noted that Waymo has not entirely defined its long-term business model, and there is “future optionality around personal ownership” of vehicles equipped with Waymo’s self-driving technology. The company is also exploring the ways it can scale up its operations, he said.\n\nThe 250,000 paid rides per week are up from 200,000 in February, before Waymo opened in Austin and expanded in the San Francisco Bay Area in March. \n\nWaymo, which is part of Alphabet’s Other Bets segment, is already running its commercial, driverless ride-hailing services in the San Francisco, Los Angeles, Phoenix and Austin regions.\n\nEarlier this month, Waymo and its partner Uber, began allowing interested riders to sign up to try the robotaxi service in Atlanta when it opens this summer. \n\nThe early pioneer in self-driving technology, Waymo has managed to beat Elon Musk-led Tesla and a myriad of now-defunct autonomous vehicle startups to the U.S. market.\n\nTesla is promising that it will be able to turn its Model Y SUVs into robotaxis by the end of June for a driverless ride-hailing service it plans to launch in Austin.\n\nAfter about a decade of promises and missed deadlines, Tesla still does not offer a vehicle that’s safe to use without a human at the wheel ready to steer or brake at all times.\n\nMusk criticized Waymo’s approach to driverless tech on his company’s first-quarter earnings call on Tuesday. Musk said Waymo autonomous vehicles are “very expensive” and made in only “low volume.” Tesla’s partially automated driving systems rely mostly on cameras to navigate, while Waymo’s driverless systems rely on lidar technology, other sensors and cameras.\n\nWould-be competitors to Waymo also include Amazon-owned Zoox, Mobileye, May Mobility and international autonomous vehicle companies such as WeRide and Baidu’s Apollo Go.\n\nSource: [https://www.cnbc.com/2025/04/24/waymo-reports-250000-paid-robotaxi-rides-per-week-in-us.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/04/24/waymo-reports-250000-paid-robotaxi-rides-per-week-in-us.html)",

Reddit Answers will expand globally and the company will be “integrating it more deeply into the core search experience, and making search a central feature across Reddit,” Huffman wrote in the letter. Huffman did not specify when exactly Reddit Answers will expand.\n\n“Recently, we celebrated Reddit’s 20th year, and I’ve never been more excited about our business and potential than I am today,” Huffman wrote. “The internet is evolving, and our role as a community-powered platform for human connection is only becoming more critical.”\n\nHuffman said that in order to focus on the “most pressing needs,” Reddit is “deprioritizing a few initiatives,” including its “work on the user economy.” Reddit’s initial 2024 IPO prospectus detailed the company’s efforts to build a user economy business, which could include games and online marketplaces akin to Roblox and Facebook Marketplace.\n\nSource: [https://www.cnbc.com/2025/07/31/reddit-rddt-q2-2025.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/07/31/reddit-rddt-q2-2025.html)",

      "text": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) -U.S. President Donald Trump said on Saturday that Walmart should \"eat the tariffs\" instead of blaming duties imposed by his administration on imported goods for the retailer's increased prices.\n\nHis comments were in response to the world's largest retailer saying this week it would have to start raising prices later this month due to high tariffs.\n\n\"Walmart should STOP trying to blame Tariffs as the reason for raising prices throughout the chain. Walmart made BILLIONS OF DOLLARS last year, far more than expected,\" Trump said in a social media post.\n\n\"Between Walmart and China they should, as is said, 'EAT THE TARIFFS,' and not charge valued customers ANYTHING.\"\n\nA representative of Walmart could not be immediately reached for comment.\n\nWalmart CEO Doug McMillon said on Thursday the retailer could not absorb all the tariff costs because of narrow retail margins. Even so, he said, the company was committed to ensuring that tariff-related costs on general merchandise - which primarily comes from China - would not drive food prices higher.\n\nMany U.S. companies have either slashed or pulled their full-year expectations in the wake of friction between the U.S. and its trading partners, particularly China, as consumers curtail spending.\n\nAs a bellwether of U.S. consumer health, Walmart's explicit statement about the impact of tariffs is a signpost for how the trade war is affecting the retail sector. Walmart is noted for its ability to manage costs more aggressively than other companies to keep prices low.\n\nEvery week, some 255 million people shop in its stores or place orders online around the world, and 90% of the U.S. population lives within 10 miles (16 km) of a Walmart.\n\nWalmart's disclosure comes about three weeks after a published report that Amazon planned to disclose how much Trump-imposed tariffs were adding to the costs of its products. The White House blasted Amazon over the report, which the company promptly denied.\n\nhttps://finance.yahoo.com/news/trump-tells-walmart-eat-tariffs-144516437.html",

      "text": "Canada is imposing it’s own 25 per cent tariffs on $155 billion worth of U.S. goods after U.S. President Donald Trump slapped Canada with 25 per cent tariffs on all goods and 10 per cent tariffs on oil, natural gas and electricity.\n\nPrime Minister Justin Trudeau says the tariffs will take effect on $30 billion worth of goods starting Tuesday with a further $125 billion worth of products being taxed 21 days later.\n\nTrudeau elected to go ahead with retaliatory tariffs even though Trump’s order includes a mechanism to escalate the rates if Canada retaliates against the U.S.\n\nCanada will also look at how to limit export of rare minerals to the US which are crucial for US tech and car companies like Tesla.\n\n**TLDR: Trade war is on!

The Austin, Texas-based company does not have a media relations office.\n\nHinton is seeking compensatory and punitive damages for Tesla drivers in California, potentially encompassing more than 1 million vehicles, court papers show.\n\nTesla moved his lawsuit this month to Los Angeles federal court from a state court in that city.\n\nThe automaker has also faced litigation accusing it of inflating vehicle driving ranges.\n\nIn March 2024, a federal judge in Oakland, California said drivers in that case must pursue their claims in individual arbitrations, not a class action.\n\nThe case is Hinton v Tesla Inc et al, U.S. District Court, Central District of California, No. 25-02877.",

And, you know, I was referring to legal analysis that we had back then. And if there's new legal analysis that says something different, then we need to rethink our response,\" Hassett said.\n\nIt was not immediately clear what new legal analysis he was referencing, but a case over whether Trump overstepped his authority in firing two Democrats from federal labor boards now pending at the Supreme Court is being closely watched as a potential precedent for whether Trump could remove Powell.\n\nPowell has said that the law would not allow his removal, that he would not leave if asked to by Trump, and that he intends to serve through the end of his term in May 2026. Powell also said this week he does not think the current case on appeal at the U.S. high court will apply to the Fed.",

Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent wants America’s allies to make deals quickly and then confront Beijing as a united front,.” But China’s not exactly rattled. After years of prepping since the last Trump-era tariff throwdown, it’s less reliant on U.S. goods and boasts the world’s biggest standing army, just in case negotiations need... backup.\n\nPresident Xi is not lifting Trump's calls like it's telemarketing call, demanding the U.S. drop its tariffs first while positioning China as the rule-abiding adult in the room. Chinese officials argue their resistance is helping other countries too—Wu Xinbo of Fudan University even suggested allies owe China a thank-you card for their tariff holiday. Meanwhile, Beijing is calling the U.S. a trade bully in everything from UN speeches to dramatic, subtitled videos invoking the ghost of Toshiba. Wang Yi has rallied BRICS nations to stand firm, warning that “bowing to a bully is like drinking poison”—a quote that sounds more kung-fu movie than policy memo. In this geopolitical soap opera, everyone’s picking sides, and the popcorn’s practically writing itself.\n\n  \nsource: [https://finance.yahoo.com/news/xi-trying-turn-world-against-103001129.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/xi-trying-turn-world-against-103001129.html)",

Meanwhile, the S&P 500 (GSPC) sank nearly 6%, as the broad-based benchmark capped its worst week since 2020. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (IXIC) dropped 5.8% to close in bear market territory.\n\nThe major averages added to Thursday's $2.5 trillion wipeout after China said it will impose additional tariffs of 34% on all US products from April 10 — matching the extra 34% duties imposed by Trump on Wednesday.\n\n\nThat ramped up investor worries that countries are more likely to retaliate than negotiate, leading to a protracted global trade war.\n\nInvestors flocked to government bonds as the 10-year Treasury (TNX) yield fell to 3.9%, nearing its lowest levels since October.\n\nEconomists are warning that with tariffs as-is, the risk of a US recession is rising. The monthly jobs report, unusually overshadowed Friday, showed a labor market that held steady ahead of Trump's biggest tariffs. The US added 228,000 jobs in March, beating estimates, though the unemployment rate ticked up to 4.2%.\n\nMeanwhile, Federal Reserve Chair Powell for the first time addressed the reality of the tariffs, saying they were \"higher than anticipated.\" He said it is \"too soon to say\" what the proper rate path should be. Traders have ramped up bets on interest rate cuts this year to five, as the Fed is expected to set its efforts to cool inflation aside to tackle the bigger risk of economic slowdown.\n\nTrump, posting on Truth Social on Friday, added to fears by saying that his policies \"will never change\" and warning that China \"played it wrong.\"\n\nhttps://finance.yahoo.com/news/live/stock-market-today-dow-plunges-2200-points-nasdaq-enters-bear-market-as-trump-tariffs-spark-worst-meltdown-since-2020-200042876.html",

      "text": "On most other finance subs, people are still recommending to new investors to pile into VOO. I can only presume they're not taking the current threats from Trump seriously.\n\nTo me, it seems like there are no checks and balances right now and Trump will continue getting his way until at the very least midterms. And that's assuming the midterms even happen in a free and fair way.\n\nSo if Trump does basically ruin the Fed, and does stay around for longer than his term (which I'm seeing as very likely right now), what's the case for \"time in the market beats timing the market\" ? Or do you just not think those things are even possible?  I want to understand the mindset, because it seems incredibly irresponsible to not even acknowledge even a remote risk of this happening right now.\n\n[Edit] Ultimately this seems to mostly just come down to optimism vs pessimism and what you think Trump is going to do. Bogleheads don't see the risk of Trump sticking around for more than 4 years or else are just otherwise wishfully thinking based on past assumptions (e.g. it's always gone up at X rate before so will continue going up at X rate).",

      "text": "As Tesla stock has fallen in recent weeks, members of the board and an executive at Elon Musk's company have been selling off millions of dollars in stock, according to filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.\n\nTogether, four top officers at the company have offloaded over $100 million in shares since early February.\n\nLast week, longtime Musk ally James Murdoch -- the estranged son of Fox boss Rupert Murdoch and a board member since 2017 -- became the latest to do so, exercising a stock option and selling shares worth approximately $13 million, according to an SEC filing. The sale took place on March 10, coinciding with the stock's largest single-day decline in five years.\n\nAccording to one filing, the shares were sold \"to cover the exercise price relating to the exercise of stock options to purchase 531,787 shares, which are scheduled to expire in 2025.\"\n\nElon Musk's brother, Kimbal Musk, who also sits on the board, unloaded 75,000 shares worth approximately $27 million last month, according to a filing.\n\nThe chairman of the board, Robyn Denholm, has offloaded more than $75 million dollars worth of shares in two transactions in the past five weeks, federal filings show. The selloffs made by Denholm came as part of a predetermined sales plan.\n\nA number of board members and executives made similar moves in November and December. But the recent sales come at a tumultuous time for Tesla, with the stock falling nearly 50% from a peak in mid-December. The company's shares have suffered most of those losses since President Donald Trump took office and Musk began his controversial governmental cost-cutting efforts as the head of the newly created Department of Government Efficiency.\n\n\"Whenever insiders, including directors, are selling shares, it's not a positive signal,\" Jay Ritter, a professor of finance at the University of Florida, told ABC News.\n\nHowever, Ritter added, an exception applies to the predetermined sales plan adopted by Denholm in July 2024, which marks a routine effort to avoid the perception an officer unloaded shares based on inside information.\n\n\"Filing a plan months ago to sell some of those shares over time is common,\" Ritter said.\n\nTesla did not immediately respond to ABC News' request for comment.\n\nSeth Goldstein, an analyst at research firm Morningstar who studies the electric vehicle industry, said some of the stock sales may owe to personal financial choices made by individual officers.\n\n\"While a sale doesn't necessarily mean an executive or board member feels negatively about a company's outlook, it could mean they think the stock is at a fair price or even overvalued,\" Goldstein said.\n\nThe share selloffs made by board members and executives totaled about $118 million, but the transactions often came after the individuals exercised stock options, the costs of which totaled about $16 million. The officers ended up with a profit of just over $100 million.\n\nABC News previously reported on concerns from shareholders and pension funds, some of whom have called on Musk to turn his attention back from slashing government spending to running his car company.\n\nTesla Chief Financial officer Vaibhav Taneja also sold off shares totaling more than $5 million over recent weeks. Some of those transactions came as part of predetermined sales plans, but a transaction earlier this month did not stem from a scheduled sale.\n\nSource: https://abcnews.go.com/Business/tesla-board-members-executive-sell-off-100-million/story?id=119889047",

KILL the BILL,\" Musk posted on X on Wednesday.\n\nMusk added, \"If the massive deficit spending continues, there will only be money for interest payments and nothing else!\"\n\nThe vocal criticism is irking Trump, the Wall Street Journal reported, with a senior official claiming that White House advisors were \"caught off guard\" by Musk's latest broadsides.\n\nTesla stock fell solidly on Wednesday and extended those losses in premarket trading on Thursday, down as much as 3%.\n\nThe comments come after the one-time leader of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) waded earnestly into the debate over the bill this week, angrily posting Tuesday that it was a \"disgusting abomination.\"\n\n\"I'm sorry, but I just can't stand it anymore. This massive, outrageous, pork-filled Congressional spending bill is a disgusting abomination,\" he said.\n\n\"Shame on those\" who voted for it in the House, Musk added.\n\nBloomberg reported that Musk may also be driven by the fact that the federal EV tax credit is being phased out by the bill, as he fought hard to keep it in place as a key driver for Tesla's business.\n\nMusk's barrage comes as the bill faces an uncertain future in the Senate, and a Congressional Budget Office estimation of its impact on the deficit adds fuel to Musk's line of argument.\n\nThe nonpartisan office projected the House-passed version of the bill would add $2.4 trillion to deficits over the next 10 years.\n\nThe formerly Musk-led DOGE itself has been criticized for not producing the budgetary cuts Musk touted it could find, and the cuts it has produced have been deeply unpopular.\n\nMusk's closeness to the Trump administration had been seen as a boon for Tesla, given its business with SpaceX and NASA and the regulatory levers the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration could pull in getting autonomous driving rules in place for Tesla's robotaxi testing.\n\nRead more: How to avoid the sticker shock on Tesla car insurance\n\nBut demand weakness in the EU and recent protests at US Tesla showrooms have followed Musk's controversial foray into politics, causing some Tesla owners to become alienated by Musk, specifically by his right-leaning tendencies, DOGE, and outward support of President Trump.\n\nTesla's big robotaxi test is slated for June 12 in Austin. Much of the company's value is tied to whether it can fully unlock autonomous driving for robotaxi purposes and individual owners.\n\nMeanwhile, Alphabet's (GOOG, GOOGL) Waymo continues to plow ahead and is essentially the leader in the space, accumulating 250,000 robotaxi trips per week.",

      "text": "I'm currently building a long-term investment portfolio with around $15,500 in USD. My approach is to combine strong exposure to tech and innovation with some international diversification. I've selected individual stocks like NVIDIA(15%) and AMD(10%) to capture growth in the AI and semiconductor space, and I've included TSLA(10%) as a way to gain exposure to the EV and energy transition sectors—though I'm open to switching that position for aerospace and defense in the future, depending on market conditions.\n\nTo complement those, I'm using the Invesco Nasdaq 100 ETF (15%) for broader exposure to leading U.S. tech companies. I've also added the Franklin FTSE India ETF (10%) to capture long-term growth potential in emerging markets, particularly India. In addition, I've chosen a cybersecurity ETF (RIZE CYBR) (10%) to position myself in a sector that's increasingly critical, and I’ve added a biotech ETF along with Moderna(15%)to diversify into healthcare innovation.\n\nBesides this USD portfolio, I hold 10,000 euros in the Vanguard Global Stock Index Fund. I plan to add 75 euros monthly to this fund, while saving another 75 euros each month as cash on the side, to take advantage of opportunities within my main portfolio or strengthen existing positions when there are dips.\n\nLastly, I’m keeping around 35,000 euros in cash, which I plan to hold in a high-interest savings account or similar low-risk vehicle, with full liquidity in case I decide to make a property purchase in the near future.\n\nThis mix allows me to stay invested in sectors I believe in, while maintaining flexibility and liquidity for both opportunities and personal needs. Open to thoughts or suggestions on how to improve it.\n\n\\*Edit: \n\nMy current main questions:\n\n1. Can all this markets go up during 4 and a half years but suddenly on the 5th year go down? What's the point then holding long term? \n\n2. The longer you hold, the less a \"break down\" can affect your portfolio? For example: A general 40% down will make you lose money on year 5 but you will be \"strong enough\" at year 10 to still being positive eventhough the breakdown? \n\n3. I know \"time in the market > timing in the market\" but do you think it is a good week/month to enter? Nvidia for example is super high right now. \n\n4. If you hold for 10 years, but there's a big loss on year 10. Does that mean all those 9 years have been useless and you gotta start again? \n\n  \nSorry if the questions are too noob and thankyou for the feedback.",

The dust-up threatened to upend trade relations even as Trump expressed hope Friday he will speak with Chinese President Xi Jinping, with White House economic adviser Kevin Hassett expecting a call to take place this week.\n\nBeijing accused the US of unilaterally introducing new discriminatory restrictions, including new guidelines on AI chip export controls, curbs on chip design software sales to China and the revocation of Chinese student visas.\n\n“If the US insists on its own way and continues to damage China’s interests, China will continue to take resolute and forceful measures to safeguard its legitimate rights and interests,” the ministry said. It also said the US violated the consensus reached between Trump and Xi on Jan. 17, when they last spoke, without elaborating.\n\nAsian shares dropped along with US stock-index futures, with a gauge of Chinese stocks traded in Hong Kong falling as much as 2.9%, the most in nearly two months.\n\nTensions between the world’s largest economies are ratcheting up again after the tariff thaw in May. The Trump administration last week said it planned to start revoking visas for Chinese students while moving to restrict the sale of chip design software to China. They have also barred the export of critical US jet engine parts and technology to China, the New York Times reported.\n\nBeyond strains in economic ties, geopolitical friction is also growing. China’s Foreign Ministry over the weekend protested US Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth’s assertion at a gathering of military chiefs that China poses an imminent threat to Taiwan, a self-ruled island claimed by Beijing.\n\nTrump didn’t elaborate when he accused Beijing of violating the tariff truce on Friday, but US Trade Representative Jamieson Greer complained that China had not sped exports of critical minerals needed for cutting-edge electronics.\n\nChina has been loosening the grip on its exports of rare earths over the past week at a pace that’s “slower than industry would like,” said Michael Hart, president of the American Chamber of Commerce in China.\n\nIn the statement, the Commerce Ministry said it “resolutely rejects” the US accusations and that the country has strictly and sincerely implemented the consensus.\n\nTrump’s comments came a day after US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said talks with China on trade had stalled and suggested that a call between Trump and Xi might be necessary to break the deadlock.\n\nThe US president “is going to have a wonderful conversation about the trade negotiations this week with President Xi,” Hassett, director of the White House National Economic Council, said Sunday on ABC’s This Week. “That’s our expectation.”\n\nTrump has signaled a wish to have a call with his Chinese counterpart as early as February and later said he was willing to travel to the Asian nation to meet with Xi, although no such engagement has been scheduled so far.",

In a letter dated August 15, Federal Housing Finance Agency director Bill Pulte urged the Justice Department to investigate a pair of mortgages taken out in recent years by Fed Governor Lisa Cook. On Wednesday, Trump referenced those allegations on his social media platform, writing that “Cook must resign, now!!!” Pulte, a vocal Trump ally, has frequently criticized the Fed and its leader, Chair Jerome Powell, for not lowering rates. He also called for closer scrutiny of the central bank’s costly refurbishment of its Washington, DC, headquarters.\n\n> The new focus on Cook is an expansion of the Trump administration’s intense pressure campaign against the Fed, specifically central bankers who aren’t perceived as allies of the president. Trump is still loudly demanding the Fed lower interest rates, continuing to bash Powell with the moniker “Too Late.” After raising rates in recent years to fight pandemic inflation that reached 40-year highs in 2022, the central bank started to cut its benchmark lending rate last fall. While inflation earlier this year hovered close to the bank’s target rate of 2%, central bankers have paused further rate cuts while they ascertain the economic impact of Trump’s tariffs.",

      "title": "CMV: Trump's tariffs are political weapons intentionally designed to create leverage over nearly every country, industry, and company.",
      "text": "I've seen a lot of discussion here about why Trump is doing these tariffs. For example, I've seen:    \n\n1. He is doing this to bring manufacturing back to the U.S.A.  \n2. He is doing this to \"punish\" countries for their tariffs and trade imbalances on and with the U.S.A.   \n3. He doesn't know what he's doing, and is dumb and/or short-sighted.  \n  \nWhile I see where the logic for these explanations is coming from, I think there is a very real chance that the true explanation is that **Trump's tariffs are a political weapon, designed to give him leverage over nearly every country, industry, and company.** By instituting tariffs, rather than just threatening them, now the clock is ticking: countries, industries, and companies are frantically trying to figure out what to do.     \n  \nThink about it: first, Trump went after universities, threatening to withhold funding unless they caved to his demands about diversity and pro-Palestinian protestors. This has already forced major institutions, like Columbia, to bend the knee to him.  \n  \nThen, Trump went after big law firms and their clients, threatening through Executive Orders to cut off their access and intimidate them. This has already resulted in major law firms (Paul Weiss and Skadden) to forge \"settlements\" to do free pro bono work to the President's bidding, though luckily some of these firms (Perkins Coie) have had the integrity to fight back and sue.   \n  \nFollowing this logic, it follows that Trump with his tariffs doesn't legitimately believe what he is telling the public about his intentions. Far more likely, I think, that he is using these tariffs to force pledges of loyalty, concessions, and \"deals\" with countries, industries, and companies. \n\nThis is not my original idea, to be fair; I heard it from U.S. Senator Chris Murphy (D - Connecticut). He has pointed out that democratically-elected leaders turned despot/authoritarian/fascist will use tools like this to maintain power. Trump knows he cannot be reelected due to term limits, so how does he hold on to power? Like this. It is a slippery slope towards becoming a dictator. \n \nI can only hope that some countries/industries/companies see through this B.S. and fight back, but it is likely that many—now that their finances are being hurt—will bend the knee. \n\nGoing back to the common explanations for Trump's tariffs, here are my counterarguments:    \n\n1. If this was intended to bring manufacturing back to the U.S.A., that doesn't make a lot of sense. Companies aren't just going to upend decades of supply chains to invest billions into a country whose people don't want a lot of dirty, hard-work manufacturing jobs, especially when everything could (likely) revert back when Trump is out of office in 4 years.   \n2. I won't pretend to be an economist, but a big reason for the trade imbalances is because Americans like buying stuff from XYZ countries. That isn't those countries' fault, necessarily. And moreover, the chart Trump showed at the White House Rose Garden this week did not accurately reflect the actual tariff rates that foreign countries place on the U.S.A—it included trade imbalances, which makes zero sense and is highly misleading, if not an outright lie.   \n3. Trump may appear dumb, but he has scores of well-planned sycophants from groups like the Heritage Foundation (Project 2025 authors) that are advising him. It is highly unlikely that they planned so much of his presidency, but the tariffs themselves were an afterthought.   \n  \nNow granted, we have heard rumors that the tariffs were hastily put together, and that Trump's team may have used ChatGPT to write some of the policy out. At first, this appears to support explanation no. 3. However, I think the hasty nature of these tariff policies actually supports the idea that they are purely intended as political weapons: it doesn't matter what exactly the tariffs are, what matters is creating immediate leverage.   \n  \nCurious for the community's thoughts. \n\nDisclosure: I have divested heavily from the U.S. markets and gone into EU stocks, especially defense. I am also short TSLA, DJT, and Air Canada.\n\n**EDIT:** As seeming proof of this theory, American journalist Kara Swisher [reported on BlueSky today](https://bsky.app/profile/karaswisher.bsky.social/post/3llynh6uoyk2z) that \"Several sources tell me a passel of high profile tech and also finance leaders is making a trip to Mar-a-Lago to read Trump the riot act — um talk common sense — to him on the tariffs. Their million dollar donations to the inauguration is turning into billions in losses.\"  \n  \nTranslation, I think: executives are bending over backwards to try and get concessions from Trump. This shows he has leverage over them already.",

Judge Mehta found the tech giant guilty of monopolizing the search engine market — specifically, the markets for \"general search\" and \"general search text\" ads, which are ones that appear at the top of the search results page, Yahoo Finance’s Alexis Keenan reported.\n\nLast Friday, Google and the Department of Justice wrapped up closing arguments in the remedies phase of the case. The Department of Justice argued that Mehta should force Google to divest its web browser, Chrome, and share its search data with rivals as well as ban its exclusivity agreements that secure Google as the default search engine on mobile devices and browsers, Keenan and Yahoo Finance’s Dan Howley reported.\n\nBarclays analyst Ross Sandler wrote in a Monday note that “the probability of a Chrome divestiture, while low, has increased in our view,” following the closing arguments, adding that “the most likely candidates” to buy Chrome would be “well funded AI companies like OpenAI, Anthropic or perhaps Perplexity.”\n\nSandler said such an outcome would be “a major blow” to Google, given that Chrome has 4 billion users and represents 35% of Google’s search revenue.\n\n“This would be a major development, a black swan event for GOOGL shares,” he said. “Shares would obviously trade off significantly if this were to play out as no investors we speak to are thinking this remedy plays out.”\n\nSandler said a Chrome divestiture would not only cause Alphabet stock to tumble as much as 25% but would also result in a potential 30% hit to Alphabet’s earnings per share.\n\n“The reality is we don't know what the court is going to decide on remedies, we listened to the entire day of closing arguments and there were certainly times where we felt a lot worse than we did prior, and other times where we felt better (in terms of GOOGL stock price impact),” Sandler said. He holds an Overweight rating on the stock.\n\nMehta is expected to decide on a remedy in the case — and the fate of Google’s search empire — in August. Google said Saturday that it will appeal the case.\n\nSeparately on Monday, Alphabet said it agreed to spend $500 million to change its compliance structure in order to settle a case with shareholders accusing the company of antitrust violations.\n\nAlphabet stock fell 1.5% on Monday, and shares are down 10.6% year to date.",

Two analysts polled by LSEG were expecting revenue of $895.7 million.\n\nIts net income stood at $14.8 million, or 4 cents per share, compared with a loss of $2.8 million, or 1 cent per share, a year earlier. This was helped by a 16% fall in the company's selling and administrative expenses in the quarter.\n\nSource: https://finance.yahoo.com/news/videogame-retailer-gamestop-misses-quarterly-200912619.html",

Boeing’s latest offer upped pay hikes to 30% from 25% in the prior offer, doubled a signing bonus to $6,000, and increased 401(k) contributions, among other things.\n\n\"The survey results from yesterday were overwhelmingly clear, almost as loud as the first offer: members are not interested in the company's latest offer that was sent through the media,\" IAM said in a statement late Tuesday night. \"Many comments expressed that the offer was inadequate and the company's decision to bypass the Union was viewed as disrespectful.\"\n\nEarlier, IAM said it contacted Boeing to engage in “direct talks” after the offer, which the company refused. Therefore, the union said it would not be holding a vote on the proposal.\n\nNevertheless, Boeing’s insistence on going directly to union members speaks to the difficulty the company is in, said Anita Mendiratta, an aviation and tourism expert at consulting firm AM&A.\n\nIAM union workers also know they have public support behind them, as big labor has seen its popularity grow, while Boeing has seen its standing suffer. The union is in a “very strong position,” Mendiratta said, as the strike not only puts financial pressure on Boeing but also hurts Boeing on a “reputational level” too.\n\nWith the strike hitting Boeing’s bottom line by as much as $1.8 billion thus far, the plane maker needs to make a deal soon. Boeing shares are already down an astounding 40% year to date.\n\nShareholders hope Boeing and new CEO Kelly Ortberg can make a deal and reverse the cash drain by the time the plane maker is expected to report third quarter earnings at the end of October.\n\n“Boeing is already having to do some significant re-examination of the financials of the organization. To put this in context, every single day that Boeing is on strike, they’re losing between $100 million and $150 million,” Mendiratta said to Yahoo Finance.\n\nWithout union workers based in Boeing’s Renton, Wash., assembly facility, Boeing cannot deliver its 737 Max jets, which are the company’s cash cow. Boeing is still able to deliver its 787 Dreamliner out of its non-union South Carolina facility; however, those jets are limited in number. In the second quarter, Boeing delivered 70 737 Max jets, but only nine of the larger Dreamliners.\n\nMendiratta, who is also special adviser to the UN Tourism Secretary-General, said disruptions in Boeing not only hurt the American plane maker but also the aviation industry as a whole.\n\n“It’s not just Boeing that’s in trouble — the entire global aviation system is in trouble because it relies on Boeing for 4 in 10 commercial aircraft as well as what it delivers in its other divisions,” Mendiratta said. “When there is a delay in the delivery of aircraft, and there are many airlines that are having delays, it means that the entire global aviation ecosystem is going to suffer, as is the global traveling public.”\n\nMendiratta doesn’t see the union bending here, at least not in the short term. Boeing put workers in a difficult position that led them to strike in the first place, she said, and emotions are running high following Boeing’s latest move to circumvent IAM leadership.\n\nIAM union workers also know they have public support behind them, as big labor has seen its popularity grow, while Boeing has seen its standing suffer. The union is in a “very strong position,” Mendiratta said, as the strike not only puts financial pressure on Boeing but also hurts Boeing on a “reputational level” too.\n\nWith the strike hitting Boeing’s bottom line by as much as $1.8 billion thus far, the plane maker needs to make a deal soon. Boeing shares are already down an astounding 40% year to date.\n\nShareholders hope Boeing and new CEO Kelly Ortberg can make a deal and reverse the cash drain by the time the plane maker is expected to report third quarter earnings at the end of October.\n\nhttps://finance.yahoo.com/news/boeing-losing-100-million-to-150-million-a-day-as-union-strike-rolls-on-130406155.html?guccounter=1&guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&guce_referrer_sig=AQAAANAWQmHD0UzqhKnTVDPsFleXumbn6G1xmOLNZ1qIpyvkppimRiyy_gjOLPw696DvbAlA3BFaU-DOlU9IwEQJpP0atQzCVt4lS1sxV8XLSzzpstngGWXUTGlg_Bo8vCePljmQbLBpTO6RRHhZIbX_vL4VeUmcoErS1aaCJzzp8ds6",

      "text": "Hello Fellow Apes (I use this term affectionately—don’t take it too seriously),\n\nI want to start by saying a huge thank you for all the kind words, thoughtful comments, insightful DMs, and support following my previous post. Honestly—holy shit—I didn’t expect that post to blow up the way it did.\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1jheaxd/tesla\\_short\\_thesis\\_and\\_the\\_us\\_market\\_house\\_of/](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1jheaxd/tesla_short_thesis_and_the_us_market_house_of/)\n\nAs of the time I’m writing this, Part 1 has pulled in some pretty insane numbers:\n\n* 542,000 views\n* 774 upvotes\n* 356 comments\n* 817 shares\n\nThose are absolutely bonkers, and I’m genuinely grateful for the encouragement and engagement. I’ve been a long-time lurker on this subreddit, learning quietly from many of you over the years. I never imagined that something I’d write would get this kind of traction. But some of the comments in that thread raised important questions and valid counterpoints—so I wanted to follow up with a deeper response.\n\nNow, for those asking for charts, crayons, or simplified pictures—just a heads-up: this sub doesn’t support image uploads. So if you're looking for visual aids, you’ll need to do a bit of homework and look up the references and data I mention here. Trust me, it’s worth your time.\n\nAlso, there will be no TL;DR at the end of this post. If you’re someone who can’t—or won’t—read through a detailed explanation, then this probably isn’t for you. The economy, and the factors that influence how a stock moves, are complex. If you're not willing to engage with that complexity, you’re setting yourself up to get burned. So, with that said, let’s dive in.\n\nu/[Worth-Initiative7840](https://www.reddit.com/user/Worth-Initiative7840/) wrote \"You don’t need the analysis bruv, 70% of Teslas profits last year were selling credits and interest on cash on hand….they don’t make any money selling cars … the hype lie has been AI and new growth businesses in the company but that’s PT Barnum three card Monty bs - current fundamentals take out all the bs - it’s Ford.\"\n\nThis comment caught me by surprise because the numbers were totally made up. I have to go back and do some research because what he said wasn't true at all. In the fourth quarter of 2024, Tesla's net income was $2.31 billion on revenues of $25.7 billion. During this period, the company earned $692 million from selling automotive regulatory credits. This revenue from regulatory credits represents approximately 30% of Tesla's net income for the quarter.\n\n[https://www.statista.com/statistics/1553187/revenue-of-tesla-regulatory-credits-by-quarter/](https://www.statista.com/statistics/1553187/revenue-of-tesla-regulatory-credits-by-quarter/)\n\nTesla reported a 47% increase in 2024, totaling $1.57 billion for the year, up from $1.07 billion in 2023. While the exact figure for Q4 2024 isn't specified, if we assume the increase was evenly distributed, the quarterly interest income would be around $392.5 million. This would account for approximately 17% of the quarter's net income. Combining both regulatory credits and estimated interest income, these sources contributed approximately 47% of Tesla's net income in Q4 2024. The 70% is false information.\n\n[https://www.captide.co/insights/tesla-q4-2024](https://www.captide.co/insights/tesla-q4-2024)\n\nNow let's talk about sale of regulatory credits. These are *not actual cars sold*—they're a kind of *bonus revenue* Tesla earns because of how environmentally friendly its cars are. Governments around the world, especially in places like California and Europe, require automakers to sell a certain number of low-emission or zero-emission vehicles. If a car company doesn’t meet those requirements, they have to *buy credits* from companies that exceed the standard—like Tesla. Tesla earns a bunch of these credits because all its cars are electric. Then it sells them to other automakers who still rely on gas-powered cars. This is essentially free money for Tesla—it doesn’t cost them anything to generate these credits, but they can sell them for hundreds of millions of dollars.\n\nAs for interest income, this is money Tesla earns just for having cash in the bank or investments. Tesla holds billions in cash and short-term investments. Instead of letting it sit there, they invest it in safe, interest-earning instruments (like U.S. Treasury bonds or money market funds). This also include bitcoin. As interest rates rise, these earnings go up—so Tesla earns hundreds of millions per quarter just from letting their money sit and grow.\n\nRemember what I said about bitcoin in the previous post? \"In December 2024, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) updated its guidelines, allowing companies to report digital assets like Bitcoin at their fair market value. This change enabled Tesla to recognize unrealized gains on its Bitcoin holdings without selling them. Leveraging the new accounting standards, Tesla reported a $600 million increase in net income for the fourth quarter of 2024, attributed to the appreciation of its Bitcoin holdings. This gain represented approximately 26% of Tesla's net income for that quarter. [https://www.investopedia.com/why-a-new-rule-helped-tesla-get-usd600m-in-bitcoin-gains-but-may-cost-microstrategy-billions-8783060](https://www.investopedia.com/why-a-new-rule-helped-tesla-get-usd600m-in-bitcoin-gains-but-may-cost-microstrategy-billions-8783060) If you have been paying attention to the price of bitcoin since Q2024, it has dropped dramatically. The next earnings are going to be really bad.\n\nAs of March 22, 2025, Bitcoin's price is approximately $84,123.\n\nOn December 31, 2024, (Tesla Q4 2024 earning) Bitcoin's closing price was around $93,429. On December 31, 2024, Bitcoin's closing price was around $93,429.\"\n\nIf this number hold true, Tesla interest income from bitcoin will drop by 9.96%.\n\nWith that said, the saying that Tesla doesn't make money from car isn't true. In the fourth quarter of 2024, Tesla's automotive sales revenue—which includes income from vehicle sales and related services—totaled approximately $18.8 billion. This figure represents about 73% of Tesla's total revenue of $25.7 billion for the same period. For the entire year of 2024, Tesla's automotive sales revenue amounted to $72.5 billion, accounting for approximately 74% of the total annual revenue of $97.7 billion. Remember the stuff about regulator credit above? These percentages indicate that automotive sales remain the primary contributor to Tesla's revenue, both quarterly and annually. Tesla is still a car company at heart, and this was it moat.\n\nYou might not know this about me, but I used to be a hardcore Tesla fanboy. I invested in the company back when they were just producing the original Roadster. Over the years, I’ve owned *every single product* Tesla has put out—including four of their vehicles.\n\nTesla’s sky-high valuation wasn’t just hype—it was because the company was doing things no one else dared to. It was more than just an automaker; it was positioned as a tech and AI company, with aspirations in robotics and full self-driving. But even beyond that, Tesla was pioneering a completely new model of vertical integration.\n\nIt wasn’t just about selling electric cars. Tesla popularized EVs, achieved massive adoption rates, and built an entire ecosystem around the vehicle. They sold their own insurance, handled their own repairs, created and *standardized* their own charging port (which others later adopted), and developed the most expansive EV charging network in the world.\n\nElon Musk wasn’t just building a car company—he was positioning Tesla to be the Rockefeller of the 21st-century automotive industry. Just like how Rockefeller controlled the oil pipeline from extraction to distribution, Tesla was aiming to control everything:\n\n* Design and manufacturing of the vehicles\n* Repair and servicing (only Tesla could repair a Tesla)\n* Insurance and financing\n* And the “gas stations” of the future—their Supercharger network\n\nIt was a brilliant playbook, and it echoed what made Sony so dominant in the 1990s: Sony owned the formats. Whether it was CDs, MiniDiscs, Blu-ray, or the Walkman headphone jack, Sony created the platforms and *collected royalties* when others used them.\n\nHad Tesla stayed on that course—doubling down on ecosystem control and technological dominance—they truly had a shot at owning the entire EV industry. But somewhere along the way, they pivoted, and that vision started to drift.\n\nI was a fanboy of Tesla, and I sold everything in November. I also started shorting Spy, but hopefully, I have time to talk about the economy in this post.\n\nWhat truly broke the long-term vision for Tesla, in my eyes, was the company’s decision to step back from its charging station expansion—the very dream of becoming the next-generation energy empire, replacing Shell, Chevron, Mobil, and essentially every gas station in the world.\n\nIn late April 2024, Tesla made a dramatic internal shift by disbanding its entire Supercharger team, including its leader, Rebecca Tinucci. This wasn’t a small reorganization—it was a major strategic reversal. The move immediately sparked concern about the future of Tesla’s vast charging infrastructure, which had once been one of its most significant competitive advantages.\n\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tesla\\_Supercharger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tesla_Supercharger)\n\nIn response, Elon Musk stated that Tesla would still grow its Supercharger network—but at a much slower pace. The new focus would be on maintaining 100% uptime and expanding existing sites, rather than continuing the rapid rollout of new stations across the country and around the world. This change came as part of broader company-wide layoffs and a growing strategic pivot toward artificial intelligence and robotics.\n\n[https://www.teslarati.com/elon-musk-explains-reasoning-behind-tesla-supercharger-team-disband/](https://www.teslarati.com/elon-musk-explains-reasoning-behind-tesla-supercharger-team-disband/)\n\nFor Tesla’s automotive partners—like Ford, GM, and Rivian, who had recently committed to adopting Tesla’s NACS charging standard—this sudden shift caused confusion and uncertainty. They had signed on with the expectation that Tesla would continue leading the way in EV infrastructure. Now, that future looked far less clear.\n\n[https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/musk-disbands-tesla-ev-charging-team-leaving-customers-dark-2024-04-30/](https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/musk-disbands-tesla-ev-charging-team-leaving-customers-dark-2024-04-30/)\n\nAs a Tesla owner in California, where EV adoption is highest, I’ve already started to see the consequences firsthand. Fewer new charging stations are being built, and the reliability of existing ones is noticeably declining. Increasingly, I encounter broken or malfunctioning Superchargers—something that used to be rare. In some locations, the charging speeds are significantly slower than they used to be—sometimes even half as fast.\n\nOn top of that, Tesla has introduced energy usage-based time rates, and the cost of charging has surged. What used to be a convenient and cost-effective option now feels like a premium-priced service. Three years ago, I used Superchargers without thinking twice. Today, I charge almost exclusively at home—because it’s five to eight times cheaper. Furthermore, you have to think about the high cost of housing and the majority of people renting or living in an apartment. They would have all had to use the Tesla charging stations for every EV car. Think about this implication!\n\n**The bigger picture here is that Elon Musk had the chance to be a modern-day Rockefeller. He was on track to own the entire energy pipeline for electric vehicles: manufacturing the cars, selling the insurance, controlling the repairs, and operating the “gas stations” of the EV era through the Supercharger network.**\n\nBut that opportunity has slipped away. The dream of Tesla owning the entire EV ecosystem—end to end—has fractured. And it’s hard not to see this as a major strategic misstep.\n\nu/Qc4281 \"I believe the Bulls are putting all of their hope in robotaxis and regardless of Q1, June will be the real test of how much support Tesla continues to have.\"\n\nIt’s time to face a hard truth: Tesla is no longer on the cutting edge of robotaxi technology. As of 2025, the undisputed leader in autonomous ride-hailing is Waymo, a subsidiary of Alphabet (Google’s parent company).\n\nWaymo operates at SAE Level 4 autonomy, meaning their vehicles can drive themselves without any human inside, in specific geofenced areas. This isn’t a prototype—it’s real, operational, and public.\n\nTheir Waymo One robotaxi service is live in Phoenix, San Francisco, and Los Angeles, where anyone can hail a fully driverless car—no safety driver, no steering wheel input, no human control required. Riders are using it every day like a regular Uber or Lyft.\n\nIn contrast, Tesla's so-called Full Self-Driving (FSD) is still classified as Level 2 autonomy. That means the system can assist with steering, acceleration, and braking, but the driver must be fully alert and ready to take over at all times. Tesla has no regulatory approval to operate a robotaxi fleet, and no Tesla on the road today can legally drive itself.\n\nWaymo uses a sophisticated sensor fusion approach:\n\n* Lidar for detailed 3D mapping\n* Radar for object detection in poor visibility\n* High-definition maps to understand complex city layouts\n\nTesla, by contrast, has removed radar and relies exclusively on cameras and neural networks, a vision-only system. While Tesla claims this mimics human driving, it’s also less reliable in poor lighting, bad weather, or unpredictable road scenarios. Waymo has logged over 20 million miles on public roads and released a detailed 2023 safety report showing zero major injuries or fatalities across millions of fully autonomous rides.\n\nElon Musk has been promising Level 4 or even Level 5 autonomy “next year” since 2016—nearly a decade of delays. As of today, FSD Beta still requires constant supervision. Tesla has not submitted its system to any regulatory body (e.g., DMV or NHTSA) for approval as an autonomous driving platform. No Tesla vehicle qualifies as a robotaxi, and none are legally allowed to operate as such\n\nTesla can't jump straight to Level 4. It first needs to prove Level 3, where the car can drive itself under limited conditions without driver input—but even that milestone has not been reached. It’s based more on hope and hype than actual technical progress or regulatory reality. Tesla has a powerful brand, and Elon’s ambitious promises get attention—but when it comes to real-world robotaxi deployment, Waymo is years ahead.\n\nNow we can talk about the robot. Boston Dynamics and Tesla’s Optimus are both developing humanoid robots. Boston Dynamic Has been developing humanoid and quadruped robots for **over a decade**. Their humanoid robot, Atlas, can run, jump, do parkour, backflips, and handle complex terrain. Their quadruped robot, Spot, is already being used in real industrial environments—construction sites, factories, even police and research teams.\n\nTesla first unveiled Optimus in 2021as a concept, with actual development starting in 2022. Still in early prototype stages—Tesla has shown it walking, lifting objects, and folding clothes, but it’s not yet capable of dynamic movement like Atlas. As of 2025, it’s still being tested internally and isn’t commercially deployed.\n\nBoston Dynamics is years ahead in terms of real-world functionality.\n\nI think I’ve looked into this deeply enough to respond to the common claim that “Tesla is more than just a car company.” The truth is, Tesla *was* more than just a car company. It had a bold vision—revolutionizing energy, transportation, and robotics all at once.\n\nBut that vision has faded.\n\nToday, Tesla has lost much of its momentum under Elon Musk’s shifting priorities. Right now, it's essentially an overvalued car company that’s trying to break into the robotaxi and robotics space—fields where it's already years, if not a decade, behind the actual industry leaders.\n\nThe ambition is still there—but the execution no longer matches the hype.\n\nNow, this isn't to say that Tesla will be going down in the next months or two. I noticed many of the people who are reading the previous post didn't understand what I was talking about when I was talking about LPSY. Specifically, I was referring to the Wyckoff distribution schematic phase c-d LPSY. Phase C is the test. The ‘Test’ serves the same but opposite function as the ‘Spring’ in the accumulation phase: the bull trap before the downtrend. While this level does get broken, it doesn’t change the picture of the cycle. Phase D is the effect. Phase D in this distribution phase is a mirror image of Phase D in the accumulation cycle. There is a considerable surge in volume and volatility, comprising one or more Last Point of Supply (LPSY) points. A Sign of Weakness (SOW) level happens, the final indication that the bears will soon take center stage. You have to open up tradingview or similar program to draw this, but it looks like Tesla is currently in that phase.\n\n[https://www.tradersmastermind.com/wyckoff-method/](https://www.tradersmastermind.com/wyckoff-method/)\n\nThe LPSY (Last Point of Supply) is a critical stage in the Wyckoff distribution schematic where rallies begin to fail, unable to reach previous highs. During this phase, we typically expect to see a short-term rally, but it’s often weak and unsustainable. Volume behavior becomes a major red flag—buying volume dries up on the way up, while selling volume increases during pullbacks. This pattern suggests that institutions have already completed their distribution, leaving retail traders to buy the dip, unaware that the “smart money” has exited. As a result, the stock becomes highly vulnerable to a sharp decline.\n\nIn Tesla’s case, these signs are already becoming visible. We’re seeing a pattern of lower highs, indicating that each rebound is losing strength. Key support levels are eroding, and momentum is fading, even in response to what would typically be considered “good news.” At the same time, narrative fatigue is setting in—delays in the robotaxi rollout, slowing delivery growth, ongoing price cuts, and Tesla’s recent pullback from expanding its Supercharger network have all contributed to weakening sentiment. All of this points to Tesla potentially being in its LPSY phase, teetering on the edge of a deeper markdown.\n\nOne thing we often overlook when talking about Tesla is its status as a luxury brand, which brings us back to the broader conversation about the economy. Before I go any further, I want to be clear: I’m praying that I’m wrong. I don’t *want* the economy to crash. But I’ve lived through a recession before—and I remember it vividly.\n\nBack in 2008, I watched family and friends lose their businesses, homes, jobs, savings—and in some cases, even loved ones. The pain was real. And what made it worse was knowing that much of it happened while our government and institutions downplayed the risks or outright lied to the public. That experience has shaped the way I look at economic data today.\n\nRight now, I believe we're entering a recession—or at the very least, staring down a serious economic slowdown. I'm not writing this to tell you to sell all your stocks or panic. I’m sharing this because I hope you’ll take a step back, assess your risks, and plan accordingly.\n\nAccording to the National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER), a recession is defined as a significant decline in economic activity that is widespread and lasts for more than a few months. It typically shows up in multiple indicators: GDP, personal income, employment, industrial production, and retail sales. There's also a more technical (but less comprehensive) definition: two consecutive quarters of negative real GDP growth.\n\nDuring the 2008 financial crisis, the earliest warning signs appeared in November 2007, which the NBER later marked as the official start of the recession. At that time, major financial institutions began reporting huge losses on mortgage-backed securities, job growth slowed, consumer confidence dropped, and the stock market—which had peaked in October 2007—began to decline. Subprime lenders were collapsing, and credit was tightening across the board.\n\nBy mid-2008, the crisis accelerated: Bear Stearns collapsed in March, and Lehman Brothers filed for bankruptcy in September. Housing prices plummeted, unemployment surged, and the economy spiraled. If you had exited the market in November 2007, you would not have seen the S&P 500 return to the same level until May 2011. That’s 3.5 years of waiting—and that's assuming you had the ability to hold through it all. This matters because knowing when to cut losses can save years of financial recovery, unless you're okay with sitting on those losses for the long haul.\n\nI still remember watching Alan Greenspan, then Chairman of the Federal Reserve, downplay the risks in the housing market and broader economy. Despite clear signs of overheating in credit and housing, he failed to act—ignoring warnings from economists, regulators, and data. That experience is why I don’t place my faith in Jerome Powell or any official narrative. I trust only the numbers.\n\nLooking ahead, the week of March 24–30 will give us key economic data. On Wednesday, we’ll get the Durable Goods Orders report. The forecast is -0.7%, compared to last month’s +3.1%. If it comes in even lower, that’s significant—because durable goods (like cars, appliances, aircraft, and machinery) are only purchased when businesses and consumers feel confident. A steep drop in this number is a classic early warning sign of a recession. However, durable goods alone don’t tell the full story—it needs to be paired with rising unemployment, falling retail sales, and declining industrial production to form a full recessionary picture.\n\nOn Thursday, we’ll see the GDP growth rate (QoQ). It was 3.0% in September and 3.1% in December. The projection now is 2.3%. If it misses expectations and drops even lower, we may not officially “ring the recession bell” just yet—but June’s data will become pivotal. That's when things may start to shift into \"oh-shit\" mode.\n\nThen on Friday, we’ll get personal income and personal spending figures. These are crucial. If both decline, that’s another strong recession signal. Personal spending accounts for nearly 70% of U.S. GDP, and if consumers stop spending, the economy slows—simple as that. Personal income tells us how much financial cushion people have. When both metrics go down, it shows growing financial stress among households.\n\nFor the week of March 31–April 6, we’ll get more insight with ISM Services PMI on Thursday, and then non-farm payrolls and the unemployment rate on Friday. Forecasts haven’t been released yet, but if these numbers also disappoint—especially in combination with all the metrics above—we’ll be staring at a textbook recession setup. These are the early signs, and I’m laying them out not to scare you, but to prepare you.\n\nYou may think I’m being overly cautious, and I could absolutely be wrong. And honestly—I hope I am. But the question you have to ask yourself is: Are you willing to risk losing 50% of your savings just to see if I’m wrong?\n\nLooking back at 2008, throughout most of 2007 and early 2008, the Bush administration repeatedly said the economy was “fundamentally sound,” even as the housing and credit markets collapsed beneath them. In January 2008, President Bush acknowledged “economic challenges” but still refused to call it a recession. And by the time the government acted decisively, it was already too late for millions of families.\n\nThis isn’t about being Republican or Democrat. It’s about making sure the words our officials say line up with what the numbers are telling us. If they don’t—we need to learn from history and not fall into the same trap. We can’t afford to get scammed into losing our life savings again.\n\nLet’s circle back to the topic of Tesla as a luxury brand—because that’s an important lens to view its current position through. Do you remember what happened during the 2008 financial crisis? Both automobile sales and luxury goods took a massive hit. Consumers cut back sharply on big-ticket purchases, and the luxury sector—cars, fashion, jewelry, travel—was no exception.\n\nIf you haven’t already, take a look at LVMH, the world’s largest luxury conglomerate. Its stock has dropped significantly, reflecting weakening demand for high-end consumer goods. This is a telling sign. Now ask yourself—what about Airbnb (ABNB)? Another brand that, while not traditionally “luxury,” thrives on discretionary income and consumer confidence. It’s also seeing a decline, which suggests people are pulling back on travel and experiences—another luxury-like behavior.\n\nThen there’s the VIX, the so-called “fear index” that tracks market volatility. If you examine the chart, you’ll notice that it’s starting to resemble the early stages of 2008—with rising spikes and volatility building quietly under the surface.\n\nSome may argue that it also looks like 2020, when COVID-19 triggered a global economic shutdown. But the key difference is that in 2020, the whole world was impacted simultaneously—the pandemic was a shared crisis that brought coordinated government responses, massive stimulus, and a V-shaped recovery.\n\nThis time is different. What we’re seeing now is primarily an American problem—rooted in sticky inflation, rising consumer debt, eroding household savings, and waning confidence in domestic institutions and policy. Other countries aren't yet showing the same systemic stress.\n\nSo when we talk about Tesla, or any luxury-adjacent brand, we have to recognize that luxury spending is one of the first things to be cut when consumers feel insecure. And the signs—from LVMH to ABNB to the VIX—are stacking up. This isn’t fear-mongering. It’s pattern recognition.\n\nLastly—and I want to emphasize this—I'm not saying the sky is falling, nor am I predicting that the stock market is going to crash tomorrow. In fact, I actually believe the market may move upward in the short term due to momentum, technicals, or temporary optimism.\n\nHowever, looking beyond the next few weeks, I believe the economic data over the next six months will begin to confirm what many of us already feel: that a recession is likely on the horizon. In particular, I think the next three months will be the most revealing. The trends we see in that window—whether in job growth, consumer spending, durable goods, or inflation—will be the “tell” that it's time for investors to start protecting their assets and reassessing their positions.\n\nYou don't need to sell everything. But you do need to have a plan. Because once the data becomes undeniable, the window to exit cleanly and safely may close fast.\n\nThank you for taking the time to read my posts. I had planned to dive into other topics, but honestly, there’s so much unfolding right now that it’s hard to keep it all focused. I genuinely feel for those who are still holding on, caught in the sunken cost fallacy, hoping things will bounce back simply because they’ve already lost so much.\n\nJust remember: losing less is always better than losing more. Sometimes survival in the market isn’t about timing the top or the bottom—it’s about knowing when to step aside and preserve what you have.\n\nAs always, I welcome your thoughts, counterpoints, or insights. Let’s navigate this together.",

      "text": "Your whole portfolio, investment strategy, your whole life is denominated in USD. Mine too. I am (like you, probably) predominantly invested in US equities/bonds. The value of those investments is not only threatened from a lack-of-future-returns standpoint, it's now also threatened in terms of ***losing*** **its buying power over time**.\n\nEnough politics! It's getting tiring reading all of the doom and gloom, *without also talking* about what to do about it. Let's discuss what to do if the USD continues to weaken.\n\nHere are some hedges I can think of. Feel free to add your own.\n\n1. Precious metals ETFs: GLD, SLV, etc.\n2. Physical gold/silver/etc.\n3. TIPS\n4. Foreign ILBs; inflation-linked bonds (TIPS but in other currencies, e.g. Canadian Real Return Bonds)\n5. Foreign currencies (GBP, JPY, CHF, EUR, etc.)\n6. Commodities ETFs\n7. REITs\n8. Actual real estate\n9. US Equities that can pass through their cost increases, e.g. Energy/Staples ETFs\n10. Foreign equities sans US, e.g. VXUS\n11. Derivative plays, e.g. Long LEAP PUTs on SPX if bearish\n12. BTC\n13. Non-fiat stablecoins (not foreign currencies, which is #4)\n14. Physical assets that you speculate will gain in value (fine art, Legos, but not #2 above.)\n\nNow, what to do in certain hypothetical scenarios? Posts should take the form \"if X happens, Y will be a good investment.\" No future-predicting, such as \"X will definitely happen; we're doomed.\" Those kinds of posts are all over this subreddit - read another thread for that. I'll go first:\n\n**If the US experiences stagflation...** good investments would be TIPS (#3), foreign ILBs (#4), Energy/staples ETFs (#9), and Commodities (#6). Why? In the case of TIPS/ILBs, they are indexed to inflation. In a stagflation scenario, we don't have hyperinflation, just stagnant growth and rising prices; this gives time for the CPI to be updated slowly enough for TIPS to be effective. Commodities and Energy companies can pass through or directly benefit from cost increases. Derivative plays protect in the case of a stock market crash, but don't do anything to protect your purchasing power of the money you keep, or gain, in the crash. And if you're long long-dated PUTs, theta will erode your position, so you'd better be right in the short term (and it's improbable to time a crash).\n\n**If the US experiences hyperinflation...** good investments would be precious metals, whether ETFS (#1) or physical bars (#2), and Commodities (#6). In a hyperinflation scenario, the CPI might not track actual inflation fast enough for TIPS or ILBs to keep up (prices may double in a mere week!), making them less valuable here than in a stagflation scenario. Gold and Commodities can be priced in real-time to react to surging prices. Notice, here, that there is no universal best investment idea right now. Hyperinflation and stagflation are different.\n\n**If the US defaults on its debt...** good investments would be foreign currencies (#5), ILBs (#4), gold (#1, #2) and commodities (#6). US-centric investments are in last place if we see a capital flight from the US, so TIPs and Energy/Staples ETFs no longer work here. Capital would flood to safe haven foreign investments, like foreign money markets, foreign ILBs and foreign currencies. Beyond foreign investments, gold is a zero-counterparty collateral, meaning that it will hold value no matter which system fails (USA or otherwise). Same with commodities: they'll be traded and in-demand regardless of what happens to the USD; other countries and currencies will still buy them.\n\nFeel free to critique or add your own scenario. How 'bout global hyperinflation (not just USD)? What if we don't have hyperinflation but the US dollar loses reserve currency status (which I posted in the FIRE subreddit [here](https://old.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/1jykgok/save_haven_investments_if_usd_loses_its_reserve/))?\n\nNo politics please.

Officials cited harm to consumers and businesses in the world’s fifth-largest economy.\n\nNewsom, a Democrat who’s considered a likely candidate to run for president in 2028, and California Attorney General Rob Bonta will seek a court order to immediately block the levies. “President Trump’s unlawful tariffs are wreaking chaos on California families, businesses, and our economy — driving up prices and threatening jobs,” Newsom said in the statement.\n\nRepresentatives for the White House didn’t immediately respond to an emailed request for comment on California’s challenge.\n\nTrump’s unprecedented use of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, or IEEPA, to impose tariffs on imports has rattled markets, prompted forecasts of a potential recession and strained relationships with overseas trading partners.\n\nThe IEEPA, passed in 1977, gives the president broad authority to regulate certain financial transactions when declaring a national emergency in response to an “unusual and extraordinary threat.” It has traditionally been used to place sanctions on countries, companies and individuals.\n\nTrump became the first president to use the statute to impose tariffs when he announced levies in February against China, Mexico and Canada to respond to the “extraordinary threat” of undocumented immigrants and illegal drugs moving through US borders.\n\nThe president is already facing at least three legal challenges to his tariffs, though major industries caught in the tariff crossfire have held off from any legal action for now. Two complaints were filed by conservative legal advocacy groups on behalf of small businesses, and the third by members of the Blackfeet Nation in Montana.\n\nJustice Department lawyers have argued that all the cases filed so far should be handled by the Court of International Trade in Washington, which specializes in lawsuits against the government over trade issues, and are seeking to transfer cases filed in US district courts to the trade court.\n\n# California Economy\n\nCalifornia, a reliably Democratic state, has already challenged an executive order Trump issued to end birthright citizenship and the freeze on federal grants and loans.\n\nNewsom during his governorship has positioned himself as a national voice on issues from climate change to abortion rights. His second term ends in 2026, leading to speculation he will run for president.\n\nCalifornia accounts for roughly 14% of the nation’s gross domestic product, has a 40 million population and would be considered one of the largest economies in the world if it were a standalone country. Newsom has said that its economic weight gives California leverage on the global stage, but it also makes it vulnerable to tariffs.\n\nThe state plays a crucial role in agriculture and US manufacturing, including semiconductors, computer equipment and vehicles. It exported $24 billion in agricultural goods in 2022, nearly 13% of total US farm exports. Almonds were the biggest contributor at $4.7 billion, followed by dairy products, pistachios and wine, with top buyers including Canada, the European Union, China and Hong Kong.\n\nNewsom has previously said he would try and insulate the state from Trump’s tariff plan by going directly to global trading partners and seeking exemptions, even though its unclear how he could pursue international agreements with foreign partners.\n\nCalifornia plans to allege, like the previous suits, that the IEEPA doesn’t give Trump authority to impose tariffs and that his actions violate the law absent congressional approval, according to the statement from Newsom’s office.\n\nNewsom and Bonta said the tariffs have an outsized impact on California businesses, including its more than 60,000 small business exporters.\n\nCalifornia Economy\n\nCalifornia, a reliably Democratic state, has already challenged an executive order Trump issued to end birthright citizenship and the freeze on federal grants and loans.\n\nNewsom during his governorship has positioned himself as a national voice on issues from climate change to abortion rights.

This is the equivalent of putting Mulvaney in charge of subsequent clean up job. The thing that amazes me most, is that Elon is completely unaware that the problem is **him**. He blamed Afshar as if he could have done something more, fired him (and the entire PR departement a while back if you remember), then with his planet sized ego, puts himself in charge of the problem he needlessly created. What does he think he is going to do? Convince all of Europe to see things his way and change their entire culture to suit his whack-a-doodle views? In his mind, are they all going to be doing the elbowless waves to idolize him by the end of Q3?\n\nSimultaneously, he is now trying to take on the entire US government by going after both sides of the aisle. At what point does the market realize Elon has completely lost his mind? He is clearly having some sort of delusions about taking over the world. His cult followers that were the only ones allowed to ride in the staged Robotaxi \"launch\" understood their mission from their leader. Unless you want to hear a 15-minute Tesla pump session, just skip to the 18:00 mark on this video when he gets out:\n\n(can't post YouTube vids, but see \"I SURVIVED A TESLA ROBOTAXI RIDE (BARELY)\")\n\nTranscript: \"*I'm feeling pretty bullish. I think I am going to buy the stock. This company is about to take over the world I think...*\"\n\nThey aren't even being subtle about it anymore. They are just telling people to buy the stock because a few select social media influencers were given highly controlled rides and a clear mission to pump. It all seems so desperate. Elon purchased Twitter to build his influence and I speculate somewhere around 10% of his 221+ million followers have had their brain turned to mush by Grok. That is a lot of people that can pump this meme stock. And they probably do think Elon will take over the world and will put their last pennies into that fantasy. Does anyone think that a staged social media campaign based on pure nonsense is enough to keep this stock in absurd P/E range that it has held in at for such a long time?\n\nAt what point is the board of Tesla liable to the shareholders for allowing this sort of behavior to continue? I guess they are all too busy selling their shares as fast as their agreements allow them to. Seriously, does anyone look at the insider trading activity and recent high-level departures of this company as have any doubts as to what is going on inside this rapidly failing company?\n\n\\*I hold TSLZ right now. And I think the collapse of this meme stock is near.",

      "text": "[https://finance.yahoo.com/news/carney-vows-deeper-deficits-fund-142514889.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/carney-vows-deeper-deficits-fund-142514889.html)\n\n(Bloomberg) — Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney is promising to run deeper deficits to cut income taxes and grow spending on infrastructure to reduce the country’s dependence on the US.\n\nCarney’s plan would push the federal government’s shortfall to C$62.3 billion ($45 billion) this fiscal year and add C$129.2 billion in net new spending over the next four years if his Liberal Party wins the election, according to the party’s election platform, released Saturday in Ottawa.\n\nCanada’s net deficit as a percentage of gross domestic product is expected to be 1.96% in the fiscal year that started this month, up from the 1.3% projected in December by the Liberals under former Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. The shortfall as a percentage of GDP is expected to fall to 1.35% by 2028.\n\n“It’s said there are no atheists in foxholes. There should be no libertarians in a crisis,” Carney said at a news conference in Whitby, Ontario.\n\nThe largest spending promises include an income tax cut, defense spending, housing investments and a trade diversification fund to increase Canada’s ability to export to markets other than the US. The plan estimates C$20 billion in revenues from Canada’s retaliatory tariffs this fiscal year, which the Liberals say they would redistribute entirely to workers and businesses affected by the US trade war.\n\nOverall, the platform shows Canada’s fiscal position worsening if the Liberals are re-elected on April 28, and the party is currently leading in most polls. Canada is unlikely to improve its debt-to-GDP ratio over the forecast horizon, which was previously a key fiscal guidepost offered by the Liberals under Trudeau.\n\nConservative Leader Pierre Poilievre has yet to release his party’s costed platform, but his campaign promises total in the tens of billions of dollars, including major tax cuts. He has pledged a fiscal rule that would see a dollar of savings for every dollar of new spending.\n\nCarney’s push to spend more deeply comes as other western nations, including Germany, also unleash deficit spending to respond to US President Donald Trump’s withdrawal from traditional economic and security relationships. Canada has one of the better fiscal positions among Group of Seven countries.\n\nCarney plans to split the budget into capital and operating expenditures, as is done in other jurisdictions including Canada’s second largest province of Quebec.\n\nHis team says it plans to balance the operating budget by the fiscal year that starts in 2028, mostly by increasing productivity through technology including artificial intelligence. Earlier this week, he promised to reduce the annual growth in the operating budget to 2% from about 9% currently.\n\n“Our plan gets government spending under control, because the government has been spending too much and Canada has been investing too little,” Carney said.\n\nThe costed platform incorporates March estimates from the Parliamentary Budget Office, including a real GDP growth assumption of 1.7% in 2025. That’s higher than the 1.5% estimated in a Bloomberg survey of economists later last month.\n\nThe platform also mentions a potential issuance of Canada’s “first-ever transition bonds” of C$10 billion per year by 2027, intended to help agricultural and industrial sectors become cleaner and more competitive.",

      "title": "$FIG is indicating $95-100, per CNBC",
      "text": "That values it at \\~$59B,  at $100/share, and implies close to $40B overvaluation. The article below has stale numbers but wanted to include for context.\n\n>The indications, which are signals from market makers of the level where trading may begin, imply as much as a 112% gain above the IPO price of $33 apiece. The shares were marketed for $30 to $32 per share, after the company increased the range earlier in the week.\n\n>The company sold 12.47 million shares in the IPO, which priced Tuesday, while investors including Index Ventures, Greylock Partners and Kleiner Perkins sold 24.46 million shares.\n\n>The IPO pricing gives Figma a market value of $16.1 billion, based on the outstanding shares listed in its filings. Accounting for employee stock options and restricted stock units, the company has a fully diluted value of roughly $18.5 billion.\n\n>Including restricted stock units for Chief Executive Officer Dylan Field, which are subject to vesting conditions, the fully diluted value would rise above $19 billion.\n\n>The figure is approaching the $20 billion valuation Figma would have fetched in a planned sale to Adobe Inc. that fell apart in 2023.\n\n>The shares offered in Figma’s IPO were approaching 40 times oversubscribed, Bloomberg News reported Tuesday, in a sign of robust demand for the first sizable software offering in the US since SailPoint Inc.’s debut in February.\n\n>Figma is used to design web and mobile application interfaces. It has expanded its suite of products in an attempt to be more useful for software development and general workplace collaboration.\n\n>Like many software firms, Figma charges clients based on the number of users and the kind of seat those users have. It added Dev Mode to the platform in 2023 to enable closer collaboration with developers, and has more recently incorporated AI technology into many of its own tools. This year it introduced Figma Make, an AI-based product that lets the user turn prompts into functional prototypes.\n\n>Now that the company is public, “we have to continue to sprint, to push hard, and we can’t let the public markets distract us,” Field said in an interview.\n\n>Going public allows Figma to have a big brand moment which centers the importance of design, Field said. “This is a time where we can create tremendous value for our community, our customers, and I think the public market is the right place to do it.”\n\n>The company is growing quickly, with a 46% year on year increase in first-quarter revenue.\n\n>A key question for Figma’s long-term success is whether it can become a tool used pervasively used by office workers beyond designers. The company’s suite of tools is seeing strong adoption by software developers, product managers, and marketers, said Andrew Reed, a partner at Sequoia Capital and a member of Figma’s board.\n\n>Sequoia, one of the most storied Silicon Valley venture firms, first invested in Figma in 2019. Around this time, companies were beginning to adopt Figma’s product en masse, Reed said.\n\n>The use of AI-focused software creation apps which are potential competitors to Figma, such as Lovable and Bolt, has rapidly increased this year. Weaving AI features through Figma is a top priority, Field said. “We have so much room to explore how we can make great AI products and experiences.”\n\n>**IPO Volume Climbs**\n\n>The IPO has lifted the volume of first-time share sales on US exchanges above last year’s pace. There has been more than $21 billion worth of US first-time share sales in the year to date, excluding financial vehicles such as blank-check companies, just behind the $20.2 billion raised in the same period in 2024, data compiled by Bloomberg show.\n\n>Demand for Figma’s IPO was likely helped by an order-taking process similar to an auction. Prospective investors in Figma’s offering were asked to precisely state the number of shares they wish to buy and at what price, a person familiar with the matter has said.\n\n>Field will continue to control the company with 74.1% of the votes after the IPO through his holdings of Class B shares that have 15 votes each, the filings show.\n\n>The CEO and fellow Brown University student Evan Wallace started Figma in 2012. Field attended Brown for two and a half years before accepting a Thiel Fellowship, the Peter Thiel-backed program that provides funding to young entrepreneurs, provided they drop out of school. Figma was widely embraced by designers who warmed to its browser-based interface, replacing previous methods of collaboration involving sharing files individually.\n\n>Figma had net income of $44.9 million and revenue of $228 million in the three-month period ended March 31, according to its filings. It reported revenue growth in 2024, though rising operating expenses contributed to a net loss of $732 million for the year.\n\n>Adobe, a maker of software for creative professionals, walked away from the deal to buy Figma following clashes with regulators. It paid a $1 billion termination fee.\n\n>The offering was led by Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Allen & Co. and JPMorgan Chase & Co. The company’s stock is listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol FIG.\n\nText the article is from:  [https://finance.yahoo.com/news/figma-indicated-112-above-ipo-152947660.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/figma-indicated-112-above-ipo-152947660.html)\n\n  \nEdit: Indicating $105-110 now.",

      "text": "https://www.cnbc.com/amp/2024/10/16/amazon-goes-nuclear-investing-more-than-500-million-to-develop-small-module-reactors.html\n\nAmazon Web Services is investing over $500 million in nuclear power, announcing three projects from Virginia to Washington State. AWS, Amazon's subsidiary in cloud computing, has a massive and increasing need for clean energy as it expands its services into generative AI. It's also a part of Amazon's path to net-zero carbon emissions.\n\nAWS announced it has signed an agreement with Dominion Energy, Virginia's utility company, to explore the development of a small modular nuclear reactor, or SMR, near Dominion's existing North Anna nuclear power station. Nuclear reactors produce no carbon emissions.\n\nAn SMR is an advanced type of nuclear reactor with a smaller footprint that allows it to be built closer to the grid. They also have faster build times than traditional reactors, allowing them to come online sooner.\n\nAmazon is the latest large tech company to buy into nuclear power to fuel the growing demands from data centers. Earlier this week, Google announced it will purchase power from SMR developer Kairos Power. Constellation Energy is restarting Three Mile Island to power Microsoft data centers.\n\n\"We see the need for gigawatts of power in the coming years, and there's not going to be enough wind and solar projects to be able to meet the needs, and so nuclear is a great opportunity,\" said Matthew Garman, CEO of AWS. \"Also, the technology is really advancing to a place with SMRs where there's going to be a new technology that's going to be safe and that's going to be easy to manufacture in a much smaller form.\"\n\nVirginia is home to nearly half of all the data centers in the U.S., with one area in Northern Virginia dubbed Data Center Alley, the bulk of which is in Loudon County. An estimated 70% of the world's internet traffic travels through Data Center Alley each day.\n\nDominion serves roughly 3,500 megawatts from 452 data centers across its service territory in Virginia. About 70% is in Data Center Alley. A single data center typically demands about 30 megawatts or greater, according to Dominion Energy. Bob Blue, its president and CEO, said in a recent quarterly earnings call that the utility now receives individual requests for 60 megawatts to 90 megawatts or greater. Dominion projects that power demand will increase by 85% over the next 15 years. AWS expects the new SMRs to bring at least 300 megawatts of power to the Virginia region.\n\n\"Small modular nuclear reactors will play a critical role in positioning Virginia as a leading nuclear innovation hub,\" said Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin in a release. \"Amazon Web Services' commitment to this technology and their partnership with Dominion is a significant step forward to meet the future power needs of a growing Virginia.\"\n\nAWS plans to invest $35 billion by 2040 to establish multiple data center campuses across Virginia, according to an announcement from Youngkin last year.\n\n\"These SMRs will be powering directly into the grid, so they'll go to power everything, part of that is the data centers, but everything that is plugged into the grid will benefit,\" Garman added.\n\nAmazon also announced a new agreement with utility company Energy Northwest, a consortium of state public utilities, to fund the development, licensing and construction of four SMRs in Washington State. The reactors will be built, owned and operated by Energy Northwest but will provide energy directly to the grid, which will also help power Amazon operations.\n\nUnder the agreement, Amazon will have the right to purchase electricity from the first four modules. Energy Northwest has the option to build up to eight additional modules. That power would also be available to Amazon and Northwest utilities to power homes and businesses.\n\nThe SMRs will be developed with technology from Maryland-based X-energy, a developer of SMRs and fuel. Along with Amazon's other announcements, Amazon's Climate Pledge Fund disclosed it is the lead anchor in a $500 million financing round for X-Energy. The Climate Pledge Fund is its corporate venture capital fund that invests in early-stage sustainability companies. Other investors include Citadel Founder and CEO Ken Griffin, affiliates of Ares Management Corporation, NGP and the University of Michigan.\n\n\"Amazon and X-energy are poised to define the future of advanced nuclear energy in the commercial marketplace,\" said X-energy CEO J. Clay Sell. \"To fully realize the opportunities available through artificial intelligence, we must bring clean, safe, and reliable electrons onto the grid with proven technologies that can scale and grow with demand.\"\n\nLast spring, AWS invested in a nuclear energy project with Talen Energy, signing an agreement to purchase nuclear power from the company's existing Susquehanna Steam Electric Station, a nuclear power station in Salem Township, Pennsylvania. AWS also purchased the adjacent, nuclear-powered data center campus from Talen for $650 million.",

      "text": "* Tesla stock is in a \"quagmire,\" the longtime investor Ross Gerber has said.\n* He said he'd sold about $60 million in Tesla shares amid growing concerns over the carmaker.\n* Gerber told Yahoo Finance that no one seemed interested in buying Tesla's cars anymore.\n\n  \nOne of Tesla's longtime investors has dumped about half his stake in Elon Musk's carmaker.\n\n\n\nThe shareholder, Ross Gerber, has said that's because no one seems interested in buying Tesla's cars or robots.\n\n\n\nGerber, who's been a loud critic of Musk since the Tesla CEO acquired Twitter in 2022, said he had sold about 60 million worth of his Tesla shares. He told Yahoo Finance in a recent interview that his investment fund still had a $50 million stake in the company.\n\n\n\n\"Over time, I've just been sort of lowering my position, because I just don't have the same confidence that they're going to achieve the goals that were set out for Tesla several years ago and even recently, which is really to sell more cars,\" Gerber said, dismissing bullish talk on Tesla's robotics and full-self-driving tech. \"That's just a distraction from the fact that they need to sell cars, this year, and next year, and the year after, because none of this is coming anytime soon,\" he added.\n\n\n\nOther Tesla investors have also grown skeptical and impatient over the car company's trajectory. Tesla's stock is down 13% this year, largely because of declining sales, rising competition in China, and drama surrounding Musk's legal battles.\n\n\n\nGerber said the used-car market was swarmed with old Teslas, adding that he'd been unable to offload his own Tesla at what he deemed a fair value.\n\n\n\n\"It's really a quagmire where you have the best products in an industry but a CEO who doesn't actually work there, who doesn't try to sell the cars,\" Gerber said, adding: \"We've seen sales go down, and that's what's happening. Sales are going down. If you're expecting a great quarter, you're wrong. They're not selling any Teslas here, other than basically, discount, discount, discount.\"\n\n\n\nAnd while analysts have made the case that the company is being undervalued as an AI firm, Gerber said artificial intelligence was unlikely to save the company. He speculated that demand would be poor for Tesla's humanoid robots, given doubts over Musk amid his chaotic revamp of Twitter into X.\n\n\n\n\"The simplest way to do it is, go around to your neighbors and ask them, 'How many of you would buy a humanoid robot built by Elon Musk?' And the answer is zero, OK. Nobody wants a robot from Elon Musk. Why? Who would trust it?\" Gerber said, adding: \"The last thing I need is some robot built by Elon Musk in my house, so I don't know if they thought about the marketing of this at all yet.\"\n\n\n\nMusk's leadership of Tesla has been under rising scrutiny from investors and lawmakers over the past few years. Most recently, Sen. Elizabeth Warren sent a letter to Tesla's board of directors, calling on the executives to ensure Musk was meeting his financial responsibilities to Tesla shareholders.\n\n  \nSource: [businessinsider.com](http://businessinsider.com)",

In the US, we know sales declined by 7% in 2024 vs 2023.

His comments in the media and related actions with DOGE have deeply hurt the Tesla brand.  If you look at Tesla's core audience it is left leaning, environmentally conscious Democrats.   Musks actions have completely alienated that demographic.   The Republicans aren't buying EV's and certainly not enough to offset a loss from the left.   A close analogy would be Bud Light and Trans Activist Dylan Mulvaney.   Sales dropped 30% and still haven't fully recovered.   Bud Light eventually fired the executives responsible for the campaign.   But there is next to 0 chance the Tesla Board jettisons Musk, as he has stacked the board with family members and loyalists.\n\nAntidotally, I live in the Bay Area.  My social circle is left leaning White Collar professionals, Tesla's key demographic, and talking with co-workers/friends I don't know anybody who is planning to buy a Tesla.   I have some friends who have Tesla's but when their lease is up they don't plan on renewing or buying another one.   In my view Musk's political activism has permanently harmed the Tesla Brand.\n\n  \n**Valuation**  \nTesla EPS was $2.05 last year and currently trades at a P/E ratio of 108.  For comparison Toyota trades at a P/E ration of 7, Ford 6, and Mercedes at 5.    Stocks can trade at high P/E ratios based on rosy growth rates.   Musk has long touted that Tesla is an AI and RoboTaxi company, it's part of why Tesla trades at such lofty valuations.   However, I checked Tesla's 10k and 90% of their revenue comes from Automotive and Automotive Services.   They are very much a car company.       \n\nEven if you were to say Tesla deserves a premium valuation of 20x earnings, that would put a valuation of \\~$41, which is a sharp drop from where it currently trades at $222.15.   Yes, Tesla is a Meme Stock and traditional valuation metrics don't apply (i.e Gamestop).   But here's the rub.   Automotive companies have huge fixed costs.   Those factories and plants, cost a lot to build and finance.   A large drop in sales can get ugly real fast and generate huge losses.   There's no way to justify these lofty valuations when your sales are dropping and your company starts hemorrhaging  money.  At some point the illusion cracks.\n\n  \n**Position:** Short",

      "text": "Microsoft is cutting a small percentage of jobs across departments, based on performance, the company confirmed to CNBC on Wednesday.\n\n“At Microsoft we focus on high-performance talent,” a Microsoft spokesperson said in an email to CNBC on Wednesday. “We are always working on helping people learn and grow. When people are not performing, we take the appropriate action.”\n\nBusiness Insider reported on the plans late Tuesday.\n\nThe job cuts will affect less than 1% of employees, said a person familiar with the matter who asked not to be named in order to discuss private information.\n\nMicrosoft had 228,000 employees at the end of June. While the company’s net income margin of nearly 38% is close to its highest since the early 2000s, Microsoft’s stock underperformed its peers last year, rising 12% while the Nasdaq gained 29%.\n\nMicrosoft’s latest cuts are slim compared to recent downsizing efforts.\n\nIn early 2023, the company laid off 10,000 employees and consolidated leases. In January 2024, three months after completing the $75.4 billion Activision Blizzard acquisition, Microsoft’s gaming unit shed 1,900 jobs to reduce overlap.\n\nAs 2025 begins, Microsoft faces a more tenuous relationship with artificial intelligence startup OpenAI, which the company has backed to the tune of over $13 billion. The partnership helped propel Microsoft’s market cap past $3 trillion last year.\n\nOver the summer, Microsoft added OpenAI to its list of competitors. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella used the phrase “cooperation tension” while discussing the relationship with investors Brad Gerstner and Bill Gurley on a podcast released last month.\n\nMeanwhile, the Microsoft 365 Copilot assistant, which draws on OpenAI technology, has yet to become pervasive in business. Analysts at UBS said in a note last month that they came away from Microsoft’s Ignite conference with the impression that Copilot rollouts “have been a bit slow/underwhelming.”\n\nMicrosoft is still touting its growth opportunities. Finance chief Amy Hood said in October that revenue growth from Microsoft’s Azure cloud will speed up in the first half of this year because of greater AI infrastructure capacity.\n\nSource: https://www.cnbc.com/2025/01/08/microsoft-confirms-performance-based-job-cuts-across-departments.html",

      "text": "Tesla shares soared 22% to close at $260.48 on Thursday, the stock’s best day since 2013, following the company’s better-than-expected earnings report.\n\nThe company late Wednesday reported revenue of $25.18 billion, which came in just under analysts’ expectations of $25.37 billion, but was up 8% compared with a year earlier. Tesla reported earnings per share of 72 cents adjusted, topping the average analyst estimate of 58 cents.\n\n“We expect this surprising earnings beat to power a strong positive reaction in Tesla shares Thursday, given the degree to which investors have become conditioned to earnings misses from the company,” analysts at JPMorgan wrote in a note.\n\nTesla’s profit margins in the third quarter were boosted by $739 million in revenue for environmental regulatory credits, which the JPMorgan analysts noted were a “potentially unsustainable driver” of earnings and cash flow.\n\nAutomakers are required to obtain a certain amount of regulatory credits every year, and if they can’t meet the target, they can buy credits from other companies. Tesla has excess credits because it only makes electric vehicles.\n\nTesla earnings also got a boost from FSD, the company’s Full Self-Driving Supervised system. CFO Vaibhav Taneja said on the earnings call that FSD contributed $326 million in revenue in the quarter after Tesla made it available for use in the Cybertruck and added a feature called “Actually Smart Summon.”\n\nCEO Elon Musk said on the call that his “best guess” is that “vehicle growth” will reach 20% to 30% next year, citing “lower cost vehicles” and the “advent of autonomy.” Analysts surveyed by FactSet were expecting delivery growth of about 15% for 2025.\n\nEven bullish Deutsche Bank analysts doubted Musk’s forecast and wrote, in a note following the earnings report, “Our view remains more reserved at 10-15% (~2.03m),” and assumes Tesla can roll out a cheaper version of its Model Y at a price under $30,000 after subsidies, and other variants of the small SUV.\n\nAnalysts at Morgan Stanley who also recommend buying the stock, called Musk’s 2025 vehicle delivery growth prediction a “maybe.” They set their estimate at 14%.\n\nIt “clearly depends on the company’s ability to improve affordability through cheaper model (next gen) introduction, financing offers and improved features,” the Morgan Stanley analysts wrote in a note Thursday.\n\nA grain of salt\n\nMusk said on the Wednesday call that Tesla plans to start production of its recently unveiled Cybercab, a robotaxi with butterfly doors and no steering wheel or pedals, by the end of 2026. He also said Tesla would conduct driverless ridehailing in California and Texas next year in its existing cars, which are not currently safe to use without a human driver ready to steer or brake at any time.\n\nBernstein analysts, who have a bearish price target of $120 on shares of Tesla, wrote in a note out Thursday: “The tone of Tesla’s conference call was ebullient and filled with Musk prognostications that have historically polarized bull and bear investors, and was more akin to a pep rally, with the company only taking two questions from sell-siders.”\n\nMusk has for years promised shareholders a software upgrade that can turn Teslas into robotaxis. That hasn’t happened yet. Musk has also promised a refreshed version of the Tesla Roadster since 2017. The design of the vehicle is not yet complete. \n\nThe Bernstein analysts wrote, “We continue to struggle to see Tesla overcoming the technological and regulatory hurdles needed to leapfrog current level 4 robotaxis, and believe fully unsupervised FSD could be years away.”\n\nThey pointed to Musk’s “long history of being overly optimistic about FSD” and said crowdsourced research that shows “Tesla continues to lag well behind competitors” on robotaxis.\n\nThe share rally Thursday was the sharpest since a 24% gain in May 2013. The jump erased Tesla’s loss for the year and left the stock up 3% in 2024, though it still trails the 22% gain for the Nasdaq.\n\nSource: https://www.cnbc.com/2024/10/24/tesla-shares-surge-as-analysts-react-to-q3-earnings-musk-predictions.html",

The United Kingdom is the only country exempt from the hike.\n\nMeanwhile, Trump's trade war is causing the global economy to slow, with growth now heading for its weakest pace since the COVID-19 pandemic, the OECD warned on Tuesday.\n\nThe OECD cut its forecasts for most G20 economies and warned that easing trade tensions is key to boosting investment and keeping prices stable. Álvaro Pereira, the OECD’s chief economist, said countries need to lower trade barriers. “Otherwise, the growth impact is going to be quite significant,” he said. “This has massive repercussions for everyone.”\n\nThe warning comes as the US is pushing countries to speed up trade talks. The White House confirmed Tuesday that the US had sent a letter to partners as a \"friendly reminder\" that Trump's self-imposed 90-day pause on sweeping \"reciprocal\" tariffs is set to expire in early July.\n\nWhite House advisers have for weeks promised trade deals in the \"not-too-distant future,\" with the only announced agreement so far coming with the United Kingdom.\n\nMeanwhile, US tensions with two key trade partners amped up on Monday after Trump promised last weekend to double tariffs on steel and aluminum. The White House said he will sign an order to do so on Tuesday.\n\nChina responded to Trump's claim on Friday that it has \"totally violated its agreement\" with the US, in turn accusing the US of breaching the agreement and vowing to protect its interests. The US-China detente — reached earlier this month, when each country eased sky-high tariffs on the other — looks more fragile amid both trade-related and other tensions.\n\nUS trade talks with the EU have also come back into focus as an early-July deadline also looms for Trump's 50% tariffs on imports from the bloc. The EU on Monday said it \"strongly\" regrets Trump's hike on steel and aluminum imports, saying it undermines planned trade talks.\n\nMeanwhile, Trump's most sweeping tariffs face legal uncertainty after a federal appeals court allowed the tariffs to temporarily stay in effect, a day after the US Court of International Trade blocked their implementation, deeming the method used to enact them \"unlawful.\"\n\nAdministration officials also hinted that court rulings would not be the final say. Yahoo Finance's Ben Werschkul has an overview of the other maneuvers Trump could pursue.",

      "text": "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/intel-cut-over-20-workforce-004251026.html\n\nIntel is set to unveil plans this week to slash more than 20% of its workforce, in a move to streamline operations and reduce bureaucratic inefficiencies, Bloomberg News reported on Tuesday, citing a person familiar with the matter.\n\nThe layoffs are part of a broader strategy to refocus on an engineering-driven culture, the report said. \n\nIntel did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.\n\nThe layoffs mark the first major move under new CEO Lip-Bu Tan, who took over last month to revive the struggling Silicon Valley chipmaker after years of challenges.\n\nLast month, Reuters reported that Tan was considering significant changes to its chip manufacturing methods and artificial intelligence strategies.\n\nThe new trajectory involved restructuring Intel's AI strategy and implementing staff cuts to address what Tan described as a slow-moving and bloated middle management layer. Shortly after his appointment, he told employees in a town hall that the company will have to make \"tough decisions.\"\n\nLast week, Reuters reported that Tan was restructuring the company by flattening its leadership team, with key chip groups now reporting directly to him.\n\nThe planned layoffs follow a significant reduction in workforce last August, when Intel said it planned to cut 15% of its jobs, or approximately 15,000 positions.\n\nThe job cuts in 2024, part of a $10 billion cost-reduction plan aimed for this year, were driven by high costs, shrinking margins in Intel's core PC and data center segments, and an expensive pivot to AI chips - an area where Intel has trailed competitors such as Nvidia.\n\nThe Santa Clara, California-based company had 108,900 employees at the end of 2024, according to a filing.\n\nThe chipmaker is scheduled to report its first-quarter results on Thursday.",

If no solution is found within 60 days, China could request adjudication by the Geneva-based organisation's Dispute Settlement Body.",

      "text": "Currently in the middle of the FIRE journey, but a little anxious about the future of economics in general. AI is advancing at a rate that I think most people are not ready for. What happens to FIRE plans if 50% of people lose their jobs in the next 5-10 years? If the government has to provide universal basic income, what does having money even mean? \n\nAlso, if the majority of jobs are replaced by ai, who will be buying the products and services that these companies provide? How will people be able to pay mortgages with no income? Will this entirely change the economy and what it means to use currency and/or wealth? \n\nI guess I'm just looking to hear what you guys think. I feel like I may make all of these sacrifices for decades only for my money to be worthless and the economy to be completely different by the time it comes to FIRE. \n\nAnd if you think I'm being dramatic, pretty much everyone working or forecasting in this field is predicting some version of this. Salesforce CEO said ai is already doing 30-50% of all jobs at his company. Lots of layoffs in software jobs, and it will only spread to other white collar jobs.",

It's co-sponsored by Senators Amy Klobuchar and Rand Paul.\n\n\\- To pass all Democrat senators need to support it, with support from 4 Republican senators. Mitch McConnell, Lisa Murkowski, and Susan Collins have voiced concerns with tariffs and are expected to support the resolution which would help it pass.

But 2025 seems particularly risky IMO because of the valuations, on well, everything. Stocks, real estate, crypto, gov't debt. None of them on their own pose any catastrophic problems in isolation, but what happens to all of them together when there's a hiccup?\n\nThere's an article in the Economics forum about commercial real estate woes. By itself it's not the end of the world, but with the gov't debt where it's at, dropping fed rates back to 0 with bank failures won't have the same effect cause bond vigilantes will ramp up the 10 year. If stocks fall, what happens to home prices when they are both at all time highs? In 2008 they both went down. What if stocks fall then crypto freaks then stocks fall more? What is this going to do to AI if funding slows? What if they all fall a little bit and that cycle repeats? The biggest safegap seems to be rich people holding a ton of cash, but they aren't necessarily going to 'catch a falling knife'.\n\nTo me, the most insulated assets to protect for this seem to be international equity. Prices are comparatively low lessening the air gap and in an actively deglobalizing world the correlation should be minimizing. Like if the US has a mini meltdown, South Africa should be chugging along ok, and vice versa.",

      "text": "I'm honestly not sure how this hasn't been brought up more, but Buffett actually has a beautifully elegant alternative to tariffs that solves for the trade deficit (which is a very real problem, he said in 2006.... \"The U.S. trade deficit is a bigger threat to the domestic economy than either the federal budget deficit or consumer debt and could lead to political turmoil...\")\n\nHere's how Import Certificates work...\n\n* Every time a U.S. company exports goods, it receives \"Import Certificates\" equal to the dollar amount exported.\n* Foreign companies wanting to import into the U.S. must purchase these certificates from U.S. exporters.\n* These certificates trade freely in an open market, benefiting U.S. exporters with an extra revenue stream, and gently nudging up the price of imports.\n\nThe brilliance is that trade automatically balances itself out—exports must match imports. No government bureaucracy, no targeted trade wars, no crony capitalism, and no heavy-handed tariffs.\n\nBuffett was upfront: Import Certificates aren't perfect. Imported goods would become slightly pricier for American consumers, at least initially. But tariffs have that same drawback, with even more negative consequences like trade wars and global instability.\n\nThe clear advantages:\n\n* **Automatic balance:** Exports and imports stay equal, reducing America's dangerous trade deficit.\n* **More competitive exports:** U.S. businesses get a direct benefit, making them stronger in global markets.\n* **Job creation:** Higher exports mean more domestic production and, consequently, more American jobs.\n* **Market-driven:** No new bureaucracy or complex regulation—just supply and demand at work.\n\nI honestly don't know how this isn't being talked about more! Hell, we could rename them Trump Certificates if we need to, but I think this policy needs to get up to policymakers ASAP haha.\n\nWe made a full video on our YT channel, but I won't post a link here to respect the rules of the sub!\n\nHere's the link to Buffett's original article: [https://www.berkshirehathaway.com/letters/growing.pdf](https://www.berkshirehathaway.com/letters/growing.pdf)",

      "title": "US tourism officials sound alarm, tourist flights to US sink 70% and could impact up to 140k hospitality jobs and $14B in economic spending",
      "text": "Here is my way of trying to find alpha in an erratic stock market - how I'm trading the US tourism dip.\n\n**1. Canada is the US's largest source of tourism**: In 2024, 20 million Canadian tourists visited the US, spent $20.5 billion, and supported 140,000 US jobs. Canada's population is 40 million, so 50% of the entire country visited, and the US had 77 million tourists so 1 country is contributing 26% of visits.\n\n**2. Recent US policies is leading to a tourism boycott from Canadians, and the rest of the world**: Tourists are boycotting US tourism due to tariffs, annexation threats, new travel barriers, and stories of visitors being unlawfully detained with no due process (in March a Canadian citizen was denied entry due to an expired visa, while this was a worker and not a tourist, instead of being allowed to return to Canada, as is the norm, she was shackled in chains and sent to a private ICE facility for 2 weeks without being able to contact a lawyer or get a bed).\n\n**3. Analysts previously predicted policies would decrease tourism by 5%, new numbers released this week show that it's 14x higher:** For Canada alone (26% of US's entire tourism industry with 20 million visitors) - airline travel is **down** **70%**, land travel is **down** **45%**, and **85%+** of tourists survey say they cancelled their US trips.\n\n**4. Here's how I'm planning on using this information to make stock trades into specific companies both long and short:** I'm shorting airlines that have high exposure to Can-US routes (it's been reported that airlines are slashing these routes due to 0 demand, and they is no clear way they can cover this revenue gap with a lower utilized fleet). I'm shorting select hospitality chains (hotels, restaurants) with high exposure/retail foot print in US states that border Canada like Niagara Falls. The US travel association says that even just a 10% dip in tourists will lead to $2 billion in economic losses and 140,000 jobs at risk (assuming 70% decrease from air travel happens across the board, that's $14b), I expect hospitality to have lower revenues. I'm shorting all non-essential or higher price retailers with a big footprint in hostility states, all these workers being laid off by lack of tourism + the fed job cuts won't have as much to spend (not my specific trade, but an example would be short Target, long Dollar General).\n\nI'm long, and buying, non-American/Europe hotel chains and travel booking platforms that get most of their revenue outside the US, as I expect Canadian and international tourists to concentrate their spend to Europe/Asia/Oceania travel this summer.\n\n**Edit 5. How do the European/International figures play?**\n\nIt's important to note that the Canadian tourism numbers dipped after the policies that happened in point 2. And we're seeing what those numbers are a few months later now. The US admin is rolling out these policies across the board tomorrow during \"Liberation Day\". The point here is that we won't see the true vector of an internal tourism boycott both in terms of magnitude and direction until the policies that were enacted on Canada are enacted globally, and consumers have time to adjust behaviour. But if the Canadian consumer is any indication, I have more conviction in my trades. **A glimpse into this being a trend is a French travel company reporting to Bloomberg their Europe to US travel bookings are down 25%.**\n\n**Edit 6. Example of the airline play**\n\nYes I know US airlines are already down a lot. Rode that wave and exited my shorts. Now I'm shorting Air Canada and ONEX (parent company of WestJet), since they have much more exposure to US-Can routes, and are cutting routes dramatically with no increase in capacity elsewhere\n\nAlso looking to short airline maitence companies, the food suppliers specific to flight food, and fuel refineries/storage those two airlines use, and retail stores with large exposure to airports that only see US/Canada travel.\n\nBut going long on regional air craft hangers since their smaller fleets are used the most for US/Canada travel, while their bigger fleets will still be active for the europe/asia flight routes that havn't seen impact on demand.\n\nWould like to hear what everyone thinks about this trade play. Thanks!\n\n**Source for numbers used**\n\n* [https://theconversation.com/tourists-are-cancelling-trips-to-the-us-heres-how-this-could-affect-its-economy-252858](https://theconversation.com/tourists-are-cancelling-trips-to-the-us-heres-how-this-could-affect-its-economy-252858)\n* [https://www.ustravel.org/press/potential-results-decline-canadian-travel-united-states](https://www.ustravel.org/press/potential-results-decline-canadian-travel-united-states)\n* [https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/28/world/canada/air-canada-flights-seats-us.html](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/28/world/canada/air-canada-flights-seats-us.html)\n* [https://financialpost.com/news/canadian-us-shopping-trips-dwindle](https://financialpost.com/news/canadian-us-shopping-trips-dwindle)\n* [https://www.discovercars.com/blog/us-travel-tourism-statistics](https://www.discovercars.com/blog/us-travel-tourism-statistics)\n* [https://globalnews.ca/news/11080371/canadian-woman-detained-ice-example-immigration-border/](https://globalnews.ca/news/11080371/canadian-woman-detained-ice-example-immigration-border/)\n* [https://www.express.co.uk/news/world/2028592/us-tourism-suffer-billion-drop-donald-trump](https://www.express.co.uk/news/world/2028592/us-tourism-suffer-billion-drop-donald-trump)\n* [https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-04-01/european-tourists-start-avoiding-the-us-as-unknown-territory](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-04-01/european-tourists-start-avoiding-the-us-as-unknown-territory)",

      "text": "I don’t see many in the investing world talking about this.\n\nDelinquency credit reports are landing for 9.2 million people (**43% of Americans with payments due**), due to hitting the 90 day mark of missed payments since late 2024’s resume of credit reporting on federal student loans.  \n\nWhy is this important? Student loans are dispersed by semester, not consolidated. While 1 payment is typically made, it’s spread out to 8+ loans. Missing 1 payment (as 9.2 million, 43% have now done) shows up on credit reports as 8+ missed payments, **tanking credit scores by 130-250 points overnight** (I personally know someone who just lost 200). \n\nYou can see stories gaining traction on here of those home/car shopping, only to see this credit hit. Does this effectively remove or significantly hinder 9 million from the borrowing economy? The effect may be 2 fold, with this being the first time those borrowers actually have to start sending $ to those loans. \n\nTried adding news link but couldn’t. \n\nEdit: this just accounts for past due. Those currently due (another 13 million people) could follow suit when they become delinquent",

I planned for years to start investing my own money pretty much as soon as I turned 18, but a couple of weeks ago my parents said they would give me access to my savings and could use that to invest/ put into a bank account etc. \n\nThe amount was higher than I had expected and of course I’m really happy and it will be such a useful starting point for investment. I intend to top up the investment fund monthly with spare money which I get from my job. I plan on using Trading 212, and putting the majority of the money into the S&P 500, a bit into the FTSE, and a tiny amount into a few others (I have QQQ, VUAG and VUSA written down but I can barely remember what they are and will do more research). \n\nThe problem is, I keep seeing in the news/online about how, due to many things but especially the election of Trump, the economy is in a bad place right now and the stock market is very volatile. I don’t mind if the ROI is below average, I just don’t want to lose any money - especially my savings, which has been saved up my whole life by my family and could mess up my future if I lose. Should I invest now or wait a bit? Thanks!\n\nTLDR - I’m turning 18 and have got some money to invest, but am unsure due to state of economy/ stock market.",

      "text": "China economy is going to continue to crash if property price goes up again, and there's no property tax. The current price-to-income ratio is 20-30.\n\nChina seems to reverse their stance on making property price to fall, they want the price to stabilize and rise in the long term. But I think this is going to be a toxic medicine.\n\nThis is because with a falling property market, people generally felt \"poorer\" and cut their spending and economy becomes bad in general. Thus China wants to stimulate economy by making people feel \"wealthy\" again.\n\nThe problem is, even after this devastating property price drop, the property average price-to-income ratio in China is still 20-30, even in poorer cities. In simpler words, citizens need 20-30 years of salary to purchase a home. To compare, US has an average ratio of 4 and New York is 10, most European countries is 5-10 as well.\n\nSo bumping the property market isn't a healthy solution in the long-run, teaching Chinese citizens to long-term invest in stocks will be, if the main goal is to make citizens feel \"wealthy\" and spending more.\n\nIn addition, China doesn't have a property tax like United States, so China cannot charge properties at a 1-2% yearly tax on their net worth. So even if property prices go up, it won't really benefit the government much, nor citizens (Because most people own and live in 1 home).\n\nI understand the difficulty faced by the Chinese government, because there are too many stakeholders on high property prices, it's impossible to just make property price fall to a 5-10 price-to-income ratio in short term. However, this will be at the expense of everybody, including homeowners.\n\nLet me know your thoughts, or correct me if I'm wrong.",

      "text": "Hey everyone,\nI’ve been looking into Iceland a lot layely, especially after seeing they now have a [single-country ETF](https://icelandetf.com). It made me wonder about something kind of unusual that could play a factor, volcanoes.\n\nI remember when Eyjafjallajökull erupted in 2010, shutting down flights across Europe for days. At the time, it caused a lot of chaos, but it also helped Iceland. Tourism jumped by over 300% in the years after, and the country got a ton of attention from people who had never really thought about visiting before.\n\nNow with more recent volcanic activity near the Blue Lagoon (which is temporarily hurting tourism), I’m wondering:\nIf there’s another big eruption, would it actually help or hurt Iceland’s economy in the long run?\n\nOn one hand, flight disruptions and safety concerns could hit tourism and the economy short term. But on the other, it might bring Iceland back into the spotlight again and boost visibility like it did before.  \n\nI’ve already got a good chunk invested, I’m just curious about if I should invest more, or if I should put it somewhere else Nordic that’s less affected by volcanos and move it back to Iceland after the initial down-tick a large scale eruption is likely to cause.",

      "text": "While startups around the world have tried to build vehicles that can fly without a pilot, only one is certified to carry people — in China.\n\nU.S.-listed [Ehang](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/EH/) received this certification from China’s aviation regulator in late March, and the company plans to begin operating flights for tourists [along a few designated routes by the end of June](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/04/04/china-may-see-flying-taxis-in-three-years-ehang-predicts.html). The vehicle, known as an eVTOL aircraft, carries two passengers and uses electric power for vertical take-off and landing, similar to a helicopter.\n\n“Ehang should maintain 100% market share in China over 2025-27, as the strict \\[the Civil Aviation Administration of China\\] airworthiness process poses a high entry barrier to new entrants,” Bank of America Greater China industrials stock analysts said in a May 14 report.\n\nThey initiated coverage of the stock with a “buy” rating, and predict the stock can reach $26 — 36% above Friday’s close. The stock is up more than 20% for the year so far.\n\nThe analysts expect Ehang to benefit from national policy support and faster-than-expected delivery to tourism customers.\n\nEhang also [ranked first among global players](https://aamrealityindex.com/f/advanced-air-mobility-reality-index-april-2025-release) as the most likely to reach the thousand-unit-a-year milestone through widespread certification and adoption, according to a recent report from U.S.-based SMG Consulting.\n\nU.S.-based rival [Joby Aviation](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/JOBY/), whose shares have dropped 9% year to date, ranked fourth. Fifth in the rankings was [Archer Aviation](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/ACHR/). Its shares are up 36% for the year. The company on Thursday announced it will be the official air taxi provider for the [Olympic Games in Los Angeles in 2028](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20250515642674/en/Archer-Selected-as-the-Official-Air-Taxi-Provider-of-the-LA28-Olympic-and-Paralympic-Games-and-Team-USA-in-Exclusive-Deal).\n\nBank of America does not currently cover either stock.\n\nThe [U.S. Federal Aviation Administration](https://www.faa.gov/air-taxis) has been [working on certification rules](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/06/05/archer-aviation-faa-signoff.html) for allowing the companies to fly their vehicles with passengers in the U.S., although initial focus is on piloted flights.\n\nIn contrast, China has accelerated its efforts [in the last two years](https://www.globaltimes.cn/page/202503/1329853.shtml) to develop what it calls the “low-altitude economy.”\n\nAbout 300 local Chinese governments have announced related plans as of April 2025, which include investment in infrastructure for eVTOL operation and business subsidies, the Bank of America analysts said in a separate May 14 report about the overall industry.\n\nEhang’s certified model, the 216-S, sells for about 2.39 million yuan ($330,000) in China, and $410,000 outside China, the report said. It noted that the larger, 4-seat Joby S4 sells for $1.3 million.\n\n“We conclude that the central gov’t sees the development of low-altitude economy as the crucial strategic industry to China’s economy in the coming few years,” the analysts said.\n\nThe policy also covers support for using drones to deliver food and supplies to tourist sites in the mountains. Such tests [gained popularity over the May 1 Labor Day](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/05/07/cnbcs-the-china-connection-newsletter-tourism-surge-defies-slowdown.html) holiday in China.\n\nSeveral Chinese companies from Xpeng to Volant are also working on flying devices that carry people. Short-haul aerial vehicles can also help with firefighting and emergency services.\n\nFor Ehang, the Bank of America analysts predict each tourist attraction will want to buy five to 10 eVTOLs, supporting a total potential China market of 80,000 units.\n\nIn the near term, they estimate Ehang’s delivery volume will reach 442 units this year, and 813 next year. “This will translate into 103%/82% revenue growth in 2025/26E,” the report said.\n\nAnother, more distant, area of potential growth is the urban air taxi market.\n\nWhile the analysts expect tourism to be the main driver of demand in the near term, they expect air taxis to grow their share starting from the year 2035. Based on the current taxi and ride-hailing car market, Bank of America estimates total demand for eVTOL air taxis could reach 200,000 units in the future.\n\n“If the annual revenue per air taxi could reach RMB1.5mn by 2035, the air taxi operation will be profitable and … should bring incremental revenue and earnings to Ehang in the long term,” the analysts said.\n\nBut the Bank of America analysts cautioned that any accident or passenger injuries could result in reputational damage for Ehang, on top of potential legal claims. Significant incidents could also slow the pace of eVTOL adoption, the analysts pointed out.",

Now, it seems the U.S. is heading into a recession—if it isn't already in one—and at this point, nobody knows how severe it might become.\n\n2.) If Trump announced tomorrow that the U.S. would stop paying interest on Treasuries held by China for example, absolutely nobody would be surprised.

      "title": "Why Tarrifs Might Not Actually Happen on Tuesday",
      "text": "I'm calling b******* on Trump's supposed tariffs that he's going to implement on Tuesday. Something about it has always seemed fishy to me and below is my analysis of why it probably won't occur on Tuesday.\n\n\n*   **The Oddity of Tuesday Implementation**: I find it strange that the tariffs are set to take effect on a Tuesday, not immediately. This delay creates an \"optionality\" for Trump, leaving room for other events to occur. If Trump is serious about imposing tariffs, then it would make sense to do it immediately, however, the delay to Tuesday doesn't allow enough time for the economy to find alternative sources of supply. Here are some possible reasons:\n\n    *   **Market Reaction**: The delay allows Trump to observe the market's reaction on Monday. If the markets react very negatively then maybe Trump would want a way out.\n\n    *   **Judge Intervention**: The delay may allow a judge to step in and block the tariffs, giving Trump a way to say he did what he promised but was stopped by the \"deep state.\" This way, Trump can fulfill his promise and blame someone else for not being able to fully carry it out.\n\n     *   **Covering Short Positions**: Trump might need Monday to allow a fund to cover a short position, which would be a bet that the market would go down. After this happens, he or a fund associated with him could then buy up those same positions after the market dip.\n\n  *    **Delay and Control:** If Trump was serious about the tariffs, they would have been implemented immediately. The delay is indicative of a desire to have more control over the narrative and potentially profit from the volatility created by the tariffs.\n\n\n*   **Why Not Act Immediately?** If Trump truly believed in the efficacy or necessity of the tariffs, he would have implemented them right away, maybe even on Sunday or Monday morning. If he were concerned about a judge blocking the tariffs, his style would be to put them in place immediately and then let the judge try to overturn them. The fact that he's waiting until Tuesday is \"telling\" and suggests that there is something else going on.\n\n\n*  **The Petty Argument**: Trump may be motivated by a dislike for the left-leaning governments of Canada and Mexico, which could be a reason for the higher tariff rates applied to them, compared to China. Kind of like \"sticking it to the libs\". There is a nationalistic argument for the tariffs, but the higher rates on Canada and Mexico don't make sense.\n\n\n*   **Market Manipulation**: Trump is creating the volatility that he can profit from, and since he pretty much owns the justice department and the SEC, they won't investigate.\n\n\n*   **A Bloodbath on Monday:** A \"bloodbath\" in the markets on Monday opens and an even bigger one on Tuesday when the tariffs are supposed to go into effect. The market's reaction may cause Trump to look for a way out of the tariffs.\n\n\nTLDR: In essence, Trump's actions, particularly the delay in implementing the tariffs until Tuesday, are not about standard policy or even national interest. Rather, they might be part of a larger scheme for personal gain, political maneuvering, and a way to solidify his power.",

      "title": "In-Depth Analysis of EHang: Why I Believe the Future of Low-Altitude Economy Lies Here?—A First-Person Perspective from an Analyst: Moat, Financial Inflection Points, and Valuation Expectations",
      "text": "I also posted this DD in another sub.\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/CattyInvestors/comments/1juurkb/indepth\\_analysis\\_of\\_ehang\\_why\\_i\\_believe\\_the/](https://www.reddit.com/r/CattyInvestors/comments/1juurkb/indepth_analysis_of_ehang_why_i_believe_the/)\n\nI. **Business Advantages**: Why Are the Three Moats in My Eyes Difficult to Shake?\n\nAs an analyst tracking the eVTOL track, I have always believed that EHang's moat has not been fully priced by the market. The following is the core logic supporting my judgment:\n\n1.**Resonance between Demand and Policy**: The \"Favorable Timing and Location\" of the Low-altitude Economy\n\n●**Market Size Estimation**: I have observed that the global eVTOL market is expanding at an annualized rate of 45% (from $35 billion in 2025 to $300 billion in 2030), and the policy support in the Chinese market far exceeds expectations. In 2024, the \"Government Work Report\" listed the low-altitude economy as a \"new growth engine\" for the first time, and subsidy policies in local governments such as Guangzhou and Hefei (with a maximum subsidy of 30 million yuan per project) have entered the practical operation stage. This pattern of dual-wheel drive by policy and market leads me to define 2025 as the \"first year of commercialization of the low-altitude economy.\"\n\n●**EHang's Positioning Advantage**: While its peers are still struggling with airworthiness certification, EHang has already obtained four major certificates: TC, PC, AC, and OC. This means that while its competitors' products are still being debugged in the laboratory, EHang's EH216-S can already charge for passenger transport in the pilot areas of Hefei and Shenzhen. This time difference brings at least a 2-3 year exclusive period, which is sufficient to capture early high-profit scenarios (such as scenic area sightseeing and high-end commuting).\n\n2.**Technological Iteration**: Breaking through the \"Life and Death Line\" of Endurance and Cost\n\n●**The data of solid-state batteries surprised me**: In November 2024, the EH216-S equipped with the battery from the Hefei Research Institute had an endurance of 48 minutes (a 60% increase compared to the original model), and the test team privately revealed that the target of the third-generation battery to be mass-produced in 2025 is directly 60 minutes. This means that a single flight can cover the straight-line distance from Shanghai Pudong to Hongqiao (37 kilometers), which may open up the imagination space of Urban Air Mobility (UAM).\n\n●**The evidence of cost reduction in the supply chain**: The motor jointly developed with Zhuhai Enpower is expected to reduce the cost of the power system by 20%. In my research, I found that the unit cost of EHang in 2024 has dropped from 1.8 million yuan to 1.55 million yuan. With the commissioning of the automated production line (the second phase of the Yunfu base), the cost is expected to be reduced to below 1.4 million yuan in 2025, which is crucial for the overall gross profit margin to return to 65%.\n\n3.**Production Capacity and Orders**: From \"Telling Stories\" to \"Real Delivery\"\n\n●**The delivery data refutes the doubters**: EHang delivered 78 aircraft in Q4 2024 (a year-on-year increase of 239%), and the annual delivery of 216 aircraft far exceeded the market's initial expectation of 150 aircraft at the beginning of the year. More importantly, the order structure has shifted from government pilot projects to commercial customers. Xiangyuan Culture and Tourism signed a contract for 200 aircraft at one time for scenic area operation, and the sightseeing projects in multiple cities have generated stable cash flow.\n\n●**The production capacity layout reveals ambition**: I have visited the Yunfu base on the spot, and the debugging progress of its automated assembly line is one month faster than expected. After the production capacity of 1,000 aircraft is realized in 2025, with the regional coverage of the Hefei/Weihai bases, EHang is fully capable of increasing the delivery volume to 3,000 aircraft within 2 years, which will be 3 times the current market consensus.\n\nII. **Financial Verification**: Why Do I Think the Profit Inflection Point Has Arrived?\n\nFacing the financial report data, the market is always torn about the \"GAAP loss\", but my model shows that the non-GAAP profit is the real signal:\n\n**Revenue Explosion**: eVTOL Has Transformed from a \"PPT\" to a \"Money Printer\"\n\n●In the company's revenue of 456 million yuan in 2024, Q4 accounted for 36% (164 million yuan), verifying the effect of production capacity ramping up. According to the current delivery rhythm, I estimate that the revenue in Q1 2025 will exceed 200 million yuan (a month-on-month increase of 22%). The annual guidance of 900 million yuan is on the conservative side. And now that the OC certificate has been approved as scheduled, it shows that the revenue from operation services is feasible. Assuming that the annual revenue per aircraft is 2 million yuan, if it can cover 3,000 scenic areas (5 aircraft per scenic area), the potential scale of operation revenue is about 30 billion yuan, which will open up the second growth curve.\n\n2. **The Mystery of Gross Profit Margin**: Short-term Pain, Long-term Brightness\n\n●Many people are worried about the decline of the gross profit margin from 64.1% to 61.4%, but when I disassembled the cost structure, I found that the one-time investment in the airworthiness modification of EH216-S has pushed up the unit cost, and this factor will be eliminated in Q2 2025. More importantly, the gross profit margin of operation services can be as high as 75% (only 58% for hardware). As the proportion of service revenue increases from 5% to 20%, the overall gross profit margin may return to over 65% by the end of 2025.\n\n3. **Cash Generation Ability**: An Underestimated Survival Chip\n\n●EHang's operating cash flow has been positive for 5 consecutive quarters, and the cash on hand of 1.155 billion yuan is sufficient to cover 3 years of R&D investment. Compared with Joby Aviation, which burns money at an astonishing speed (an annual loss of $400 million), EHang's \"self-cash generation\" ability makes me think highly of its risk resistance.\n\nIII. **Valuation Divergence**: Where Exactly Is the Market Wrong?\n\nCurrently, EHang's market value corresponds to a PS of only 15 times in 2025, while that of its peer Joby is as high as 69 times. This huge disparity puzzled me until I discovered two major cognitive differences:\n\n1.**The Market Underestimates China's Policy Execution Ability**\n\nOverseas investors have difficulty understanding the promotion speed of the \"Chinese low-altitude economy\". Shenzhen has built the world's first city-level low-altitude dispatching system, and Hefei plans to lay out 500 takeoff and landing points in 2025. The implementation of these infrastructure projects will directly increase the utilization rate of eVTOL, while their counterparts in Europe and the United States are still arguing with the FAA about the regulatory framework.\n\n2.**The Revenue from Operation Services Has Not Been Priced**\n\nThe current valuation only reflects hardware sales, but EHang is piloting a \"profit-sharing model\" in scenic areas such as the Dabie Mountains (a 30% commission on each flight revenue). If this model works, the proportion of operation revenue will exceed 20% in 2025, and the valuation system will shift to that of a SaaS company (8-10 times PS), which means at least a 50% room for correction.\n\nIV. **Risk Warnings**: The Three Major Risk Points I Closely Track\n\nAlthough I am optimistic in the long term, I do not shy away from risks. The following are the variables that may subvert the logic:\n\n1.**The Mass Production of Solid-state Batteries Is Delayed**: The technical route of the Hefei Research Institute has not been tested in winter low temperatures. If it cannot be mass-produced in Q3 2025, the endurance advantage will be diluted.\n\n2.**Local Government Debt Drags Down Infrastructure Construction**: The construction of low-altitude takeoff and landing points depends on government investment. If the fiscal policy is tightened, it may lead to lower-than-expected implementation of scenarios.\n\n3.**Intensified Competition**: The entry of international competitors such as Joby (PS 69 times) and domestic competitors such as XPeng Aeroht (with pre-sales exceeding 3,000 aircraft) may squeeze market share and affect the valuation premium.\n\n**Conclusion**: My Positioning Strategy and Key Nodes\n\nAs an analyst with a heavy position in EHang, my operation logic is very clear:\n\n●**In the short term**: The approval of the OC certificate (Q1 2025) and the delivery volume in Q1 (target of more than 200 aircraft) are the catalysts for the stock price. If the stock price falls below the 20-day moving average, reduce the position periodically.\n\n●**In the long term**: Hold until the end of 2025. The target price corresponds to a PS of 8 times in 2026 (revenue of 2 billion yuan), and the expected upside is 120%.\n\n**Finally, a reminder**: eVTOL is not a short-term speculation concept, and one needs to endure the fluctuations of policy and technological iteration. But if you believe that the urban sky will eventually be reshaped, EHang may be the sharpest spear in the next decade.",

      "title": "Trade Wars and Treasuries, or, How I Learned to Start Worrying and Watch the Bonds\n(A longform ELI5 explainer on why the bond market is reacting — and why that's dangerous)",
      "text": "OK Reddit, I have been asked to synthesize a few ELI5 posts I made over the past week into an explainer, because folks found them helpful.  Believe me, it’s an exciting action story, covering the fall of Randy Reliable, cutthroat geopolitical macroeconomics, and some face-punching.  And you’ll learn why people in the know are worried. \n\n**TL;DR**: Bond yields aren’t just a number — they’re a signal of trust. And when the 10-year treasury starts rising during a market crash, it’s not a good sign. It means the world is losing faith in the U.S. Here’s why that’s dangerous, what it says about our leadership, and how macroeconomic pressure is the new frontline in geopolitical power.\n\n## **Trade Wars and Tariffs, or, *How I Learned to Start Worrying and Watch the Bonds***\n\nOver the past two weeks, equity markets have plummeted in response to Trump’s “Liberation Day” tariff announcement.  However, by the middle of last week, the 10-year treasury yield began to rise sharply overnight. Those in the know started to worry- a lot.  The following day, Trump significantly revised some of his tariff policy, citing bond market “queasiness.\" This brief primer is designed to help ordinary folks understand the basics and gain the macroeconomic literacy necessary to grasp these times, what may be happening, and why it is so concerning. \n\n## **What is a Treasury Bond?**\n\nImagine the U.S. government borrows money from people for 10 years and promises to pay them back with a little extra (interest). That “little extra” is called the yield. A treasury is essentially that. It’s an instrument through which the government borrows money and agrees to pay back more after a certain period of time.  So the 10-year treasury is a loan the government will repay in 10 years with a bit more.\n\nLet’s say I buy a treasury for $10 and receive $11 back from the government over 10 years. That’s a 10% return over its lifespan, or about 0.96% annually if compounded, but approximately 1% per year if simplified. We refer to that as a 1% yield.\n\nWhy does selling bonds cause prices to decrease? It's simple: supply and demand, just as selling stocks lowers their prices. When you suddenly sell a large quantity of anything, the price drops because supply exceeds demand.\n\nNow let’s say I sell that bond for $8 because someone is dumping bonds and prices are falling. That bond still pays $11 over its life. So the person who buys it from me is getting a $3 gain on an $8 investment — or a 37.5% total return over 10 years. This translates to about a 3.2% annual return (compounded) — a big jump from the original 1% yield! \n\nAs you can see, when bond prices go down, yields go up — they move inversely.\n\nThis is worth emphasizing:  The U.S. always repays the same amount ($11) regardless of how much someone later buys the bond for on the secondary market ($8).\n\n- If the bond sells for $12 later, the U.S. pays back $11.\n\n- If the bond sells for $10 later, the U.S. pays $11.\n\n- If the bond sells for $8 later, the U.S. pays $11.\n\nThe reason the yield changes is not due to what the U.S. repays, but because the secondary market buyer paid a different amount for that return.   Making back $11 from a $12, $10, or $8 investment results in different profits, and thus different yields.\n\nWhy would someone sell a bond for $8 at a loss that is guaranteed to eventually pay $11 (in 10 years)?  Because they need the $8 now and don't want to wait 10 years for the bond to mature!  Or they might think they can get better than a 3.2% return by investing the money elsewhere.  Just as it makes sense for you to withdraw money from your bank account, even if it's guaranteed to earn you 2% interest, because you need to pay your rent or because you believe you can do better than 2% by YOLO-ing into 0-day TSLA puts.\n\n## **Why Should I Care About the 10-Year Treasury?**\n\nRemember my example where I sold my bond for $8, which caused the yield to rise to 3.2%? Now, when the government needs to borrow money again, it can’t offer the previous 1% yield. Why? Because people can simply buy that 3.2% yielding bond on the open market. To stay competitive, the government must raise the interest rate on new bonds to satisfy market demands. As a result, it ends up paying more to borrow money.\n\nThink about it this way:  Imagine you’re a builder in a town called Springville. For years, you’ve successfully sold one-bathroom houses for $100,000. However, Springville has evolved. It's now a family-oriented town, and everyone wants two bathrooms. The one-bathroom homes you previously built are now selling for only $50,000 on the resale market, as buyers realize they will need to spend an additional $50,000 to add a second bathroom.\n\nHere’s the issue: You can’t continue building one-bathroom houses and expect to sell them for $100,000. Buyers won’t be interested. Why would they, when the market values a one-bathroom home at $50,000?\n\nIf you want to maintain that $100,000 price tag, you’ll need to provide more value, such as including the second bathroom from the beginning. The same applies to the U.S. Treasury. If it wishes to keep issuing debt, it has to match what the market currently provides. Otherwise, investors will simply look elsewhere.\n\nYou might say:  Well, so what? I don’t care what the government pays in interest.  Not my problem!\n\n*Oh, it is very, very much your problem.*\n\nThis is because the 10-year treasury yield is a benchmark.  Many other loans (like mortgages, car loans, student loans, and business loans) key off of it.\n\nSo when the yield goes up, it means the U.S. government has to pay more to borrow — and so do you.\n\nHigher yields = higher interest rates across the board.\n\nThat’s bad for:\n\n- **Homebuyers** – higher mortgage rates = higher monthly payments\n\n- **Businesses** – higher borrowing costs = harder to invest, hire, or expand\n\n- **The government** – more of the federal budget goes toward interest payments instead of programs like schools or infrastructure\n\n- **The stock market** – investors shift money out of stocks and into safe, high-yielding bonds, pushing stock prices down\n\nBasically, because so many interest rates are tied to the 10-year treasury yield, any increase in that yield raises the cost of capital for the entire economy. Getting money becomes more expensive. Business slows down. At the same time, stock prices drop.\n\nIt’s a double whammy.\n\nThat’s why people watch the health of the treasury market so closely — because it impacts nearly everything in the economy, even if you don’t own a single bond yourself.\n\n## **Why is the 10-Year treasury such an important benchmark?**\n\nI want to say “just because” — but that wouldn’t satisfy you.\n\nIt’s not that the 10-year treasury must be the benchmark, but it’s the one everyone watches because it hits the sweet spot.\n\nTreasuries (so far) are considered “risk-free.” They’re backed by the U.S. government and are super liquid. That liquidity and low risk provide the market a ton of real-time data about inflation expectations and the overall cost of capital. So they’re a natural baseline for figuring out what riskier borrowing should cost.\n\nImagine you have a friend, Randy Reliable, who’s always good for his money. Everyone is willing to loan him money at 2%. He borrows a lot, so there’s plenty of data on what rate people charge him — and you can be confident that 2% is the right baseline.\n\nThen Sam Suspicious comes along and wants to borrow. You don’t know exactly what to charge him, but since you know what Randy pays, you simply add a risk premium to that. That’s how the market treats borrowers — it builds off the known “risk-free” rate.\n\nBut why the 10-year treasury specifically? It’s not too short (like a 2-year) or too long (like a 30-year). It captures market expectations about inflation, economic growth, and Fed policy over a medium-to-long horizon, making it the go-to reference point for many long-term loans.\n\nMany countries have their own 10-year bond benchmarks, but Randy Reliable, the U.S. 10-year treasury, remains the gold standard globally.  In Europe, most euro-denominated contracts don’t key off the U.S. treasury. Instead, the German 10-year Bund is the de facto benchmark; it’s seen as the most stable and liquid bond in the Eurozone.  Other examples include:\n\n- UK 10-year Gilt – a common benchmark for domestic British rates.\n\n- Japanese 10-year  – used domestically, though heavily influenced by BOJ policy.\n\n- Chinese 10-year – also exists, but tends to be more policy-driven and less market-transparent.\n\nThese bonds exist and are useful, but their reliability and global relevance can vary, especially when markets perceive a government as unstable, opaque, or overly interventionist.\n\nThe US 10-year beats these because it checks all the boxes:\n\n- Deep liquidity\n\n- Transparent, market-based pricing\n\n- Long track record of stability\n\n- Dollar dominance — many contracts worldwide are USD-denominated\n\n- Safe-haven status during global crises\n\nWhen benchmarking global risk, Randy Reliable (aka the U.S. 10Y) remains the handsome, well-dressed guy with a good credit score.  If you benchmark against another country and it suddenly does something wild (Brexit, for example), you get burned. That’s why predictability is essential — investors need confidence, not surprises.\n\n## **So It’s Good to Be Randy Reliable?**\n\nYes, it is indeed good to be Randy Reliable. The dollar’s position as the global reserve currency grants the U.S. considerable soft power. Countries often avoid financially attacking the U.S. as those actions tend to backfire on their own economies, making economic retaliation against the U.S. both risky and costly.  Additionally, high global demand for U.S. dollars keeps the dollar strong internationally, allowing Americans to purchase foreign goods more affordably.\n\nHowever, there’s a downside:\n\nA strong dollar also makes American exports more expensive, which can hurt U.S. manufacturers selling abroad.\n\nThat’s why undermining the dollar's status as a reserve currency is an unspoken (but nearly essential) goal of Trump's agenda, even if he is not fully aware of it.  Yet, it’s a perilous strategy as it significantly weakens the U.S.  A good article discussing all this can be found here:  https://www.foreignaffairs.com/united-states/how-trump-could-dethrone-dollar.\n\n## **It All Comes Down to Trust and Predictability?**\n\nNow you’re getting it.  The yield on the 10-year is seen as a key indicator of trust in the U.S. economy and its macroeconomic leadership.\n\nSo what if old Randy Reliable develops a ketamine habit and begins threatening his friends?  Well, suddenly he doesn’t seem like such a safe person to lend to. \n\nThis is why the “long part of the curve” for treasuries (i.e., 10-year, 30-year) is often seen as an indicator of the financial health of the United States economy.  Are we Randy Reliable or Randy Reckless?  That’s the question the world is asking right now, and it reflects in the yield curve. Add potential strategic bond selling pressure from China and other countries on top of that, and we have a problem.  I’ll get to that in a bit.\n\n## **The Yield is the Entire Field**\n\nSo, putting it all together, the 10-year yield is a key barometer of the health and strength of the U.S. economy and the trust in American economic leadership.  As that trust erodes, folks see the U.S. as a riskier borrower.  So the rates they’re comfortable charging to loan money to the U.S. go up. \n\nTypically, during periods of financial uncertainty, the yield on 10-year treasuries goes DOWN.  That’s because long treasuries – lending to Randy Reliable – have always been regarded as a safe haven.  Remember, it represents the risk-free rate!  When equities (stocks) weaken, investors usually shift their money into that safe place.  More buyers lead to an increase in the value of treasuries. Because value and yield are inversely related, the 10-year yield declines.\n\nBut that’s not what we saw last week!  Instead, while stock prices were falling, the 10-year yield was increasing.  That was… weird.  The markets no longer saw treasuries as their safe haven.  That’s a scary thought.  It implied a market losing faith in the United States and concluding it was actually Randy Reckless. \n\n## **Wasn’t I Supposed to Be Worried About an Inverted Yield Curve?**\n\nAren’t higher long-term bond yields a good thing?  You may have heard that an inverted yield curve is a worrisome sign.  That’s when long-term bonds have a lower yield than short-term bonds.  This situation is also anomalous because you would expect longer-term loans to have higher risk.  More time means a greater opportunity for the lender to default or for inflation to wreck you.  This higher risk typically leads to a higher rate of long-term bonds compared to short-term bonds. \n\nAn inverted yield curve is a signal.  It historically signals a recession and is worth monitoring.  Remember, when equities and other investments decline, we expect people to seek safety – like Randy Reliable – leading to a drop in 10-year yields. Therefore, while an inverted yield curve is concerning, it’s still NORMAL. It remains just a signal, not a systemic risk in itself.\n\nRising 10-year yields during market weakness present a different type of danger: strategic selling by foreign holders or a decline in confidence in U.S. creditworthiness.\n\nThat’s not a recession signal. That is the disease.\n\nThat’s a sovereign confidence event.\n\nDifferent animal. Nastier teeth.\n\n## **What Does China, Japan, and Canada Have to do with This?**\n\nNow, China has almost $800 billion in treasuries (and they are also a big buyer, which creates demand). Japan holds even more — about $1 trillion.  Canada also has a sizeable holding. These can move markets.\n\nAnd remember, even if China holds only a small fraction of the total outstanding treasuries, what matters is the float — that is, how much is being bought and sold at any given time. For example, suppose typically 1% of the houses in your city are on sale at any time. Now, a real estate mogul decides to sell all of his houses, which make up 2% of the housing stock. That’s a small fraction of all the homes in the city, but it triples the supply for sale. There aren’t enough buyers for that. So, prices drop. A lot.\n\nEven though it’s just a 2% change in total inventory, it’s a huge disruption to normal market activity. Japan, China, and Canada can impact the treasury market in a similar way. If they sell a lot at once, particularly if others are selling treasuries too, there simply won’t be enough buyers with cash ready, and that’s what we refer to as a liquidity crunch or a low-liquidity situation. Since China is a major buyer of treasuries, it can also influence the demand side by halting its purchases.\n\n## **Bond Market Chess vs. Trade War Checkers**\n\nConversely, the increase in the 10-year yield last week may have resulted from major sovereign bondholders striking the United States right where it hurts.  They can engage in macroeconomic Bond Market Chess while Trump and the United States play Tariff Checkers.  And China, Japan, and Canada wouldn’t even need to crash the market — just sell slowly and steadily, nudging the long end of the yield curve upward over time. This matches what we are witnessing now. That alone can quietly erode the U.S. economy. Think boiling frog.\n\nThe Chinese can then take the capital released from their treasury sales and reinvest it into their domestic economy — infrastructure, industrial policy, and innovation — effectively blunting the impact of a trade war. So, they’re hitting the brakes on us while stepping on the gas at home.\n\nChina is smart enough to know this, and they have the tools to do it.  So are Canada and Japan.  Indeed, the current Canadian Prime Minister, Mark Carney, is one of the smartest macroeconomic thinkers out there.  \n\nThe dollar’s status as the global reserve currency gives the U.S. immense advantages. But there’s no such thing as a free lunch, and this kind of yield exposure is the price we pay for that privilege. As the saying goes, “With great power comes great responsibility.”\n\nWhen the U.S. is strong, stable, and globally engaged, the financial pool is too deep for even China and other countries to make a splash. But if we start pulling back from the global economy, undermining our own institutions, and projecting unreliability, that’s when the macroeconomic knives can come out and actually hurt us... a lot. This is particularly true if we, through belligerent economic policies,  encourage other Western or Western-aligned countries to collaborate against American interests.\n\nThis is exactly why people like me are warning that Trump’s policies are not only misguided but also economically dangerous, fundamentally undermining American power.\n\n## **Can’t the Fed Do Something?**\n\nYes and no, but not really.  Yes, the Fed can step in and buy long-term treasuries — that’s what it did during previous rounds of Quantitative Easing (QE).\n\nBut there’s a catch: it’s much harder for the Fed to control the long end of the yield curve (10- and 30-year bonds) because those markets are massive and heavily influenced by investor sentiment regarding inflation, growth, and fiscal credibility.\n\nWhen the Fed buys bonds, it can lower yields. However, doing so aggressively on the long end could send a dangerous signal: that the Fed is suppressing risk in a manner that markets may not deem sustainable.\n\nIf the underlying issue is fiscal credibility, QE can backfire — driving up inflation fears and ultimately causing long-term yields to rise instead of fall.\n\nSo yes, the Fed can intervene, but doing so risks unmooring inflation expectations, weakening the dollar, and undermining confidence in treasury markets.\n\n## **So Why Not Just Make Those Chinese-Held Bonds Null and Void?**\n\nAfter reading this primer, many have suggested, why don’t we just declare Chinese-held treasuries null and void? We have the power to take that leverage from them!\n\nNo, we do not have that power.  Do you want to crash the entire bond market and cause the US to default on its national debt?  Because that’s how you do it.  This would be an economic catastrophe of the highest order and would make the Great Depression look like a mere blip.\n\nIt’s as if someone is out there spreading rumors about your violent tendencies.  So, in retaliation, you publicly punch them in the face. Voiding China’s notes makes about as much sense.  It simply proves exactly what the market was unsure about.    \n\nAs an example, suppose you, Charlie, Joan, Peter, and Mary each loan me $10,000.\n\nI decide I hate Peter and tell him I’m not paying back his loan and that I won’t repay it if he sells it to anyone else.  Peter’s loan becomes worthless.  This situation is called a default. \n\nCharlie, Joan, and Mary all realize that I could easily default on their loans as well.  So, they panic and sell their loans as quickly as they can because now they don’t trust me.\n\nThe value of the notes drops to zero or close to it because nobody trusts me to pay them back.\n\nNow, I go out to the market and ask for more loans.  Nobody wants to lend me money except at extortionate rates.\n\n## **What Can We Do?**\n\nUltimately, fixing this will require a great deal of time and rebuilding trust.  Unfortunately, trust is not something the Fed can print out of thin air, or that the President of the United States can enact through an Executive Order.  Trust comes from relationships and time.\n\nThere’s an old adage:  Trust takes decades to build, a moment to lose, and forever to regain.  We are witnessing that in real time.  Restoring trust may well take decades now.  There will be no easy fix.  Hopefully, now that you understand the macroeconomic issues, you can begin the hard work ahead. \n\n*Open Source Note:*\n\nFeel free to copy, share, or adapt this post — with credit — for any non-profit, political, or educational use.

      "title": "\"Past performance doesn't indicate future results\" vs \"time in the market beats timing the market\"",
      "text": "People love to parrot \"time in the market beats timing the market\" around a lot these days to deride people who are exiting. But doesn't that go against the other truism of \"Past performance doesn't indicate future results\" ?\n\nHere's the core problem: \"time in the market\" depends on the assumption that the market – especially the US stock market – will keep marching upward over the long haul. People are basically leaning on the idea that past performance will guarantee future results. The underlying conclusion? The market will inflate endlessly, so you might as well park your money in US equities and call it a day.\n\nBut what if that's not true? Let's be real: the US has held a pretty unprecedented position in the global hierarchy for decades, particularly since WW2. Free trade, stable governance, and a massive consumer-driven economy have made it the de facto \"safe haven\" for the world's wealth. It's been an environment that heavily favours investors, fuelled by policies and norms that protect capital and encourage entrepreneurialism. Or at least that was the game plan until roughly two months ago.\n\nThings are shifting now, fast. The global economic order that underpinned US dominance is under siege. We're watching protectionist measures surge, geopolitical tensions heat up, and the overall stability that investors used to take for granted is definitely not a sure thing anymore. Worst case, we might even be on the cusp of watching the US morph into one of those “faux democracies” (like Russia or Turkey), where they still do elections but only pretend to be free and fair. That’s hardly an environment where you can just assume indefinite growth and bulletproof rule of law.\n\nAnd that’s the problem with the old “time in the market beats timing the market.” It depends on the belief that the past is always prologue – that America will maintain its position, its strong institutions, its global leadership. But being top dog in the global economy isn’t some birthright that can’t be forfeited. It’s earned…and it can be lost. Especially if the US lurches toward a system where power is concentrated, institutions are weakened, and allies (or entire supply chains) get burned in the process.\n\nJapan looked unstoppable in the ’80s; then it stagnated for decades. The UK was the global financial centre for hundreds of years; now it’s not. Why should the US be immune, particularly with internal political chaos and external challenges are piling up? If trust in the rule of law collapses or there's a leader who openly sidesteps democratic checks, how confident can you be in American markets as the ultimate safe haven?\n\nNone of this means the global stock market won’t rise over time – but it does mean that where those gains happen could radically shift. Maybe emerging markets become the new kings. Maybe commodities surge amid world turmoil. Maybe some emerging tech or decentralised ecosystem ends up being the safe bet we haven’t even considered yet. You can’t just close your eyes and assume “staying in” is always the best move. That’s blind faith, and we’re past the point where faith alone can carry the day.\n\nAnd to be clear, I’m not trying to doomsay or, god forbid, even encourage anyone to pull out their investments. I’m just pointing out that blindly assuming the market will always recover - just because it always *has* - is a fallacy and a risk in itself. And maybe, just maybe, the people who *have* pulled their money out for the time being aren’t clueless idiots, but just people who have actually looked at the storm clouds gathering on the horizon and decided to hedge their bets. Maybe, at the very least, people could be a little less condescending to them.\n\nIf the game itself is changing, then clinging to the old rules feels like a losing proposition. The market might still “go up” in some form, but there's no guarantee that US equities will remain the biggest engine of global growth indefinitely – especially if American political stability continues to unravel. Past performance is not a promise, and this could be the moment we all finally learn it.\n\nFor the record, I'm still adding my monthly pension contributions to VUSA, but my existing piles (about £10k worth as I'm young and poor) were taken out more or less at the peak when Trump announced his original tariffs and showed he was serious about compromising America's position in the world. I'm also in the UK, so exchange rates are a factor for me.",

      "text": "President Trump laid down a marker for coming trade talks with Beijing, floating the idea of 80% tariffs.\n\nThat would be a rollback from the maximum 145% levies he enacted in his second term, but would still impose serious hurdles to trade between the world's two largest economies.\n\nChinese and U.S. officials, including Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, are set to meet this weekend, potentially paving the way for broader negotiations. Both sides have indicated the key objective for this meeting is to de-escalate tensions.\n\n\"80% Tariff on China seems right! Up to Scott B.,\" [President Trump posted on social media](https://www.wsj.com/livecoverage/stock-market-today-tariffs-trade-war-05-09-2025/card/trump-says-80-tariff-on-china-seems-right--XcWp3YYXHEKVcNSkBwup) early Friday.\n\nIn the meantime, new data from China showed an early tariff hit—[goods shipments in April to the U.S.](https://www.wsj.com/economy/trade/chinas-export-growth-remained-resilient-in-april-00bf93a6) fell by more than a fifth from a year earlier, while exports to Southeast Asia jumped.\n\nThe focus has shifted quickly to China after the Trump administration struck its first trade deal, with the U.K., on Thursday. That helped [stocks extended a recent run of gains](https://www.wsj.com/finance/stocks/stock-market-rally-us-uk-china-trade-409cf8fe) fueled by growing optimism over trade. Futures were subdued early Friday.\n\nInvestors will be on watch for comments from several Federal Reserve policymakers, after the Fed warned Wednesday that tariffs were raising the risks of [both higher unemployment and inflation](https://www.wsj.com/economy/central-banking/fed-keeps-rates-steady-as-tariff-uncertainty-roils-outlook-55ebe99f), and kept interest rates on hold.

      "text": "Context: mid 40’s, self-employed, homeowner.\nI’m very financially literate, but took my (investing) toys away years ago when I proved to myself I wasn’t beating the market.\n\nI now invest primary through Wealthfront, and at the start of the year my risk was set at 10/10. I’ve been steadily ratcheting it down as things get more and more uncertain, and I’m now at 2.5/10 risk.\n\nMy concern is that the standard financial return modeling used by tools such as Wealthfront may not cover the situation we are facing here in the US.  For example, as I take “risk” down, domestic bonds goes up, and foreign equity allocation is going down. I’m not sure I agree with that as an effective strategy to deal with an isolated US. As a homeowner, I’m already very exposed to the US economy, so this feels like it’s concentrating risk rather than moving to a lower risk profile.\n\nThoughts?\n\n[Edit based on some comment threads]\nThe above understates my overall risk profile after these changes. I’m an accredited investor. I’ve got a ton of other risks in the portfolio (late stage private equity, angel investments, MFR) that are much harder to migrate to lower risk levels quickly. So this liquid part is acting as a “shock absorber”.\n\n[More edits]\n“Take away my toys” means I don’t short the market or use options. I do have some individual stocks, but don’t make a habit of it. I sometimes hold vested public stock.\n\nI also make a habit to liquidate whatever crypto I receive as soon as possible. I’m not in the business of holding those risks.",

Retail sales dropped 0.9% for the month, following an upwardly revised 0.7% gain in December.. Much worse than the expected 0.2% dip. These figures are adjusted for seasonality but not inflation, which rose 0.5% during the month.\n\nExcluding auto sales, retail spending fell 0.4%, missing the forecasted 0.3% increase. A critical “control” measure, used to calculate GDP by stripping out nonessential categories, dropped 0.8%, erasing the previous month’s 0.8% gain.\n\nSince consumer spending accounts for about two-thirds of U.S. economic activity, this decline raises concerns about weaker growth in the first quarter.\n\n**Key Figures:**\n\n* **Sporting goods, music, and bookstores**: -4.6%\n* **Online retail**: -1.9%\n* **Motor vehicles and parts**: -2.8%\n* **Gas stations & food & drink**: +0.9%\n\nThe data suggests consumer momentum may be fading, leaving myself and probably many others wondering how the economy will fare moving forward.\n\nSource: [https://www.cnbc.com/2025/02/14/retail-sales-slumped-0point9percent-in-january-down-much-more-than-expected-.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/02/14/retail-sales-slumped-0point9percent-in-january-down-much-more-than-expected-.html)",

      "title": "Financial professionals mostly aren't paid to care what happens to the S&P 500 the day after tomorrow",
      "text": "Container volumes at the port of Los Angels are down this week. They'll be down farther next week. We know this because arrivals are scheduled in advance and crossing the ocean by boat takes awhile. Container volumes at east coast ports are expected to do the same thing, but on a delayed schedule, because \"Shanghai, through the Panama Canal to New York City\" is a longer trip than \"Shanghai to Los Angels\".\n\nAnd because of *that*, it's a safe bet truckers will have trouble finding work next month. Large-scale retail layoffs seem likely to follow soon thereafter. Very little can be done to stop this, because even if the tariffs on China were lifted tomorrow, it takes 3-7 weeks to get merchandise from a Chinese port to an American retail store. (Plus, I feel pretty confident saying the tariffs on China won't be lifted any time soon.)\n\nA natural question when you hear this is, \"if that's true, why isn't the stock market down more?\" And I think a lot of the answer to this question can be summed up as: **hardly anyone is paid to care.**\n\nI was going to title this post \"financial professionals mostly aren't paid to care what happens to your index funds the day after tomorrow\", but the **index fund providers** *are* paid to care... in the sense that they are paid to care about minimizing tracking error. They are paid to make sure that when the index goes up X%, the fund captures those games, and when the index goes down Y%, the fund doesn't do any worse than that. But they aren't paid to know whether the index will be up or down tomorrow. And this is not a criticism! It's not their job.\n\nWho's job is it? For **high-frequency traders**, it's pretty much the opposite of their job. Their job is to do a trade and unwind it a few milliseconds later at a penny-per-share profit. And some of the hate HFTs get strikes me as overwrought; before HFTs were skimming a penny a share off every trade, floor traders were skimming 12½ cents (because stock prices used to be quoted in eighths of a dollar). But HFTs definitely don't care about what's going to happen to the trucking industry next month.\n\nNow, despite what you may have heard, HFTs aren't the *entire* stock market. HFTs like to do small, quick trades. So instead, if somebody wants to sell half a million shares of TSLA, they might call around to various **dealers** and ask for quotes. The dealers will quote numbers below what an HFT would pay for *ten* shares of TSLA, but hopefully high enough that the seller agrees to the deal, and then the dealers will need to sell the stock to someone else, and that can't be done in a matter of milliseconds. Maybe they unwind their position over the course of 24 hours. So when the dealer gives a quote, they might be thinking about what the market could do tomorrow—but they hope that by the day after tomorrow it will be somebody else's problem.\n\nOkay, but those are the middle-men. What about **professional stock-pickers**, active mutual fund managers, long-short hedge fund managers? Unfortunately, they also aren't paid to care what the S&P 500 will do the day after tomorrow. Managers of actively managed mutual funds care how they do compared to their benchmark, which is generally an index. If the index is down, that's fine, as long as *their* stocks are down less (or perhaps realistically, for risk-averse managers, aren't down significantly more). Meanwhile, a long-short hedge fund, which buys some stocks while shorting others, wants to be able to tell its investors that whether the broad market is up or down will have *no effect whatsoever* on the fund's performance.\n\nSo yes, actively managed mutual funds and long-short hedge funds are going to take a longer-term view of stocks they are thinking of buying or selling. And yes, they will care if companies could be affected by tariffs more than others. But even if they start to suspect *every* company should be down as a result of tariffs, they're not going to smash a big red button labeled \"sell everything\", because that's not their job.\n\nMaybe it's *somebody's* job to care, but honestly it's hard to come up with a good business model based around that sort of thing. If you realize a crash is coming, but get the timing wrong, you could lose a lot of money—like if you went all-in shorting the market in 1999, when the dot-com bubble wouldn't burst until the following year. And if get the timing of *this* crash right because you bothered to look up how fast freight moves, how does that let you correctly time the next crash? It's not a lot to build a career on.\n\nHell, it's one thing to know about freight schedules, another thing to predict when the *market* will notice. It could crash tomorrow on bad first-quarter GDP numbers, or it might remain up until there are headlines about truckers unable to find work, or maybe it will take actual pictures of empty store shelves for the reality to sink in. And I certainly don't claim to know how badly the US will manage to drag the rest of the world economy down with it, which is why my money's in a mix of international stocks and international bonds, rather than simply one or the other.\n\nWhat I can tell you is this: unfortunately, you can't assume surely *somebody* would do something about it, if there were a totally predictable crash incoming. Nobody else has as much of a financial interest in what happens to your savings as you do. Act accordingly.",

Between government and tariff impacted layoffs, people are probably struggling at worst and moving into hunkering down mode at best.\n\nYet, I keep seeing the response in so many finance and investing threads to buy the dip. Have we lost touch that the vast majority of Americans cant afford to buy the dip? Because it appears that the real winners in all this will be the Top 1 percent who can buy the dip.\n\nWhen the dust settles, is there any way we can rebuild and reimagine a free market economy and investing system that benefits the bottom 50 percent instead of reinforces the top 1 percent? Does anyone have a favorite book or thinker who has offered such a solution?",

      "title": "🎭 \"Tariff Theater\": Why the 7% Rally Is a Mirage, Not a Market Rebound",
      "text": "The recent 7% rally in equities, coinciding with the Trump administration’s decision to roll back certain tariffs to 10%, has been interpreted by some as the beginning of a broader policy shift. In reality, the fundamental landscape remains unchanged. If anything, the superficial nature of the rollback only highlights the extent to which markets have latched onto optics in the absence of substantive improvement. This rally in equities has not been mirrored by the bond market.\n\nThe core dynamics of U.S. trade remain adversarial. China, the United States' largest goods supplier, continues to face high and sustained tariff exposure. The aggregate effective rate, factoring in prior rounds of reciprocal escalation, remains above 100% in several key categories. The European Union has not softened its stance, and in many areas, has reinforced its commitment to retaliatory measures. These are not temporary frictions; they are structural conflicts driven by divergent regulatory philosophies and increasingly protectionist trade regimes.\n\nThe administration’s trade team has pointed to limited agreements with smaller economies as signs of progress. But these are largely symbolic, wins on paper that have little bearing on global supply chains or multinational corporate strategy. For firms with cross-border exposure, especially in manufacturing, technology, and retail, the operating environment remains materially constrained. Cost structures have not normalized, logistics remain fragile, and geopolitical uncertainty continues to inhibit capital deployment.\n\nMultinational firms, Apple being a key example, have not seen operational relief. Their upstream suppliers are still entangled in the broader tariff gridlock, and downstream demand remains vulnerable to price transmission effects. Margins are thinning, and strategic flexibility is diminishing as firms are forced to hedge against policy volatility rather than invest into expansion.\n\nBeneath the surface, core macroeconomic indicators point to a deteriorating environment. Unemployment, while still moderate by historical standards, is trending upward. Real wage growth has stalled. Inflation, particularly in services and shelter, remains persistently elevated, even as headline CPI shows deceleration. Consumer credit delinquencies are rising. These are not the foundations of a sustainable recovery.\n\nThe current rally in equities is not being underwritten by earnings strength. On the contrary, forward guidance across several sectors has been revised downward, and earnings compression is visible in both nominal and real terms. What we are seeing in markets is not confidence, it is positioning. With liquidity abundant and volatility elevated, capital is rotating into risk on technicals, not fundamentals.\n\nTo complicate matters further, market behavior is beginning to resemble that of the late 1980s. Volatility is no longer episodic, it is persistent. The Federal Reserve’s posture remains hawkish, and the long end of the yield curve continues to rise, undermining equity valuations and tightening financial conditions in the real economy. At the same time, geopolitical dislocation is contributing to a growing perception that U.S. assets, once the global default for safe and productive capital, are no longer as insulated as they once were.\n\nForeign capital inflows are beginning to waver, and the strength of the dollar, long a source of stability, is now a headwind for export competitiveness. In this context, the idea that a marginal tariff adjustment constitutes a policy breakthrough is difficult to justify. If anything, it highlights how thin the narrative support for this rally truly is.\n\nUntil there is a credible de-escalation of trade tensions with China and the EU, a normalization of inflation and labor market conditions, and a return to earnings-led equity performance, the market remains structurally fragile. The recent rally is not a signal of recovery. It is a speculative drift, driven by hope, not data.\n\nInvestors would do well to treat it accordingly.",

I think it could have significant impacts on the global economy, causing a very real financial crisis.\n\nAI is probably in a bubble as well, there are very obvious stocks at the very least which are beyond reason, such as tesla and Palantir.\n\nThese seem to be a staple in the modern portfolio, and could contribute to an even greater loss of the wealth effect.\n\nthe wealth effect would further deteriorate as multiple compression occurs across the board in a bear market.\n\nA lot of people will probably pile on here saying that crypto wont go to zero, but factually there is only one use for blockchain technology right now and that would be a CBDC. CBDC would not have anything to do with the current coins which are being treated as ponzi schemes, and would not be related to the likes of tether or USDC. As matter of fact tether and USDC would likely stop existing as liquidity for them would dry up in an event where there is no coins to gamble on outside of them.\n\nIs the next great financial crisis going to play out something like this? and when will it occur? Historically in great bubbles they were nearing an end when political figures were stoking the fire for personal gain. It is not hard to see this playing out right now. A lot of people find comfort that there is greater acceptance of crypto, but in fact it is a sign that the party is nearing its end. History rhymes.\n\nEDIT: I have responded a lot in here, I think that I have clarified a few things with people and would like to change my wording above. Bitcoin is not a ponzi scheme, it is closer to a pyramid scheme or pump and dump. Not much more to add by responding to new comments, they all seem to be along the same lines.

      "title": "From Decentralized Hype to Centralized Risk: The Stablecoin Trap",
      "text": "The new stablecoin legislation that was pushed through the Senate this week effectively ties the U.S. Treasury to crypto, because nothing says “sound fiscal footing” like betting the government’s cash flow on digital tokens and market hype. \n\nThis new plan forces stablecoins to be backed by short-term T-bills. That creates an estimated $2–$3 trillion in new demand for government debt, which is nearly half the current size of the T-bill market. On paper, that looks like a win. In reality, it’s a circular feedback loop: Crypto demand fuels stablecoins, stablecoins buy T-bills, T-bills fund deficits. The government becomes addicted to speculative capital flows. And round and round we go.\n\nIt’ll work great, until it doesn’t. The whole setup depends on risk appetite staying high. Thing is, crypto isn’t some stable, predictable pillar of the economy. It’s a sentiment-driven casino, where whales move markets and retail euphoria inflates bubbles. Confidence in that environment can evaporate overnight.\n\nWhen the music stops, we will see a wave of stablecoin redemptions. To meet those redemptions, issuers have to dump T-bills into the open market. Yields will then spike and liquidity will dry up. Government borrowing costs jump at exactly the worst time. Suddenly, the entire short end of the Treasury curve is caught in a feedback loop running in reverse.\n\nCrypto is becoming exactly what it claimed to replace: a systemic risk the government can’t afford to let fail. And it won’t be the VC whales or offshore exchanges who foot the bill. It’ll be the taxpayers, either directly or through backdoor rescues and Fed liquidity if things unravel.\n\nOnce you tie public finance to crypto flows, the line between a market correction and a fiscal crisis starts to blur. A major stablecoin unwind won’t just hit DeFi yield chasers, it’ll slam the short end of the Treasury market. That’s when the Fed and Treasury will have no choice but to step in, to stabilize yields, backstop liquidity, and calm foreign holders.\n\nSo yeah, we’re already halfway to a too-big-to-fail bailout economy for crypto. Not because it earned that privilege, but because we let it entangle itself in the core plumbing of the financial system.\n\nThis isn’t just risky, it’s desperate. You don’t latch public finances to speculative manias unless you’re out of conventional tools. And if your fiscal strategy depends on token demand holding up, you’ve already lost the plot.\n\nWhat makes this even more dangerous is the moral hazard baked in. We’re handing fiscal stability to unregulated private actors, namely stablecoin issuers, hedge funds, and crypto exchanges, many of whom have no oversight and no skin in the game if it blows up. Just like the shadow banks in 2008, they profit on the way up and vanish when the tide goes out.\n\nThey’re calling this “financial innovation,” and anyone who questions it a Luddite. But let’s be clear: this isn’t modernization. It’s monetizing the mania and papering over structural deficits by plugging them into whatever speculative engine happens to be hot this cycle.\n\nIf this goes sideways, and history says it eventually will, it won’t just hurt crypto. It could shake global trust in U.S. debt markets, and by extension, the dollar itself. Because now our “risk-free” assets are being propped up by the same forces that gave us meme coins and NFT rug pulls. That’s how systems collapse, not with one catastrophic decision, but with a series of reckless bets made under the illusion that the good times will last forever.",

      "text": "I know this might be an unpopular opinion, but I've developed a genuine respect for Jamie Dimon over the years.\n\nThink about what he's navigated as CEO of JPMorgan Chase the 2008 financial crisis (which his bank weathered better than most), the European debt crisis, the pandemic shock, and now this high-inflation environment. Through all of this, JPMorgan has remained one of the strongest financial institutions in the world.\n\nYes, he's made mistakes and JPMorgan has paid its share of fines. But what impresses me is how he speaks with refreshing clarity in an industry full of doublespeak. When he warns about economic risks, he's usually right. When politicians from either side try to pressure him on policy positions, he maintains independence.\n\nWhile other bank CEOs have come and gone (or been forced out during crises), Dimon has maintained steady leadership since 2005. He seems to actually care about the long-term health of both his company and the broader economy rather than just quarterly numbers.\n\nIn an era where most financial leaders seem to be either political puppets or focused solely on short-term gains, I find his consistency and straightforwardness admirable. Maybe I'm in the minority, but I think the financial world benefits from having someone who calls things as they are.",

Instead, the likely outcomes are\n\n1. inflation getting permanently \"stuck\" around 3%, as we enter a 5th consecutive year of 3%+ inflation\n2. a 1990s-style asset bubble / parabolic melt-up, especially on anything AI-adjacent\n\nIt's clear inflation is not under control. Since May 2024, trailing-12-month core CPI has been perpetually stuck in the 3.1-3.2% range, and core PCE around 2.7-2.8%. (Chart: [https://www.reuters.com/graphics/USA-STOCKS/klvyqxrrqvg/inflation.png](https://www.reuters.com/graphics/USA-STOCKS/klvyqxrrqvg/inflation.png) )\n\nIn my humble opinion, it's also apparent that current interest rates are NOT restrictive in any shape or form. The federal funds rate has been at or above 4% since December 2022, with no noticeable long-term damage to any part of the economy (except OFFICE commercial real estate, for structural reasons unrelated to rates.)\n\nWhy is it that Federal Reserve officials\n\na) have effectively taken rate INCREASES off the table, instead believing that simply holding rates would be enough?\n\nb) continue to yap about (eventual) rate cuts - they're just postponed for the time being, not canceled? (Just watch Waller & Goolsbee interviews - they're \"on hold for now but still expect rate cuts later\")\n\nc) continue to believe the \"neutral\" rate is at rock-bottom pre-COVID levels? (December 2024's SEP showed half of the FOMC still thought the ideal long-run rate was in the 2's)\n\n(The above started long before last November's election, so I don't believe their dovish rate-cutting bias is politically driven. Powell was talking about cutting rates in December 2023.)\n\nI don't have an Economics PhD but have been investing & following central bank policy decisions for quite some time. To me, this seems like the most recklessly dovish  FOMC, relative to economic & financial conditions, since Arthur Burns.

Which would spell a larger looming crisis if the rest of the market cannot uphold the overall economy without the AI story in the backdrop which has been the single dominant narrative and crutch for an overall weakening economy.",

His firm was very profitable 2021-2023.  The S&P under Biden gave us + 58% or so return or so (corrected).\n\nHe recently said what the Trump stock market tank is just an ordinary cycle, and that had we not prospered so much in 2006, 2007 we would not have had the \"market correction\" of 2008.  2008 was caused by deregulation and bad loans (amongst other things).   He is gaslighting investors and all Americans\n\nHe stands to make a ton of money from an impending recession.\n\nSecretary of Commerce, Howard Lutnick, is an investment banker and worth between 2-4 billion dollars. He is on record saying Trump tariffs are \"worth it\" if they cause a recession. He has also said it's Biden's fault if we have a recession.\n\nBiden oversaw the best economy we have seen in 50 years.\n\nWhat these men have in common is both are bullshitting investors and all Americans.  Egg prices could go to $500 a dozen and they would buy the same amount of eggs they do now and not feel a thing.  They will also profit during a recession and they will be in  a great position to buy anything they want at cheap prices.\n\nNo telling how many White House insiders are shorting the S&P and other funds.\n\nIt's important that investors scrutinize the economy as well as those who are implementing policies that are degrading the market and realize when you are being gaslighted by those will profit from investor ignorance.\n\nFinally, you hear a lot of noise these days with mindless cliches: \"timing the market\" or \"panic selling\" from people who are so gas lit you should avoid smoking around them to avoid combustion.\n\nBuffet is sitting on more cash in the history of BRK and for a reason, and he has clearly said tariffs are not paid by the tooth fairy (they are paid by you and I).\n\nThe best thing an investor can do right now is understand fundamental economics and recognize when you are being gaslighted.  What you are seeing is not a market correction nor an ordinary cycle.  You're witnessing a very healthy market get tanked, and on purpose.\n\nThe irony is the market tries to love Trump.  They love his deregulation, low taxes for the rich and corporations, the end of red tape, etc.  The market loved his election win and we were seeing fresh highs.\n\nUntil he started his trade wars and threats to invade, and annex foreign countries.\n\nFinally, both Trump and Elon have said it's going to be \"painful\" for a \"while\".  It will not be painful for them.  They will feel nothing, Trump has made hundreds of millions in the last few months off of his various grifts, Elon has tanked Tesla with his Nazi antics, but it's not like he's having to go to fewer movies or tighten his budget.\n\nBeware of people telling you about weathering financial hardships from those who profit from them.",

      "text": "Another redditor posted [this question](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1ml11ly/lower_interest_rates_why/) and I got carried away with my answer.  \nIt does not fit the comment space, and I thought it may be interesting for a larger audience than the comments from the post. Please note that I do not have any political affiliation, I am not even american, and I am only providing a semi-educated commentary about the FED's job.  \n\\------------------------------------------------------------------  \nThe FED has two mandates: maximum employment and low inflation (nowadays officially 2% [FED dual mandate](https://www.chicagofed.org/research/dual-mandate/dual-mandate)).\n\nOne very simplistic way of thinking about the FED is the Taylor rule ([Taylor Rule wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_rule)): essentially, if the FED sees employment and inflation raising, it should raise rates in order to *cool* the economy. Vice versa, if employment and inflation are going down, it should lower rates in order to *heat* the economy.\n\nThis is econ 101. \n\nWhat is interesting is that, normally, the economy is mostly hit by demand shocks. We think about demand shocks as changes in the demand for goods, which, for a constant supply, increases inflation (prices are a point where demand and supply meet) and increases employment/lowers unemployment (to make more goods firms hire more labour).\n\nKeeping rates systematically below a given point (what we call r\\*), makes it so that when a demand shock hits: prices go up, unemployment goes down, labour is squeezed, so wages need to increase, which means prices go up and on and on. Effectively, this is what happened in the US - and globally - in the 70s ([the anatomy of double digit inflation](https://www.nber.org/system/files/chapters/c11462/c11462.pdf)).\n\nTherefore, economists tend to think about the economy as a series of equilibrium: there is an equilibrium interest rate (r\\*), an equilibrium unemployment rate (NAIRU or u\\*), and many other fundamentals, which we call **stars**. There **stars** tend to move for several reasons. For example, an economy in which people have high rate of unionization may have a higher NAIRU than an economy with low unionization rates. Therefore, not all economies are the same, and not all stars are the same. Here is an example from a paper I like a lot, which tracks r\\* in all major economies: [global trends in interest rates](https://www.nber.org/papers/w25039).\n\nThis is also econ 101.\n\nThere are (in my opinion) three sides of what has been going on in the US in the last 8 months.  \n  \nFirst, inflation is on an overall downward trend, but still far from the rate of 2% ([FED inflation](https://www.federalreserve.gov/economy-at-a-glance-inflation-pce.htm)). Normally, we would look at this as a trivia problem: inflation is higher than target, let's keep rates high. However, because the data we get tends to be late, we may also try to extrapolate its trend.\n\nFor example, the European Central Bank, which is basically the FED but for the majority of countries from the EU, lowered rates even when inflation was above 2%, and still managed to get it to target. You can see EA inflation [here](https://www.ecb.europa.eu/stats/macroeconomic_and_sectoral/hicp/html/index.en.html) and rates [here](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/ECBDFR). This is because they saw it was on an overall downard trend, assumed that real inflation was going to go down anyway, and took a more aggressive stance. \n\nIn October, t[he FED did the same](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/DFF). The rates were higher than now, and had been lowered as the FED was afraid that inflation would have othewise quickly gone below 2%.\n\nSecond, his is where tariffs come into play. The Fed tracks inflation expectations from the SPF ([survey of professional forecasters](https://www.philadelphiafed.org/surveys-and-data/real-time-data-research/inflation-forecasts)). The professional forecasters are not extremely good at predicting what is going to happen, but they do capture the business sentiment fairly well. Looking at the median of the surveys, you may see that after Trump's election, inflation expectations start to rise again because of tariffs.\n\nThat is because tariffs are really tricky. They are not a *demand* shock like the one we talked about before. They are a *supply* (specifically *technology/productivity)* shock. Technology shocks are a type of shock that depresses the labour market while being inflationary. For example, a new cost saving tech is introduced to the market: this makes it so that products are cheaper, so people can buy more of them, and the labour market is doing good, but inflation is below its optimal value. Dealing with supply shocks is a nightmare for economists at the FED.\n\nThe problem with technology shocks is that the two sides of the Taylor rule - inflation and employment - are not going to the same direction. Currently, if you look at inflation (or in this case inflation expectations), by all means you are supposed to *increase* rates. Inflation is raising (2.2 in April vs 2.6 in June). Inflation expectations are also rising.\n\nThird, employment. Until recently, our impression was that the labour market was doing good. If you look at the FED announcement, they cited lower demand for labour (which we track from [vacancies](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/LMJVTTUVUSM647S)) and a lower labour supply (because of the new immigration policies), but overall growing [employment](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/PAYEMS) and a very low unemployment rate (you can put [unemployment](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/UNRATE) and [NAIRU](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/NROU) in a single chart and see that unemployment is below the NAIRU).\n\nHowever, **the job revisions are signalling a recession incoming**.\n\n\\-----------------------            --------------  \nEffectively, the FED has been served a hot potato.  On one side, you have a labour market which is ***not strong*** by any metric, which means you are supposed to **lower** the rates to support the economy.\n\nOn the other side, inflation will probably raise even more now that the tariffs are starting to effectively come in. Imagine a paradox in which all you buy is 100% imported. On average, inflation would be 15% compared to the previous month, and more compared to the previous year. While this is not the case, in a scenario in which inflation is already rising, adding tariffs on top is not a good idea.\n\nSo why do [analysts think the FED is going to cut rates in September ](https://www.reuters.com/business/jpmorgan-brings-forward-fed-rate-cut-forecast-september-2025-08-08/)?\n\nIt is because a recession is probably undergoing, and it is getting worse and worse by the day. On one side, this means that the little element that gets multiplied in the Taylor rule coefficient for the labour market gets higher. On the other side, randomly raising prices means overall lower economic activity. Basically, because during a recession people are buying less goods, the prices go down because there is a declining demand.\n\nRemember the demand shock from before? Right now, the US economy is undergoing a large negative supply shock, and a semi-large negative demand shock. Both of them have negative effects on the labour market and overall economic activity. But they have contrasting effects on inflation. Realistically, the technology - tariff - shock will prevail on the demand - lower econ activity - in increasing inflation.\n\nSo, let's answer the question. Should the FED cut rates? I do not know. **But I know they will**. However, inflation will probably go back to the large levels we have seen during the pandemic.\n\n\\----------------------------------  \nFinally, one bonus question:\n\nIs Trump right when he says JPOW should have cut rates before? Basically, **no**.\n\nThe reason is very simple. Had JPOW cut rates before, inflation would have raised to over the current 2.6%, and the labour market would have been in slightly a better shape. However, the likelihood of managing inflation would have gone virtually to zero. \n\nEDIT: Fixed typos and formatting.",

      "text": "Disclaimer: This is an opinion piece, not financial advice. I may be wrong, and as ever do your own research.  \n  \nI think we can all agree that something doesn’t feel right about the current state of the US stock market.  \n   \nValuations are stretched, fundamentals appear increasingly irrelevant, and AI hype is propping up a handful of tech giants that now dominate the S&P 500. There is talk again on Wall Street about a bubble, and for good reason. While institutional investors still drive most of the volume, retail investors have become a cultural force in this market, and that influence is rarely discussed with enough seriousness.  \n   \nThe retail mantra of VOO and chill, buy the dip, market only go up etc, isn't just a meme anymore, it's a way of life for millions who are sleep walking into a situation they don't fully appreciate or understand. Social media influencers, YouTube finance channels, and TikTok traders have made passive investing and perpetual optimism trendy. With the widespread adoption of trading platforms that you can use on your phone at an instant, and zero-commission trading, newer investors are buying broad market ETFs and big tech names without always understanding the risks, or even the underlying businesses.  \n   \nTesla and Palantir are good examples . These stocks trade more on narrative than on cash flow or earnings. The enthusiasm is rooted in future potential, especially around AI, not today's performance. And in many cases, these companies are simply selling AI tools to each other or hoarding compute capacity, rather than delivering real consumer-facing monetization. There’s a circular logic at play, in that tech firms are bidding up each other’s valuations with massive cash piles, creating the illusion of demand and progress.  \n   \nMeanwhile, under the surface, the macro picture is getting gloomier. Recession indicators are flashing amber, slowing growth, falling real wages, weak consumer confidence. Layoffs are rising, particularly in white-collar and tech sectors, and corporate earnings are showing signs of strain. Add to that geopolitical tensions, unpredictable trade policies, and potential tariffs that could shock supply chains. AI, the very force driving the market, is going to accelerate job losses. If you disagree with this you are blind.  \n   \nThen there’s Trump, who seems intent of crashing the world economy. Tariffs are almost impossible to defend if you are an advocate of global economic growth, and now he is applying massive pressure to the fed to cut interest rates. And with the latest jobs report, a rate cut might well be coming. A scenario where rates are cut too early, or money is printed again in the face of economic weakness, could easily reignite inflation, especially if tariffs are layered on top. That sets up the possibility of a stagflationary cycle not unlike the 1970s, slow growth, high prices, and little room for monetary maneuvering.  \n  \nSo what happens next? I don’t claim to know for sure, but here’s what I think will happen:  \n   \nInflation will spike after the fed is forced to cut rates and tariffs start to bite. Consumer spending dries up. The AI bubble starts to burst as people realise that there is no immediate and widespread monetization route to the masses. Big tech valuations, propped up by over enthusiasm and the greater fool theory, collapse. What follows is a grinding downturn... not necessarily a 2008-style collapse, but possibly a long period of stagnation and disillusionment, for as long as 10 years. I believe the start of the downturn will happen some time in the next 12 months.  \n   \nThis isn’t a call to panic. It’s a call for realism. Passive investing is powerful, but it's not immune to cycles. The blind faith in “stock goes up” is exactly the kind of sentiment that tends to mark market tops, and has been seen many times throughout history. Make sure you remain diversified and play your own game.",

      "text": "From MarketWatch. \n\nhttps://www.marketwatch.com/story/nvidias-stock-buyback-plan-is-one-of-the-biggest-of-2024-is-that-a-good-thing-9beba5c5?mod=djem_mwnafterbell\n\n> The semiconductor company announced alongside its earnings on Wednesday that it has boosted its stock buyback authorization by $50 billion. That’s double the size of the $25 billion share-repurchase program announced a year ago\n\n> Looking beyond the year, Nvidia’s announcement is tied for the 12th-largest [stock buyback] on record. The company is one of only seven in the U.S. to have announced a buyback program of $50 billion or more. The buyback authorization is 1.7% the size of Nvidia’s market capitalization, which is about $2.91 trillion.\n\nI tend to like stock buybacks. I like them more than dividends. The company has enough faith in itself that it wants to secure more of its own profits.  If you’re spiraling down in the dumpster, there’s really no need to buy back— especially if you believe this is the High Point and it’s only going down from here.\n\nNvidia has a number of problems. One is that it has a gigantic amount of cash. It was estimated that within three years it might be able to turn out 270 billion in free cash flow\n\nBut as the big player in the market, both its own specific market and the broader market, it’s gonna have a real tough time making big deals. Meaning deals significant enough to affect the bottom line.\n\nIt’s in the old-school Microsoft phase where everything it does is gonna be examined for antitrust. Can you imagine if they tried to buy AMD or something like that? It’s never gonna happen even if it made sense and didn’t destroy competition. \n\nSo they’ve got infinite money and kind of very finite things to do with it. their purchases of other companies has been around 300 *million* this year. Which is entirely insignificant.\n\nHowever, I worry that the stock is insanely expensive. It’s noted that this gives them the option to pull the trigger whenever they want. So if there is a downturn, that’s good news for them because they’ll be able to spend triple digit billions buying themselves back.\n\nSo in one sense, you can look at this as potentially bad news. Meaning they expect enough volatility, including down swings, to make it possible and profitable to have the 12th largest buyback in history.  \n\nOR they feel they aren’t gonna drop and this is just a low point of a forever-climbing stock price.\n\nEither way it’s good for Nvidia, but it makes it tough for investors to predict. If this was anyone else, I think it would be a little bit easier, but there’s so much money and the scale is so vast that it’s hard to wrap my head around. \n\nIf they had been able to buy the dip a month or so ago, it’s astounding how much money they would’ve made. Not to mention securing more of their future profits.\n\nObviously, companies of this size don’t move that fast and they aren’t playing a shell game. So it’s merely just a thought experiment to see how much money they would’ve created out of a blip.\n\nLots of companies do buybacks, and lots of high-tech companies do buybacks. And the timing of it can generally illuminate a lot of things. But in this instance, I’m having a tough time seeing through it. \n\nIn the past, they haven’t been a really savvy financial company. They’re not doing all kinds of tricks and schemes and mergers and things to burn short sellers and whatever. They’ve just been “boring” R&D and managed to get ahead of at least three or four massive shifts in technology in the world economy. \n\nThe stock split. I had kind of considered it surprising. It just didn’t fit who they’ve been up to this point. Why does it matter if they’re 3000 or 100? I suppose it’s nice that more of the unwashed can get in on the purchase. But it seems to be a small distinction. Like how many people could afford a few hundred bucks but not a few thousand bucks? AND are buy and hold stock investors. I said at the time it wasn’t gonna move the needle whatsoever. But beyond that, I just don’t really see the point.\n\nAs I’ve said, there’s a lot of reasons to do a stock buyback. But this magnitude and at this price have left me guessing.\n\nI like to think it’s optimism of their future. And that two years from now the stock is going to be much higher. In which case it made perfect sense to buy now.\n\nThat’s my hope anyways. \n\nEdit: sorry for typos my phone won’t let me scroll back for some reason",

If AI increases productivity and profit margins for pretty much all of its businesses, if it really is that powerful, but the workforce goes down to 20% unemployment for example which is around what it was during the Great Depression, what would happen to the stock market? On one hand you’ve got huge organisations growing which would make those stocks go up in value normally, but without millions of people putting money in via their pension, 401k etc or simply through retail investing because they no longer have a job, what do people think will happen to the stock market? \n\nEDIT: I also don’t think the government will introduce UBI. Anyone who does lives in a pipe dream. Have you seen how many people are in poverty all over the world, and even in developed countries. The billionaires and Governments literally don’t care, especially the billionaires. Most of them don’t even pay tax in their own country.",

Something I have had alot of success with and has really helped me sleep at night is PUTs. I have been nervous last couple years economy wise and for $10k to $30k a year or so in portfolio \"drag\" I can buy pretty phenomenal insurance just incase. For example, bought puts against SPY/SYF/STLA this last fall through Feb bc I was/am nervous and it worked out really well. I sold out about 70% of peak value bc it was too much up/down for me and 5x'd what I had in, peak it was over 10x what I had in. I am now back in PUTs against AAPL and SPY again bc I still have same nerves and seeing market get frothy/return to pretty high levels and want to keep my \"insurance\".\n\n  \nAnyone else do this?

They’ve always just kept their money in a regular savings account with their bank. No high-yield savings accounts, no stocks, no mutual funds, and not even certificates of deposit (CDs). For decades, they’ve earned next to nothing in interest—probably less than $15 a month.\n\nGrowing up, we were a family of five. My dad earned around $85,000 a year, and my mom worked part-time, bringing in maybe $25,000 annually. We weren’t rich, but we were comfortable. They worked hard to provide for us, but they never prioritized investing or learned much about it. Now, as they’re getting closer to retirement, my dad still plans to work for a while since he runs his own business and enjoys it.\n\nIt’s honestly eye-opening to think about what could have been if they’d started investing earlier—like back in the '80s or '90s. Even a little bit in the stock market over all those years could’ve made a huge difference.\n\nFor me, I didn’t start investing until my late 20s because it wasn’t something we ever talked about at home. My parents never really understood it, so they never passed that knowledge down. It’s kind of surprising how much of an impact financial education (or lack of it) can have across generations.",

The remaining profit is then distributed to investors based on the number of shares they own.\n\nThis partnership seems to benefit ranchers in that:\n\n\\- They have no additional capital outlay, the herd and all associated expenses are funded by outside sources\n\n\\- They receive compensation for what they are outlaying (their time and effort)\n\n\\- The flexibility to continue raising their own herd in parallel to this herd without any new infrastructure or risk being taken on\n\nInvestors receive:\n\n\\-Diversification with a tangible asset\n\n\\- Access to a previously largely inaccessible market\n\n\\- Generally short turnaround time on their investment \n\nObviously this is all a gross oversimplification but it's just a concept. Would this be appealing or is this something that most ranchers would see as the juice not being worth the squeeze? What are some risks I'm overlooking or something that's not being considered?\n\nI'm trying to get feedback on the concept from various sources so appreciate your time and any feedback you can provide.",

Most of my portfolio is in ETFs and stocks, and I also hold a little bit of Bitcoin.\n\nI run my own business (it’s under my mom’s name because of my age), and each year I have to pay taxes on the profit I make. Right now, I just put part of that money aside in a savings account to cover taxes later. It earns like 1–2% a year, which isn’t much.\n\nLately I’ve been wondering: instead of just letting that money sit there doing almost nothing, should I invest it too? I won’t need it until next year anyway.\n\nOnly thing is, I’m not sure *how* to invest it. Should I just throw it into the S&P 500 like I do with the rest of my portfolio? Or should I take a different approach since it’s money I can’t really afford to lose?\n\nWould appreciate any advice. Thanks!",

Speaking during a visit to Argentina, Bessent noted that the Trump administration would use the approximately six months leading up to Powell’s term expiration to make preparations.​\n\nPresident Trump has publicly urged Powell to reduce interest rates, raising concerns about pressure on the Fed’s independence. However, Bessent stated he is not worried about Trump undermining Powell or the central bank's autonomy. He emphasized the importance of separating the Fed’s monetary policy role from its bank regulatory functions, suggesting more discussion is needed on the latter given the Fed shares regulatory duties with the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and the FDIC.​\n\nBessent also shared that he meets weekly with Powell to discuss a wide range of issues and noted there are currently no significant concerns about financial market stability or bond market developments.​\"\n\n[link here](https://www.reuters.com/world/us/bessent-says-white-house-will-start-interviewing-candidates-next-fed-chair-this-2025-04-14/)\n\nThe market doesn't seem to be caring about this news very much?

Would love to see examples of portfolio breakdowns. \n\nHave you ever experienced a similar scenario and what did you decide to do?",

That obviously won’t happen. Even if we see a slowdown in growth or a decline, search will still generate massive amounts of money, which can be used for significant buybacks—like those seen in the last quarter.\n\nTL;DR: Google is basically a fast-growing company with a PE ratio of 40, plus a “dying” business that’s still going to generate around $50 billion annually for the next five years.",

I work under my dad who is a General Contractor and I have access to tons of subcontractors and wouldn’t have to hire a GC to do the job. We would also love to possibly flip/sell a few and then keep some in the future as rental properties.\n\nAre there better business opportunities that I should consider instead of real estate?

      "text": "Congress has released draft legislative text for extending the 2017 tax cuts. The Joint Committee on Taxation has estimated the proposed legislation would add $5.6 trillion to the deficit over the next decade, to be offset by $1.9 trillion in spending reductions, for a net cost of $3.7 trillion. (Source: https://thehill.com/business/budget/5297588-republicans-tax-bill-jct/amp/ )\n\nThis is on top of a national debt figure that's already projected to rise above $50 trillion by the end of this decade without new fiscally expansionary legislation being passed.\n\nSome Republicans representing battleground states have criticized the proposed spending reductions (mainly to lower-income social welfare programs & clean energy incentives) as being politically unpalatable. Historically, when this happens, congressional leadership tends to trim down some of the cuts & throw the cost onto the deficit, because these battleground legislators are on the front lines of deciding which party wins the majority.\n\nEven the draft $3.7T cost would be by far the most expensive legislation ever passed, exceeding the 2020 CARES Act, the 2021 Rescue Plan, and the 2022 Inflation Reduction (EV incentives) Act. And it’s unlikely to be a large stimulus to economic growth, considering that most of the bill simply extends the 2017 tax reform (although there are some targeted new provisions like no tax on tips etc.)\n\nThree years ago, when Liz Truss proposed big (and largely-unfunded) tax cuts in the UK, bond investors sent Gilt yields soaring from 3.5% to 5%, requiring the Bank of England to intervene. Truss resigned as Prime Minister after only 45 days, and she lost her Parliament seat in the next election.\n\nMeanwhile, Treasury investors have remained calm. 10-year yields have settled around 4.5% in the last few days, and in fact are slightly lower today. They don’t seem to be alarmed by the exponential growth in deficits & the national debt. What explains this?\n\nThis topic isn't a political debate about the pros & cons of tax cuts & spending cuts. It's about the economic implications and impact on asset prices.",

This proposed section aims to \"weaponize\" taxes on foreign investors by significantly increasing tax rates for certain non-U.S. individuals and businesses.\n\n**Key aspects of Section 899:**\n\n* **Purpose:** It is intended as a diplomatic tool to counter what the U.S. considers \"unfair foreign taxes\" imposed by other countries on U.S. businesses and individuals. These \"unfair foreign taxes\" include undertaxed profits rules (UTPRs), digital services taxes (DSTs), and diverted profits taxes (DPTs).\n* **Mechanism:** The legislation would apply increased U.S. federal income tax rates—ranging from 5% to 20% incrementally—on certain income earned by non-U.S. persons from \"discriminatory foreign countries.\" A \"discriminatory foreign country\" is defined as any non-U.S. jurisdiction that imposes one or more of these \"unfair foreign taxes.\"\n* **Affected Parties:** The heightened tax rates would apply to a broad category of foreign persons, including foreign governments, sovereign wealth funds, individuals, corporations, private foundations, trusts, and partnerships associated with these designated countries.\n* **Impact:** If enacted, Section 899 could introduce substantial economic and compliance challenges for foreign governments, multinational enterprises, and investors. Experts suggest it could lead to the \"weaponization of U.S. capital markets\" and potentially weaken the dollar and impact European stocks with U.S. exposure.\n* **Current Status:** The bill has passed the U.S. House of Representatives and now moves to the U.S. Senate for consideration, where significant changes are still anticipated",

This move is part of the Pentagon's \"Section 1260H list,\" which now names 134 firms believed to support China's military-civil fusion strategy, where civilian tech is leveraged for military purposes.\n\nTencent, known for WeChat and major gaming investments, has denied the allegations and plans to work with U.S. authorities to clear up what it calls a misunderstanding. Similarly, CATL, a key supplier of EV batteries to Tesla, Ford, and BMW, refuted the claims, calling their inclusion a mistake and stating they have no involvement in military activities.\n\nWhile the designation doesn't impose immediate sanctions, it signals increased risk for U.S. investors and partners. Companies previously added to this list, like DJI, have faced serious business disruptions, including bans and reputational hits.\n\nBoth Tencent and CATL are expected to challenge the decision, but this adds to the ongoing tensions between the U.S. and China. Investors should keep an eye on this situation as it could impact these stocks and broader U.S.-China market relations.",

      "text": "The domestic political and geopolitical ramifications of this are going to be very interesting.\n\nThe administration is forced to either blatantly ignore the courts in the most globally, publicly recognizable way possible or capitulate and lose what leverage and respect they thought they had with every country on the planet.\n\nThey pissed off every country in the world and spat all over them at every possible occasion. And the House burned all of its political capital to squeeze by a disaster of a bill. The only way they could tell everyone it was going to be paid for was by tariffs and cuts. Tariffs just got taken out. \n\nThe funny part is it doesn’t really matter what they do — ie attempt to ignore it or get a stay and tie it up in the courts or comply (no way, that’s not their style, but it’s not impossible — in any case, it’s moot). The signal has been sent, the king has been shown to bleed. \n\nStocks may rip, but I think it will be short-lived; I’d be more willing to say bonds crash as lenders realize this will get tied up in the courts and scare off any chance of the Senate passing it in the aftermath of this disaster. It’s DOA. That’s not even considering the astronomical domestic business pressure they’re already certainly feeling as businesses across the country now have a legal decision to exempt them from anything the administration tries to do now. It’s weak but enough of a safe bet to plan around for a business leader, owner, operator to make decisions.\n\nAs for the geopolitical situation, I’d imagine there are a good number of reasons for the world to feel the bully who threatened so much to so many shouldn’t be made to atone for its hubris. Supply chains have been dramatically disrupted and reoriented and our debt and dollar depend on the world we disrespected and threatened feeling that we are trustworthy debtors and agreeable partners. The domestic factors already mentioned strongly suggest both of these tenets have been violated in scarring and long lasting ways. Enough of the world has started to meaningfully question American exceptionalism and to put (or rather begin moving) their money where their mouth is — demanding higher yields on Treasuries, the Taiwanese dollar spike, foreign currency and equity market record appreciation… you get the idea. This gives them the signal they need to begin offloading our debt based on the same risk assessment that domestic businesses are playing. There’s no way for them to fund this now and everyone now knows it can’t be furnished by force from anywhere except inside the country itself. Our debt “crisis” is now an actual crisis.\n\nSrc: https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-05-28/trump-s-global-tariffs-blocked-by-us-trade-court",

I also have a Roth IRA that I had to stop contributing to as I am over the MAGI income threshold ($230k, make $250k). Form 8606 pro-rata rules are biting me a bit hard. \n\nHowever, learning more about SEP IRA's it might be wise and most beneficial. From my understanding, doing this I can use my contributions as a deduction on my taxes, reduce my taxable potentially below the MAGI and be able to once again contribute to my Roth IRA and maximize returns. \n\n401(k) is not an option as the maintenance fees are too high. \n\nQuestions:  \n1. From my understanding, SEP IRA's MUST be not just offered but given to each employee as they are not salary deferral, but employer contributions. \n\n2. Those contributions must be EQUAL, but is that percent or dollar amount?\n\n3. If I go this route, I would not be able to do both SEP and SIMPLE, but could I make the change in the middle of the year, or best to wait until the next tax year?\n\n  \n4.  Seems I cannot rollover my Simple IRA unless it has been active over 2 years which it has, but I just transferred from one broker to another. Does that reset the 2 years?",

      "text": "My dad is an active investor, has been for decades and we talk about stocks and companies around the holidays. Yesterday we were talking about Nvidia and in our conversation there was something about AI and Nvidia and that he didn't know that I thought was common knowledge, but I'm curious how common it actually is or if it's a generational gap.\n\nThe knowledge that I thought was common was that the biggest reason Nvidia is well positioned to benefit from spending on AI is that graphics algorithms (e.g. video games, CGI rendering, etc.) and machine learning algorithms rely on the same kind of computation, large matrix multiplication. They have spent decades developing GPUs for graphics processing + other stuff, but through no effort on their own, the \"other stuff\" is now more valuable than the graphics processing. Their \"AI hardware\" is really just the most recent version of their GPUs that they sold to consumers, to Pixar, etc. not similar, they are \\*literally\\* the same thing.\n\nThey didn't somehow develop AI hardware in the past 2 years that's better than everybody else's, they've been developing the product for decades for another purpose and stumbled into the AI use case. This is also why it's so hard for a competitor to overtake them, they have a lot of ground to catch up on. Hardware development is really slow, really expensive and really difficult.\n\nThis came up in the context of my dad telling me some rumor he had heard about an ex-Nvidia current-Tesla engineer saying something about how Tesla had hardware that was years ahead of Nvidia, which is not really even remotely likely IMHO. Google has spent almost 10 years developing its TPUs for machine learning specifically and even then they're only faster in some narrow scenarios and is way more restrictive computationally.\n\nAs to why Nvidia and not AMD, it's largely because of their software stack and community support. They have put a lot of effort into developing CUDA, cuDNN, etc. and putting it in the hands of researchers starting 10+ years ago, so now it's what everybody builds on.\n\nBefore all the arm-chair experts come out of the woodwork, yes I know that GPUs are general purpose parallel processing units, but the point is that they have long been designed with graphics in mind first and foremost. And I know that they've been tailoring recent generations of GPUs more towards ML use-cases (e.g. tensor-cores) and they're not exactly like GPUs of old. And yes I know that their data-center business has long been a big portion of their revenue and they make more than just consumer graphics cards.\n\nI don't mean to discount their good work, they've done a great job in positioning themselves in the best way possible, there is a lot to be said about being able to capitalize on good luck.\n\n  \ntl,dr; the energy it takes to train ChatGPT could fry 100,000 turkeys this year (I didn't check the math)",

      "title": "Is the Tesla Bubble about to pop?",
      "text": "I’m not a Tesla expert, and I’m sure many of you have deeper insights into the company, but after watching the latest developments, I have some concerns that I wanted to share as a long time holder. Tesla’s stock is sitting around $330 per share, up 75% from last year, but I’m struggling to see how it justifies the current valuation.\n\nHere’s a list of what bothers me:\n\n1. **Elon Musk’s PR Nightmare** – It’s hard to ignore how much Musk’s public image has deteriorated. Between the “Sieg Heil” incident on live TV and his controversial actions, he’s lost a lot of credibility, and by extension, Tesla’s brand has taken a serious hit. A lot of people now see him and the company as 'problematic'.\n\n1. **Competition Is Catching Up Fast** – Tesla used to be the only game in town when it came to EVs and FSD, but that’s no longer the case. Other automakers are making significant strides in both areas, and some are already ahead in terms of technology and innovation.\n\n1. **Declining Profit Margins** – Tesla’s profit margins have been shrinking year after year. This is concerning for a company that’s valued at over a trillion dollars. If this trend continues, it could put a major dent in their long-term prospects.\n\n1. **The Cybertruck Disaster** – The Cybertruck was supposed to be Tesla’s next big thing, but it’s turned into more of a meme. The build quality issues and the general lack of progress on the product have made it a major disappointment, and it’s starting to look like a marketing gimmick more than a groundbreaking vehicle.\n\n1. **Full Self-Driving Tech Overhyped** – Despite the constant chatter about robotaxis, Tesla’s self-driving tech is still stuck at Level 2-3. Other companies have already rolled out Level 4 autonomous vehicles, making Tesla’s claims look more like wishful thinking at this point.\n\n1. **Political and Tariff Risks** – Tesla’s business is exposed to a number of external factors, from steel and aluminum tariffs to an anti-EV U.S. President. Plus, with a California governor who openly opposes Musk, there’s a real risk of losing state EV incentives, which would hurt sales.\n\n1. **Raw Material Costs Are Rising** – Tesla is also facing increasing raw material costs, and tariffs on batteries imported from China could push those prices even higher. With profitability already under pressure, this is something that could really squeeze margins going forward.\n\n1. **Struggling to Attract AI Talent** – Tesla’s ability to innovate in AI seems to be stalling. The company is having trouble attracting top AI talent, with many researchers opting to join OpenAI, Google, Amazon, and other big tech companies. This could set them back in the long run, especially as competitors accelerate their own AI developments.\n\n1. **Losing Support from Left-Leaning Consumers** – Tesla’s alignment with Musk’s political views has alienated many left-leaning consumers, who are typically more inclined to purchase EVs. This shift in consumer sentiment could hurt Tesla’s market share, especially as alternatives to Tesla grow.\n\nI used to think of Tesla as the Nvidia of EVs, miles ahead of everyone else. But right now, it feels like they’re slipping, with more and more companies closing the gap. Like probably lots of you (well, at least those on TikTok) I’ve been using the trademind AI a lot recently, and that also has TSLA as a clear red flag to sell now. With all these issues piling up, I really struggle to see how Tesla maintains its $1.1 trillion valuation.\n\nWhat do you think? Am I missing something, or is Tesla headed for some rough times ahead?",

I got a great deal on it, and I've been steadily growing over the last couple of years. I'm at point where I'm needing to hire someone to handle most of the tech work while I spend more time selling. \n\nBased on average salaries in my area, I'd be running at about a $2400/mo deficit on payroll for the first year, and then $1400/mo the following year based on my current revenue. (My buyout will be finished in 12 months)\n\nI've recently moved in with my girlfriend, and will be listing my current house at the end of this month. I should be able to get around $70k back after everything is said and done. \n\nNow, I know that I'll have to draw from this savings for a while, so I need some decent liquidity, but I also feel like, if invested properly, I could use that money to generate at least some return to try to maximize that payroll buffer. Based on my current rate of growth, I should be able to cover payroll within 12 months, but I'm fairly conservative and want to provide stable employment for my tech. \n\nI've searched around a bit, but I'm having a hard time finding a strategy that would maximize the benefits without totally screwing up the buffer I've managed to build over the last 5 years. \n\nAny thoughts?",

      "text": "Source: https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2025/03/22/irs-tax-revenue-loss-federal-budget/\n\n> Treasury Department and IRS officials are predicting a decrease of more than 10 percent in tax receipts by the April 15 deadline compared with 2024, said the people, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to share nonpublic data. That would amount to more than $500 billion in lost federal revenue; the IRS collected $5.1 trillion last year.  ... The prediction, officials say, is directly tied to changing taxpayer behavior and President Donald Trump’s rapid demolition of parts of the IRS. Senior tax agency officials issued detailed warnings about those outcomes to the incoming Trump administration before the president took office, according to records obtained by The Washington Post.\n\nSo this means the government might have to sell $500B more bonds, about 27% more than the current $1.8T deficit.\n\nIt seems this should drive long term rates up as the government struggles to sell more bonds, unless there is a another big QE bond purchase  (now, QT is being throttled back to close to neutral).   This means even bigger deficits as interest payments rise (already 11% of budget).    \n\nWould the Fed bail out the government with QE if it struggled to sell long term bonds?  Or would Powell shrug as rising long term bond rates worked their anti-inflationary effect?\n\nPOTUS just called for lower rates.  Does he mean short term, or long term QE?  I assume the Fed will ignore the demand, again.\n\nThe balance-of-payments school (fiscal deficit drives trade deficit) suggests we will be importing more stuff, as foreigners buy our bonds.  But this stuff will be subject to tariffs,  seemingly further increasing inflation.\n\nThus I'm thinking of selling my long term bond fund (EDV) at breakeven; I had gotten it when rates peaked around 5% assuming inflation will be conquered and we'll return back to 3% soon, but this hope seems to be evaporating.\n\nAny obvious errors in the above reasoning?

      "text": "First time poster.  I’ve been looking to see if someone else has thought/discussed this.\n\nI’ve been reading lately about how the tariffs will cause prices to increase.  About how the USD is at a 3-year low.  The American spending power will be impacted as their dollar is not going as far and prices will increase.  There is also an anti-consumption momentum building in the U.S. as well.  All these things will hurt the U.S. businesses and have probably been baked into the prices of the stock market.\n\nAlternatively, the narrative is that other countries want to pivot and work with China.  The stories typically say China will still be able to produce and sell to other counties, thus making them the “winner” of the tariff war.  \n\nI was wondering if the Chinese youth have been taken into consideration?  There seems to be a depression amongst the Chinese Millennials and Gen Z.  They do not want to work the “996” anymore.  They prefer to “lay flat” and are starting a trend to call themselves “rat people.”  \n\nSo, I’m left thinking that markets are down because USA caused a tariff war, but could it be that China will not “win” as they may have more business opportunities with other countries, but not the willing labor force?  Has this been factored into the market already or is it just speculation?  \n\nAlso, if this discussion is better served under a different subreddit group, let me know.  I thought it would be good here, but could be wrong.  \n\nEDIT - Thank you for your responses and discussions.  I think there is a lack of media attention on how China is really being affected which is why I reached out to obtain better clarity in the overall situation.  As some of you pointed out there are multiple factors, other than social unrest in the younger generations, that will affect China’s financial health.  Thank you again.",

Now, what is wrong with a company that chooses to stagnate and continue doing what it's doing if that type of thing is either good for the world, makes money, or useful in someway, or a combination of all 3. Reason why I'm asking is because there's companies out there that just shouldn't change/adapt. Hershey is a good example too. Why should Hershey kisses and that receipe change barring terrible ingredients? Why should certain fashion brands like Under Armour need to make different core line ups, or whatever else companies out there have to change so drastically so stay afloat?",

      "text": "**Shares of Pepsi closed 1.85% up today. Some information about Poppi, the acquisition target.**\n\n\\- Founded in 2018 by a couple, they reported upwards of $100 million in sales in 2024. Even if we round up to $150 million in sales, Pepsi would be paying a 13x multiple on top line revenue not net profit. Realistically 19.5x top line revenue on the $100 million reported if we don't use the rounded up $150 million figure.\n\n\\- The company previously appeared on Shark Tank and sold 25% of the business to Rohan Oza for a $400,000 investment. Rohan Oza is a businessman known for his success in bringing drink brands such as Vita Coco and Vitaminwater to market\n\n\\- The company has a wide range of marketing partnerships with celebrities including Post Malone, Hailey Bieber, Kylie Jenner, Billie Eilish, Russell Westbrook, Jennifer Lopez and Olivia Munn\n\n\\- Poppi was previously sued in California class action lawsuit for misleading consumers about the health benefits of their drinks. With only 2g of fiber, a consumer would have to drink 4+ cans to \"realize any potential health benefits\"\n\n**Interested to hear what people think about this acquisition.**\n\n\\- Is Poppi overvalued and did Pepsi overpay?\n\n\\- Should Pepsi have built the internal capabilities to build a brand like this rather than acquiring? Does acquiring show a lack of direction and vision by management? It's hard to imagine that with Pepsi's scale in manufacturing, marketing, retail partnerships, etc. it have cost more than $1.95 billion to make a competing offering that could reach $100 million in sales within 6 years.\n\n\\- Naturally my next thought was, given the above on valuation, is the Poppi brand worth almost $2 billion? Maybe it's not the sales they are after, but the formulation, the brand, or the marketing partnerships.\n\n\\- Will Pepsi change the formula, leading to turning off long time customers?\n\n**Sources**\n\n[https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2025/03/17/pepsi-prebiotic-soda-poppi-acquisition/82495383007/](https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2025/03/17/pepsi-prebiotic-soda-poppi-acquisition/82495383007/)\n\n[https://www.reuters.com/business/retail-consumer/pepsico-buy-healthier-soda-brand-poppi-nearly-2-bln-deal-2025-03-17/](https://www.reuters.com/business/retail-consumer/pepsico-buy-healthier-soda-brand-poppi-nearly-2-bln-deal-2025-03-17/)\n\n[https://apnews.com/article/pepsico-poppi-prebiotic-soda-f1fdb1103b5d8ad6a9e6d8c37e5ab713](https://apnews.com/article/pepsico-poppi-prebiotic-soda-f1fdb1103b5d8ad6a9e6d8c37e5ab713)",

      "title": "Tesla over valued should it be shorted?",
      "text": "Over the past few years, Tesla’s stock has been propelled by a narrative of future technological breakthroughs and visionary leadership. However, a closer look at the underlying fundamentals—and in particular a comparison with Chinese giant BYD—reveals several concerning points:\n\t\n1.\tSuperior Sales and Market Penetration of BYD\n\t•\tIn 2022, BYD sold approximately 1.86 million new energy vehicles worldwide, compared with Tesla’s 1.31 million deliveries globally (with only about 440,000 delivered in China) [ ￼].\n\t\n•\tBYD’s sales figures reflect its diversified product portfolio—from affordable passenger EVs to commercial vehicles and buses—which has allowed it to capture a larger share of the rapidly expanding global market.\n\t\n•\tProminent voices like Charlie Munger have even remarked that in China, “BYD is so much ahead of Tesla that it’s almost ridiculous,” noting that while Tesla has been forced to reduce prices repeatedly, BYD has maintained a pricing discipline that reinforces its quality perception [ ￼].\n\t\n2.\tIntegrated Vertical Model and Proprietary IP\n\t•\tBYD’s business model is built on deep vertical integration. It manufactures everything from battery cells (including its innovative blade battery) to complete battery packs, ensuring tighter quality control, faster innovation cycles, and cost efficiencies.\n\t\n•\tIn contrast, Tesla’s battery strategy still depends heavily on external suppliers such as CATL, Panasonic, and LG Energy Solution. While Tesla touts its in-house 4680 cell as revolutionary, independent analysis shows that its energy density improvements (in Wh/kg) are modest compared to the rapid progress made by competitors [see discussion below].\n\t\n•\tBYD’s extensive R&D and robust portfolio of patents in battery technology (and its willingness to license technology to other automakers) suggest that its technological edge isn’t just hype—it translates into real, scalable production improvements. Tesla’s reliance on external providers leaves it vulnerable if those suppliers or competing integrated players (like BYD) drive down costs and improve performance.\n\t\n3.\tLimited Technological Differentiation on Core Battery Metrics\n\t\n•\tA key metric for EV performance is energy density (Wh/kg). Despite much fanfare around Tesla’s battery innovations, the improvements in energy density aren’t dramatically superior to those achieved by BYD and other leading manufacturers.\n\t\n•\tThis calls into question whether Tesla’s premium valuation—built largely on future expectations—can be sustained if its core battery technology isn’t materially better. BYD, on the other hand, combines modest improvements in battery performance with a proven, fully integrated production process that has already translated into higher sales volumes and broader market acceptance.\n\t\n4.\tThe Overvaluation Argument and Market Sentiment\n\t\n•\tTesla’s current market valuation appears to be based on an almost irrational optimism about future robotaxis, autonomous driving, and energy storage breakthroughs—none of which have yet materially improved the company’s profitability or production volumes.\n\t\n•\tWith BYD now not only supplying its own vehicles but also securing contracts as a battery supplier for other major players (including recent agreements where BYD’s FinDreams unit is set to supply Tesla’s Shanghai energy storage facility [ ￼]), the narrative that Tesla is the sole leader in battery innovation is weakening.\n\t\n•\tWhen you combine lower vehicle sales numbers, an overreliance on third-party suppliers, and only modest improvements in battery performance, the rationale behind Tesla’s high valuation starts to crumble. Investors may eventually reprice Tesla based on its current fundamentals rather than its lofty future projections.\n\nConclusion\n\nFrom this perspective, the argument for shorting Tesla centers on the idea that:\n\t\n•\tBYD’s strong global sales, robust vertical integration, and advanced battery IP are not only outpacing Tesla in key markets (especially in China) but also provide a more sustainable competitive advantage.\n\t\n•\tTesla’s reliance on external suppliers and its relatively modest improvements in core battery metrics (like energy density) suggest that its premium valuation is built on an overly optimistic narrative.\n\t\n•\tIf market sentiment shifts away from these future promises and begins to focus on near-term fundamentals, Tesla could see a significant correction.\n\n\nHad gpt organize my info dump in a readable format . But byd is clearly a company that should be valued more it makes no sense that tesla has it’s current valuation. Also throw in global anti American economic sentiment and anti elon well. Seems to make sense that their stock will decline.\n\nhttps://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-02-03/tesla-sales-plunge-63-in-france-the-eu-s-second-biggest-ev-market",

The network effect significantly applies to digital platforms, dating all the way back to the internet itself. When the internet became more widely used, more people relied on it to conduct work, deepen personal connections, and for research and other functions.\n\nExample: social network platforms\n\nThe network effect is especially prominent on online platforms that encourage users to add other users to the platform’s network. Social networks such as Facebook and Instagram are key examples of the network effect. The more people that use the platform in an individual’s network, the more likely it is that individual will use the platform, too.\n\nExample: E-commerce platforms \n\nE-commerce platforms, such as Amazon, also benefit from the network effect. As more retailers opt to sell their goods on Amazon, the more consumers will look to Amazon to shop. The reverse is also true.\n\nI currently invest in MSFT,GOOGL,META,V,MA.

You can’t just walk into most stores and buy groceries or gas with it. Yet, every time it surges, people start calling it \"the future of finance,\" but that future never really happens.\n\nI keep hearing about institutional money coming in, but if it’s mostly hedge funds and whales pushing the price up, how does that make it a real currency? If regular people are just there to provide liquidity for the big dogs, how is this different from a glorified pump-and-dump?\n\nDon't get me wrong I'm a Bitcoin fan and have been buying and selling it for years now. But I cringe everytime I hear “It’s digital gold”.. Gold has a use beyond its speculative value. It can be made into jewelry, art.. People want to have it because its a ‘real’ thing you can hold in your hands! Bitcoin's only real use is making anonymous transactions that regular humans don't usually need to make.\n\nAm I missing something here, or is Bitcoin actually just a bigger fool scheme?\n\nEdit: When you ask the trading AI everyone on tiktok uses ([this one](http://trademind.ca))  It basically says Bitcoin isn’t a Ponzi because there’s no central scammer, no guaranteed payouts, and it still functions even when prices crash. It’s more like a scarce digital asset that people trade, kind of like gold but way more volatile. But that still doesn’t really answer why it hasn’t become a real mainstream currency. Feels like people just trade it hoping someone else will pay more later.",

So they sold her $1.2M in 5.15% annuities and $800K in 3% annuities.\n\nShe has a mortgage at 2.75 that she pays to the bank with $10,000 monthly mortgage payment on a $1.1M loan.\n\nAfter fees the 3% annuities pay less than the mortgage.  They tell me it's so she can deduct the mortgage interest.\n\nI was made trustee on her accounts and was pretty shocked.  Her expenses are about $50K a month and they wrapped up 90% of her money that she can't touch for 3-5 years.   She invests exclusively at this bank so they knew her finances.\n\nThe good news is that her salary covers the $50K a month, barely.  \nShe sold her company for a $5M stock merger but can not sell the stock for 2 years.  \nHer home equity is about $2M\n\nThe bad news is that she has FTD (Frontal Temporal Dementia), hence the trustee bit.  \nThe really bad news is that she has 3-5 years to live.  And how much longer she can work\n\nI feel like the bank took advantage of he by tying up 90% of her cash.   Her net worth is around $10M so she now has about 2% of her money that she can access.\n\nThe bank won't break the annuities unless she pays the penalty.  I'm pretty pissed at the bank and have told them that their investments \"Were not in her clients best interest.\"  She lives in California and the attorney general's page talks about selling financial instruments to people over 65.  It's considered 'elder abuse' if they are not working in the clients best interest.  Especially differed annuities.",

And the green number on the right, Total Gain 5.67%, is the return for the total portfolio list.  But this is a single stock, single purchase portfolio.  I don't understand why the numbers are close but not identical. What am I missing?\n\nForgot to mention, the top left number changes with the display range, which makes sense.  But if I put it out to YTD, which covers the point I purchased the stock, the numbers are even more off between the chart and the portfolio number. \n\n[https://imgur.com/a/TUUSCK7](https://imgur.com/a/TUUSCK7)",

However, the companies they are investing in have poor revenue since people are spending less money in the economy. \n\nI imagine plenty of companies will go out of business. But these people just keep buying the index funds consistently since they were taught to automate their investments.\n\nWould these stocks keep going up anyway since people keep buying and demand is there? \n\nI would imagine this would not be good at all for the overall economy, which is perhaps why schools do not teach this..",

Below are some of the possibilities:\n\n\\-The effect of microfinance in decreasing inequality\n\n\\-The long term effect of Private equity in companies after they're taken over\n\n\\-Different hedge fund strategies and how they've fared in uncertainty (post 2008 crisis, Covid, tariffs, etc.)\n\nI'm leaning towards the last theme but I'm worried due to lack of transparency by hedge funds that this is a topic with little information available.\n\n  \nThanks in advance.",

      "text": "I currently have 90% of my money in a Roth IRA split between Vanguard and Interactive Brokerages. I use Vanguard for set it and forget it index funds and IBRK for slightly more active trading - nothing too risky - no options tradings, no day trading, all long positions on individual stocks. I occasionally use indicators like RSI and MACD to time my investments into stocks that I was already planning to buy. \n\nMy current portfolio looks like this: 40% VTI (Total U.S. Stock Market), 30% VEA (International Developed Market), 10% VWO (International Emerging Market), 10% BRK.B (Berkshire Hathaway), 10% Mixed Bag of Individual Stocks. \n\nI thought about making it simpler by just doing VTI and VEA. As I near retirement age I plan to gradually increase my bond allocation but right now having any bonds at all seems detrimental. If I had a higher  risk appetite and a more positive outlook on the big tech stocks right now, I might replace VTI for VOO as it has better historical performance (not an indicator of future gains, blah blah...) but I really am concerned by how concentrated the S&P 500 is.\n\np.s. there's nothing special about Vanguard ETFs. I just find that they typically have competitive expense ratios and like the idea of having all/most of my index funds from one brokerage. I think Fidelity and Schwab are great options too. I've also heard good things about M1 Finance but they seem a little experimental so I just stick with Vanguard and IBKR. \n\nHere are some of the stocks in the mixed bag, 10% allocation, traded on IBKR: TRI, SSP, SCHL, CHGG, LMND, TQQQ, UTHR, WAB, PGR, JPM.\n\nI have a credit score of 799 and have never missed a payment (thanks Mom for letting me be an authorized user on your credit card). Three cards make up that score (Chase Freedom Flex, Some Random Discover Card and a STEP Card). I have considered looking into a money market account at Chase so that my savings/emergency fund can earn a little more but don't fully understand it enough atm to pull the trigger. \n\nI have been super fortunate to have been supported financially by my parents. Up until this point I have had decent transportation to and from school/work, plenty of food on the table, quality electronics and resources for studying, gaming and programming (not to mention clothes and a roof over my head). Most of the money I have now came from working at a local credit union over the summer and fall of last year along with saving all the money I got from things like Christmas and Birthday. I also worked for my Dad every once in a while as a kid and he would sometimes pay me depending on the work (bringing him tools for his construction/repair/contracting/renewable energy business). My largest asset is the Macbook I'm typing this on (I'm a reluctant mac user :p). Neither of my parents are fabulously wealthy and they don't plan to contribute anything to my college education (I'm hoping I might be able to live at home during some transition periods so I don't have to drain my savings on a rent deposit when I haven't figured out my employment situation or things like that). Oh, and also I have  no debt (woop woop!).\n\nOn a scale of 1-10, how would you rate my finances? How fortunate is the situation I am in in terms of privilege and do you have any advice for how to contextualize all of the privilege I have been given. There is certainly some bad shit that I have intentionally left out of here but I am curious from a purely financial standpoint where I stand in terms of what percentile of people have it as good as I do at 18 and what part of that is due to making informed decisions or being given parental support. \n\nAre there any problems with the individual stocks that I chose or should I have a more concrete/outlined strategy in that section - perhaps swapping out larger companies like JPM, for more small cap stocks to even out the large caps that tend to be in low-expense ratio ETFs like VTI? How redundant is having 10% BRK.B and can that be justified? Does TQQQ have any utility? Feel free to answer all or none of these questions.",

We are both authorized users on each other's cards, & these cards are used for a majority of our expenses. We are wanting to have a joint account of sorts to make sure things stay fair (neither of us feel unfair but just seems to make sense since all of our expenses are for both of us anyway lol).\n\nHow does everyone do this? I think we were thinking to max out our Roth IRAs first, & then maybe contribute a certain % to 401k? We know we have to have an emergency fund in a HYSA, but this HYSA will just be in 1 person's name, with the 2nd person just having access, & we just pay the shared expenses off our credit cards from here? & then do we also just keep contributing to this shared HYSA with a % of our income? She threw out 90% & then 10% of our income we keep for ourselves - does this seem reasonable? I truly have no idea. Do we invest everything after we hit our emergency fund # into the market? How do you keep investing in individual brokerage accounts at the same time? Looking for advice on where to start, what to consider, & how others are doing combined finances with their partners.",

      "text": "Hi everyone, I’m looking for some help here. I was recently released from prison after serving 6 years for distribution of cannabis. \n\nBefore I went in I had a brokerage account with Wells Fargo. When I came home about a month ago I had a lot of notifications that my account needed to either be liquidated and closed or transferred to another institution immediately. \n\nI tried fidelity but they don’t accept felons. \nAnother felon I know tried robinhood but they don’t accept felons. A friend recommended Chase because they have a policy where they hire people with adverse backgrounds, so I called Chase and spoke with two different advisors and they confirmed that, yes that is JP Morgan Chase’s policy and they confirmed that there would be no issue with me opening a brokerage account. \n\nSo I opened an account and I even had a senior advisor in the escalations department make a three way phone call with me to the Wells Fargo advisor to confirm to Wells Fargo that the ACAT was legitimate and so Wells Fargo could lift the restrictions off my account to complete the transfer. After the phone call, it took about 2-3 days for the ACAT to go through and I had a fully functioning brokerage account. \n\nI began adding more legitimate funds through a bank transfer and bagan buying stocks and ETFs. I woke up this morning with an email that said I had an important account notification. I opened my account to check the notification and it said that “after further review” JP Morgan Chase has decided to discontinue services with me and have given me until May 12th to liquidate my account or transfer my positions to another institution. \n\nI believe that FINRA has rules about felons having brokerage accounts and it seems that every banking institution is associated with FINRA. Does anyone have ideas of what I can do? \n\nI considered opening a trust and making my sister the trustee and listing myself as the beneficiary. There has to be someway to be invested in the market. If not, I’ll be relegated to 2.5% CDs and my finances are screwed the rest of my life. Any advice helps, thanks!\n\n\nEDIT: yes I do have a secondary money laundering charge as well for paying my home mortgage with suspected proceeds from my drug crime. I was just focusing on the “being a felon” part of this situation and not the specific individual charges. There seems to have been no problem “opening accounts,” it’s when I fund the accounts (with 100% legitimate funds with records going back 30 years when I was born) that there is a trigger to the legal departments and I get banned.\n\nSecond Edit: I guess I should have been more clear. None of the firms that have debanked me, Wells Fargo, Fidelity, now Chase, have specifically claimed that money laundering was the issue, they only claimed that their decision was based on a felony conviction. So I apologize that thinking the felony conviction was my problem and not the specific charge!",

How long will it take for me to get to $200,000? To those trying to get to their first $10,000, $50,000 and $100,000 you guys can do it too!

Do I save for a house now?\n\n\nEdit: For those who were asking if I started with zero net worth. I arrived in the US with only $1500 (All the money I saved up working back home) and a $12000 loan for the processing of papers and licensures. I paid that off on my first year.",

      "text": "US stocks cratered on Friday with the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) plunging more than 2,200 points after China stoked trade-war fears and Fed Chair Jerome Powell warned of higher inflation and slower growth stemming from tariffs.\n\nThe Dow pulled back 5.5% to enter into correction territory. Meanwhile, the S&P 500 (GSPC) sank nearly 6%, as the broad-based benchmark capped its worst week since 2020. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (IXIC) dropped 5.8% to close in bear market territory.\n\nThe major averages added to Thursday's $2.5 trillion wipeout after China said it will impose additional tariffs of 34% on all US products from April 10 — matching the extra 34% duties imposed by Trump on Wednesday.\n\nThat ramped up investor worries that countries are more likely to retaliate than negotiate, leading to a protracted global trade war.\n\nInvestors flocked to government bonds as the 10-year Treasury (TNX) yield fell to 3.9%, nearing its lowest levels since October.\n\nEconomists are warning that with tariffs as-is, the risk of a US recession is rising. The monthly jobs report, unusually overshadowed Friday, showed a labor market that held steady ahead of Trump's biggest tariffs. The US added 228,000 jobs in March, beating estimates, though the unemployment rate ticked up to 4.2%.\n\nMeanwhile, Federal Reserve Chair Powell for the first time addressed the reality of the tariffs, saying they were \"higher than anticipated.\" He said it is \"too soon to say\" what the proper rate path should be. Traders have ramped up bets on interest rate cuts this year to five, as the Fed is expected to set its efforts to cool inflation aside to tackle the bigger risk of economic slowdown.\n\nTrump, posting on Truth Social on Friday, added to fears by saying that his policies \"will never change\" and warning that China \"played it wrong.\"\n\nhttps://finance.yahoo.com/news/live/stock-market-today-dow-plunges-2200-points-nasdaq-enters-bear-market-as-trump-tariffs-spark-worst-meltdown-since-2020-200042876.html",

      "text": "**Hello everyone,**\n\nI’m new to Reddit (I just discovered it), and I’m currently at a crossroads in my academic and career journey.\n\nI am 20 years old, enrolled in a bachelor’s degree program in Banking and Finance, and currently finishing my 3rd semester (the first semester of my second year). My grades are good, and I’ve been considering pursuing a master’s degree in finance at a reputable university after graduation.\n\nHowever, I’ve noticed that most well-regarded universities come with significant costs. To give you some context, I am Bulgarian, studying abroad in Europe, and not residing in North America. Universities suggested by my professors, such as Bocconi in Milan and Warwick in the UK (where some of them studied), have high tuition fees. Additionally, applying to these institutions often requires a GMAT exam, which adds to the financial burden.\n\nI don’t want to overly burden my parents with these expenses. My initial plan was to start working after graduation, save money, and then apply for a master’s program. This approach would not only help me afford the degree but also boost my CV with work experience. However, I’ve recently started doubting whether this is the best path.\n\nA lot of institutions—banks, both national and private—are actively seeking workers and offering positions with what could be described as \"highly competitive\" salaries. This makes me question whether pursuing a master’s degree is the right choice for me. My professors strongly encourage me, particularly to apply to universities like Warwick and Bocconi, but I am unsure how much of a tangible benefit such a degree would provide for my career in the long run.\n\nDo you have any advice or suggestions? I assume many of you are already working and can offer insights based on your experience. Are master’s degrees in finance worth the investment? Would working for a few years before applying improve my chances and make the cost more manageable?\n\n  \nI know this is not the right place to ask this but when I tried to go on the r/finance i didnt get an answer. Please excuse me if this is not the place.\n\nI’d really appreciate your thoughts and experiences.",

I thought today was clear so I didn't have to buy any options or other ways for some protection. Then I was watching the news and they announced one of my stocks' earnings report and it drops 2 digits.\n\nI triple checked the list of dates on my yahoo finance app everyday and that stock was not listed. I made sure of this. In fact, even after the news had announced their earnings report, the app still did NOT have the stock listed under the earnings dates for my portfolio! \n\nBut if you go under the stock's individual page, the earnings date is written right there. If the app knows the earnings report's date, why is it not including it under the events list with the other stocks' earnings date?\n\nI have it on the correct tab and no filters because I see other stocks (plural) dates and I double checked this and confirmed it.\n\nEdit: Will include screenshots later",

      "text": "A little Google Finance magic and you can create some plots showing you the \"multiples\" of your money had it been invested for X number of years (I prefer this over unwieldy percentages).\n\nIf you invested your money into one index for 30 years that first dollar will have grown by the multiple below. I show two periods the last 30 years, and the 30 years before that:\n\nPeriod #1 (1995-2025): S&P 500 - 7.6x | Dow Jones - 10.1x | **Nasdaq - 21.7x** ([plot](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vRgRe1DDKrRvQFzPZaBTs4kUKH2D1k8EPflAY7JsAcBi2635-891Q3PSTL_eMIaVXK-CMGH2c6TP2tw/pubchart?oid=97885568&format=interactive))\n\nPeriod #2 (1965-1995): S&P - 5.7x | Dow Jones - 4.6x | **Nasdaq - 8.1x** (plot: [plot](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vRgRe1DDKrRvQFzPZaBTs4kUKH2D1k8EPflAY7JsAcBi2635-891Q3PSTL_eMIaVXK-CMGH2c6TP2tw/pubchart?oid=1857506659&format=interactive))\n\nNasdaq does better. Why are we generally piling into VOO or SPY instead of QQQ or ONEQ?\n\n(I also understand that it doesn't make sense to factor invest into a market exchange, of all things, but what about it makes it more performant over our one true love S&P 500?)\n\n\n\n\\----  \nEdit #1: The astute have pointed out, I cherry picked 2 periods. I ran the rolling/slider analysis and plotted here: [plot](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vRgRe1DDKrRvQFzPZaBTs4kUKH2D1k8EPflAY7JsAcBi2635-891Q3PSTL_eMIaVXK-CMGH2c6TP2tw/pubchart?oid=467475738&format=interactive).\n\nIt's a little confusing because all the data is being transformed on itself (and rolled into a single number), but here's the interpretation: X-axis represents your \"present day\" and you started investing 30yrs prior to that. Your gains (as a multiple) are shown on the Y-axis above. The chart as a whole represents 60yrs of investing.\n\n\\- The Nasdaq wins out fairly significantly, 20x on average, to S&P's \\~7x.\n\n\\- The Dow and S&P are much older so the data's valid through all the dates we're looking at; the Nasdaq needed to be clipped at 2001 (opened in 1971).\n\n\\- Dividends are not included, but someone let me know how to estimate adding 3% (vs 1%) dividends to the total returns and compare that to 20x vs 7x multiples.

      "text": "Just want to get a gauge on where I am at in terms of savings for retirement. I know everyone has different starting points and goals, but just curious and was interested in hearing from others.\n\n28 yrs old working in finance in hospitality industry. Currently have around $80k saved, $30k in 401k, and then $50k in VOO.\n\n  \nUpdate: Just wanted to say thank you to everyone who commented. Did not think this post would get THAT much attention, but I guess it was a fairly easy prompt to reply to. While some of us might have more saved than others, we all have different paths and face different challenges along the way. I am happy to see us all here working on improving ourselves and being responsible with our futures. May we all be rich one day and have everything we ever wanted.",

Wife and I just realized our employer has us in a 457b account at Voya, I have two separate Roth IRA accounts - One at Vanguard and one at T Rowe, and I have a \"regular\" trading account at Schwab.\n\nQuestion 1: I'm 56yo.  I see that there are contribution limits on both the Roth and the 457b accounts.  Are these independent of each other for tax purposes in terms of my annual taxes for the IRS?  I know I declare my Roth contributions but I've never done anything about the 457b contributions.\n\nQ2: I've imitated the paperwork to close out the T Rowe Roth and move it to Vanguard.  I then plan on closing that out and moving it to Schwab into a separate Roth account.  I started this just for convenience, but is there any benefit to that other than that?  any drawbacks?\n\nQ3: The 457b accounts are in some Blackrock 2040 fund, which seems to have some pretty below average performance.  Is it (should it be) easy just to switch this out to a different fund?  Is there a tax hit in a 457b?\n\nThank you!",

Totally understandable that kind of stress can make anyone vulnerable. But it’s also led him into something that looks like a scam, and I’m not sure how to talk him out of it.\n\nThe company he’s gotten wrapped up in is called Solar Suns Investment Guild. He found it on Facebook (big red flag right there), and they’re promising crazy returns with almost no risk. From everything I can dig up, it’s clearly shady:\n\nNo regulatory registration that I can find (not listed with SEC/FINRA).\n\nPress releases that look like pure self-promotion, not journalism.\n\nScam-alert websites already flagging them as a WhatsApp/Facebook “investment group scam.”\n\nNo independent reviews outside their own ecosystem, and the founder “Maverick Preston” has no verifiable background in finance.\n\nI’ve tried explaining this to him, but here’s the issue, he already put money in. Now that he has skin in the game, he’s defensive and doubling down instead of questioning it. He thinks he’s “done the research” and is basically immune to hearing otherwise.\n\nSo, my problem isn’t identifying that it’s a scam, I’m pretty confident it is. My problem is: How do you convince someone who’s already invested in a scam that they’ve been taken? Especially someone who’s older, scared about retirement, and hanging on to the hope that this is their way out.\n\nI don’t want to come across as condescending or make him dig in further. I just want to figure out how to show him clear evidence without him shutting down.\n\nHas anyone here dealt with a situation like this? What’s the best way to talk to someone who’s already “all in” on a scam?",

      "title": "WSJ: Why There Will Never Be Another Warren Buffett",
      "text": "A great article by Jason Zweig on Warren Buffett after his announcement that he will retire at year-end.\n\nhttps://www.wsj.com/finance/investing/why-there-will-never-be-another-warren-buffett-2b5fa268\n\nExcerpt:\n\nThere’s only one Warren Buffett, and there will never be another.\n\nOn May 3, Buffett announced that he will step down as chief executive of Berkshire Hathaway, the conglomerate he has built into one of the most successful investments in history. There are three reasons why he has no equal and never will: the person, the period and the package.\n\nLet’s start with the person. Buffett is not only brilliant, but he has also spent nearly his entire long lifetime obsessed with the stock market. Especially in his early years as an investor, his unparalleled success depended on an unbearable sacrifice: forgoing a normal social and family life. \n\nEver since 1942, when he bought his first stock at age 11, he has devoured information about companies, reading corporate reports the way most people listen to music. \n\nAs a young investment manager, Buffett would wander through his house with his nose in a corporate annual report, practically bumping into the furniture, oblivious to the comings and goings of family and friends. While his kids played at an amusement park, he would sit on a bench and read financial statements. Buffett was there physically, but mentally and emotionally he was off in a world of his own, fixated on tax-loss carryforwards and amortization schedules.\n\nImagine being that obsessed. Imagine enjoying it.\n\nNow imagine enjoying it almost every waking moment ever since Harry Truman was in the White House. That’s how unusual Buffett is.\n\nExpertise is rooted in pattern recognition, and Buffett has seen every conceivable pattern. Given what I know about his work habits, I estimate—conservatively, I believe—that Buffett has read more than 100,000 financial statements in his more-than-seven-decade career. \n\nFinally, Buffett placed his investments in a package like none other.\n\nBerkshire Hathaway operates as a publicly traded holding company, a receptacle for whatever he has thought worth owning: other publicly traded stocks, Treasury bonds, private companies. At one point it was even one of the world’s largest holders of silver; now it holds more than $330 billion in cash. \n\nBerkshire isn’t a hedge fund, mutual fund, exchange-traded fund or any other conventional investment vehicle.\n\nBy design, it charges no management fees that would subtract from its returns and no performance-incentive fees that would encourage excessive risk-taking in pursuit of a big payday.\n\nMost investment funds operate under a curse that economists call “procyclicality.” After a fund racks up a streak of good returns, investors throw money at the fund, forcing its managers to put the new cash to work in a market that is likely becoming overpriced. That hinders future performance.\n\nThen, when returns falter in a falling market, investors yank their money out, forcing the fund managers to sell just as bargains are becoming abundant. The fund’s own investors make its performance worse, intensifying the market’s ups and downs.\n\nBerkshire’s only cash flows, however, are internal. Money comes in from (or goes out to) the assets it owns. Cash can’t come pouring in from new investors, or get yanked out by fleeing investors, at the worst possible times—because you can invest in Berkshire only by buying shares from someone else in the secondary market.\n\nThis package has given Buffett a structural advantage that has enabled him to pursue opportunities wherever and whenever he has perceived them. That’s a luxury almost no other professional investor has—or even wants.\n\nSo long as most fund managers can earn a lavish living for underperforming the market, the real risk for them will be trying anything different. Pigs will sprout feathers before anybody has the daring to try truly emulating Warren Buffett.",

      "text": "**1. Valuation Metrics Are Sky-High**  \nPalantir currently trades at a Price-to-Sales (P/S) ratio of approximately 53.13, significantly higher than industry peers.\n\n[GuruFocus](https://www.gurufocus.com/term/ps-ratio/PLTR) Even for a growth company, this level of valuation is extreme and implies future growth rates that may be unattainable.\n\n\n\n**2. Revenue Growth Isn’t Scaling as Expected**  \nWhile Palantir’s revenue growth has been solid, it’s showing signs of deceleration:\n\n* FY 2022: 24% year-over-year growth\n* FY 2023 (projected): 18% year-over-year growth\n\nThis deceleration doesn’t justify its premium valuation. Additionally, the company remains heavily reliant on government contracts, which are often lumpy and unpredictable.\n\n**3. Profitability Is Still Questionable**  \nDespite boasting about achieving GAAP profitability recently, Palantir has heavily relied on stock-based compensation (SBC). In fact, SBC accounted for approximately 30% of their operating expenses last quarter, which dilutes shareholder value and raises questions about true profitability.\n\n**4. AI Hype Is Inflating the Bubble**  \nThe market has been overly optimistic about Palantir’s AI capabilities. While their AI Platform (AIP) sounds promising, actual adoption metrics and revenue contribution from AIP remain vague. It’s easy to talk AI; it’s harder to monetize it sustainably.\n\n**5. Insider Selling Signals Lack of Confidence**  \nExecutives have been offloading shares at a significant rate. For instance, Chairman Peter Thiel sold a substantial portion of his holdings recently.\n\n[Yahoo Finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/insiders-lead-sell-palantir-stock-223000919.html)If the leadership team doesn’t see long-term upside at these prices, why should we?\n\n\n\n**6. Competitive Pressure Is Mounting**  \nPalantir operates in a crowded space with competitors like Snowflake ($SNOW), Databricks, and Microsoft ($MSFT) offering similar or better solutions. Palantir’s dependence on government clients limits its commercial reach in comparison.\n\n**TL;DR:**  \nPalantir is an interesting company with solid tech, but the stock price is disconnected from fundamentals. High valuations, slowing growth, heavy SBC, and reliance on government contracts make $PLTR a risky bet at current levels. AI hype has driven the price into bubble territory, and insiders don’t seem confident in its future.\n\nWhat do you think? Is $PLTR worth its valuation, or are we seeing another overhyped tech bubble? Let’s discuss! 👇\n\n*Note: All financial figures are based on the latest available data as of November 2024.*\n\nSources",

He has been convicted of two financial crimes (SEC fraud in 2002 and IRS fraud in 2024). People don’t change unless something traumatic has happened to them.  As far as I can tell, Saylor is still rich since 2002.\n\n2. MSTR is using basic financing mechanisms to issue debt to buy more BTC, in the hopes that investors will drive up his stock price so he can buy more.  It is trading at a 100% premium to its BTC holdings with no real IP.\n\n3. Saylor’s behavior on Twitter is troubling.  Many of his posts are AI-generated images of him in some ego fantastical pose.  If you actually read the underlying message and manipulation being used here, it’s obvious he’s trying to trick retail investors into buying more MSTR.\n\nThere are much cleaner ways to get levered BTC exposure without any of the company and single-man risk of MSTR.",

This trend is expected to worsen with further tax cuts and spending increases, both of which are central to Trump’s economic agenda.\n\nProtectionist Trade Policies: Trump’s tariffs and threats of extended trade wars have already weakened the dollar and increased global skepticism about the U.S. economic outlook. Agencies warn that a prolonged trade war or drastic measures like capital controls could further erode trust in the dollar and U.S. creditworthiness.\n\nPolitical Instability and Governance: Credit agencies cite repeated political brinkmanship over the debt ceiling, government shutdown threats, and increased polarization as risks that undermine fiscal management and confidence in U.S. governance.\n\nNegative Outlooks from Agencies:\n\nS&P and Fitch have already downgraded the U.S. from AAA to AA+ in recent years, citing fiscal deterioration and governance issues.\n\nMoody’s, the last major agency maintaining a AAA rating, shifted its outlook to negative in late 2023 and has warned that further policy decisions—such as unfunded tax cuts and high tariffs—could trigger a downgrade as early as 2025",

      "text": "I don't want to get political in this discussion. I'd rather just focus on what is happening and hopefully we can leave political discussions out of it.\n\nThe finance committee just voted 14-13 to have Robert Kennedy Jr proceed to a senate floor vote. It's likely the case that he's going to be made secretary of HHS.\n\nPart of the changes that are about to be made is related to food dyes and food additives.\n\nHe's posted many such videos on YouTube outlining how the US has more of these additives than Europeans allow in their foods.\n\nFood dyes like Red 40 are linked to many health ailments.\n\n# I looked into some companies that deal with food dyes and came upon 3.\n\n1. Dupont de Nemours (DD) - 32.15B market cap\n2. Sensient Technologies Corporation (SXT) - 3.2B market cap\n3. Archer Daniels Midland Company (ADM) - 22.95B market cap\n\nThere may be more out there so definitely go looking into it as you might some profitable opportunities.\n\n# 1) Dupont de Nemours\n\nI'll keep this one short. Dupont has a cool ticker but they are gigantic and don't disclose how many of their sales come from food dyes. They also have their hands in other ventures so I skipped out on it but maybe some other people can dig into whether its a good opportunity.\n\n# 2) Sensient Technologies\n\nI was excited about this one when I first found it. Their revenues for their Flavors & Extracts group had a revenue of $203 million in Q3 and their Color group had $162 million in Q3.\n\nSadly, there are no juicy options on this for puts. That made me sad. Something to monitor though as this industry receives more attention.\n\n# 3) Archer Daniels Midland\n\nI'll start off by saying that I'm super bummed out about this one. I found them the day of their earnings reports and saw they're down 4%. I wish I found this one yesterday.\n\nI first looked through their returns over the years and they're down 31.50% over the last 3 years. Sentiment among shareholders is low from browsing through various forums.\n\nThe company reports that their losses were as a result of a drop in seed oil demand.\n\nI don't know if you've been on YouTube lately, but a lot of channels are discussing the cons of seed oils. I'm not here to turn this into a debate. This is about money. Their seed oil division has plunged 32% year over year.\n\nGo on Google Trends and type in beef tallow and you'll see how much its gaining in popularity:\n\n[https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?geo=US&q=beef%20tallow&hl=en](https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?geo=US&q=beef%20tallow&hl=en)\n\nGuess who's against seed oils and is a supporter of beef tallow? Possibly the next HHS secretary if he gets confirmed.\n\nKeep in mind, it's extremely rare for a cabinet pick not to get approved by the Senate. There have been only 6 such cases in the past 100 years.\n\nThe company is going to close down some of their seed oil ventures. Some people might see that as a positive reason to buy so there's risk there involved with buying puts.\n\nIn 2014, ADM purchased WILD Flavors and food dyes account for 9% of their business.\n\nIf people are buying less seed oils and if more food dyes become banned (as Red 3 was during the previous administration), then this could hurt ADM.\n\nThis is just preliminary research but things are moving fast politically and its in these moments where profits are being made.\n\nJust after his finance committee vote cleared, vaccine stocks dropped.\n\nI'm not saying to buy puts, do your own due diligence. But there's an opportunity here. It's not as popular of a stock as the other healthcare stocks that are being sold today.\n\nIf you have any other companies that are in the food dye niche, please post them below so that I can look into them. Would like to have as many as possible.",

      "text": "Hi everyone, I'm (23M) very new to a lot of adult budgeting and finance things as I just graduated college and got my first full-time job (though I've been investing for several years now). One thing I keep hearing about that I've never considered was that I need to have an \"emergency fund\" which would cover 3-6 months of expenses, and I'm a little confused about what exactly this means.\n\nIn terms of risk for this emergency fund, I don't want that amount of money just sitting in a bank because of the very low interest it would generate compared to a money market like SPAXX, but this is a zero risk \"investment\" to put into the bank because of FDIC. As for SPAXX, I'm holding onto this nest egg and getting 5% (or so) interest on it, but it isn't a zero risk investment though very very low (I understand Fidelity has only \"broken the dollar\" 3 times in history). Would you go even further than just a money market like with an ETF like SCHD or is that \"too risky\" for what should be a stable nest egg?\n\nAnother concern would be the level of liquidity needed for an \"emergency fund.\" I don't imagine there are many emergencies where waiting the 1-3 business days for the EFT would be catastrophic considering I could just use a credit card in the mean time, but would it be a better idea to have a smaller nest egg (<1 month expenses) in an immediately liquid position such as a traditional savings account with your bank?\n\nLast question, should I be closer to the 3 or the 6 months of the 3-6 months range? Thanks\n\nEdit: Not sure why I'm getting downvoted but I appreciate everyone's responses!",

      "text": "We're considering walking away from a $1.2M townhome purchase in the East Bay and want to validate our thinking before making this final decision.\n\n# Our Financial Situation\n\n* Household income: \\~$360k base with annual bonuses (adds 12-18% yearly)\n* Down payment ready: $400k\n* Current rent: $3k/month for 2br/2ba with rent control protections\n* Market rate for similar rentals: $2800 -4,200+ in our area\n\n# The Property Details\n\nThe townhome is in Dublin and is in a newer development near good schools, but comes with some high costs:\n\n* Mello Ross: \\~$500+ monthly for 25+ years (until around 2050)\n* HOA fees: $440/month\n* Property taxes: Standard rate but on $1.2M assessment\n* Financing: Looking at 6.875% rates in current market or 5.875 for 5 year ARM\n\n# Our Analysis\n\nWhen we calculated total monthly ownership costs versus our current situation, we would be paying approximately $4,500 MORE per month than we do now. This includes mortgage, taxes, special assessments, HOA, insurance.\n\nHere's where it gets interesting: We ran a 5-year scenario assuming the house appreciates at 7% annually (aggressive but possible in this market). Even with that appreciation, investing our $400k down payment plus the $4,500 monthly difference in index funds would give us nearly $1M in investable assets after 5 years.\n\nThis means we could potentially put down 60%+ on a $1.68M house (what this one would cost in 5 years) versus 33% today. So basically, we would move from barely affording the down payment to having enough to buy most of the house outright.\n\n# Why We're Hesitating\n\nThe math seems almost too good to be true, which makes us wonder if we're missing something important. The Mello Roos special assessments really hurt the economics - that's $500+ monthly (2% increase every year) that provides no return and continues for decades.\n\n# Our Questions\n\n1. Are we being too conservative by assuming we can consistently invest the monthly difference?\n2. Is there a flaw in comparing liquid investments to real estate ownership benefits?\n3. Are we underestimating the non-financial benefits of homeownership?\n4. Could we be missing tax advantages or other factors that change the calculation?\n5. Is the \"priced out forever\" fear legitimate, or does the math actually work in our favor?\n\nWe genuinely liked this property and the location, but the numbers made us step back. The special assessments(Mello Roos) alone would cost us \\~$180k+ over 25 years - money that could compound significantly if invested instead.\n\nHas anyone else done similar analysis when facing Bay Area purchase decisions? Are we overthinking this, or does the investment approach make sense given current market conditions?\n\n**TL;DR**: Running numbers on $1.2M Bay Area townhome vs continuing to rent + invest. Math suggests waiting 5 years while investing creates much stronger financial position even with home appreciation. Seeking validation or reality check on this analysis.",

      "title": "Palantir: Overhyped Valuation and Growing Risks in a Shifting Market",
      "text": "Palantir Technologies Inc. (PLTR) is trading at valuation levels far exceeding industry norms, raising serious concerns for potential investors. Its price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of 64.7x represents a staggering premium of 1,885% over the sector median of 3.2x, while its forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 203x highlights a 708% premium compared to the sector median of 25x. For historical context, Microsoft’s P/S ratio peaked at 31x during the dot-com bubble, less than half of Palantir’s current level. Enterprise value metrics further amplify these concerns, with Palantir showing an EV/Sales ratio of 64.8x versus the sector median of 4.1x, and an EV/EBIT ratio of 469.9x compared to 21.4x. Adding to the risks, Palantir's projected earnings growth is slowing, with EPS growth expected to decelerate from 51.7% in 2024 to 25.17% in 2025. In an environment of stagnant interest rates, these extreme valuations heighten the risk of a significant correction, making caution essential for investors.\n\nPalantir’s reliance on government contracts, which accounted for 56% of its revenue—approximately $1.11 billion in the first nine months of 2024—is another critical risk. The Department of Defense represents 70%-80% of these contracts, highlighting Palantir's heavy dependence on a single government segment. This reliance is further compounded by termination-for-convenience clauses, allowing contracts to be canceled with notice periods as short as 3-6 months, and annual renewal requirements due to legal restrictions against multi-year agreements. Palantir also faces high customer concentration risk, with its top three customers contributing 17% of revenue in 2024, down only slightly from 19% in 2023. The Department of Government Efficiency (D.O.G.E.) initiative, aimed at reducing federal spending, poses additional risks to contract renewals and revenue stability.\n\nThe company’s stock skyrocketed by 144.27% over six months as investors treated Palantir as a high-growth stock. However, this speculative momentum has led to overvaluation and risks of multiple compression—where profits increase but share prices stagnate or decline. For example, Palantir and peers like CrowdStrike (CRWD) and The Trade Desk (TTD) have an average P/E ratio of 395.73%, underscoring significant overpricing. In 2025, a stagnant interest rate environment and reduced consumer spending, driven by inflation adjustments, are likely to further pressure profits and stock performance. The broader market's shift toward stable blue-chip stocks has already reduced speculative investments, as reflected in Bitcoin's trading volume decline from 4.17 million in 2020 to 387,000 in 2024. This changing investor attitude could exacerbate the decline in Palantir’s valuation.\n\nDespite impressive AI-powered platforms like Gotham, Foundry, and Apollo—designed to enhance data integration and decision-making—Palantir faces stiff competition from established tech giants like Microsoft and IBM and specialized firms like Snowflake and Databricks. While the AI boom has driven revenue growth, with a 30% year-over-year increase in Q3 2024, sustainability is a concern as overreliance on AI hype can lead to inflated valuations disconnected from long-term fundamentals. Palantir’s total revenue grew to $726 million in Q3 2024, with U.S. commercial revenue increasing 54% to $179 million, reflecting progress in diversifying beyond government contracts. However, its dependence on AI-driven growth and federal spending still poses significant risks for long-term stability.\n\nHistorical precedents, such as the dot-com bubble, show that companies with extreme valuations, like Cisco and Oracle, faced dramatic corrections that required years or decades to recover. These lessons emphasize the importance of valuation discipline and fundamental analysis. While Palantir remains a prominent player in AI and analytics, its inflated valuation, slowing growth, and reliance on speculative market trends suggest caution for investors. Analysts currently rate Palantir as a “Moderate Sell,” highlighting the potential for significant losses despite its technological strengths and government connections.\n\n**TL;DR:** Palantir’s extreme valuation, heavy reliance on government contracts, slowing growth, and overdependence on AI hype pose significant risks, particularly in a market increasingly favoring stable investments.\n\n**Sources:** Palantir, Palantir Blog, Yahoo Finance, SEC, Seeking Alpha",

      "text": "I am a fan of the long term buy and hold strategy. If the markets high? I buy it. If there’s a dip? I buy even more.\n\nS&P is great, and by being 50+% VOO and a mix of mag 7, I’ve had excellent returns since 2020. With that said, I’m a young investor (27m), and I’d like to plan more intelligently for the long term. \n\nWhat industries, or companies, do you all believe will be around and thriving 20-30+ years from now?\n\nFor me, I think the culture of “tech” companies will continue to be strong with their hyper efficiency, monopolistic power, and acquisitive nature. So amazon, google, meta and Microsoft, will continue to acquire competitors and dominate all aspects of American life for years to come imo, but there are also dominant monopoly-like players in Walmart and Costco which I also believe will continue to rise and do in the physical world what the tech giants can’t/won’t. In terms of “what we’ll always need” in food, water, shelter, I’m less familiar with players that have the same level of dominance and will last. \n\nI think energy is the crisis of our time, but I’m hesitant to bet on any individual company at this point. I’m not sure if others have insight, but I’d love to hear arguments not for what matters this year, but what will matter in the longest term.\n\nThanks in advance for any contributions.",

For a while I’ve been thinking of what it would be like to own a newer car but couldn’t justify going along with it and getting back into a car payment when mine works fine technically. The reasons I’d even consider a change is the following: a bigger cabin to have a more roomy/comfortable ride, modern safety features and the biggest thing is better fuel economy.\n\nHere’s a small picture of my driving life. I stay 36 miles from work so it’s a 72 mile round trip 5 days a week, so I evidently spend a lot of time driving and that’s just my work commute, factoring in my personal trips they’re similar in nature. I’m getting around 32mpg currently and I’m filling up my tank like every 4 days.\n\nI took my car to get serviced the other day and a sales representative from the dealership contacted me and said they would offer me over the market rate for it. (I quickly shut them down telling them I just paid it off recently, so we didn’t talk numbers) but it got me thinking, could getting a newer vehicle with much better fuel economy be worth it? Toyota hybrids are now getting over 50mpg. Could you justify getting a newer vehicle and enduring a car payment for a few more years? What do you think Reddit? Am I crazy for considering this?

I have always wanted to do creative things like writing or being an entrepreneur but I stuck to the salary + benefits jobs because I wasn't willing to take the risk.\n\nSo now here I am, I have $1.55M invested between retirement and brokerage accounts, and about $90K in cash. My job pays \\~185K/year and my wife makes about $95K. As of a few months ago, my plan was to work until I had $2.5M, and then retire. My expenses are around 50-60K/year so that seems like a pretty comfortable buffer.\n\nBUT, we might be heading into the worst economy in a long time. The markets are all over the place and I don't think the 6-8% return assumption is going to apply in the near term. We might see runaway inflation. And while in normal times I'd be confident of getting a new job if I needed one, now I'd be competing with dozens of other ex-government employees with the same set of skills and we might be heading into a recession. \n\ntl;dr: I really want out of the 9 to 5 workforce and I'm past ready to pull the ripcord, but my gut says I should be hanging on to my job for dear life right now. But that's kind of what my gut always says so I don't know if it's trustworthy.",

When I was 18-19, when I had no credit, my mom convinced me to co-sign on a car to “help kickstart my credit” which made complete sense to me at the time. She’s had the same car, and it’s now been repo’d TWICE! First time, I had to pay $2,200 to get it caught up on and released from the tow yard before it went to auction. Now I just let them have it cause I can’t deal with it anymore. \n\nTo makes matters worse, she calls me and tells me that she got a Ninja Air Fryer from Rent-A-Center…WHILE SHES 3 MONTHS BEHIND ON HER CAR! \n\nIdk what to do. I hate that I’m making sure that I am paying off my cards right before the statement date, making all my payments on time and being responsible and having spreadsheets while she thinks it’s a game.

I am still covered for health but not dental.\n\n\\----\n\n​First, when I mean no money, I mean no money. I can barely afford gas half the time.\n\nI am a college student and I live with my parents. My parent's insurance kicks children off at 19, so I also haven't had a cleaning in over a year. I would ask them for money but they don't have that either because, well, the economy. We don't qualify for low income either.\n\nMy wisdom teeth are awful. Pretty sure I have five because one is at a complete angle and doesn't fit in my mouth. One of them is cracked, maybe two.\n\nSimply said, I need these teeth gone but have nothing to my name, Any and all advice is appreciated.",

      "text": "Hey, so I’ll start off and say I’m not necessarily financially savvy, and generally could be doing a better job. But here’s the situation.\n\nMy wife and I own a house and we are planning on moving soon so I can take a job up north. It pays better and it’s doing something I really enjoy at a company that I really like. Kind of a dream job honestly. \n\nWe basically decided we are going to sell the house we’ve owned for the last 4 years because we really don’t want be landlords and we want to focus on living in a new place and new job. \n\nWe bought the house in 2021 for $175,000 and we currently owe $155,000. We are looking to sell for $215,000 but it could possibly go for more. Our realtor said it’s best to sell for the actual value and see if you get better offers. \n\nWe are considering buying near my job in a small town where things are a bit more affordable and outdoor access is easier, plus there’s more space to move around. So we would be able to get a much nicer house for a lot less and really put whatever money we get into something that will grow with us. We also considered that if the job didn’t work out there’s other places in that area that I could work. And we could always rent the house out if we needed to move ASAP. \n\nBut with it being such a big move it would be nice to just rent for a while and try to get a lay of the area. But there’s hardly any rentals in the area that we like and the better rentals are in the bigger town about 15 minutes away. Not a big deal but the rental prices are also just higher. \n\nSo we are basically looking at putting $40,000 down on a $200,000 house with a high interest rate. Mortgage roughly $1200 a month. \n\nOr rent for $1500-$1800 a month with less space, further from work. But if the market crashes at least we didn’t loose anything. \n\nIf it helps to know we also have a dog. So that does make everything rental wise a bit harder. \n\nThe area is also a collage town so most of the rentals have no storage and a lot of utilities built in. Generally pet fees or no pets. \n\nAlso our avg income per month is roughly $3500",

I do have money in stocks, I prefer dividends, and a Roth IRA with a $6000 a year contribution.\n\nMy issue is I still feel like I’m leaving lots of uninvested money on the table. I know I could put more into stocks but I’m worried with this economy. I’m not amazing at stocks, I don’t lose money but it’s a very small growth.\n\nShould I reach out for a financial advisor so is that a waste of money? CDs? I just don’t know what to do and I’m feeling lost. I feel like that book “Death of a Salesman”. Im always on the road working. I feel like life is passing by. I’ve got money but no home, no girlfriend or wife. The last 7 years were a blur and I just want to find a way to make a home but still feel financially safe if I take a big cut and leave my industry.\n\nEdit: Thank you all so much for the rapid and helpful responses. I wanted to add a little more info about my stocks for you all. I do have several shares of JEPI, SCHD, SPHD and SPYD. It seems my issue is more fear of losing than the idea of continual investment. You guys are right, over time the markets alway tend to go up with these index funds.\n\nEdit: seriously thank you all, after reading all of these comments it seems my problem is more about me not being happy. I teared up as I realized I am sad and making a sudden change to buy a house or leave my job isn’t the answer. I need to look into myself and speak with a therapist.\n\nBut I will also be looking into better management of my accounts. More index funds, monthly investments, and looking into 401k/Roth options.\n\nThank you all, sometimes reddit can be filled with negative thoughts, but you all have been tremendously helpful.",

      "text": "Hi all, sorry in advance for a bit of a vent — looking for some perspective here from someone who has been in a similar situation. I (29 M) am the sole earner for a family of 5. I work for the federal government and had a wild year last year — I relocated out of state for what was seemingly a better job opportunity with a promotion and found it to be a terrible fit for both me and the family. We had previously owned a house which we sold and used the equity (around 75k) to purchase a new home (huge mistake in hindsight). The new location was in Florida. Less than a year in, we were desperate to get out of there, back to family, and I just so happened to get invited to an interview for a great job back near our hometown. We knew we may lose some money trying to sell the house so soon, and we were okay with it, but we didn’t realize just how bad it would be.\nThe FL real estate market bottom seemed to fall right out from under us at the same time we moved. After the house sat on the market for months with no offers, we were burning through our savings very fast (paying double rent/mortgage back in our home state on a 6.5% mortgage). We took the first serious offer we could get to stop the bleeding, but lost  everything we put down between selling at a loss and realtor fees, along with burning through the remainder of our savings. \n\nNow I’m starting over, no serious debt except for a truck payment, which I’m keeping. Salary is 136k but that doesn’t exactly stretch too far with 3 kids in the current economy. I save as much as I can for retirement and I can save around 600-800 a month for closer term goals, but I feel so far behind now compared to where I was. Thankful for the good job and VA loan eligibility, I know I could have had it worse. Has anyone had a similar experience, and how long did it take you to get back to feeling a little more stable afterward?\n\nEdit: just want to say thanks to everyone who answered — lots of great advice and it helps to know others have gotten through similar times and came out on top. Appreciate everyone sharing some wisdom.",

We are in a unique position as we have $500k for a downpayment on a home and zero debt otherwise. Her argument for buying a $750-800k home on an ARM is that mortgage rates right now are unlikely to go up (probably right), that we would want to refinance anyway within 5-7 years with current interest rates at 6.5% (probably right), and that if interest rates actually do go up over the next seven years, it's probably because the national economy is honestly just straight up crumbling (I know a lot of folks are pessimistic right now but IMO this is unlikely).\n\nMy insanely thrifty, financially conservative gut feeling is to stay far away from ARMs. That said in this case this seems like a relatively safe bet -- even if interest rates go waaaay up 7 years from now, our loan is relatively small in this case so we're likely to have paid off a big chunk, if not all of it.

We’re thinking since we have a good amount of time ( 1yr to execute against the relocation package offer) that it may be best to rent.

She would drive down Sunday afternoon/evening and stay until Wednesday noon time to drive back home to NJ. It’s going to suck for a bit on all of us but it buys us time to really see how this housing market responds to the Trump economy changes. It also gives us time to explore the area a bit more to see if we even like it there. Letting go of this 2% mortgage on a home that’s nearly paid off especially with all of my “creature comforts” and upgrades I’ve done is just not sitting well with me.",

      "text": "I live out in the country and up until now have had beater cars. I was able to finance a used Chevy Bolt and thought everything was good until the car started having issues. Took it to the shop and found out it's rodent damage. One $500 deductible later and I have my car back. Literally a week later and they've chewed thru the washer fluid reservoir again and now, months later, I'm having electrical elements starting to go out again. I set out traps, have everything picked up outside, etc to do what I can to prevent this but I think they just love all the soy wires in newer vehicles. The only solution I can think of is to build a garage to keep the car away from the rodents. I've gotten bids for all the elements and can do the whole project (concrete, building, garage doors, etc) for $20k. Problem is that I don't have enough equity to get a home equity loan. I have excellent credit (799 on my banking app) and my credit union offered me a 7% personal loan but only for $15k. I'm trying to find a $20k personal loan that doesn't have an outrageous interest rate and that is at least a 5 year term. Even if I can find that, by my estimates, that puts me with about $400-500 of cushion in my budget after all bills and a small but realistic grocery allotment. I'm very worried about living with such a small margin of error especially with the uncertainty in the economy. I'm a white collar job and have been off and on searching for a new job for 5 years now with no success. I feel incredibly pessimistic about my ability to find a new job if I'm laid off. The good news is that my team and I would be towards the last of the people let go as it was recently assembled out of the \"rock stars\" in the company to fill a roll our customers are literally walking out the door over. Overall I feel caught between spending money over and over again to keep fixing this car (idk how long insurance will let me keep filing comprehensive claims over this before dropping me) or stretching my paycheck to the very edge of comfort to afford a solution to save my car. What would you guys do? Is there a 3rd option I'm not thinking of? Do you guys have any directions to point me towards for personal or non-equity based home improvement loans? Thanks in advance!\n\nEDIT: people. I have tried it all. They ate the Irish Springs. I have tried peppermint oil, clove oil. Special blended “rodent repellent “ sprays. I have a sonic repellant and flashing light and they chewed through the wire in 3 places. There is no other prevention I can try other than cats which I don’t feel like is an acceptable option for me. I understand mice like garages but I’m handy enough to rodent proof a garage. Can we please focus on the finance problem here?",

Now I feel like I'm stuck in a prison of my own making and my future is in jeopardy.\n\n**Some backstory:** I inherited a partially paid off house and my wife makes a decent salary. Because of that I was lucky enough to be in a position to pursue my passion after college despite not making much money at it, with the hope that it would one day pay off. Since college, I’ve prioritized the money I made into 1) paying off my student debt 2) creating a rainy day fund for an unstable career 3) trying to maintain some version of an enjoyable lifestyle with my wife. But now, after taking years to finally get afloat in a gig economy, my industry crashed and I’ve mostly been out of work for about a year. I’ve burned through most of my rainy day fund.\n\nMy wife is pregnant, and it’s been a huge wake up call. I have no debt, but I also have zero retirement savings and little-to-no financial literacy.\n\nI’ve tried reading the wiki but I might as well be reading Russian — I don’t know where to begin.\n\n**Finances:**\n\n* 35 years old.\n* $20k left in my personal “rainy day fund” savings account\n* $30k in a joint savings account with my wife.\n* $17k in a HYSA with my wife.\n* No debts.\n* Refinanced for a 2.7% mortgage rate in California and will paid off in 12 years if all goes well. House is worth roughly $900k.\n* Wife makes $160k/year.\n* I was previously making anywhere from $50k-$80k a year, but that has dropped down to about $20k this last year.\n* I contribute roughly $1500 to mortgage/month.\n* With health insurance, bills, etc my other spending routinely hits about $2500.\n\nBesides “making more money” and getting a more stable income, I have no idea where to start. I work very hard, but I feel like I've put my eggs in the wrong basket for too long and feel so behind. Any advice on where to start so I can a) understand finances better and b) develop good financial habits to try and catch up?",

We've wanted to buy a home, but living in Denver, it's been tough to find a home in our price range (~$500k).  When they do pop up, they're instantly snatched up with cash offers.\n\nDespite the current economy issues, both of our jobs will thankfully be very secure.  With that in mind, houses are now popping up in the area and actually sticking around long enough to entertain offers.  Some are even actively dropping $25k+ in price.\n\nIs now the time for us to really push for a house, since it seems others are hesitant to do so?  \n\nWe're good about our funds, but we admittedly have ZERO idea what we're getting into.  My gut tells me to buy, but if anyone has any insight or advice against it, please let me know!\n\nThanks so much for any input!\n\nEDIT/UPDATE:  Thanks everyone for all of the information and perspectives!  This has been very helpful for us as potential first-time buyers in a tough area and tough economy.

It’s a nice neighborhood But there’s on avg. $500 a month of HOA fees. Been here for 4 years, definitely some equity but since I can’t really afford it, I’ve been slowly accruing debt.\n\n2. We just had a baby, bills are already adding up quickly. We have no savings for him or ourselves. Adding both him and my wife to my insurance totals 1400 a month for all of us \n\n3. I do have a steady job that I enjoy and pays decent (avg. 90K) but after the health insurance is taken out and the mortgage is paid I feel like I’m left with very little to survive off of. Because of my income I don’t qualify for any help.\n\n4. My wife hasn’t worked for a while, she had some medical things going on but now she’s taking care of the baby. Decent Day care near us would be more than any job she might get so that seems unreasonable now.\n\n5. Credit card debt has increase to about 23,000 and I’m nearing my limit. I only have one credit card.\n\nI’m not sure what I should do. I think maybe selling the house and moving to something smaller would be good but in this economy I can’t imagine paying all that much less. Also renting seems crazy also since monthly rent is about the same as what we pay for our mortgage unless we move to a much lower income area. I could also pick up another job but I’m already picking up extra hours at my current job and side hustle jobs won’t make me as much as the $50 an hour I get now.\n\nAny additional advice, ideas?\n\nAdditional info.\n\nNo car payments \n\nTake home income is about 3600 a month after health insurance is taken out (up to 500 extra a month depending on overtime). I have a hybrid position where my salary is set if I meet a certain amount of billable hours each week and any additional hours counts towards hourly rate. \n\nWe have monthly and quarterly HOA, which averages out to about $500 a month and our mortgage is about 2200 . \n\nOur car insurance is about about 650 every six months. I selected the lowest coverage that we feel comfortable having.\n\nHonestly, we haven’t done a good assessment of our expenses for food and gas and other expenses.\n\nI think offering daycare is a phenomenal idea that I would’ve never thought of.

      "text": "I'm 50 years old.  I work as a nurse, I have another side business/hobby that hopefully breaks even every year but probably loses money.  I spend a lot of time pursuing things that are interesting to me.  I work to pay for things.  Work is fine and I currently really enjoy my job but I'd sure prefer to not work.  \n\nI've kind of lived my life and had enough money to do the things I've wanted to do and more or less enjoyed myself but I've never worked towards retirement.  It's only in the last 4 or 5 years that I've pondered getting older and staying in one place and having some stability. \n\nI have zero debt.  My credit score is 779.  \n\nThe issue is that I have somewhat limited savings and not much else.  I'm renting a 1br in a very expensive Northeastern city and home ownership here is not really possible for me without working a lot more than I want.  \n\nI am strongly leaning towards moving to Rochester NY where there is a creative scene that appeals to me, a seemingly large amount of healthcare jobs and where houses are roughly 1/3 of what they cost here.  I think I could probably be happy there.  There are not a lot of alternatives on the east coast.  My parents are older and in NY and I don't want to be super far from them.\n\nI'm fairly risk averse and I am very pessimistic about the direction the country is going.  I'm a bit concerned even that healthcare jobs will not even be that reliable so I'm somewhat hesitant to move when I have a solid union job but there's not a lot of other reason to stay here.  \n\nI grew up with parents who were paranoid about investing and accumulated a large amount of cash and I definitely have that inclination.  It's only in the last 2 years I've had a 401k and now I sort of get it.\n\nSo I'm looking for some advice on where to put money.  The way things are are very stupid, I know that.  \n\nI have 90k in a very low yield 1% savings account that was given to me.  This is for a down payment on a house and probably some initial repairs and expenses on buying a house.  So I should move this into something that's higher yield but also that I can withdraw from?  What would that be?\n\nI have roughly $30k in savings and checking accounts that I've accumulated over the last few years.  This is what I've been paying my bills from and kind of what I keep on hand.  Obviously this is also stupid.  \n\nI have a 403(B) from work that has about 13k in it as of now.  Vested balance is about 10k.\n\nI basically just don't pay a ton of attention to any of this and I realize that I've lost out on tens of thousands of dollars on not at very least keeping stuff in higher yield accounts.  I am super crazy paranoid about the economy crashing and always have been but also realize that the market has consistently gone up.\n\nI haven't really thought retirement was a possibility for me so I just tried to save money as a buffer and take care of myself so I can keep working till I croak.  I do think it's rational to understand the world is probably going to get harder in the next 30 years and that some assumptions we have might not hold water.\n\nAnyway.  TLDR:\n\nWhat would be some smart ways to move this money into higher yield things that would also allow me to withdraw at least some of it in case I need it for a house or emergencies?\n\nThank you and sorry for rambling.",

Tuition is an eye-popping $23,700 (about ~$2.5k/month over 10 months) and we just found out he’s not going to be awarded any financial aid. We make about $214k gross but take home is around ~$134k net. We still have costs for medical, savings, mortgage, bills, preschool tuition for our youngest, etc.\n\nWe use Ramit Sethi’s conscious spending plan, and it shows our fixed costs are already at 60% (should be 40-60% of take home). I understand this is not workable, I feel like I just need so many people to tell me it’s insane to spend 11% of gross/18% net of take home on one kid’s tuition. My partner seems to have accepted this isn’t going to work for us, but I keep spinning my wheels because it’s important to us and could really benefit our son, but the idea of 1) tying up that much cash in tuition is mind boggling to me 2) especially in this economy and 3) that money could do so much work for us in terms of saving for the future and personal finance. I feel like I understand the logic and the numbers aren’t lying, but struggling to accept this. Any feedback welcome (be kind).",

My goal is to save our house even if I lose everything else.\n\nSo I'll start off with my finances, and assests. I have a house with $295k left on the mortgage, zillow says the house is worth 825k. It's a 15byear mortgage with 11 years left @2.25% and 3k a month.\nOf the three semi trucks I own 2 are paid off but one of them probably won't sell for anything at all since it's broken down, might get 40k for the other one and the trailers. The third truck still has 2.5 years of payments and it would be break even if I sold it buy I do earn money with this one, roughly 4-5k a month. Other income includes my wife who earns roughly 3k a month. My 2 son's would be about to contribute 1k each for rent and bills.\n\nNow for my debt, I have a total of $140k in credit card debt with 70k of it on business cards. Don't need to be told how stupid and screwed I am with that, we racked it up trying to save the company and health care bills. I also have roughly 20k the company owes to California state taxes. Also I took out a 90k SBA loan during covid at 4.5% that I pay roughly $700 a month for. Also I fucked up by mixing my personal and business accounts. \n\nIs bankruptcy an option that somehow let's my save my house and discharge some of my debt?\n\nEdit: Just wanted to add yes I've been very careful with my spending, no netflix, eating out etc, debts from medical and the trucking economy going into what's now its 4th year of a recession and I had bought the semi trucks right before the market crashed and pay went to the toilet. Semi was at 150k, 165k, and 180k when I bought them and roughly 100k for the 3 trailers. I know i should have gave up on the business earlier. \n\nEdit2: I need about 7k a month if I had no credit card debt for my house payment, car insurance, electricity, internet, phone, and other bills. My wife earns roughly 3k and I get 2k from rent from my son's. And I can bring 4-5k also. My biggest issue is I can't keep up with the payments for my debt.",

My son moving out has meant that I'm saving a ton every month.\n\nMy dilemma revolves around my mortgage and my potential retirement date. Now that my son has moved out, I could afford to pay off my mortgage within 5 years by paying an extra 1k a month (and I can definitely afford that). Doing so would also allow me to retire at almost the same date my mortgage is paid off.\n\nPrior to realizing that I could do this, my plan was to work until 70 (10 years from now). \n\nFWIW, I am in a pension system. Retiring in 5 years as opposed to 10 years has some implications on my retirement income. However, if my mortgage is retired, those implications are far less significant.\n\nEssentially I *can* do this. Should I?

      "text": "I am 33 years old. I have $29,474 in a 401K retirement account that is in an S&P500 index fund. I cannot withdraw that money without incurring a 10% penalty and paying taxable income on that amount. Right now, my taxable income is 0$. I live in Cambodia, and I am a volunteer in the United States Peace Corps.\n\nFrom what I understand, I would pay 0% tax on the first $15,000 of the withdrawal, and then 10% on the next $11,925, and 12% on the remaining $2,549. I would also need to pay the IRS a 10% early withdrawal penalty, which would bring the total tax liability to (2947.4+1192.5+305.88) to 4445.78.\n\nI would then have access to $25,028.22. I'd like to invest this money in individual companies like MSFT, GOOG, and other companies that I discover that have undervalued P/E, PEG, and P/S ratios, as well as strong balance sheets, income statements, and cash flow records.\n\nTechnology companies are expected to grow enormously in the coming years. I would diversify the investments of course into other sectors of the economy too - not just invest everything into technology.\n\nI currently have a $12,130 investment in GOOG that is doing well with unrealized gains.\n\nAdditionally, I am trying to make up for a loss on an investment that went horribly wrong, and resulted in a 100% loss. I know what I did wrong in my original analysis of that company, and will not make that mistake again.\n\nI'd have in total $12,130 + $25,028 = $37,158 to invest and earn back the $30,000 + $4445.78 = $34,445.78 that I've lost in a faster time period.\n\nI've tried to become more financially literate over the past 4 months since I sold for that giant loss of $30,000, and become a responsible, long term investor in valuable companies. I know that withdrawing a 401K early is costly, and what I'm thinking of doing with the remaining $25,028 is much riskier than leaving the original $29,474 in an index fund until I'm 60 years old - in the year 2051.\n\nI still have many years left of earning power as well, and I'm confident that I'll find a job after I return from the Peace Corps, as well as make back the $30,000 I lost as well as the $4475 that I will lose if I withdraw the 401K.\n\nWhat would you do in my situation? I want to invest in riskier assets instead of an index fund, but an index fund is safe, and it will grow slowly, but I won't recover from the $30,000 financial loss for 5 or more years, and potentially not make as much on investments in individual stocks that are expected to grow quickly.\n\nThanks for your time.",

      "title": "Do hybrid vehicles make financial sense if you're owning long-term?",
      "text": "This is a thought I've had for years and recently decided to crunch some numbers.  Toyota is known for having the smallest price delta between their conventional and hybrid drivetrains.  About $3,000 CAD or $2,000 USD.  I'll use the AWD Rav4 as an example.\n\nBefore 2020 it seems like Toyota had an 8 year/100,000 mile battery warranty.  Since 2020 it seems like a 10 year/150,000 mile warranty.  Toyota claims the battery is designed to last the life of the vehicle, but all all know Toyota owners are known for keeping their cars longer than most.  So I'd hesitate to call 100K miles or 150K miles the \"lifespan\" of a Toyota.  \n\nA Google search returns a battery replacement cost in the range of $3,000-$8,000 USD for new batteries.  Or $1,500-$3,500 USD for refurbished batteries. I'm not sure why the range is so wide. Perhaps only the bad cells require replacement?  So that's the cost you could expect if a replacement is required outside of warranty.  \n\nIt seems as though the hybrid batteries are expected to last about 10 years.\n\nUsing fueleconomy.gov, the listed fuel economy for a 2024 RAV4 Hybrid is 41 mpg city/38 highway/39 combined.  \n\nFor the conventional drivetrain it's 25/33/28 mpgs.\n\nThe website says you can expect to save $2,250 in fuel costs over 5 years.  \n\nI know there are many variables, but if we just run with these numbers, you could expect to save $4,500 in fuel costs over the life of the battery, but you paid a $1,700 upfront premium for the hybrid.  So you're really looking at a total savings of $2,800.  Across 10 years.  $280/year is quite miniscule.  Of course assuming average yearly mileage.  You'd need just over 6 years to \"break even\" on the hybrid premium.  So if you don't keep the vehicle at least that long, you're just losing money.  I know nothing of residual resale value between either drivetrain though.  \n\nBut the added drivetrain complexity may or may not leave you in the hole depending on whether your battery get replaced under warranty and, or if you choose to get refurbished or new batteries.\n\nThis really doesn't seem all that compelling.  If you don't keep the car, sure you're rolling the dice less, so to speak, with regards to the battery replacement.  But you're also not appreciating the maximum fuel saving potential, yet you still paid the premium for the hybrid drivetrain.  \n\nIs there even an environmental aspect to this? Maybe locally?  But based on nothing but my assumption, I bet not on a global scale.  \n\nWe're not even talking about buying used.  That would probably be a whole other can of worms.\n\nAm I on point here?  Did I get something wrong or miss anything significant?  Hybrid Cars for the sake of saving money don't really seem all that compelling if you look closely.",

We were hoping to refinance when interest rates go down, but they're about the same as last year. I think the economy can only be predicted with a magic 8 ball right now, so I'm not gonna wait longer for rates to improve. We have no other debt. Our IRA and 401k will be maxed. We'll have a 6 month emergency fund in a 3.6% saving account. We're not sure how long we'll live in the house. It depends on how long our parents live. They're upper 70s.\n\nI feel like recasting is a safe 6.49% return and lowering our mortgage payment would make it a lot less stressful if one of us lost a job in a bad economy. The other option is to invest it in ETFs. We're following a bogglehead strategy, but I don't want to invest it all at once because I can't time this market. I don't know how best to spread out the investment either. I also don't know how to figure out the expected returns of the ETFs, so it's not easy for me to compare that vs recasting.\n\nWhat happens if the housing market crashes?\nWhat happens to the interest we've already paid on the mortgage? It is about 20k so far. Are we just wasting that?",

No other debt besides the mortgage. I can retire at 62 with a defined pension of 1/3 my annual salary. Even if I retired at 62, my employer would my fund health insurance until I’m 63.5 years old. However, I would need to find insurance until Medicare (65) which is not cheap. My wife is self employed so she doesn’t have access to health insurance through an employer. Since she is three years younger, paying her health insurance is expensive. I don’t plan on taking social security until 67. Here’s my question. If you were me, when would you retire? For context, I’m burnt out from working. The people I work with are decent and the work isn’t terrible. The pay is fair for what I do, $120K annually. Sometimes the hours are long but usually 40 to 45 hours a week. I know I have more options than many people. Retiring at 65 would add another six percent annually to my pension and $150K to investments. My wife and I are fugal. Our lifestyles are simple. We don’t spend much money outside of the basics; mortgage, utilities, insurances, car maintenance, gas, food, medical, etc. We do a lot of camping and own three trucks/SUVs that cost money.

      "text": "Ok everyone, I’m consulting people here because I can’t seem to get a simple straight answer from anyone I know, including my mortgage lender. I think she’s just unaware of how many questions I have and I don’t want to constantly bother her when a question pops in my mind. We are first-time homebuyers and I have a few questions just for clarity on a few terms and the way things work. \n\nPlease only kind, non-judgemental answers! We’re figuring this all out on our own for the first time. TIA!\n\n- My mortgage lender discussed discount points- I get that this is just money paid towards lowering your IR. HOWEVER, she also said she’d recommend “paying more towards the principal” rather than spending a lot on discount points. Can someone explain to me what this means, exactly? And what we do to do this?\n\n- Are you able to over-pay some months towards your mortgage, and if so does this do anything besides get you closer to paying off your loan?\n\n- I always heard you can negotiate an IR, so I asked… she gave me the impression that there really is no such thing in today’s economy. What’s with that?\n\nEDIT: just want to say thank you for all this great advice! I’ll use those amortization calculators to do some more digging, but I’m thinking my mortgage lender gave sound advice and we should put more towards the down payment vs points (she did say they predict rates will drop by the end of the year if we choose to refi)",

      "text": "So I've never gotten too deep into credit card points. I've had a rewards cards for 10 years now. I buy everything possible on my cards. I've never worried about which cards to use because I've only had one criteria. 0% APR. At first it was just the offer I happened to get, then I just kept using that card because I didn't know better. Then I got another one and used because I was saving for a house. \n\nAround covid I bought a house and I had 0 APR card at the same time. I was cash strapped after the house so it was helpful to put everything on the card. By happenstance after I paid off my balance one of my other cards sent me an offer for 0% APR. When I was using it I got laid off. Almost time to pay it off I didn't want to use my savings so I did a balance transfer to another 0% APR card and then opened another one because I still had no income. I got a job and started catching up. \n\nWhen the time came I paid off both cards. I've never been late on a payment, I've never paid interest I always pay off my balance right before 0% APR expires. All of the points I used as cash back to help me reduce the balance. Currently I have another one and I'm doing the same thing. But I'm in a better financial situation and started using cards based on the benefits. \n\nI've never understood miles. Like I understand some cards give you 5% cash back on travel. I understand that if you have enough points you can buy tickets with them and get your travel for free. But at 5% cash back to get $1,000 worth of points you would have to spend $20,000. Is that it? All the people that say they regularly fly first class because of their points and stay at the hotels for free, they just spent 100k a year and that's how they get enough points? Or do they scale and compound somehow and you get a better deal if you use them specifically for miles or hotels? Thanks in advance",

We have college savings plans in place for both of our kids (3&1), and just in case I kick it early, I have a $500K 30 year term life policy with Mass Mutual. We own a really small home (2.75% interest), and the only other debt we carry is a fixed rate home loan (5% interest) that we still owe $20k on. \n\nWe pay about $2500/month for child care which leaves us very little left over for savings. We have always operated with little to no emergency fund, which now feels foolish but still insurmountable. Our house still needs a lot of work to make it work for our family and we have to make it work because of the low rate. \n\nI have 2 old retirement accounts through old employers totaling $32k. They’ve grown a little over the past decade but of course are getting hit hard in the current economy.

About $800/month each on the car and student loans is what I choose to pay. So at the end of all that I have about $2000 for other things like utilities, food, gas, etc. I have about $10k in savings for an emergency. Anything extra goes towards my loans.\n\nI have been thinking about the idea of selling/trading in the car to try and get something cheaper or even for cash, but is it smart? I would eliminate my car payment and can focus more on my student debt.\n\nSome things I am considering if I do sell it...\n1. I kinda want a truck because I'll need one to eventually help my fiance and I move in a year with her horses, but gas will be expensive.\n2. I kinda want an economy gas car since 90% of my driving is just to work and back.\n\nWhat are your thoughts?",

      "text": "My mother passed about 2 months ago and I am the sole beneficiary on her accounts. I am set to receive over $1.5 million dollars from all accounts, which are listed below:\n\nCore Life Insurance - $50,000.00\n\nBasic Life Insurance - $250,000.00\n\nSupplemental Life Insurance Policy - $1,017,000.00\n\n401(k) - $213,861.12\n\nFinal Wages - $1,274.04\n\nI am a 35-year old, single, male in semi-decent health. My partner and I have been together for 18yrs and have a home and vehicle together. I will include my current financial situation below:\n\nCredit Card Debit: $21,618.30 with rates between 25-29.99% APR\n\nMortgage: 3% fixed rate over 30yrs. Current balance on mortgage shows as $337,714.51. Monthly mortgage payment is $2,211.44.\n\nCar loan: $7,580.70 @ 8.48% APR. Monthly payment is $407.65 & it is a 2018 Toyota RAV4 XLE with about 120k miles on it. Runs very well.\n\nMy request for guidance is as such:\n\nI suddenly come into a serious amount of money right as our country and economy are absolutely shitting the bed. I don't know that I feel 100% safe in the whole \"buy the dip, you're young\" mindset when I'm legit concerned the USD as we've known it may not be around in 4 years. I'm thinking that, despite my 3% locked mortgage rate, I should take some of these funds and pay off my mortgage completely.\n\nObviously the credit card debts need to go, I think that goes without saying but I'll say it anyway. The car I could be fine with keeping as a monthly payment, especially if my mortgage is paid off. I really just am not sure what to do with the house.\n\nThe money, regardless of the house being paid off or not, will be invested in my Schwab account. My questions more surround the whole \"Do I pay off my mortgage or bet that the economy will bounce back and buy in the dip\" ordeal.\n\nI'm sure I'm missing important info so feel free to ask for clarification on anything and I'll do my best to reply promptly. Thank you all in advance for the guidance.\n\n  \nEDIT: I should also note that I'm being told that all of this money is being given to me without having to be used to pay off any outstanding debts my mother had. If this is the case, that's fantastic news, but if we could get some clarification or confirmation here - that'd also be nice.",

      "text": "We make $180,000 ($150k me, 30k, wife) with a $1100 (5% APR) mortgage payment + $450 HOA on our first home, a condo ($179,000 purchase in 2022). My family of 4 lives pretty comfortably here, financially (max 401k, IRAs), space-wise, etc. Only downside is I have a massive commute of 1.5 hours (1 hour on a good day).\n\nWife just got an offer for $100,000 conveniently right next to my job. This is a rare opportunity for her specific field, and would be a great resume builder.\n\nProblem is, we would need to move closer. We can't both be commuting 1.5 hours with kids at school/daycare so far away. And anything within 30 minutes of my job is $1mil+ right now. ~45 minutes out, we can find between $500,000 and $575,000 (~6.9% APR) for the same size floorplan as what we have now. This would put a mortgage at 20% down around $3,400 - $3,950, and we don't really have more for higher downpayment. Anything smaller is in sketchy parts of town (high crime), and any rent options are $2,500+ for about a third the space as our condo, meaning one bedroom, no space for kids.\n\nThe other catch, is my wife's offer is potentially only 1 year. They *want* to extend longer, but who can say in this economy. We could scrape by on $3,400 after that year on my income, but that's hitting >50% of my take home, and I don't want to give up retirement saving. Wife can probably find something for $30k again as well, but now we are back to where we started income-wise, in the same size house, paying $2000 more every month, higher interest rate. Only my commute is 45 minutes instead of 1.5 hours, which isn't nothing.\n\nIs the move worth it? Financially? Are there other risks I should be considering? Other alternatives? How should we make the most of the guarunteed 1 year of her job at $100k if we do? If she can keep the job I think we come out ahead, but I don't want to become house-poor if it doesn't pan out.\n\nThings to note: \n- Daycare ($1300) will be ending for our youngest after a year when she gets to kindergarten, which could relieve some of the extra mortgage cost.\n- Market is very competitive out there. Houses are going fast and I don't know how much leverage we have. Where we currently live may be harder to sell, which makes securing our equity for a downpayment tricky.\n- I am currently working remote 2 days/week, but there are rumblings of full Return To Office in the next year or so. Commuting 3 hours each day 5 days a week would be rough.",

I (28F) work a decently paying job and recently moved to a new city where the cost of living, especially rent, is higher than what I was used to back in my hometown.\n\nFor the past two years, I’ve been able to comfortably afford my rent in a (2 bedroom one bath duplex) and live within my means. But that changed last month when my car completely broke down. I had no choice but to finance a new one, and now I’m dealing with a car payment on top of my already high rent.\n\nI live in a quiet, relatively safe neighborhood. My neighbors are kind, look out for me, and help me feel secure. But with my new financial burden, I’m considering downsizing to a smaller, more affordable place, like a studio or a cheaper one-bedroom apartment.\n\nHere’s my dilemma: cheaper rent usually means living in a cheaper neighborhood, and that brings up serious safety concerns for me. I don’t want to put myself in a risky situation just to save money, but I also don’t want to fall behind financially. \n\nHas anyone been in a similar position? How do you decide between financial relief and personal safety? What would you do?\n\nI want to provide an update on this post as I took some of y’all’s advice to look for another job. (Part time job) on top of my full time job && well I did and let me tell you it has been a disaster LOL only my 3rd week in & they already had me training a new girl mind you I am still pretty new myself. Long story short she made a huge mistake & the both of us spent hours cleaning it up. Followed by an angry lecture from the said owner and manager of the establishment. that is a story for another post LoL so I am back to square one. I want to find cheaper housing to avoid having to work a second job & deal with the added stress that comes from having 2 jobs LOL life is so funny.",

I've been paying the minimums on the cards, but I will no longer be able to do that. I have no other place I can pull money out of. I already sold my car and most of my things. I am out of options and am not sure what to do to. Any advice would be appreciated. Feel free to call me an idiot, but rest assured that I'm well aware.\n\n  \n\\*Edit: To clarify, I think what I'm looking for help with the most is what to do about the debt now that I can't pay it.",

      "text": "I (28) have been saving for a down payment on a house for a few years now. I have 57,000 in my specific mortgage savings account and 71,000 saved over all. With the housing prices in my area that’s barely enough for a 20ish percent down payment on the kind of house I would ideally want. With monthly payments, taxes and utilities I couldn’t really afford it.\n\nBut, I could afford a manufactured house. There are a couple of houses near me going for around 80,000. After a sizable down payment the mortgage and lot rent would come to 1200-1300 a month. That would be for a three bedroom double wide, about the rent for a one bedroom apartment in my area.\n\nI want to own a home so I can start a family. I want to foster and adopt, which I can’t do in my current living situation. I want to own something so I have more control and not throw money away on the out of control rent prices. If I take care of the house I have a good chance of protecting my investment and I would hopefully upgrade after a few years.\n\nBut there’s a problem- uncertainty. The economy is a mess. Queer rights are under attack. (I’m nonbinary) And my job might be at risk due to the big bill. (I work at a medical lab and most of our tests go Thursday Medicare) \n\nWhat if I lose my job and can’t afford my mortgage and lot rent? What if I lose all the savings I worked so hard for? What if I make a home for a family I can’t have? What if nothing happens and I waste my life planning on disaster?",

      "text": "Hi,\nMy family (wife, myself and 4 kids) are considering buying a beautiful country home on 5 acres. But I am concerned about being house rich, money poor and running into painful problems that were preventable. The home is costly ~$1.5million (~$450sq/ft), but otherwise amazing: single owner, custom build, very well maintained, gardens, pool, ponds, just amazing. There is definitely a premium put on the quality of the home, but not overpriced for the area. It tends to be a place for affluent people to move to when they want space.\n\nThis is the type of home that would be our forever home, so it is really exciting, but I don't want to be rash with the mixed sentiment in the economy that has lasted a long time and the current high interest rates that aren't going down quickly. There is almost no renovations required, or least nothing in the short term. No other catches that we have yet to see on the property itself.\n\nFor financials: It is only my salary, ~$275k in Total compensation. I have a lot of security in my company, but I don't feel great about my particular org in the company (not growing like we were) and there have been layoffs. Retirement is on track, and college is still 10 years away. I am not looking to short change my future with this decision.\n\nFor downpayment, we have about $500k equity in our house. I have vested stock that I can sell to bring the home loan down below jumbo status, but that still puts us at ~$775k mortgage and hopefully on the low end of 6% rate.\n\nBased on some basic math, it would be roughly 50% of my take home pay for the mortgage (401k untouched, probably keep some ESPP). We don't live lavish by any means, but kids gotta eat, tax bill will be high, and I don't know how much electricity 5 acres consumes. I am nervous about overextending our finances just because we are excited about fulfilling this dream.\n\n* Any advice about being house rich, money poor? Things to be prepared for? \n* Is there anything I am overlooking in finances? \n* Any questions my wife and I should be asking ourselves? \n* When does a house become unwise, even though it is expected to appreciate?\n\nThe crux of my worry is that I could never have imagined buying a home for this much money. It feels like it couldn't every be a good decision, just foolhardy. I am not looking for a perfect formula to trust, just want to be thoughtful and make the best informed decision.\n\nAppreciate any advice.",

      "text": "So the wife and I (both mid 30s) are expecting a child soon and she he has been really pushing to buy a property. I have ran the numbers and we can certainly afford the down-payment and the all in cost of ownership (EMI, maintenance, HOA fees etc.). So affordability isn't an issue and we would not be buying \"too much\" house as per the standard rules of thumb like the 28/36 Rule (Debt to Income ratio) and 3-5x annual income rule. The upfront payment however will represent 50% of our savings.\n\nFor context, we live in Dubai and the reason I mention it is because its tax free. No income tax , no property taxes or capital gains taxes either on property value appreciation or on equities.\n\nI have also developed a detailed model on rent vs buy. If certain assumptions I have made (property appreciation, long term mortgage interest rates) etc. hold then its better to buy vs rent. However, I have no way of knowing if those assumptions will hold even if I think they are reasonable at this point.\n\nI just feel there is way too much concentration risk with buying a property. I am placing a huge bet in the Dubai economy or the specific building and apartment that it will increase its value even if my assumptions are modest.\n\nMy alternative is to invest my money in a globally diversified stock/bond index fund. It may turn out that the dubai property market continues to boom and I will be kicking myself for missing out on all the sweet sweet gains 10 years from now but just given the concentration risk, I don't think its a smart decision. I may end up making less money by going the index fund route but given the massive diversification and 100+ year history of stock market returns, it just feels like the smarter choice.\n\nAnd then I wonder, why is my situation so different to any other? Wouldn't it always be better to rent vs busy just given the concentration risk?\n\nI know you will say that there is an emotional angle of owning your own property and the stability that comes with it. But then isn't that emotional perspective logically overblown given that that there is significant downsides to owning property besides just potential sub-optimal returns (significant debt, illiquidity potentially creating a catastrophic situation if you lose your job for lets say 6+ months in a down-turn)\n\nMy wife is really keen to buy and I am open to be convinced but I just don't see a good reason. Maybe I am blind?\n\nEDIT: I am slightly surprised by the responses. I know a lot of people are sometimes emotionally invested in the idea that owning a house is great which I can appreciate as I am not immune to the same feelings. However, a lot of people have ignored the crux of my question. Given the disparity in concentration risk in buying vs renting(and investing the downpayment in index funds), why would buying make sense? Yes owning a house and investing can be different but they don't have to be mutually exclusive always.",

      "text": "Hi all! \nSeeking friendly advice from you folks (ppl who just want to be rude, no need to comment. Keep it positive please). \nI am 35 and live in the suburbs of Houston with my daughter. I bought the house in 2021. It was never intended to be my forever but I wanted to start my home equity journey. I got the house with a 2.375% interest rate, my mortgage is $2300 (high property taxes). I have no other debt. \nI am ready to move into the city of Houston. I’m unmarried and my daughter is now an adult (I had her in high school). I want to build community, do more things in the city and meet more people. I’m not finding that in the suburbs. It’s mostly families with young kids so my life and schedule are a bit different. I’d love to date and get married one day but the men out here are married lol. I do go in the city a lot but the drive is far, so I don’t get to do as much as I’d like (work in coffee shops, try different workout classes, happy hours and run clubs because of traffic). \nAnyway, I found a 3 story I love. It’s listed at $419,000 which would increase my mortgage $1000-1200. I’d have to decrease my savings from $2000 a month to $1000 a month to make this work. I’m currently making $130k and should be promoted soon but not counting my chickens before they hatch. \nIs this feasible? I am really ready to focus on this next chapter as an empty nester but I find it hard in my area. \n\nAlso, I plan to rent out my home for additional income, not ready to let that interest rate go yet. \n\nWould love to hear from young parents with adult children or those starting fresh who understands my life and feelings. \n\nEdit: this is my first post here and fairly new to Reddit so I appreciate the feedback on additional info. \nFor my current suburb home: \nMy mortgage company says it’s about $80k in equity, but this is pre appraisal\nIf I rent my realtor estimates I’ll make about $500 a month\nIt’s a new construction. I still have the foundation warranty and I pay for a warranty for all appliances and systems\nMy dad lives here and will help with small repairs \nI work remote so I’m flexible to go to the home when needed\n\nI have about $120k in 401k (took a dip from economy). Currently I contribute $1000 per month to 401k but will have to reduce to $500 plus company match. Roth is already maxed out. \n\nI save $2000 per month to my account but will have to reduce to $1000 per month. \n\nI put $2800 a month in my checking which takes care of all my bills. That will increase about $1200 which I will reallocate from above. \n\nThat leaves me about $2200 for miscellaneous spending a month (groceries gas dinner vacation dog kid etc)\n\nNo debt. \n\nI have 5% saved for the down payment and closing. I will receive a raise and bonus next month but my job won’t tell us compensation changes until next week. \n\nUPDATE: thanks for all the supportive feedback! I reached out to my realtor and we will begin the process to sell my current home. Then I’ll use the money to put down 20% and the remainder in a low index fund. Should come out with at least $100k from the sell. thanks again!!!",

Which honestly makes no sense since I can do that in a brokerage account. \n\n  \nThis being said - when I do leave and roll the funds from my 401k to IRAs... how would those after-tax contributions be handled? I'm curious, because if I make sure those just stay in cash and when I do a roll-over to an IRA, put it and leave it all in cash at Fidelity - would I be able to somehow roll those funds into Roth when I do a 401k rollover to IRA - or would I still be limited by IRA contribution limits at that point?\n\n  \nI'm wondering just incase in 10 years or so, I'm above the joint income threshold to do Roth contributions - or if it would take 15 to 20 years to backdoor all the money over to Roth. It would be easy since if I do this I already pay taxes on the 401k contributions, if I could just convert to Roth on the roll-over to IRA.",

      "text": "Hi all, so I’ve been weighing two options. I’m stuck in between going all in with debt or starting my IRA. I’m currently 24 and seeing how the economy is going and I’m concerned that what I am currently doing for retirement is not enough. I’m contributing 6% to my 401 (mandatory) and my employer matches that. I owe roughly 22.6k at a 6.49% interest rate on my car loan at this point, and I have been approaching the issue as to not even think of starting an IRA until the debt is gone. So I’ve been throwing anywhere between 500-1000 on principal for the debt. However the sooner I start an IRA, the sooner compound interest takes off and I’m aware that even a couple years can make a difference.",

      "text": "(I’m the Uk)\n\nSo I’m 25 and my partner is 27. We don’t have kids don’t plan on having any. I’m in a job that pays about 2-3k a month (3-4k with OT) and my partner gets 1-2k a month and after bills and some spare money we normally have about 2-3k a month spare. Right now we just paid off debts (we had bad times before the good times) and are looking to look at getting a house around 240,000 in our area for the type we are wanting. \n\nHowever I have worked out if we save the 3k a month and live a bit on the saving side (less takeouts and holidays) then we can have 240k in only 6.6 years and we would be 31 and 33 without having to have a mortgage meaning we would have 3-4k a month free.\n\nWe already aren’t the type to drink or party. We are mainly a gaming couple and our holidays are Disneyland Paris which is only about2-3k to do (yes one of those Disney couples we don’t regret anything) so we don’t do much anyway in terms of high spending. \n\nSo is it best to just get a mortgage or save for 6-7 years and live the rest of our lives debt free and owning our house completely. \n\n\n(Edit even though it says uk at top)\n\nMy wage is £50,000 so please stop comparing to us and saying I’m doomed or etc. In us wages my wage would convert to £80,000 - 90,000 depending WHICH btw would get a 1,290sq 3 bed in California so your economy isn’t as collapsed as a lot of you are commenting. \n\nAlso due to actually helpful comments I’m considering/going to look for a mortgage without early payment penalty’s and just pay extra towards it so I have a nest egg.",

I'm a full time student but also have a pretty decent paying job (great savings/investments building up) with a lot of upward mobility. I'd also probably be able to work remotely 6-8 months from now with the go-ahead from my boss. Why do I want to move out? I hate where I live and how boring life is.\n\nI'm someone who really enjoys busier areas and seeing new people every day. I currently live in the suburbs and it sucks the life out of me because all I do is go to school (community college), work, and come home to do it all again M-F. I don't enjoy school and mostly am using it as a means to open more doors for me in the future.\n\nA close friend of mine (at a nearby-ish university) asked if I wanted to move in with him next fall because his roommate's moving out in the spring. This is also a location I love and have been to many times, so I'm familiar with the area and this apartment.\n\nI'm torn because this could be a great experience to find my footing in the real world and be uncomfortable without my family, but could also be putting my (short-term) financial future in jeopardy if I don't have all my ducks in a row.\n\nAm I being naive and irresponsible? Would moving out of my current situation for a year or so be that bad in the long run? I'd love to hear your thoughts. Thank you.",

      "text": "My maternity leave is soon coming to an end. My baby is starting daycare in a couple of weeks--it is literally $2000 a month, which is insane to me! My husband and I are already struggling with 2 mortgages ($3700/mo total). We met online and lived in different states. My husband moved in with me almost 2 years ago, and we are still dealing with his (now) out-of-state mortgage. It's been extremely frustrating, with him taking PTO weeks at a time to finalize moving out, and I am hoping that he will finally wrap it up by the end of next week so we can either sell or rent.\n\nI guess my issue is, I'm mired in $84,000 of student loan debt. I have been making steady payments since 2017. I have barely made a dent because I graduated in 2011 and the jobs I could get right out of college were unfortunately very low-paying. I got a STEM degree, and despite everyone touting that there's a shortage of scientists, engineers and doctors, 60% of those who graduate with a STEM degree in the States don't even go on to utilize it. There is a definite oversaturation in my field, where starting salary was just $33,000/year (salary, so you're expected to work overtime without compensation). Meanwhile, universities and government hired overseas workers by the hordes who were paid even less. And I was in debt $80000 by the time I graduated.\n\nAnyway, I couldn't contribute much to paying down my loans at the end of the day without going homeless or starving. I've worked very hard to pull myself out of the trenches of being broke and homeless. There were numerous times where I worked for free just because no one would hire me (too many qualified candidates, I was told, and I wasn't the best), and I needed to build my resume. I only started being \"okay\" in 2022. Now, about $1000/mo goes into student loans, and yes I am on a payment plan.\n\nMy husband and I both bring home $8400/mo. We spend about $2000/mo on household items and groceries for a family. I have about $2000 in interest-free debt that I make monthly payments on, and we are almost done paying off our one car (there is $5000 left). I refuse to pay for two cars because it is just too expensive.\n\nI feel like I barely have enough at the end of the day to put more into my student loan debt.\n\nWhat can I do to make more money so I can just get rid of my student loans? I feel like I've been struggling, and struggling just to figure out how to even put a roof over my head in these economies. Now, I can finally tackle my student loans, but I'm a mom now and don't want to sacrifice time away from my son. So I feel like I can't just get a \"second job,\" because when I come home, I only have a few precious hours to cook dinner, help out with chores, spend time with my child. I don't want to give up any of that. Any ideas?",

At my previous job i always carried great insurance with supplemental coverages such as aflac due to the fact that im an active guy and i ride motorcycles. it goes without being said i no longer have any of that coverage since i left the previous company. \n\nwhere im finding myself in my state atleast is an odd spot in regard to filing for a short term assistance offered by the state. i dont seem to quite fall into the requirements for unemployment OR temporary total disability which are the two programs my state offers for something like this (to my knowledge). Unemployment requires the ability to work and seek employment. TTD (which im still not 100% clear on) seems to maybe only be available for on the job injury? or am i mistaken in my interpretation of the states requirements? \n\nThank you for the help, sorry for the poor format im new to reddit!",

      "text": "I’m 22 years old and Chase just closed all 4 of my credit cards, my personal checking account (which had about $5,000), and my business account (which had around $75,000). I called in and asked to speak with a supervisor, and was told the reason was “unusual activity.” The only thing I did recently was pay off about $20K in credit card debt.\n\nI’ve never missed a payment, and I was just trying to clean up my finances. I wasn’t given any specific details beyond being “flagged,” and now I’m extremely worried about the impact this will have on my credit score — especially losing 4 accounts at my age.\n\nIs there any way to get Chase to reconsider or reopen the accounts? Has anyone dealt with something like this before? Should I escalate this or file a complaint somewhere?\n\nAny advice would be appreciated.\n\nA lot of people are saying that I should open new checking accounts with another bank. What other bank would you guys recommend where I won’t have to face something like this again?\n\nAnother question**\n\nInstead of having Chase issue me a check for my business account balance, can I just withdraw the full amount in cash? That way, when I open a new bank account, I can deposit the cash directly and avoid waiting 7–10 business days for a check to clear. \n\nI run a business, and managing cash flow is critical — my vendors give me 21-day terms, and if I don’t pay on time, they stop selling to me. That’s why I’d rather withdraw the full amount in cash instead of waiting 7–10 business days for a check to clear. But yeah, clearly trying to access my own money to keep my business running must mean I’m up to something shady lol.\n\nUPDATE**\nLooks like they closed all 4 of my credit cards and my personal checking but decided to leave my business account open. Literally just made an appointment with a banker at US Bank and a local credit union to open accounts.",

Thank you for everyone who helped. I should’ve confirmed the number before I posted this. Apparently that $800 came from my father in law \n\nMy father in law is 73, has glioblastoma (diagnosed oct 2024) and we just found out that he has not been being honest about finances nor has he been being paid for over a year at his job. The business was in trouble and he was making half salary for 2 years and apparently now zero salary this past year (with the promise that he will get this money back after a deal closed). Now he is unable to work and his employer is saying he can’t pay him what he is owed. \n\nMy mother in law spends a lot (in her defense she didn’t know the financial situation was dire) and I assume my father in law wanted to keep her happy and let her buy whatever she wants, thinking he will get this deal closed and be back to having money.  His boss owes him approx 700k. Since this plan has all gone to shit, he has been draining their retirement and any other money they had without anyone knowing. So now, he is incapacitated and they are f’d. \n\nTheir house is probably worth about 700k. I believe they have ~250k to be paid off on the mortgage (have refinanced and probably took home equity loan at some pt) My question is basically, what order do we pay bills. I would think definitely sell the house, but the mortgage is about $800 and rent would be 4 times that. I should also mention they have their adult son living with them who contributes nothing and has bad credit and his own debt, but they won’t just let him be homeless. \n\nSo, sorry to ramble I’m just trying to figure this out. If you don’t pay your mortgage, how fast do they take the house from you? If you don’t pay your electric suddenly, how fast do they turn it off? What can we get away with not paying for a little while until we get things under control? He has life insurance but we have to find out if it’s term or whole. \n\nMy mother in law has a lot of jewelry, handbags, fancy china. Would an estate sale be beneficial? \n\nThank you for anyone who can help. Sorry to be all over the place. This hit us like a hurricane",

The business's LLC is in the States, although they do not live in the States nor are they from there. I am from the States.\n\nWe are a young couple, have been married for nearly 5 years and together for 10. This business started about 6 years ago, prior to us being married. The business has been fairly successful, I would say. They pay themselves a salary each month on top of having a few employees. The rest of the money goes to a fund that currently isn't being touched nor is invested in any place.\n\nRecently they have been talking about investing that money - either something in their home country like a plot or in an office space for some of the employees that work in their home country. The other options is to split that money in two and have it go to each of them down the middle and each decide how to use the money that the business is making.\n\nI am a bit confused as to what role I may (or may not) have in this. I am the spouse of one of the co-founders. Do I have any say in how the money is invested or not? I want to also preface this that I am in no way worried or anxious about my spouse's spending habits nor do we have issues around money, I am just sincerely curious as to how I play into this, if I do at all. We currently do not have any kids, we rent, and we do not have any big expenditures in our name, but eventually we may have those things. What is my role in this as the spouse, if any?",

My business and time feel maxed out, and my wife feels like she can’t get a job anywhere. Her low job confidence makes it self-fulfilling and makes it harder for her to get jobs despite having a masters degree. On top of this, I feel like I’m not succeeding in helping her. How do we crawl out of this? How do we get her a job or some other support for this? I’m sorry for venting on this subreddit. I’m just seriously desperate for some good life advice and seasoned life mentorship.\n\nTLDR, buying a house, having kids, and saving for retirement feels financially impossible.\n\nEdit: Thank you to those of you that commented that were actually helpful and kind. There are a lot of people here that want to judge my relationship, which I didn’t ask for. I think instead of buying a house right out of our lease, we’re going to go live with her parents for a few months to save some money. In the meantime, I know she will get a job and things will work out. We’ll get the house, the kids, the retirement. It’ll just be a bit longe rid a wait than we wanted. Again, thank you to the non-judgmental comments. I truly appreciate you showing me that we shouldn’t get all freaked out focusing on the zoomed out picture.",

      "text": "For reference I have an office job with a W-2 and made about $80k a year (gross) and my husband is self-employed and made about $60,000 (gross) and receives a 1099-K. We made $6,000 in estimated tax payments (on top of my tax withheld) for 2024, have a child and bought a home in 2024 that we also use as a home office.\n\nWe usually always file jointly with TurboTax but figured we would try to see if the competitors were any better this year. Took a few hours but was worth it. For some reason TurboTax does not calculate as much of an expense for my husbands vehicle and home office as the other competitors which are the reasons for the refund differences (although we used exactly the same information for all). I think it could be the way TurboTax calculates what percent of the home/vehicle is being used for the business.\n\nAll that being said we will be filing with TaxFreeUSA this year. \n\nTurboTax\nFederal Refund: $698\nState Refund: $52\nFederal Cost to File: $89\nState Cost to File: $39\nNet Total: $622\n\nTaxAct \nFederal Refund: $778\nState Refund: $394\nFederal Cost to File: $69.99\nState Cost to File: $39.99\nNet Total: $1,062.02\n\nH&R Block\nFederal Refund: $778\nState Refund: $394\nFederal Cost to File: $85\nState Cost to File: $37\nNet Total: $1,050\n\nTaxFreeUSA\nFederal Refund: $782\nState Refund: $414\nFederal Cost to File: $0\nState Cost to File: $14.99\nNet Total: $1,181.01\n\nEDIT: So I think I’ve figured out why I’m seeing some differences. It looks like for our home office that we are deducting from my husband’s income, TurboTax isn’t including our mortgage insurance premiums in the summation of expenses for the home office, while the other three are. Is that supposed to be included or not? Another difference was I forgot to add in the car taxes and interest for his car’s deduction. This gets us at exactly the same numbers as the other three which I’ve also gone through and updated.\n\nI also went through with a fine tooth comb and was able to get all 4 websites to tie (if I force added the mortgage insurance to TurboTax. I can remove this from FreeTaxUSA before I file if it shouldn’t be included). Thank you to all who recommended that I review everything. I learned a lot and ended up discovering more cases where I was eligible to deduct more from my husband’s income so I could pay even less in taxes! (HOA fees, pest control, etc for our house since it benefited the home office as well!) \n\nI hope I helped at least one other person and a good lesson to me to be more careful especially when pregnant and overtired! Thank you!",

      "text": "I (23m) Doesn't know what to focus on. I recently bought my first car (a hoopty) for $15,000. A 1999 CK1 Lancer. After 2-3 weeks, I threw transmission fluid in the engine and now it doesn't start. It has been parked for the past month.(July 7th to Present). Around the same time, I lost basically all of my money on a failed event. I had to get an advance on my salary, $5,500 in order to pay off bills. However, That same month(July), My business, (T-Shirt Printing & Signage) made the most I ever made in a month ($15k sales) compared to the previous high of $7k. Also, My other side business of renting foam machines, I got one rented last month and the machine stopped working yesterday. I also, has a balance of $2,500, that I owe boss that i'm paying off monthly. He gave me a raise around the same time I borrowed some money from him, so instead of me paying it back, he kept my salary the same until it's paid off. So when It's paid off, my salary will increase to $6,500 montly. Based on how i'm paying now. It would be paid on. December 31st. The $15k sales i made, the majority of the profit made, i used to pay off my bills. All my bills are paid now. So i only got around $3k left. And the vehicle costs around $6k to have running again, but the mechanic is telling me that the vehicle needs alot of repair to run smoothly again and it's a waste because the parts are more expensive than most cars but the resale value is not good. He offered to buy the car as is, so that he would sell it for parts. He is offering $5k. I can verify what he said about the vehicle is true. As it is right now, I really am attached to the car because it's my first. It's really hard for me to let go.\n\nShould I:  \nA - Prioritize my business, and sell the vehicle, and buy a printer, to increase my profit margins. Also, buy a new machine for my foam party rental business.\n\nB - Hold on to the vehicle, and fix it. It does help keep the cost down when renting the foam machine. I pay $500 for transportation for it. Also, I was able to do delivery for my business which was a little extra income. The convenience was amazing aswell.\n\nC - Priotitze paying off my Boss so that my salary can increase?\n\nD - A mixture of Two or Three of the Above\n\nE - Something else that i'm missing.\n\nPS: The event in question where I lost the money is a party I hosted. This is my passion. But as you can see it costs. Would definetly be looking forward to hosting another in the future.",

      "text": "Need help with understanding elder care financial advice. Can a nursing home take all of my mothers social security and pension check leaving her $35.00 and without any means to pay her bills? My mother went in hospital and was in there for a month and half. She's 80 and sitting in a bed for that time made her muscles weak. They sent her to a skilled nursing facility about 3 weeks ago. Now we were told to recover to plan on 5 months or so by the nurse in hospital. But we got notified and appealed the insurance decision that they sited they weren't going to pay anymore because she was well enough to go home and didn't need skilled nursing anymore.  Note she is not well yet, she needs assistance getting in and out of bed, she's incontinent, and still very weak. So we were told the facility that has her once the appeal ends they will move her out to an old folks home and that they will take her social security and pension check and that she will be left with $35.00 for expenses and that Medicare will pick up the rest. But she has bills and plans to go home and this doesn't account for her having debts. Can they take all her money leaving her without the ability to pay her bills? We were originally told that her Medi. Medi. Insurance coverage would cover everything what one insurance didn't pay for the other would. Now they want her money and we're left scrambling trying to figure out how to pay her debts acquired prior to going into the hospital. She doesn't have any assets or anything literally living paycheck to paycheck and now we're just trying to figure out how to pay her credit card, and bills to keep her residence open for her to be able to come home to. How does this happen and how do I navigate this. Most important how do I help her?",

I drive on average 1300-1500 miles a month and around 18,000 a year and I drive my own 2017 Honda civic that just hit $100,000 miles. (I bought it in 2020 as a old lease with minimal miles) The car is still in great shape and it’s paid off (so the mileage money I accrue is basically profit minus the gas and insurance / wear and tear). \n \nMight I add I don’t really want an astronomical car payment. My civic was about $280 but I was paying $400 to get it paid off sooner. \n\nIt is not a comfortable vehicle to drive though everyday and I’m debating if it’s time / worth it to sell / trade it in for an suv where I have more room etc. But the thought of having another car payment sounds terrible. \n\nDo dealerships have business use leases or anything? Seems like I’ll constantly be trading and buying something newer every couple of years at this rate. \n\nJust looking for advice or personal experiences to help me with a decision.",

      "text": "Hi everyone,\n\nI’m currently a senior in college preparing for graduation, and I recently accepted a position with Primerica as a Financial Coach. Initially, I was excited about the opportunity. It was presented as a way to help people improve their financial literacy while gaining valuable experience in the finance industry.\n\nHowever, after doing more research, I’ve found a lot of mixed reviews about the company, particularly concerns that it operates like a pyramid scheme. Many sources suggest that Primerica’s business model relies heavily on recruiting new agents rather than focusing solely on selling financial products. Some claim that most of the income comes from building a team and earning overrides on their sales, instead of direct client work.\n\nI’ve only been to the office once, and everyone I met seemed genuine and welcoming. The environment was positive, and I heard several personal success stories from representatives who have been with the company for a while. From what I observed, there does seem to be potential for growth, especially for individuals who are self-driven and comfortable in sales and leadership roles.\n\nThat said, I’m feeling unsure. I value my time and want to make sure I’m investing it into something ethical, sustainable, and aligned with my long-term career goals. I’m concerned about the commission-only structure, the lack of benefits, and the pressure to recruit within my personal network. While this isn’t my only job at the moment, I am looking for something stable that I can grow with after graduation, and I’m not sure if this is the right fit. I’m still open to giving it a shot to gain firsthand experience, but I want to go in with realistic expectations.\n\nI’m reaching out to ask: has anyone here worked with Primerica or had direct experience with the company? Is it something worth pursuing as a new graduate, or should I be cautious? I also have a meeting with my Regional VP tomorrow and would appreciate any suggestions for questions I should ask to better understand whether this opportunity is truly right for me.\n\nEdit: I can’t respond to all of the comments that were made under this thread but I just want to say thank you for reading my post and I genuinely do appreciate all the feedback!",

I have 375k in student loan debt and currently am a little more than halfway to PSLF having paid very little thanks to COVID. I should be close to 6 years in but have not had payments count for several months as I've been in a SAVE forbearance and despite attempts to get off of in Oct and Jan am still sitting in SAVE. I will likely try again to get on PAYE in the coming weeks but am hoping that a final ruling on SAVE will occur before that.\n* I am employed in a PSLF eligible outpatient job making around 145k, I also run a part-time private practice (sole proprietorship) that is on pace to gross a little over 100k with pretty low overhead. I also do occasional moonlighting at a hospital that will probably gross 40-50k. I have maxed the 401k through my employer. I have been making estimated quarterly payments for the business income and just met with an accountant today to make sure I am handling taxes correctly.\n* I filed for a tax extension for 2024 to help reduce loan payments once I am on an IBR plan again.\n* I got married in February. My wife just started her attending job and will make about 500k. She is also pursuing PSLF so, without having formally run the numbers, I assume we are best of filing taxes separately.\n* I have contributed to a Roth IRA since residency but only found out a couple weeks ago that now that I am married and will file separately will be over the limit and face penalties. I will need to figure out how to fix this.\n\nThe accountant I met today was helpful but I think a little out of her depth with some of these needs, particularly with retirement/business structure. She mentioned S-Corp being something I should consider, though from what I recall reading on WCI I'm not sure if it makes sense at this stage or not. I also was thinking maybe I should do a solo 401k to try to lower AGI. I also need to figure out what to do with the Roth (backdoor Roth)?\n\nI know general consensus here is usually to figure this stuff out on our own but right now I am not confident that I can pull all these moves off simultaneously and correctly. Any advice is appreciated, including recommendations for professionals who might be able to set things up correctly. Thanks for reading this far.",

      "text": "A few years ago, my stepdad and his new CFO, a new guy from a different state, both asked me to help them by becoming involved “on paper” for a new business to help the family, which they could build and make purchases for the business.\n\nAt the time, I was recovering from major leg surgery and on heavy medication. So I was staying with my parents while I recovered. I trusted them, so I agreed.\n\nHere’s how I got tied in - all to help the family: \n•\tThey listed me as an owner on the business paperwork \n•\tThey added my name to the business license \n•\tThey had me open a business credit card under my name\n\nI never worked there, never got paid, and had zero control over how money was used.\n\nLater on, they gave multiple people access to the card. The CFO started using it for non-business expenses like pet insurance, restaurant bills, movies, and personal spending.\n\nHe also told me taxes were “handled,” but months after I went back to my home state to continue healing, I started getting letters from the IRS and state tax office saying nothing had been paid.\n\nWhen I brought it up, he admitted that instead of paying the taxes, he used the money to improve the store, give raises, and try to keep the business afloat.\n\nI later did a background check and found out the CFO has a criminal record for grand theft in another state. I told my stepdad back then, but nothing changed, probably because the CFO was living in their basement, supposedly “helping with the business,” even though he lived in another state.\n\nEventually, the business shut down. Both he and my stepdad promised they’d take care of the debt.\n\nFast forward to now: \n•\tThe CFO is MIA \n•\tMy stepdad says he “can’t afford to help” \n•\tAnd I’m stuck with everything\n\nI’ve just given birth, finally recovered from three leg surgeries, and am in school, but now I’m being chased down for: \n•\t$30,000 in IRS debt \n•\t$24,000 in credit card debt (in my name) \n•\tAlmost $10,000 in state tax debt\n\nI feel completely overwhelmed. I never benefited from this past business, and I was taken advantage of when I was physically and mentally vulnerable.\n\nMy husband is supportive, he just finished school, and I’m still trying to finish my degree too. We were hoping to save for a house and eventually start a real business that I own. Now I feel like all of that is crumbling.\n\nCan I protect myself legally or financially, it’s been years passed while I thought things were getting fixed. Every time I asked they said they were working on it, and now the former CFO is MIA. Can any of this be disputed or discharged?\n\nAny advice, personal experience, or direction would mean the world. I feel like my stepdad failed me, I wish my dad were still around, he passed from Alzheimer’s before all of this. It has been a really emotional day since finding out this updated debt news. Thank you for taking time to read this.",

      "title": "My (37) Parents came clean about financial disaster and I don’t know where to start",
      "text": "I’m looking for directional advice on where to look to start tackling the financial disaster that my parents have created. If anyone has thoughts on avenues to help address this situation and considerations that I need to account for, that would be enormously helpful. I live in IL and my folks live in NJ\n\nHistory: If you don’t want additional context you can skip to The Situation.\n\nMe: I’m 37 (M) married with a five month old. I’ve been in sales engineering for 12 years and have built myself a decent nest egg. Ever since I saw my parents weather the financial crisis, I’ve realized how important it is to be economically stable. Recently, my parents, who are otherwise wonderful people, came to me asking for help organizing their finances and what I saw horrified me.\n\nParents: My dad (72) is a self made entrepreneur and my mom (71) was a preschool teacher. I grew up in a loving, upper middle class household. My dad owns a small business in market research for 30 years that was very successful. He managed to make it through the .com bubble and the financial crisis relatively unscathed. While there were scary times, he was always able to pull it out. \n\nCovid was a different monster. His company hung by a thread, but my dad always knew he was going to make it through. His hubris got the best of him and he started lending the company money to keep it afloat. He put everything into it and I mean everything. I knew it was bad when he asked me for money a couple of years ago. I understood the risks and loaned them the money. He asked again a year later and I gave them a small infusion to hold them over.\n\nThey came to visit me after the birth of my daughter five months ago. I could tell that they were distracted when, what should’ve been a happy occasion, felt somber. They told me that they were falling behind on their bills, so I started to ask questions. I knew things were tough at the business, but I didn’t know how bad things were, and frustratingly, neither did they. They told me that their credit card payments were getting too high, which I foolishly thought that they had some big purchases, but when I questioned them further the money was for minimum payments on their credit card. I essentially told them that I would help them out if they gave me the full picture as long as the money goes to them and not interest payments.\n\nThe Situation:\nFlash forward to last week. They finally come clean with their financials and it was way worse than I thought. My dad borrowed from their entire nest egg to keep his business afloat. Not only did he borrow from his 401K and his IRA’s, but it went so much deeper. He borrowed millions from his and my mom’s retirement. They finally opened up their books up to me and I was shocked\n\nDebts\nCredit card debts: adds up to $92K across seven different cards. Some of these cards my dad is the main card holder and some are in my mom’s name. Their total minimum payments come to ~$3,300/month and the interest rates vary from 14% to 33%\nCar Debt: They leased a car in my dad’s name from GM Financial with $532 payments and a buyout  price of $38,530 \nHouse Debt: They owe ~$90K on their mortgage and took a HELOC with ~$60K left. \nBank Account: $300 overdrawn\n\nMonthly Expenses\nVariable Expenses: ~$3100/month across groceries, internet, car, etc\nInsurance: $2600/month this includes\n* Life insurance ($1.5M): $1,200\n* Long Term Care: $800\n* Medicare Supplement: $300\n* Various other policies: $300\nMortgage+Taxes: $3,230/month at a 4.25% rate\n* Because all of this happened as a result of COVID, they qualified for a 12 month reprieve on housing expenses. The stipulation is that they don’t sell the house or refinance for three years.\n\nAsset:\nHouse: would say that this is their best asset and could conservatively sell for $600K. They live in a development with three home layouts and one with their layout sold for $850K in the last month. Their unit is much less updated and needs a little work to get it ready.\nSocial Security: $5,150/month\n\nCash Flow:\nCurrent total expenses: ~$12,400/month\nTotal Income: $5,150 + some teaching jobs they’ve picked up\nNet: -$7,250\n\nToday: \nThere are obviously some emotional and behavioral factors that need to be addressed  in the situation. I’m not looking for feedback on whether or not I should help - I first want to stabilize the situation and set them up for longer term sustainability.\n\nInitially, I was going to pay off their credit cards and buy out the rest of their mortgage then they would transfer the deed to me. This would allow them to live in the house for essentially free (paying taxes and HOI), but as I dug more into the situation, I’m realizing that this is a bit above my pay grade. My sense is to go to a bankruptcy lawyer to help unwind this mess. I’m not sure if there are other avenues that we need to explore.\n\nThank you so much for thoughts\n\nTL;DR my parents have borrowed themselves into a corner and I’m looking for the best next steps to take.",

(I want to believe he's afraid this is a scam and that he's not trying to pocket my money, considering he owns a legitimate business in town.)\n\nSo I called Chase and spoke to someone in the claims department who is filing a dispute that the money was sent in error. They told me that the process is basically Chase will reach out to TD Bank who will then reach out to the person to get the money back and that's where we are at this point.\n\nI'm losing sleep over this situation as the money is basically my entire savings. Does anyone have any advice or maybe can share a similar story where they got their money back? I dont know what to do at this point, I'm afraid to reach out further and appeal to the person in case they think I'm trying to scam them. I really don't know what to do at this point and everything seems like its in limbo.",

I dont want it .  Nor did ask for it .  They had to be aware of the charge back why else DEL my account from their website ?  My credit card company does not see a new charge for this .  I m guessing they pulling we shipped it out and here the proof it was shipped via fed ex  that way they win the charge back.   \n\nSo what do I do so I dont end up with the cops saying meet buba your new cell mate ?   Do I have to return an unasked for item from an order I cancel.    if the company was in Canada I say screw it because I know what the law is  but in the USA you can end in jail for tolls and 10 year old parking tickets in some places.

      "text": "I am a 28M and currently I am working a 9-5 job in Europe, but after meeting my Filipina wife we started running a piggery business together in the Philippines. We started small with 1-3 animals and long story short we built a small pig house with around 15K USD and we are operating with 60 animals for fattening and 7 mother pigs.\n\nI will get into the finances of our business so you can get a better picture.\n\nThe business is projected to generate within a year around 15K USD profit with our current budget, we are also pretty much reinvesting everything back to it! Our current financial situation is like this:\n\nWe built the pig house but currently around 1-2K USD more is needed for some extra details and labor.\n\nWe buy a single piglet for around 90\\~ USD and feeds and operation cost(transportation/electricity etc) is around 170\\~ more so on average around 260 per animal. If the piglet is born with a mother pig, then we share 1/3rd of them with a caretaker and the but the initial buying cost is only for maintaining the mothers, I would say this varies depending on the birth, if its 6 or below its kind of of a loss and if its 7+ its a extra profit!\n\nOur sales will produce around 75 USD per piglet on average which we share 10% with our caretaker + we give him as part of our operational expense around $150 USD per month too. I would say our operational expense brings the total profit on average to around 60-65USD per piglet, which if you divide that with their total cost of $260 it is around 23-25% profit per quarter.\n\nThis full cycle of sales is 4 months on average when we buy a piglet and around 5-5.5 when its our own.\n\nWe took a small loan for 13% annual rate but its only for 8 months and we don't need to pay monthly but lump sum it all for around 5K USD. I also had a friend who loaned me another 4K USD with a 15% return since we kind of desperately needed some cash for liquidity a couple of months ago.\n\nWe also have an agreement with a feeds store that we can \"finance\" some feeds for around 1 month, so whenever we struggled with liquidity especially on the last months before a sale, we just got the feeds and paid them back in cash on the day of sale.\n\nSince we operate with lower liquidity than we can basically afford, each time a sale comes we pay back the store, buy new piglets, operate for a while in cash and once its close to run out, we finance again until the next sale, this way we always have something running and recycle.\n\nMother's pigs cost so far around around 5K USD (but we are expecting many births starting this July).\n\nFor the last year i sent big chunks of my income as part of this investment and my wife as an accountant, keeps the books and runs basically the operations by managing the people involved, we can do that online too.\n\nI want to grow this as fast as possible since our pig house can handle a few more pigs and we also have an agreement with some villagers that we can finance their piglets, and share profits 50/50 if we use their space, this will bring the profits lower but it still pretty good. (if the pig house is full).\n\nThe main risk part of this business is ASF as it can wipe out all your farm if the virus comes but our village is one of the most isolated in the mountains of Philippines (around 30 minutes from the closest big town)\n\nI have around 7-8K USD in crypto right now in a platform! I am thinking if its a good idea to slowly exchange them for cash and put them inside the business.\n\nCurrently we never take any profit back we simply reinvest all back with the hopes to aggressively scale it giving the margins we operate.\n\nI was thinking of finding investors but my wife is scared of scammers and she doesn't trust strangers\n\nQuestions if you made it so far in this post!\n\nWould you sell your crypto on a good day and just try to send it to the business to scale it further?\n\nOn what year would you start withdrawing profits back?\n\nWe have some other business ideas we want to try as well, such as building a chicken egg farm (small scale) but not sure when it would be a good time to start that project. Since if we diverse our investments it would likely be more \"safe\" in case of a worst case scenario.\n\nAny thoughts or recommendations on how you would operate this is welcomed! Feel free to ask questions.",

      "text": "My wife and I recently got married and are moving into her townhome (larger, has a garage, more valuable, lower HOA). \n\nI purchased my current 2/2 condo for $203K in June 2018, and I refinanced twice to its current rate of 2.875% through 2051. My monthly PITI is $1,077 and my HOA is $623/mo. My HOA includes ultra speed internet, cable with HBO/Cinemax, water, trash, exterior maintenance, and a new pool/gym, so while the sticker shock is high, it does include a fair amount. The dues increased $115/mo this year due to master insurance policy costs after the neighborhood was dropped from our master policy due to too many water claims, but we have worked hard to improve attributes of the community to hopefully re-enter the primary insurance market in 2026. I have taken care of my condo and have replaced all the windows, had it professionally painted, installed a whole home surge protector, installed a new air handler/evaporator assembly and water heater, and installed all new light fixtures. \n\nI have it currently listed for $315K, which is in the middle of the comp range for recent sales in my community year to date. I am the only unit for sale. However, I have had *zero* showings and am on my second price reduction after initially going onto the MLS at the end of May. The sale proceeds on this property would be roughly $160K, and I would likely put this in a CD of some kind in the 4-5% range. My wife and I plan to wait out buying a forever home for a little while in this rate and pricing environment and also because her townhome is sitting at 2.75% which obviously is a gold mine. This is why we prefer to hold on to the proceeds of my condo for now. \n\nMy property’s lack of foot traffic has surprised my agent and while I hear that condos are slow across the board, it has gotten me thinking about renting. I estimate I could get about $2,250 +/- $150 for the unit per month, representing rental cash flow of $400-700/mo. To me this sounds like an attractive cash flow (with some devoted to a reserve fund along the way), but I recognize that being a landlord does sometimes come with its own challenges. I am somewhat handy, but I feel like aside from an appliance failing, my condo is relatively up to date from the work I mentioned above. I also know life has a funny way of jacking up your plans. \n\nI did some rough math and it looks something like this for a 12-month period: \n\nRental income $2,250/mo @ 12 mo: $27,000\n- Mortgage interest: $4,000\n- HOA: $7,476\n- Property taxes: $2,925\n- Depreciation: $6,200\n- Other expenses: $1,000\n= Net rental income: $5,400\n\nMy estimated rental income is similar to the annual proceeds I would get off of my condo sale earnings in a CD at 4%, but it does not account for the $3,600 in equity I would accrue annually by having the unit occupied. \n\nJust looking for some thoughts on this. Happy Friday to all!",

If I don’t become a limited company, should I be transferring this money to my personal account to make use of a 4% saver ISA.\n\nSo the question is - is the money already paid into the account subject to tax, or does this only happen when paid into my person account? I presume the former, but wanted some perspective!\n\nThanks in advance.",

So even you paid the full statement balance by the end of the due date, you still going to be charged a finance fee because whoever made the system decided to screw you over.\n\nIs this some kind of computer error? why would the system post a finance charge to my account if I paid the statement balance in full?",

Around 2013 she/they declared bankruptcy while also going through a messy divorce. One result of the process was that their business was dissolved and the assets sold to pay debts. Somehow this card slipped through the cracks and remained active. It was used since then and has been kept current. It was honestly something she had to rely on at the time as her source of income was no longer viable.\n\nSome context: Now, over a decade later, the balance is still hanging over her and she doesn't make enough to pay it off in a reasonable amount of time. She makes something like $16-$17/hr if I recall correctly. She is currently living with me as she has done since I purchased my home around 2014. During that time the agreement was that she would help with chores and things as well as do the grocery shopping and I would pay for all the rest of the household bills with no expectation of rent. I pay for all utilities and services. She pays for her own vehicle.\n\nAs for the advice I'm seeking. What resources potentially exist for handling that credit card aside from getting it paid off? I understand that it is sometimes possible to negotiate lower payments. And she is vehemently opposed to declaring bankruptcy again. Still, I am planning on getting married soon and the house is feeling a bit crowded, but I fear she will never be able to live on her own if that card isn't handled.\n\nThank you in advance. I will do my best to pay close attention to the post in case there is more information I need to provide.",

Most of my portfolio is in ETFs and stocks, and I also hold a little bit of Bitcoin.\n\nI run my own business (it’s under my mom’s name because of my age), and each year I have to pay taxes on the profit I make. Right now, I just put part of that money aside in a savings account to cover taxes later. It earns like 1–2% a year, which isn’t much.\n\nLately I’ve been wondering: instead of just letting that money sit there doing almost nothing, should I invest it too? I won’t need it until next year anyway.\n\nOnly thing is, I’m not sure *how* to invest it. Should I just throw it into the S&P 500 like I do with the rest of my portfolio? Or should I take a different approach since it’s money I can’t really afford to lose?\n\nWould appreciate any advice. Thanks!",

We now have a loan for both cars and some exterior home improvements that were necessary for structural integrity. \n\nWell, I want to start a business and my husband suggested us selling the house and moving to an apartment/rental for the next 2 years to see if it would take off. Basically, after the sale, paying off debt and realtor Fees, we would have ~$120K. We would take $50K for my business and start small before scaling up. The other $70k put aside for the next few years until we find a new home in a money mutual account.\n\nDoes this sound like a good plan? I think I'm questioning it a bit, because to me if we liened against the home for the equity, it seems like it's not different to me than if we sold. I think my husband and I are differing on how we view the asset of our home. With my husband's plan of selling we would just be free of all the debt, rather than praying the business take off and we pay down our debts.",

I have an independent financial advisor who uses a well-known brokerage (think something like Fidelity, Charles Schwab). I asked him to sell $4000 worth of stock and he instead sold 4-5x that worth of stock. When I pointed out the error a few hours later and asked if he could fix it, he then bought the difference back at $3 more per share. I also now think I'm on the hook for $16K in capital gains. When I asked if he carries insurance, he immediately dropped me as a client and said that he doesn't usually allow clients to participate in investments and trading and regrets making an exception in my case.  \nPeople make mistakes all the time and I totally get that. But it's hard to let it go when it's going to cost me thousands of dollars. Is there anything the brokerage can do as this is an independent advisor?  \n  \nUPDATE: Several people have asked for an update. After the FA saw \\*this post\\* and all the responses, I was immediately contacted and accused of trying to ruin his business.  However, seeing this post also resulted in him submitting trade errors for both the original trade and the even more egregious second trade. Both trades were reversed and I remained fired as a client. I was also told by folks here that he had posted to XYPN to ask that community how to deal with his \"needy client's\" requests. I'm very grateful to the education I received from the members here as you all ultimately solved the problem just by commenting.",

I found out after AMEX contacted me - I reached back out to AMEX on a confirmed telephone number (I am an existing customer) and they confirmed that someone had applied, so they would mark it as fraud and close the application.\n\nI tried to report this to Barclays but everyone I talked to seemed confused on what do about this information - all they could do was confirm I had no other applications open.  I feel that this kind of coincidence is very unlikely - there must be some bad actor in their system, but not sure what else to do.\n\nI'm concerned that normally business lines of credit do not reflect on your personal credit report.  What can I do to see if there have been other business cards/accounts opened up under my name?  Do I just have to call each bank individually?\n\nAMEX didn't ask me to file a police report, nor say they would be doing anything other than closing the application.",

He only pays me $13 an hour and he suddenly says he cannot afford to pay me my 40 hours so he needs to cut it to 20 hours starting on Monday. (Note he told me this on Tuesday). \n\nHe also likes to victimize himself saying that he has nothing saved up and he needs to uber in order to pay my wage. It is not my problem he didn’t have a financial plan before launching a company. \n\nI’ve already been here for a month and a half, and I sometimes feel regretful believing in him. Any advice on what I should do? \n\nSince he said he would pay me weekly, I organized my payments around this, now I am behind. \n\nI have sent him messages and he ignores me. He comes to the office and does the Irish goodbye so he doesn’t have to encounter me to talk.\n\nAlso note that if I leave, he will no longer have any employees. Between the two, I am the only one who speaks English. \n\nEdit: this is my actual first post on here. How can I like your comments? Thank you for all the input on my situation and for validating what I have been thinking\n\nEdit2: wow, he just paid. But still, after reading you (and already had my gut feeling). I am going to leave. Thank all of you again for your comments and kind messages too. Vegas is also home to me!",

      "text": "I've been wrestling with something that's been eating at me lately. I work in tech/product management, and I'm witnessing both my father and father-in-law go through what I can only describe as a slow-motion career crisis. Both are good workers, but they're stuck in this horrible limbo where they hate their jobs but are too scared to make any moves.\nThey're both dealing with this crushing loss of confidence as they age. Neither made it to executive levels - they were always solid middle-management types. But now they're just... existing. They come to work, keep their heads down, and pray they can hang on until retirement. They're terrified of being \"found out\" or pushed out, and they know their skill sets aren't competitive enough to easily land something new at their age.\nHere's what's keeping me up at night: I'm only 31, but I'm terrified of ending up in the same position. I have a finance degree and work in product management, but watching them has made me realize that no field is immune to this. It feels like the only escape routes are:\n\n1. Build something of your own\n\n2. Climb high enough up the corporate ladder that you're \"untouchable\"\n\n3. Accept the same fate\n\nI know I'm probably being paranoid given my age, but I can't shake this fear. I feel like I need to be doing something NOW to prevent this from happening to me in 20 years. But what? Keep learning new skills? Start a side business? Switch careers entirely?\nHas anyone else dealt with this fear or watched their parents go through something similar? What moves can I make now to avoid this trap? Any advice from older tech workers who've successfully navigated this would be especially appreciated.",

      "text": "My wife applied for a Chase Southwest business card about a week after she applied was approved for a Chase Southwest personal card. \n\nWithin 24hrs she was denied for the Chase Southwest Business card. The reason given was “Lack of comparable credit lines on bankcard trades,” which I’m assuming alludes to the lack of long credit cards in her name (she is an authorized user on our Chase Freedom Card for the last 15 years, but nothing else). \n\nI called the recon line and spoke to a very nice and polite woman and submitted a recon for the application. After running through the normal set of questions about the business, she put me on hold, then came back to say it was still denied. This time the reasons given were the amount of the credit limits on the personal and business cards vs. business income and also lack of other cards on the account. \n\nObviously I can call and do another recon for the card over the next couple days, but I want to know if I should change my answers on the interview questions? Like, should I tell them her income for the year in the business is much higher than I did on the initial application? I mentioned our joint incomes for our fulltime jobs (her business is a side business in addition to her actual daytime job), but she said the shared income (which is obviously much much higher than the credit limits of the cards) didn’t play into them making the denial decision. So should I change our answer for her business income to make it much higher? \n\nAnd how much of a difference is okay if I change the answer? Meaning, if on the application it says $3000 income for the year and then in the interview I say her business income is $20,000, is that going to be a red flag or weird to them? Or will they just go off of what I say on the phone?\n\nSecond, this might be a terrible idea, but I could also call Chase and have them lower the credit limit of the personal Southwest card (it’s $20,000 currently for her). I could have them lower it to say $8,000 and still never come close to spending that monthly on that card. We’re really only doing the credit cards for the SUB’s through Southwest…it’s not really about the actual spending. Would that be terrible? I know it can hurt a credit score to lower the credit limit, but if we barely do any spending on the card anyways, does it still matter? We spent $1000 on it this month, and that might honestly be the extent of it! \n\nThanks so much! \n\nCouple notes:\n- we are not guilty of the 5/24 rule, so that’s not the issue\n- she has excellent credit (as do I)\n- she currently is an authorized user on our Chase Freedom card of 15 years, but just that and then her new Southwest personal card we just got approved for.\n- Again, we’re doing this to try and score a Companion Pass through Chase by stacking SUB’s for the personal and business cards. \n\nThanks!!!",

My plan is to use my approximately $180,000 in accessible investment assets to cover living expenses, and I estimate this will last me about a year. I'm looking for advice on how to best manage this and potentially stretch it further.\n\nMy main questions are:\n1. What's the best way to manage/hold these $180,000 in investment assets during this transition period?\n2. I also have another $580,000 in retirement accounts (with 80% in a 401(k) and the rest in traditional IRAs). Is there any way I can access those retirement funds without taking a huge hit, should the need arise, for either living expenses or business startup expenses?\n3. I'm wondering if taking out a personal loan would be a smart move to help cover expenses or provide additional runway while I get my business off the ground. My credit score is excellent (above 800 for all three agencies), which I hope would provide favorable terms.\n\nWhat strategies should I consider for managing my finances during this startup phase?

      "text": "Hi Reddit,\n\nI’m in a tough financial spot and could really use some insight or advice from anyone who has been in a similar situation. Here’s the deal:\n\nBack in March of 2024, I stepped in to help my dad start a trucking business, using my own credit cards to cover many of the purchases and rental expenses. The money went fast—before I even realized it, the expenses had piled up. Unfortunately, the business didn’t work out, and I’ve been left holding the bag for all the debt. My dad hasn’t been able to pay me back, and at this point, it’s clear I’m on my own.\n\nThe debt is entirely on consumer credit cards—specifically Chase and MGM Rewards—with balances that have ballooned beyond what I can reasonably handle. To make matters worse, the interest rates are between 25% and 30%, so the balances are snowballing fast. I’ve been denied debt consolidation and balance transfer offers, even from my local credit union, which I reached out to as a last resort.\n\nI’ve also tried connecting with the NFCC (National Foundation for Credit Counseling) and National Debt Relief, but I haven’t heard back yet. I’m trying to avoid filing for bankruptcy because I know the long-term impact it could have on my credit, but I honestly don’t know what other options I have left.\n\nI feel overwhelmed and nervous every day. I track my budget religiously, but it’s still hard to stay afloat. I know my situation isn’t unique, and I’m hoping someone out there can share their experiences or offer advice. Has anyone else faced a similar mountain of credit card debt and come out on the other side without declaring bankruptcy?\n\nI’d appreciate any insights, resources, or even just a bit of hope at this point. Thanks in advance.",

I anticipate that I have 6-18 months left depending on how effective the current round of chemo goes. I live in Hamilton, Ontario, Canada.

After 10 years reinvestment I want to start paying the kids an annual income of $???. I would also like to possibly provide a lump sum (Perhaps luiquidate 1/10 of assets per child) to be given for personal investment/use (house, marriage, car, etc)\n\n\nCollege tuition has already been taken care of and is not required. \n\nWhat would you do? What would you avoid? What scams will target me? I can tolerate some risk, as I see this as a 25-30 year plan. I don't necessarily want a business that the kids will need to work at/rub; ofc that would be ideal, but I have long ago accepted that kids rarely do anything you want them to.\n\nSome ideas I have are listed below. If they are terrible, please tell me why. If I am missing an opportunity elsewhere, please tell me. As I mentioned, I should have have at least 6 months to get this started and once the paperwork and insurance is completed, I anticipate it taking another 6-18 months until the setup is completed. \n\nPotential Income Targets:\n\n1) Purchase industrial strip plaza(s) to continue renting out space\n\nTarget price $2.5M-$6M\n\nEstimated Mortgage $???\n\nEstimated income $???\n\nPros/Cons\n\nRisk Factors? \n\n\n2) Purchase Commercial strip plaza(s) to continue renting out space\n\nTarget price $2.5M-$6M\n\nEstimated Mortgage $???\n\nEstimated income $???\n\nPros/Cons\n\nRisk Factors? \n\n\n3) Purchase 8-12 unit apartment building to continue renting out space\n\nTarget price $2.5M-$6M\n\nEstimated Mortgage $???\n\nEstimated income $???\n\nPros/Cons\n\n\nRisk Factors? \n4) Purchase 3-4 $800k single family homes to rent main floor and basement apartment areas\n\nTarget price $2.5M-$6M\n\nEstimated Mortgage $???\n\nEstimated income $???\n\nPros/Cons\n\nRisk Factors? \n\n\n5) Purchase 5-7 $400k single family townhouse/rowhouses to rent in\n\nTarget price $2.5M-$6M\n\nEstimated Mortgage $???\n\nEstimated income $???\n\nPros/Cons\n\nRisk Factors?",

      "title": "Father passed away, leaving my mother with 4 month overdue mortgage and nothing to pay it ",
      "text": "**Background:**\n\nMy father passed away a little over a week ago, leaving behind his wife (my mom) and 4 children (including myself, aged 24-31). We all had a feeling that the financial situation was not great, but had no idea just how bad it would be. Until yesterday, we had no access to his computer or passwords (he paid all the bills and would not let my mom get involved).\n\nOnce I gained access, I could not find any evidence of the mortgage being paid after May 17th. I also discovered personal loans and maxed out credit cards totaling over $100k, some of which had my mothers name on them and some that did not, none of which she knew about. Additionally, there was a total of $8k in his retirement accounts that we are currently able to find and a HELOC with $3k remaining to draw from.\n\nThe mortgage obviously is the biggest worry, as we always thought the house was our safety net. Bank of America no longer lets us access the account online for whatever reason and I cannot find any evidence of recent payments from any accounts we have access to.\n\n**The plan:**\n\nWe had planned on attempting to keep my mom in the house through the holiday season through a number of methods, just to provide the most stability for her emotionally. First was to apply for a second HELOC, as large as we can get and use that to cover expenses. Second was to ask for hardship relief on the mortgage. Both of which may been unfeasible now if the mortgage has gone unpaid this long.\n\nWe also discovered that life insurance was not paid for more than 6 months and the policy has lapsed so any hope of getting pennies on the dollar in that situation will likely involve a legal battle we have neither the funds nor time for at this moment.\n\nThere is $25k coming into his business account (he worked for himself) hopefully in a few days but that will all go to cover the mortgage if they even let us pay it at this point (\\~4k per month for the house).\n\nPlease any help or thoughtful comments are appreciated.\n\n  \n**Edit:**\n\n**9/30:** Thank you all for the comments and sorry for not getting back to them yesterday. I will be looking through and trying to respond to everybody today. I did notice that there were a lot of comments about calling the house \"our\" safety net as opposed to my mom's. To clarify, of course it is my mom's but I was speaking from a standpoint of approaching the problem as a family and a team. Yes, the 4 kids are all grown and not dependent on my parents. We have each sunk all our available cash into paying whatever bills we need to in the immediate aftermath. Additionally, for those commenting on the funeral costs, we did chose a cremation and very simple service to minimize cost but that was also before we were able fully access all the information about just how bad the situation was. In the long run it saved us money anyways since the ME took the body direct to the funeral home on the day it happened and would have kept charging more the longer we waited.",

I also have 3 cars(taxis) that I am paying a car note on. I'm able to slowly pay all this down while maintaining the minimum payment.\n\nIn total I owe about 40% in credit card debt and about 60% in car loan debt (Sheesh it looks like so much when I write it out.)\n\nAnyway, my crypto and other investments are starting to look good, like I might be able to clear it all off in the next couple months. I'm waiting till the point where I only have to liquidate 1/3 of my investments to clear all my debt.\n\nIs there any reason I shouldn't do this, or should I do it differently?\n\nI'm looking for advice or just a different point of view of this situation. I feel like, If I clear my debt, my income will probably rise greatly, since there's no more interest from the 3 cars and 13 (personal and business) credit cards.\n\nFeel free to chide me for having so much debt! :)",

She is unhappy with the relationship but is reluctant to break it off due to her (perceived) debts and liabilities. \n\nMy MIL “signed a whole bunch of papers” without really understanding what she was signing. She believes that a 26’ box truck is in her name and she is responsible for it. \n\nI reviewed her credit report on CreditKarma and I am only seeing:\n\nCiticard: $10k  \nWells Fargo: $10k  \nWells Fargo: $7.7k  \nWells Fargo line of credit: $5k  \n\nUnder the “Auto Loans” section, I don’t see anything. \n\nMy MIL is an unreliable reporter so getting information from her is hard and when I do get information, it may not be accurate. \n\nMy questions:\n- Should I get the VIN for the truck and run a carfax report? Would that tell me who the owner is?  \n- What is a line of credit from Wells Fargo? Does that require collateral? Is it an unsecured loan?  \n- Should she declare bankruptcy and if so, are these credit card debts included in the bankruptcy?  \n- If we suspect early signs of dementia, what would be the best first step in securing her finances from the business? Would Power of Attorney be a good idea to look into?  \n- Are there any other places I should look to find a better picture of her liabilities?\n\nMy partner and I want to help her untangle herself and live a life that is within her means. I also did want to mention that she receives survivor benefits from her late husband as well as some investment income. Occasionally the business does make money but I believe on a whole that they are losing money since the BF is asking her to sign for some new loans. \n\nAny help is appreciated. Thanks.",

I didn’t regret any of it.\n\nI still save. I still invest. But I also live.

      "text": "I was laid off in April. I had 3 months of savings, now depleted, and I won't be able to pay my mortgage next month. I have applied to over 400 jobs with a decent amount of interviews. What can I actually do? \n\nEditing to add relevant details: \n\nI am on unemployment. My unemployment will last 2-3 more months. One month of unemployment does not cover my mortgage. I am ineligible for any other public services, such as food stamps or Medicaid. I am uninsured. My unemployment is roughly 20% of my prior salary.\n\nI have done all the things I should have done after being laid off - filed for unemployment, contacted my banks and credit card companies, cancelled all subscriptions and memberships, even refilled my expensive prescriptions before my insurance ended. Did you know that one inhaler - one month of use - is $600 without insurance? \n\nI have already contacted my mortgage company, but they cannot do anything until I miss a payment. Then, I can apply for hardship, but it is unclear whether that would be a full deference or a few hundred dollars off the mortgage. I would not know until I start the process. \n\nI wish I could have saved more than a 3-month emergency fund, but this is my third layoff in three years. I'm lucky that I was able to save up just 3 months worth of money. The first time I was unemployed, I took out a personal loan. The second time, I cashed out my 401k. I do not have much leverage with loans at this point. A HELOC is my absolute last resort. I have only owned my home for 3 years, so it will not be a substantial loan and I will have nothing once that is exhausted. \n\nI live in a HCOL area and I work in tech (hence the repeated lay-offs). I am applying to any and all relevant jobs in my field. I would like to get a job outside of tech, but that is not really up to me in this job market. I will accept the first offer I get. My interview stats are pretty solid for my field. Unless you have similar experience, there is no reason to comment on my job search. This is a personal finance subreddit - not a career judgement one.\n\nWhile I would love to get a side job in the meantime, my unemployment will decrease with every dollar I earn. My unemployment cannot cover my bills, but it is more than I would earn from a part-time, minimum-wage job. This is not MY choice - it is just how it works. And yes, I can and do work for cash but that's not going to cut it. Please see this comment for a better explanation: https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/1liiqtb/comment/mzcn3gy/\n\nSome commentors are saying the math doesn't add up. I don't know what to tell you other than I had 3 months of money saved up, and the end of that 3 months will be July 1. I can scrape together all of the money for my other bills to pay my mortgage, obviously, but then I'll be defaulting on loans and credit cards - again. My credit is wrecked. And no, I can't ask family - they are abusive - I haven't spoken to them since I turned 18.\n\nI am looking for answers other than the obvious 'get a part-time job' and 'file for unemployment.' I am steps ahead of that. I am hoping someone has some niche or other idea that might work for me.",

I would urge people to stay away from these services or be extremely cautious, there is no one supervising them and fraud is rampant.\n\nBanks and credit unions are still regulated by state and federal agencies. Bigger banks are regulated by the OCC - Office of the Comptroller for Currency, who has an online complaint form and process. Smaller banks are often regulated by a state regulator.\n\nReference: [https://www.cnbc.com/2025/03/10/why-banks-dont-want-the-cfpb-to-disappear.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/03/10/why-banks-dont-want-the-cfpb-to-disappear.html)\n\nQuote from article:  \n“They’re about to live in a world in which the entire nonbank financial services industry is unregulated every day, while they are overseen by the Federal Reserve, FDIC and OCC,” the lawyer said. “It’s a world where [Apple](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/AAPL/), PayPal, Cash App and [X](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/01/28/elon-musk-x-visa-digital-wallet.html) run wild for four years.

For the past 16 years of our relationship, it has been a source of contention, and any time we discuss it, it usually leads to arguments. \n\nThroughout that time, we've received two separate inheritances for $30K each. Unfortunately, they were used for either existing debt/car payoff or were otherwise squandered. \n\nI was unemployed for 6 months within the past year, and we now have $20K in CC debt on a single card. We make more than the minimum payments, but we also put a lot of purchases on the card for cash back. As I'm typing this I'm realizing that the \"cash back\" we've accrued within the past year doesn't even match 1 month of interest charges on the card... \n\nI know we need to budget, but in the event that history repeats itself, what type of professional should we consult to help us stay on track? I'm sick of living paycheck to paycheck. Any advice is appreciated, please be kind.",

We love our location, property, and are locked in at a 2.7% mortgage so not looking to move in the area, instead want to add substantial square footage. I’m trying to figure out how to go about financing it? The home is valued around $170,000 and we owe around $85k. While we haven’t talked to contractors yet (first need to see what we are approved for), I’m thinking it will be a pretty substantial cost of around $250k from what I’ve researched.\n\nWe could use a home equity loan to cover part of the costs but that is obviously a major gap. How do you fund the remaining? Personal loan interests rate are incredibly high. Is this where construction loans come in? Or can you take out a second mortgage for only the extra needed amount so you can keep the amount with the lower payment? So confused about where even to start!!",

      "text": "I recently graduated high school and don’t own a car yet. Right now, I use my sister’s car to get to work, but over the past few days I’ve been seriously thinking about financing my own car within the next few months. I’m considering vehicles in the $14,000 to $17,000 range and would need a loan to cover it. I’ve watched a lot of finance videos, and most of them say financing a car at 18 with my income is a bad idea. I currently make about $20,000 a year after taxes, which I know isn’t a lot, but my situation has a few extra factors I’m weighing.\n\nMy mom has a very good credit score and is willing to cosign on the loan, which would help me qualify and possibly get a better interest rate. Based on some estimates I’ve run, the monthly payments would likely be between $200 and $350 depending on the exact car and terms. I understand that insurance will be expensive due to my age and limited driving history, but I don’t have any other major bills outside of gas, insurance, and the occasional outing with my girlfriend. I’m also in the Army Reserve, which means I have a steady monthly income of about $350 minimum guaranteed for the next five years. On top of that, I’m with Navy Federal Credit Union, which could offer lower interest rates because of my military status.\n\nI haven’t made any final decisions yet, but I’m taking time to think things through and explore all the possibilities. I’d really appreciate any advice from people who have been in a similar situation or who know more about car financing and managing money at this age. Thanks in advance for any help. \nEdit: i would wanna buy a used car of over 70k miles on it. \nI would be able to put a 5k downpayment on it.",

She has made a significant dent in her debt and loans since graduating but hasn’t put much toward investments or retirement because of that. \n\nI plan to help her tackle as much of her student loans and debt once we’re married and combine finances, we’re on the same page about having a main joint account and then our own small personal accounts as well.\n\nWhen it comes to investments and retirement saving, financially/mathematically, is it better to help her get to a similar level to where I am, or keep things the same and just know that I will split everything with her anyway?

I do have some credit card debt but it has never gone to collections or anything like that. I have never received a letter, phone call, or email saying I owe someone money. I have a 750 credit score just for reference. This has to be a mistake right?\nOddly enough my mom had the same thing happen to one of her accounts as well. Please someone help me. \n\nI know my sister has about $10,000 worth or credit card debt, if not more. Perhaps it has something to do with her. And my mom does not have much debt either and none of it has gone into collections. And obviously their accounts are separate from mine so why would they take MY MONEY. I have called my bank. They said there is nothing they can do other than provide me the number for the company that took the money. \n\nEDIT: Fortunately I am now in the process of recovering my funds. The levy was due to an old credit card debt from one of my family members and they are now in a payment plan with the receivership company. Because my account was associated with my family members name, the judge that issued the judgement viewed my money as fair game in order to pay back the debt. As many others have said, this is an important lesson that having someone else’s name tied to your finances can be disastrous.",

(Paid down from $28,000 in the last three years.)\n\nI'm realizing after several visits and phone calls to the credit union that they have a strict \"10 day processing period\" (aside from their later interaction with the DMV) to process a payment, *even if this payment is in physical cash*.\n\nI understand they want to wait on a personal check, or possibly even a certified or cashier's check. Lots of scams out there. But even if they buyer for my car walked in with cash in a briefcase, I was told by the head of their title division (and a senior manager in their loan division), they warn about a ten business day processing delay.\n\nThe problem is that this prevents the buyer from getting tags from the DMV that entire time. I have also visited my state's DMV and they confirmed that they are unable to do any title work or issue any tags until the free and clear title is available (lien released) in the buyer's name.\n\nIf the buyer is a schoolteacher, police officer, retail clerk -- anyone who works and lives paycheck-to-paycheck -- they can't afford to have a just-purchased car sit in their driveway for 10 business days only to have to wait an additional 5-10 days for whatever the DMV needs to finish processing the paperwork.\n\nMy thought was to **buy my own car from the credit union by using several credit cards** ($16k in total), anticipating that I would be able to sell the car fairly quickly (4-6 weeks), and at most have to pay one or two months' interest across those cards. This would allow me to have the free and clear title in my name ahead of time and when the sale happens, I just sign the bottom of the title and the buyer could get tags that afternoon or the next morning, if needed.\n\nI don't have the savings to pay off the remaining amount -- I've also applied for a personal loan but was declined. My credit score is 770 but my income is low. (Lower now than when vehicle was purchased, through no fault of my own.)",

      "text": "Me and my husband are having a really hard time with our finances. I haven't been able to eat or sleep. We are having issues even making it paycheck to paycheck. We penny pinch and try to make it stretch as far as possible but we always go the last 2 days of the week without dinner (we always make sure our son has food and all other necessities). Its just becoming to much. I don't want to reach out to family, i just don't know what to do anymore.\n\nEditing to add: We/my husband brings in about 2600/month. Our rent is 1800 a month (which is really low for our area). \n\nOur other bills are broken down as follows; water is as low as 80 as high as 110. \n\nElectricity is usually around 250/300 depending on the time of year. \n\nThe Internet is about 100(my husband got a deal as he had his own equipment just needed it connected). \n\nThe phone bill(both of ours combined) is 80.\n\n I've also been dealing with a lot mentally and my husband insisted on me getting into therapy. My therapist knows of our money trouble and has me set to the lowest price of payment possible at 40$ a visit and my visits are once a month (give or take, sometimes she wants to see me sooner). I'm also on a list of medications, and due to not having insurance, one of my medicines is like 220$.\n\nThen there's food, diapers/wetwipes, typical hygiene items, which depending on what week it is and what we got the week before. It can range from 150 to 200",

With all the add-ons the dealer included, a $23,000 car ballooned to over $33,000, and the loan term is way too long.

I know these numbers are laughably small in today's terms, but that's just how it is where I live. \n\nThe houses have newer metal roofs, decent vinyl siding, but are otherwise very basic. I can do 99% of the maintenance myself. \n\nSo is it worth it to buy them both, continue living in this house until I build and rent the other for less than I'll be paying per month, just to build equity? I currently have no debt, not married, no kids. Was planning on breaking ground this year but I could wait if this is the smarter route. \n\nAny and all advice welcomed. Thanks in advance. \n\nEdit: will definitely have it inspected by a licensed inspector. Also I could afford to pay for both of them, without a renter.

We are in the works of setting up a joint account where we can evenly put money for groceries, insurance, etc. but when it comes to the house we have different ideas about how to handle it. Obviously the deed is in his name and he owns it by himself. I will be moving in at the end of the year when my lease is up, and I assumed what I was paying at my place for rent I would now pay part of it to him for the mortgage. He says I should put that money towards my college loans, which are significant, and I would just take on the smaller costs of the home like utilities, internet, etc. We have about the same salary, though he makes just slightly more than me, but he puts more of his money into stocks and retirement funds. I guess I’m just wondering when we are married, the house is still not in my name, is my credit going to go down because I don’t have these on time rent payments anymore? Are either of our plans financially responsible for both of us? Is there any other way we could do this that we haven’t thought of? I don’t think I can ask him to change the deed and put my name on it though I guess I’m entirely sure how it works. I want to feel like we’re both contributing fairly. He understands money stuff better than I do. I’d just like to be able to present some more options when we sit down to talk about it again.",

      "title": "Finances while navigating divorce",
      "text": "Hello redditors-\n\nI’m looking for some financial advice as I navigate through my divorce (dissolution). I’m going to attempt to provide all the financial details, but please ask if anything else is needed!\n\nCurrently, my wife and I have been separated for about 4.5 months. She left the house in March. It doesn’t matter the reasons why, but long story short, she told me out of the blue one day she was unhappy in the marriage and needed a “break”. About two weeks later I discovered an affair. It’s been so long, fair well, ever since. We have two young children, ages 5 and 9.\n\nWe both work full time and we both have modest careers. I earn about 115-120k per year. I have the option to work OT whenever I want, but I hardly ever work it. I get some extra hours here and there but nothing crazy. I have zero debt. I drive a 2014 vehicle that only has 64k miles. Never needed any major repairs. Still in great shape. I have a work vehicle that is provided to me and that’s how I’ve kept the mileage low. I have 1 credit card that only has a 12k limit and I have NEVER paid a penny to interest. I pay it off every month. The r only debt I have is our home. We bought the home in 2021 for $289k. It is now worth approximately 350-380k. My mortgage is a 20 year loan, with biweekly payments (one extra payment a year) at $640 biweekly. Roughly 1,250 a month (expect two months a year where the extra payment happens). My yearly tax bill is around 5k. Another $1,200 a year for homeowners insurance.\n\nMy wife makes very similar money, around 110-120k a year, depending on her bonuses. She is only two years into her career though. So her ceiling will be a lot higher in a few years. She also has a work vehicle provided, which she is also allowed to use for personal use and she gets free gas. She has no debt either. We have both always saved 20+% into future retirements/pensions. But I’ve been with my career for 11 years, so mine is much larger. My wife worked part time for years, a little time as a stay at home mom, and a few years full time. She is really just getting started. I probably have more in my secondary account than she has total.\n\nWhen my wife first told me she hired an attorney for a dissolution, she told me she wanted 50/50 co-parenting with the kids. She also told me she had no interest in my pension, retirement, or child support. Since we have been separated, we have done 3.5 days a week each with the kids. A few times I’ve had to take the kids a little extra, but it’s been pretty close to 50/50. We are good about working with each other with the kids! Thank god for that.\n\nCurrently, we each have our own checking and savings accounts, but we both have access to each others accounts. We agreed to split all cash 50/50. We roughly have about 6-7k in checking accounts and about 60-65k in savings (depending on time of month).\n\nWhere my question comes in: I want to keep the family home. It’s a great home and I have the interest rate locked in for the remainder of the 15 years at 2.9% interest, owing 213k left on the home. For me to go buy a new home at $250-300k in this market, would be a much smaller and not as nice home with a much higher interest. I feel I would have a bigger payment than I do now! The state we live in is very low cost of lining. It really is a great home, with 2,400 square feet, 4 beds, 3 bath, and a finished basement. Since we moved it, I’ve replaced the roof, water softener, complete new HVAC system, new and bigger breaker box, re-done the master bath, and new flooring in the whole house. It’s good to go for years!\n\nI’m worried about the buyout. I would owe my wife half the equity in the home. Originally, she asked for 50k and that’s it. This was a steal for me. I felt that she was being “nice” because she felt guilty because she is the one who ruined this marriage and left. But, obviously since she got the attorney, she realizes there is more money she can get, rightfully so. So I’m predicting a buyout of about 80k. I’ve met the mortgage broker and we looked at home equity loans and a second mortgage. If I go the second mortgage route, my interest rate will not change when I remove my wife from the loan/deed. That was nice to learn!\n\nAlthough my income sounds nice, my actual take home pay is about 2,700 every other week. So to budget, I say 5k a month (low ball so I’m on the safe side). By the time I pay the monthly mortgage, insurance, taxes, and second mortgage loan, roughly half my monthly income is already gone! I could use some of the cash we split to lower that loan amount, but I want to have a decent emergency fund just in case something happens. I do plan to start working some OT to quickly get that second loan paid off ASAP. I also am looking to stop paying into my secondary retirement account until that loan is paid. That’s $500 a month I put into the secondary account to go towards the second mortgage.\n\nMy wife has brought up the topic of child support a few times, which scares me. I told her it’s BS to think she should get support when we do 50/50 parenting. That’s when I learned my state REQUIRES child support be paid to the custodial parent. Custodial parent pays for all child needs and then I would pay my share of that. I told her that I would also like to be custodial parent. We are both fantastic parents, neither of us have a reason to not be custodial. I know that the court system will automatically grant it to the mother if we are both capable and willing. I offered the idea of each of us claiming one kid, and with similar incomes, the support would essentially be zero or maybe a few hundred a month. She declined this offer. She said being custodial parent is non negotiable for her. I said it was for me as well. She then said I better be ready for a long, drawn out divorce with lots of attorney fees then. I said “ok”. This pissed her off.\n\nI’m worried that my wife is going to go back on all her “promises” from the beginning. I don’t think a judge would take away 50/50 parenting since we have been doing it flawlessly up to this point. But I know I will never get custodial rights. It’s just the way it is. We can complain about that as men all we want, but that’s life and I accept that fact.\n\nSo- do I take the second mortgage and pay my wife out for the home? Or do I sell the home and split the proceeds with her? The proceeds plus the cash on hand is enough for both of us to go buy a new home. But I already know I won’t find a house in the school district that’s this nice with this payment. But I’m worried about being strapped for cash.\n\nIs it realistic, as an older man who works night shift, to pick up a bunch of OT for a few years and get this loan paid off? If I do work OT and my income goes up, will my child support then go up?\n\nI’m ignorant on the topic of divorce, because I never thought in a million years I would be in this situation… but here I am…\n\nThank you all!",

      "text": "Moved into our house about five years ago and I’ve had minor issues with water in the basement here and there. I did a little bit of a DIY fix because it wasn’t ever a terrible issue, and that seemed to do the trick until the recent bombardment of rain we’ve had in the past few weeks. I now have a major problem that’s going to require about $25K of waterproofing and drainage systems. It is also going to mean a  basement refinish and with three teens in the home (two of whom loudly play guitar), I definitely need to have a basement area where they can be sequestered with their friends and do their thing. But we’re taking basic—new floor, new drywall, maybe a half bath since it’s been on the to do list. Assuming this will run me another $25k+ at least.\n\nThinking of doing a 401(k) loan, but also considering HELOC. Some details if that helps—I’m 49 and wife is 45. We owe about $250K on our house with about triple that in equity. I have about $1.2m in 401(k). I have about $30k in a HYSA savings acct but I’d rather not touch that for this. I had some investments, but used most of them to bump up my down payment when we bought the house. We don’t have any debt and make a good household income ($350ish), but our oldest is attending an expensive private college that ate up his 529 last year, so now that tuition comes right out of my pocket, but luckily he’s only got one more year to go and it’s manageable. I would rather not have to do this basement until then, but I don’t have a choice at this point. At the very least, we have to do the waterproofing now.\n\nAny suggestions?",

We’ve lived together over the summers before, but it was in his parents' house, so we never really had financial ties beyond Venmo-ing for dinner here and there. The rent is $1,300 per month (after my mom helps with some of the total amount), so we agreed to split it 50/50. We’ve been getting furniture and eating out, so I paid, and he sent money through Zelle. He gets paid weekly, so the payments were split into multiple parts.\n\nHere’s where the issues occurred. He gave me $40 for a dinner, $60 for a piece of furniture we bought, and $300 for rent. Later, he sent $400 for rent, so I said we’re all set. He keeps saying that he paid me $400 twice, so $800 has been paid for rent and utilities. I disagreed and said he technically only sent $700, which is enough for rent (but not all utilities), but he insists that because he sent $400 twice, it should all count toward rent and utilities.\n\n**Basically, is there a way to organize two people paying for different things and find a monthly balance? I would prefer to keep an exact tally as bills come up so we don’t have to worry about who may be overpaying. He prefers a “I pay this time, you pay next time” model, but that doesn’t really work with big bills like rent and electricity.**\n\nWe both have Rocket Money, so paying for another financial service or app is not ideal. I do love using Excel, but it’s not very suitable for a situation like this I don’t think.",

      "text": "Hey all,\n\nI’m 30 and trying to get my financial life together. Right now I drive a 2020 GMC Sierra, but I still owe $37,000 on it. The trade-in offers I’ve been getting are around $30,000, so I’d be rolling over about $7K in negative equity. I mistakenly put myself in a bind here and had “new vehicle fever” when I got this thing. Now I’m seeing how much money I’m wasting on a hunk of metal. \n\nThe truck payment is $667/month, and it’s eating up a huge chunk of my income. I want to save and invest more, maybe even hit $100K in savings/investments in 10 years. I’m brainstorming new financial goals and want to save more for long term goals and retirement so the 100k is just a spit ball, idk. I currently have $0 in savings and about $15k in a 401k. \n\nI’ve increased my income this year to approximately $54,000 which I’m really proud of, considering where I was at. However this truck payment is still crushing me. I have $5k in credit cards I’m paying along with $6k in a personal loan I am paying. \nI clearly have made some unwise financial decisions. \n\nI’m thinking of trading the truck in, taking the $7K hit, and getting something cheaper—like a Toyota 4Runner (if possible)  in the $10K–$15K range that’s still 4WD.  Maybe even cheaper and a different vehicle/model if it comes to it depending on what I can find.\n\nThe ego part of me feels like I’m giving up or “playing small” but I also know freeing up that $300–$500/month… (considering I’d have another car payment, just cheaper, maybe 200 - 300 /month for a car payment) \n…could seriously help me build wealth and become debt free.\n\nHas anyone else done something like this? Was it worth it? I’m really tired of my digging myself into financial holes so I want to make the best move I can here. \n\nAlso—any tips on how to finance an older car if it’s not from a dealership? Credit unions? Personal loans?\n\nAppreciate any advice or experience. Just want to get on the right path financially.",

I’m deciding between hiring a planner or staying DIY, so here’s where we’re at.\n\nLate 30s couple, one child (hoping for 1–2 more). HH income ~$180k. I just moved to America, and started a W9 job last year that offers a 401(k) with 5% match — current balance is ~$6k, so most of our investable assets are outside retirement accounts. Husband currently has no retirement plan through work,but has been investing in an E*trade account for some years (previous job gave stock options in the company instead of 401k, unfortunately it tanked and we lost that). I get health insurance for myself/son; he’s covered separately. I also contribute to an FSA.\n\nWe own a rental property (cash flow ~$300/mo) and our own home with a mortgage. Savings: ~$15k — about 2 months of expenses in liquid cash (not including investments), assuming we paused saving/investing. If one income were lost, we’d likely relocate to be closer to family (lower cost of living), but we’re here for at least another year so planning for current situation.\n\nInvestments: \n•Crypto #1 ($27k)Modest position in one coin doing well — not huge, but tough to decide whether to sell/buy back in. \n•Crypto #2 ($46k); More diversified, also performing well. \n•E*TRADE ($74k) and currently investing ~$1k/mo in mixed funds/stocks (incl. SWPPX). \n•529 ($2k) 60/mo for child.\n\nWe planned to put more in 529 but prioritized retirement. Also debated custodial brokerage. Will need to adjust budget for two kids in future. Not adding anymore to crypto currently. We’re OK with some risk, but unsure if that’s wise.\n\nEverything right now hinges on a small 401(k), our E*TRADE account, and the crypto. I’d been leaning toward a flat-fee/hourly planner, but some say AUM is better. I think our big picture is OK, but not sure if all these moving parts are really moving the needle. So with all that, would anyone mind sharing their thoughts on whether we should we keep going ourselves, or get a planner? And any insight on how best to set ourselves up for success if we keep DIYing\n\nEdit: thanks for all your responses. I thought I had to be thorough and mention all the different accounts without giving exact amounts (as recommended in a different thread, and Google suggested just highlighting different accounts since the question is about whether a financial planner is needed).. I have edited to add that above for any new readers. \n \nI also should have mentioned that I’m new to the US, so first full time W9 job with the option for 401k. I feel better hearing that our situation is not that complicated and appreciated hearing thoughts on how to simplify. And especially the note about AUM models needing more funds than we actually have. I hadn’t come across that in my reading so thank you!! \n\nNeither of us were raised learning about managing money or prioritizing retirements/investments so it’s been a little overwhelming. I listen to a lot of podcasts (money for couples, Dave Ramsey, inside out money and other one off episodes), and read some of the recommended books on them. But I hadn’t heard of some of the info/links mentioned below. I will check them out, thank you!!\n\nEdit 2: I’m going to keep going with doing my own research for now! And go through links shared below. I think selling off crypto 1 is the move, I just need to do more reading now on having the investment platform as well as Roth IRA for hubby since current job doesn’t offer 401k.\n\nEdit 3: no, we don’t plan to mooch off our kids. I realize we’re very behind, and we do hope to have one more (three was the max, but two is more likely). Not immediately though since we are wanting to get our finances in order!! Hence the post about we can start doing that, and whether we needed a qualified person to review our finances and help get us on the right path.",

      "text": "I’m curious what the general consensus is on here.\n\nMy parents, who just turned 60, currently don’t have a real nest egg saved for retirement. For a number of different factors, they never really afforded to save much over the years but I don’t want to get into that. \n\nThey have combined, MAYBE $400k saved in tax-deferred retirement accounts. I estimate they jointly earn close to $180k per year with their jobs which has been a huge step up for them recently (only within the past 5 years or so have they been earning this much). I am unsure of how much in student loan debt they still have for my siblings (Parent Plus loans) but I would estimate it’s close to $50k. They also still have a large outstanding mortgage on their home. The house is probably worth $400k but they still owe close to $180k.\n\nThey purchased and built a plot of land that they built a vacation home on, with the intention that they will rent it out for vacationers. They say they can cover the building loan payments for this new property, along with still paying their other debts, with their current income. Renting it out will be extra income to them on top of what they earn.\n\nThe whole reason they say they have done this is that they can transition from their manual labor jobs (my mom is a nurse, my dad is a construction foreman) to this and essentially be full-time rental property managers to continue earning income to fund their retirement.\n\nThis whole thing they cooked up, to me, just sounds way too complex and betting on way too many factors and variables to reliably fund their retirement. I’m honestly scared for them, and I’ve wanted to tell them before that this doesn’t sound like a good idea. But I didn’t have the heart to say anything.\n\nI guess I’m just asking if anyone else has been in similar situations and what you may have done about it. Thanks.\n\nEdit: WOW this has blown up more than I thought it would! Will try to comb through everything!",

She drives 13-14k miles per year and we have about $2k in positive equity in her current car. We also have about $5k cash that we could put toward a down payment. The reason that I am considering a lease instead of finance is due to my uncertainty with Kia. I've never owned a Kia or had a vehicle serviced at their dealership. I've heard mixed review about the service experience at the nearest dealership and, if it's as bad as I've heard some say, the 2nd nearest dealership is well outside of courtesy shuttle range. If we are unhappy with the vehicle or service experience in 2-3 years, with how Kias depreciate (estimated 33% over 3 years), we would take a bath on a trade-in. Would we be wise to lease the vehicle (2-3 years @ 15k miles/yr) and buy out the lease if we are pleased?\n\nTLDR: $7k available toward down payment, Wife drives 13-14k miles/yr, Unsure of a new (to us) vehicle brand and service experience, Concerned about depreciation, Considering leasing and buying out lease if happy\n\n  \n\\*\\*\\*Thanks for the replies and information.

Sometimes I fell like my siblings don't think about it as much as I do, and that may be because I don't have kids (that's prob def the reason why) but I just want to be proactive than reactive.\n\nSo please again no mean comments, constructive criticism is allowed, just be cordial about it.\n\nThank you in advance!!",

      "text": "hi guys I’m wondering if financing a car is a good idea because I am out of options. I just recently started a job after moving out with my fiancé. We now live in his home town with his family while we wait for our apartment to be ready. We both work full time and now it is so hard to manage 2 jobs and one car between the 2 of us. The bus doesn’t really run out here and uber/lyft is way to expensive just to get to and from work so I am out of options( around $250 per week) We have all of our first time renting fees set aside and have started setting aside money for our emergency fund. I have been looking at used cars and have found some that are relatively cheap and good mileage. I make enough to pay rent and all of the necessary car fees that would come along with a car and to pay a loan off. My fiancé said he would help pay it back with me because we would both be using the car. Any opinions are helpful and thank you in advance!",

Mint wants me to connect every account, YNAB has this steep learning curve, and most others throw 20 features at me when I just want to log what I spent on coffee this morning.\n\nThe bigger issue is I keep forgetting about my finances or future planning, and then some fine day it hits me that I haven't been tracking anything or thinking ahead.

      "text": "Hi guys! First time posing here so bare with me if it's too lengthy or unclear, but I will try my best to explain the situation.  \nSo both me and my wife have full time job and we live in Bay Area in California, a place where you literally cannot go to anywhere if you don't have cars. After starting the new job I just feel it's too annoying to take rides everyday with fluctuating rates, and sometimes the drivers are not too friendly either. And waiting every morning/afternoon for someone to pick me up just simply sucks. I just don't want to keep throwing money into something that's not investable at all. So I have been talking to my wife about getting a used car as we have a 2016 Honda Civic EX off loan already. She's kind of agreed but also hesitated (she is always hesitated when it comes to big payment like cars tho, I pushed her really hard back in 2018 to be able to purchase the used Honda too which benefit us a lot), but understands the need of a second car.\n\nLong story short, I went to dealership yesterday because I found a 2021 white Camry which is in really good shape (my wife didn't accompany me as she didn't think I will pull the trigger). There was only one owner and they did maintenance every 3-6 months. After talking to the salesman I was pretty happy with it and decided to take it home. However, the best rate I can get (according to the dealership) is 7.99% with Wells Fargo for 60 mos. Credit score $740+. Monthly payment will be $471 (after warranty included which I plan on opting out after 6 months). I know the rate is kind of in the normal range for current market place, but still I feel so stupid for not remembering to negotiate the price. And also not remembering to shop around first. Just can't express how disappointed I am at myself. My original purpose is to have a reliable car with lower monthly payment compared to Lyfting monthly, but the monthly payment now is almost the same with Lyfting, not to mention I need to add hidden cost like maintenance, auto insurance and so on.\n\nI will definitely try to budget and save more money so I can pay more towards Principles, but there is also a possibility that in the future my wife and I will be moving to Canada (just not sure when tho- could be in 1 year, 1.5 years or 3 years). And I know in order to import your car to Canada you need to clear all loans which I am not sure if I will be able to do by then. And also I am trying to see if I can refinance but I guess I should wait for a year or so? I was trying to re-finance during last night and this morning but some of them were saying \"unable to complete the request. please call.\" Not sure if it's because the loan amount (which include the insurance/registration fee) might be greater than the car value?\n\nAnyway any advice will be appreciated. But please if you could, be a little bit gentle with me as I am already hating myself and feel I am the most stupid person in the world. \n\nEdit: Advice on if I should re-finance will be really appreciated! And also in the future if I need to move from the US, will it make more sense if I try to resell the Camry to either a private buyer or a dealership and just pay off any differences that's between car value and the amount I owe?\n\nEdit again:\nHi everyone just an update!! :))) So I went to the dealership again with my wife and we had asked to cancel the warranty they were trying to force me to buy. And now the payment has become $380/month for 60 month with 7.99% Apr, which was much closer to my monthly budget. Will try to refinance when it hits 6 months to let the credit build a bit and have my wife as a co-applicant to see if we can get a better rate. Thanks guys for all the responses and I did talk to my wife and promised her that I won't make any abrupt decisions in the future anymore. Really learned from this experience (also traumatized a little bit 🥲)",

      "text": "Hey everyone! I've been tracking my expenses for the past 2 years, increased my savings 8 times, and I wanted to share some unexpected insights that might help others.\n\n**1. Inflation is way more personal than headlines suggest**\n\nI always read about inflation rates, but never noticed it in “real life”. After about a year of tracking expenses, I discovered this. It’s hard to track based on weeks or even months, and I really faced that after \\~1 year. With the same expenses, the same quality of life level without any significant changes, I can’t fit my budget anymore. This realization was pretty disappointing. I was even thinking about stopping any budgeting and tracking activities. But that’s not the way, after a few days I returned to my normal state and decided to focus on increasing my income instead of abandoning my tracking habits.  \n(my old tracking sheet after budget adjusting: [https://imgur.com/oweKCyc](https://imgur.com/oweKCyc))\n\n**2. \"Normal months\" are rare - and that's normal**\n\nOne of my biggest revelations was that there's no such thing as a \"typical month.\" Looking at my data:\n\n* Some months were 30% over budget due to unexpected car repairs\n* Other months were surprisingly under budget.\n* Holidays and birthdays always threw things off.\n* Medical expenses came out of nowhere.\n\nThe key learning: Build a buffer for these \"surprise\" months. They're actually not surprises - they're part of life. “Emergency fund” is a must-have, but it’s not a magic pill, don’t rely on it too much.  \n(my February nightmare, s\\*\\*t happens, just keep going: [https://imgur.com/WXyb5ix](https://imgur.com/WXyb5ix))\n\n**3. Impulse buying becomes harder when you track**\n\nThis was unexpected, but knowing I'd have to log purchases made me think twice about random buys. I simply don’t want to see those red numbers in my green budget life. Of course, it doesn’t save you millions (actually depends on your income/expenses, but not my case). It is more about preventing spending more.\n\n**4. Finally understand where my money ACTUALLY goes**\n\nBefore tracking, I had this vague idea about my spending. Now I know:\n\n* My \"cheap\" coffee habit was actually $180/month. (Dropped it to \\~50 after a year)\n* Subscriptions were eating $85/month (that’s a hard thing to deal with, but at least it doesn’t grow for now)\n* I was spending way more on food delivery than I thought.\n* Weekend activities were 2x more expensive than I estimated. I do not have children, it is just me, my partner, and a dog. I can not imagine the children’s impact on that.\n\n**5. Adjust**\n\nAdjust, adjust everything, and find your comfort zone. Do not set hard limits without knowing your actual spending. First several months **must be** “testing” months. You should get to know your habits, your money, your expenses. Do not set unrealistic limits. You will be disappointed when you go over that number. Instead, be curious about your spending, investigate them. Just live an everyday life. But set in advance the duration of the period. 2-3 months worked well for me, I think that period is crucial not to drop all that expense-budgeting things.\n\n**6. Peace of mind?**\n\nI do not think you can achieve real peace of mind with all that. However, you can gain control over your finances. I have never considered the connection between my psychological state and budgeting. Those two years were tough for me, and my expense-tracking habit was a small part of my stability. But it depends on your personality.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nTracking expenses is truly impactful, and it has really changed my life. Those 2 years were not my first try. I have tried several times before, but all of them have been unsuccessful. Maybe I was too young (I’m 27 now), or there were other reasons for that. I’ve been working full time since I was 20, and for the first 5 years, I had less than 8k in savings. Now, after 2 years it is 8 times more. I can't attribute everything to budgeting and tracking expenses, but it helped 100%. Most of my money is in stocks and ETFs, so I do not have any short-term plans for them.\n\n**Tips for anyone starting:**\n\n* Start simple - just track everything for a month.\n* Don't judge yourself in the beginning.\n* Focus on patterns, not individual purchases.\n* Be consistent with categories.\n* Do not automatically import transactions from the bank, enter them manually.\n* Use tools that don't feel like work.\n\n**What's next?**\n\nI will continue to track my spending. And I have a few more ideas about budget optimization and hacks to save money. I will test them this year and hopefully I will be able to increase my savings even more without any downgrades.\n\n**What surprising patterns have you discovered in your spending?**",

My wife’s starting a job there and I’ll need to go back and forth between there and where my job is. \n\nFor context, I started a new job a couple months ago and my spouse is starting a new job in July. Our combined income (starting July 1st) is now 225k gross. We have no debt and about $75k in retirement savings.\n\nWe have about $15k in cash+savings today and that will go up to about $20-25k by August 1st. I’d like to get a used Camry, Mazda 3, or Civic — there’s several in my area for around $18-20k (some cheaper but older and with much higher mileage). \n\nDo we pay cash for a car as soon as we have $18-20k in the bank (therefore depleting our cash on hand), or do we put down a $10k payment and finance the rest (essentially paying interest for a few months to smooth our cash flow and then pay the rest of it down in 6 months or so)? \n\nI know I could also just look at cheaper (10k) cars, but I want something comfortable to drive in given the commute and something that’ll be reliable and last a while. My wife will also be learning how to drive in this car. \n\nAny advice much appreciated!",

      "text": "I’m thinking about getting an electric car to replace my truck as a daily driver.\n\nI like my truck a lot but it’s not very good on fuel. I live quite far from where I work so I spend $400 or so on gas. I don’t want to sell the truck because me and my family still need the truck for “truck stuff”.\n\nMy county offers unlimited non peak hour charging for $31 a month and I have free chargers at my workplace. This would save me at least $350\n\nI have my eye on a 40k electric car and I’m not so interested in having debt on a depreciating asset. I also like the idea of getting a new car regularly. But I don’t see myself leasing for very long, maybe 6 years. By then I’ll hopefully be out of my parents house and in a good enough spot to buy a car.\n\nIt would cost me $524 a month to finance the car for 60 months with $9k down(I don’t have 9k yet). To lease it would cost $390 for 36 months with nothing down. \n\nLeasing a car for the cost of my gas with little commitment sounds like a no brainer to me. It checks all my boxes but leasing has such a bad rap.\n\nWhat should I do?",

      "title": "The Blindingly Obvious Goal of Trump’s Tariffs That Everyone Seems to be Missing…",
      "text": "I keep seeing confusion about what Trump’s trying to accomplish with his new “tariffs on the world (except Russia, of course)” strategy.\n\n\n\nSome have come up with partial truths, like him crashing the economy so that his billionaire friends can sell in advance, short the market then buy the dip, and further consolidating industries by knocking out small and medium sized businesses (eg. https://www.reddit.com/r/Political_Revolution/s/pjgB8tIqpW) and while those may be side benefits, it misses his BY FAR most important motive:\n\n\n\n**His goal with these tariffs is to force any corporations that want to survive to submit to his direct control & “buy” his favor (a, by definition, fascist takeover FWIW).**\n\n\n\nThis is classic mob boss “carrot & stick persuasion” tactics & they are **terrifyingly** effective.\n\n\n\n**By imposing mixed levels of industry and country-specific tariffs & making it clear that these are all being imposed (& removed)** ***at his will*****, Trump is able to dramatically (& immediately) influence nearly every company’s relative costs & competitiveness.**\n\n**Within an astonishingly short period (likely just a matter of weeks or months) this financial control will force even the largest companies to submit to his demands in order to get the specific tariffs driving up the cost of \\*their\\* products & supply chains reduced or removed. Those who don't play by his rules will end up having to charge more & profit less, & will eventually be driven out of business by the competition that does play along.**\n\n\n\nWith this latest move, he’s given the CEOs & board rooms of America a **very clear, stark choice**:\n\n\n\nDo whatever he says (likely including in the long term purging your company of anyone who publicly opposes him & no longer advertising on platforms that allow opposition messaging), publicly praise him and “donate” millions to his “campaign\" (for a 3rd term?), and the tariffs that most directly affect your bottom line will be magically reduced or removed overnight.\n\n\n\nDo anything he doesn’t like, in contrast, and he’ll reimpose or increase them instead.\n\n\n\nHis calculus is simple:\n\n\n\nHe’s got another 3 1/2 years of executive power, minimum (you’re dreaming if you think BOTH the Republican-controlled house & 2/3rds of the Senate would ever vote to remove him, and even if they did, Vance would likely just continue with these tactics).\n\n\n\nMost CEOs can only survive a year ***at most*** of continually losing market share to the competitors that *are* willing to pay to play before they’ll be replaced by someone more compliant.\n\n\n\nThis means that by the 2026 midterms, any remaining corporate opposition will be substantially weakened and on its way out the door. By 2028, they will be utterly marginalized or gone.\n\n\n\nFor anyone who thinks this is alarmist, you only have to look at the brazen effectiveness of his most recent targeted attacks via executive order on the nation’s largest law firms.\n\n\n\nLaw firms that had previously participated in cases against him (or his cronies) have been individually named and prohibited from entering federal buildings (obviously a necessity to participate in federal court cases), had their security clearances threatened and been banned from working with federal agencies (often a multimillion dollar portion of their business).\n\n\n\nThe result?\n\n\n\nOne by one, **and within just a few weeks**, they’ve ALL bent the knee and not only dropped the cases they *were* working on, but also “donated” tens of millions in free legal work for organizations that Trump likes in order to get his executive orders reversed (successfully, btw). Understanding the clear intended message of these targeted attacks, many of the other big law firms have already announced plans to preemptively bribe (er, provide) him with over $100 million in pro bono services(!):\n\n\n\n[https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trumps-big-law-firms-retribution/](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trumps-big-law-firms-retribution/)\n\n\n\nFWIW, this has been Trump’s MO forever, so no one should be surprised. He has always used his outsized wealth and power to bully others into doing his bidding. Whether it’s stiffing small contractors out of millions after they’ve done all the work, then burying them in legal debt when they try to complain until they've commit suicide ([https://www.wsj.com/articles/donald-trumps-business-plan-left-a-trail-of-unpaid-bills-1465504454](https://www.wsj.com/articles/donald-trumps-business-plan-left-a-trail-of-unpaid-bills-1465504454)) or publicly humiliating fellow Republicans into complete submission (eg. Lil Marco Rubio, Lyin' Ted Cruz, etc), this is simply how he operates.\n\n\n\nThis is all out of the Dictator’s handbook, of course, and it’s why our founding fathers designated the power of the purse to congress instead of the president alone. Unfortunately, congresspeople are far too cowardly to assert their rightful power and will passively watch our democracy die long before they do anything about it. It seems highly unlikely that any company can resist this type of targeted coercion long term.\n\n\n\nHow we the people respond will determine whether the country we grew up in still exists in recognizable form just a few months from now.\n\nTL,DR: The “emergency” powers Trump currently has allow him to start, stop and dramatically alter international tariffs at will.\n\nGiven his extensive record of abusing power for personal gain (as demonstrated recently by him sabotaging individual law firms’ ability to conduct business with individually targeted executive orders, forcing them to not only stop all work on cases against him and his cronies, but also give him hundreds of millions of dollars in free labor in order for him to rescind them. These orders caused other law firms to preemptively offer him hundred million dollar bribes as well).\n\nI’m suggesting that he is likely to abuse his power again, effectively controlling many companies’ ability to compete depending on their compliance with his demands. By suddenly raising and lowering tariffs by large amounts (currently 50% in some cases, and there’s no reason he can’t go higher to make a point), he can attack individual companies’ respective weak points and sabotage their operations, making them consistently less competitive. He can also pair this with reduced tariffs on their rivals, making them MORE competitive. He can thus pit them against one another, consistently punishing the least complaint and rewarding the most compliant to strengthen their hand.\n\nBecause most companies legally exist to maximize shareholder profits, this will eventually force them to either acquiesce to his demands (no matter how extreme, eg. Demanding they replace employees he dislikes with people he does and participate in crimes) or be forced out of business, leading to what’s commonly known as a fascist state.\n\nPS Here’s an example of him doing exactly what I’m talking about: https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/apr/04/trump-exempts-big-oil-donors-from-tariffs",

I get it.\n\nI also get, that America has what should be a totally unsustainable debt level; in large part, from being very generous with World aid, in various forms.\n\nNow, having said that, besides tariffs, how could Trump entice/force American companies to bring their manufacturing to America? How could he otherwise achieve this, without shafting the middle-class?\n\nIt occurs to me that, the world was still nowhere near recovering economically from COVID.....and now this.\n\nThank you for your insight.",

      "text": "# \n\nAs fallout continues from the latest jobs report that showed a dramatic slowdown in job growth, business leaders are warning that the current market slowdown is “only the beginning,\n\nTrump, deep in his delusions about his ability to bully foreign governments, is figuratively banging his head against a wall. For six months he has been threatening tariffs, raising tariffs, then reducing tariffs, then changing his mind about tariffs and who should be taxed. He has been bouncing around like a chihuahua on crack with our three largest trading partners, Mexico and Canada, and China, thus throwing the world economy into total confusion and driving them to seek new partners with which to trade; he has driven China even closer to Russia and North Korea.\n\nHe is finding out the hard way like a schoolyard bully, that when you try and smack someone, they smack back. And the world is smacking back. He announces trade deals like the one he says he has with Japan. It is not a trade deal, it is a capitulation the will negatively impact American families to the tune of 1,500 dollars a year.\n\nIt also turns out the 'trade deals' he has announced as accomplished are not 'deals', at all. They are frameworks for deals. Frameworks then will be changed, negotiated, altered, and compromised over the next year, or so. He tells us they are finalized, but, as usual, he is lying through his store bought teeth.\n\nHe will say anything, do anything, blame anyone to hide his incompetence, and real, educated economists and businessmen tell us to fear for the worst.\n\nTrump and as he and his crime family now rake in personal billions while the American economy quivers and quakes with every manifestation of his cognitive fog.\n\nSee this:\n\n,\n\nOnly the beginning': Business leaders warn of Trump-induced economic crash\n\nStory by Alexander Willis\n\n2 min read\n\n© provided by RawStory\n\nAs fallout continues from the latest jobs report that showed a dramatic slowdown in job growth, business leaders are warning that the current market slowdown is “only the beginning,” and that the impacts of President Donald Trump’s tariffs are already well underway, Politico reported Friday.\n\n“Inflation and price increases are coming,” said Greg Ahearn, president and CEO of the Toy Association, speaking with Politico. “Layoffs have already been occurring, and supply is going to be lower as we head into the holiday season. These are all happening.”\n\nTrump unveiled the latest tariff rates on Thursday, set to go into effect on Aug. 7, with tariff rates as high as 50% on major trading partners. Among countries hit with the top rate of 50% is Brazil, with imported Brazilian coffee representing 33% of all coffee consumption in the United States.\n\n“I think most people believe wholeheartedly that the impact of these tariffs is going to be felt in the months ahead,” Ahearn said. “And the reason why is that production and manufacturing and the goods as they flow through the supply chain takes time.” Another cause for concern among business leaders was the unpredictable nature of the tariffs, with among the United States’ largest trading partners – Canada, China and Mexico – still negotiating with Trump as of Saturday, just days before tariffs are set to take effect.\n\nDoubt also exists among business leaders regarding countries that Trump has already reached a trade agreement with many of which are only verbal or exist solely on a single letter, with no clear commitments from both parties.\n\n“If you’re a business and you’ve got global supply chains and you’ve got to make investments, it really matters that some countries are still in negotiations and certain countries are not in negotiations,” said Mohamed El-Erian, chief economic adviser at the financial services company Allianz, speaking with Politico.\n\n“Where are Mexico and Canada gonna end up? We seem to know Vietnam, but do we really know Vietnam? It’s not clear yet.”\n\n[https://www.rawstory.com/tariffs-2673807387/](https://www.rawstory.com/tariffs-2673807387/)",

If businesses can take illegal advantage of workers, or customers, they will, especially if they think it's necessary for their survival or growth, or if they think they will be able to get away with it. Therefore customers should also take advantage of businesses, when it is in their self interest.

      "text": "Could tariffs have unintended consequences for small businesses while favoring larger corporations?\n\nReflecting on India's rapid economic changes in 2016-2017, such as demonetization and the introduction of GST, when many small businesses struggled to adapt. This transition led to a significant shift in market share toward larger corporations, as smaller players faced challenges they couldn't quickly overcome.\n\nAs the U.S. considers a new tariff structure, it’s worth examining whether similar effects could emerge. Small businesses, which make up over 99% of U.S. enterprises and play a crucial role in our economic landscape, often find it challenging to absorb additional costs or quickly adjust their supply chains in response to changes.\n\nThe key question for policymakers is how to design tariffs that support a balanced market. It’s essential to ensure that small businesses are not disproportionately affected, which could lead to increased market consolidation.\n\nFinal thought: How can policymakers ensure that the implementation of tariffs promotes fair competition and supports the resilience of small businesses? \n\nFor more insights, consider exploring the following sources:\n\n- Impact of demonetization & GST in India: Quartz India\n- Effects of tariffs on U.S. small businesses: U.S. Chamber of Commerce",

Its advanced algorithm, powering the addictive For You Page, has even helped users self-diagnose health issues like ADHD.\n* **Data Privacy**: Leaked reports suggest ByteDance employees in China accessed U.S. user data, contradicting TikTok’s claims of secure domestic storage. Critics warn of potential misuse by the Chinese government under China’s **National Intelligence Law**, which mandates data-sharing.\n* **Misinformation & Influence**: U.S. officials, including FBI Director Christopher Wray, have flagged TikTok as a tool for potential propaganda or disinformation campaigns.\n* **Economic Impact**: TikTok’s ad revenue of **$16B in 2023** and e-commerce features like TikTok Shop ($15B in small business revenue) make it indispensable to creators and businesses. But a ban could shift this ecosystem to U.S. platforms like Instagram Reels and YouTube Shorts.\n* **National Security vs. Free Speech**: TikTok argues that a ban infringes on First Amendment rights, while lawmakers emphasize the app’s potential threat to U.S. sovereignty.\n* **Creators & Businesses**: Over **7 million U.S. businesses** rely on TikTok for income, and creators could collectively lose **$1.3B monthly** if the app is banned.\n\nWith the Supreme Court set to hear TikTok’s case on January 10, and whispers of President-elect Trump possibly reversing his previous stance, the fate of TikTok remains uncertain.\n\nI did a detailed story covering the Tiktok Origins to its impact on US e-commerce and small businesses - [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqozG1ug6jw](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqozG1ug6jw)\n\nWhat’s your take?

      "text": "According to The Gaurdian:\n\nThe accompanying rhetoric, in each case, has called for collective sacrifice to the common good. Sir Keir and his chancellor, Rachel Reeves, speak of tough choices and trade-offs. Mr Bayrou last week instructed French voters that “everyone must participate in the effort” to reduce public debt, while refusing to countenance proposals for a 2% tax on very wealthy individuals. Mr Merz routinely lectures Germans on the need to work more.\n\nAccording to fool49:\n\nIn the same article it was reported that the collective wealth of the super rich grew by 500% in the last 15 years. But what do they mean by the super rich? The top n%? Those who have wealth over m euros? This is lazy reporting.\n\nI think that with many nations running large budget deficits, instead of reducing social welfare, they should extract wealth from the \"super rich\", like those who have wealth over hundred million dollars or equivalent. Wealth taxes, inheritance taxes, and high marginal income taxes to start with. The only sacrifice workers should accept is later retirement ages, to track rising lifespans.\n\nAnd also higher marginal taxes on the richest businesses, like those with over a hundred million dollars in annual profits. The implementation of a minimum global tax or to start with OECD tax, to end profit shifting to tax havens. Taxes should be paid where the business has operations or sales. Not only to where it is registered or has it headquarters. And in USA corporations pay much lower taxes as compared to other businesses, like partnerships and sole proprietorships. This should be corrected with higher taxes for corporations.\n\nReference: https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/jul/20/the-guardian-view-on-europes-failing-economic-orthodoxy-social-contracts-cannot-be-renewed-through-cuts",

Air Canada also said it was willing to pay flight attendants 50% of their wage for work done before planes take off, leading the union to reply that its members should be fully compensated for their labour.\n\nAbout 70% of the airline’s flight attendants are women, said Natasha Stea, a local union president and flight attendant. She questioned whether they were being treated fairly, given that Air Canada pilots, the vast majority of whom are men, received a significant raise last year.\n\nAccording to fool49:\n\nIt looks like the government is siding with big business, or Air Canada. The government is ordering an end to the strike and binding arbitration. Wages should generally keep pace with inflation, and all hours worked should be fully compensated. I don't know if arbitrators can look after the interests of flight attendants. \n\nReference: https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/aug/17/government-orders-striking-air-canada-flight-attendants-return-work",

      "text": "If lump of labor is a fallacy in the near term, then the mass tech layoffs should have triggered record business formation and record demand for tech workers. Or is lump of labor only a fallacy over a 20+ year period?\n\nAnd if productivity gains due to AI is lowering demand for tech workers, can we presume that productivity gains put downward pressure on employment and wages?\n\nI ask these questions because I hear a lot of questionable information from economists, economics professors, and grad students from prominent universities - on the news and on Reddit.",

      "text": "Often I'll enter a shop, pub or restaurant that's been where it has for a year or two, and I wonder how they are making any money. For example, there is a pub near me which has 4 or 5 customers in it most times, employs 5 staff all earning around £11 per hour (uk), presumably has to pay rent, utility bills, buy stock and other sorts of costs. Of course, if this was an isolated example, I could put it down to perhaps being owned by someone who can afford to lose money, but there are several such businesses near me. Several newsagents, a restaurant, barbershop which rarely has customers inside etc. Is there something I'm missing? Thanks",

Are there other sectors in Europe that can compete with these for salaries, or is this just the way the economy works there? Curious to hear your thoughts or experiences!",

      "text": "Hello everyone,\n\nI'm about to begin my master thesis in Finance and I'm a bit undecided on the theme. I was wondering if you think any of these topics have enough \"juice\" and information about them or if they've been talked about enough. Below are some of the possibilities:\n\n\\-The effect of microfinance in decreasing inequality\n\n\\-The long term effect of Private equity in companies after they're taken over\n\n\\-Different hedge fund strategies and how they've fared in uncertainty (post 2008 crisis, Covid, tariffs, etc.)\n\nI'm leaning towards the last theme but I'm worried due to lack of transparency by hedge funds that this is a topic with little information available.\n\nThanks in advance.",

With the failure of austerity in Europe after the global financial crisis, it looks like the pendulum has swung in the other direction. The pandemic has emboldened governments to run large fiscal deficits, and after they have become fatter, they are unwilling to go on a diet.\n\nReference: https://www.reuters.com/markets/swiss-finance-minister-chides-us-europe-over-time-bomb-debt-levels-2024-08-24/",

      "text": "In Africa, one of the biggest challenges for financing consumer goods is the lack of trust in banks, which leads many people to avoid keeping their money there altogether. For those who can afford big-ticket items—like the latest iPhone or a new car—the common approach is to save up and pay in cash.\n\n\n\nApplying for credit is tough, too. Banks often require formal proof of employment, utility bills with a home address, and a stable income level. But with so many people working informal jobs and a lack of standardized addressing systems, meeting these requirements is nearly impossible for a large portion of the population.\n\n\n\nCould innovative financing solutions boost the economy by promoting more consumption and easing access to credit?",

The Kazan Declaration notes the benefits of faster, low cost, more efficient, transparent, safe and inclusive cross-border payment instruments. The guiding principle would be minimal trade barriers and non-discriminatory access.\nEstablishment of a cross-border payment system. The declaration encourages correspondent banking networks within Brics, and enabling settlements in local currencies in line with the Brics Cross-Border Payments Initiative. This is voluntary and nonbinding and is to be discussed further.\nCreation of an enhanced role for the New Development Bank, such as promoting infrastructure and sustainable development.\nA proposed Brics Grain Exchange, to improve food security through enhanced trade in agricultural commodities.\nAll nine Brics+ countries committed themselves to the principles of the UN Charter—peace and security, human rights, the rule of law, and development—primarily as a response to the western unilateral sanctions.\"\n\nThe article claims that the BRICS+ countries don't have much in common, and they don't have shared valued. Well, it is not an exclusive club for democracies. It contains theocracies, monarchies, authoritarian states, and democracies.\n\nWell they are all commited to human rights and rule of law. The human rights are a type of shared values. They are mostly countries from the global south. No Western country is a member. So they do have much in common. \n\nI am hoping for more political and economic integration. Including a convention on human rights, and reduction of trade barriers. And also academic cooperation with student and professor exchange, and research cooperation and knowledge sharing. They have already discussed and planned trade and financial cooperation.\n\nReference: https://phys.org/news/2024-10-brics-world-lacks-values-identity.html",

      "title": "John Maynard Keynes' 1942 Address: How Much Does Finance Matter?",
      "text": "The whole [speech/essay](https://www.bradford-delong.com/2020/05/john-maynard-keynes-how-much-does-finance-matter.html) is worth reading but the following two extracts are fantastic and we all would do well to benefit in the modern era from their wisdom.\n\nFirstly, on the crucial observation that finance for the \"community as a whole\" (macroeconomy) is never the issue - it's the real resources available that should be marshalled and understood:\n\n>HOW MUCH DOES FINANCE MATTER?\n\n>For some weeks at this hour you have enjoyed the day-dreams of planning. But what about the nightmare of finance? I am sure there have been many listeners who have been muttering: 'That's all very well, but how is it to be paid for?'\n\n>Let me begin by telling you how I tried to answer an eminent architect who pushed on one side all the grandiose plans to rebuild London with the phrase: ' Where's the money to come from?' 'The money?' I said. 'But surely, Sir John, you don't build houses with money? Do you mean that there won't be enough bricks and mortar and steel and cement?'\n\n>'Oh no', he replied, 'of course there will be plenty of all that'.\n\n>'Do you mean', I went on,' that there won't be enough labour? For what will the builders be doing if they are not building houses?'\n\n>'Oh no, that's all right', he agreed.\n\n>'Then there is only one conclusion. You must be meaning, Sir John, that there won't be enough architects'. But there I was trespassing on the boundaries of politeness. So I hurried to add: 'Well, if there are bricks and mortar and steel and concrete and labour and architects, why not assemble all this good material into houses?'\n\n>But he was, I fear, quite unconvinced. 'What I want to know', he repeated, 'is where the money is coming from'.\n\n>To answer that would have got him and me into deeper water than I cared for, so I replied rather shabbily: ' The same place it is coming from now'. He might have countered (but he didn't): 'Of course I know that money is not the slightest use whatever. But, all the same, my dear sir, you will find it a devil of a business not to have any'.\n\n\n\nSecondly at the end of his speech on the \"vile doctrine of the 19th century\" where economics had (and still is) forgotten what it is for - to embellish the lives in the round of all those people whom its study and application serve:\n\n>Where we are using up resources, do not let us submit to the vile doctrine of the nineteenth century that every enterprise must justify itself in pounds, shillings and pence of cash income, with no other denominator of values but this. I should like to see that war memorials of this tragic struggle take the shape of an enrichment of the civic life of every great centre of population.\n\n>Why should we not set aside, let us say, £50 millions a year for the next twenty years to add in every substantial city of the realm the dignity of an ancient university or a European capital to our local schools and their surroundings, to our local government and its offices, and above all perhaps, to provide a local centre of refreshment and entertainment with an ample theatre, a concert hall, a dance hall, a gallery, a British restaurant, canteens, cafes and so forth.\n\n>Assuredly we can afford this and much more. Anything we can actually do we can afford. Once done, it is there. Nothing can take it from us. We are immeasurably richer than our predecessors. Is it not evident that some sophistry, some fallacy, governs our collective action if we are forced to be so much meaner than they in the embellishments of life?\n\n>Yet these must be only the trimmings on the more solid, urgent and necessary outgoings on housing the people, on reconstructing industry and transport and on re-planning the environment of our daily life. Not only shall we come to possess these excellent things. With a big programme carried out at a properly regulated pace we can hope to keep employment good for many years to come. We shall, in very fact, have built our New Jerusalem out of the labour which in our former vain folly we were keeping unused and unhappy in enforced idleness.",

      "text": "# Promises, promises, and outright lies; Trump, the Republicans, and how they conned you out of your vote.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile Trump and the Republicans promised to cut electricity and energy prices in half within twelve months, just the opposite is proving true. As always, every guarantee from the administration and their panderers in Congress about anything turns to ash as soon as they secure the votes from gullible citizens.\n\nThey promised not to touch Medicare benefits for the disabled and indigent, then reversed their promise and did just that. They promised not to slash Medicare benefits, yet the Big, Beautiful, BS Bill lays the groundwork to do just that. They promised vet benefits were sacrosanct, now. they too, are being slashed to the bone.\n\nThey promised more effective government, but in order to fund obscene tax cuts for the wealthy, they have hollowed out our government, fired hundreds of thousands of critical workers leaving us susceptible to new pandemics because medical research in now in the hands of a mad man, susceptible to infiltration from enemy spies because the FBI is under the control of a partisan hack, susceptible to sudden raging storms because weather forecasting has been reduced to the amount of arthritic pain in Trump's knees, and our civil rights under direct attack from roving bands of masked thugs reminiscent of the days of Hitler's Germany.\n\nThey conned you with lies, promises, and a wink at white nationalists and religious fanatics, and still the ask for your vote,\n\nSee this:\n\nElectricity prices are soaring under Donald Trump\n\nStory by Joe Edwards •\n\nElectricity prices across the United States have been climbing in 2025, despite President Donald Trump's repeated pledges to reduce energy costs. Ahead of last year's election, Trump said in an opinion piece for Newsweek that his administration would \"cut energy and electricity prices in half within 12 months\" for both businesses and American families. He has blamed former President Joe Biden's administration for contributing to energy price hikes.\n\nWhat To Know\n\nAccording to U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) data, the average price of electricity per kilowatt-hour has risen from $0.179 in January to $0.190 as of June—an increase of around 6 percent. Between January and February, prices remained steady, according to BLS data. But between February and April, prices rose slightly to $0.181, and then marginally again in May to $0.182. According to the BLS's data, prices then jumped noticeably in June to $0.190.\n\nAnalysts previously indicated that a spike in natural-gas prices, surging loads from artificial intelligence-driven data centers triggering multibillion-dollar capacity charges, and an aging, congested grid were among the reasons Americans could see higher energy and electricity prices this summer. Analysis by Reuters noted that household energy costs have risen at a rate more than twice that of overall consumer price inflation between June 2024 and 2025.\n\nJust When We Need It the Most, Air Conditioning Could Become Unaffordable\n\nThe Financial Times reported that electricity costs in the U.S.'s largest power market are set to hit a record high, driven by surging demand for AI data centers and delays in new power plant construction. Grid operator PJM reported a 22 percent increase in procurement costs to $329.17 per megawatt-day, totaling $16.1 billion for the period from June 2026 to May 2027, representing a 10 percent annual rise, it said. Consumers may see their energy bills increase by one to five percent, depending on how utilities and states pass on the costs, the Financial Times reported.\n\n\"Economic growth is driving a massive uptick in electricity demand. Existing supply has been leaving the system due primarily to state and federal decarbonization policies and some economics,\" a spokesperson for PJM told Newsweek. \"As to new supply, PJM has studied and approved 46,000 MW (enough to power about 40 million homes) that have been slow to construct due to reasons outside of PJM's control, including global supply chain, state/federal permitting and financing challenges. \"As of June 2025, there are approximately 63,000 MW in projects that will be studied and approved over the next 18 months that we hope will actually construct. In any market, when demand is up and supply is down, there will be an increase in pricing. PJM has been warning of this eventuality for several years now, specifically as it relates to the impact of these supply/demand fundamentals on our ability to reliably operate the power grid.\"\n\nWhat People Are Saying\n\nPresident Donald Trump, in a Newsweek opinion piece published October 1, 2024: \"We will cut energy and electricity prices in half within 12 months—not just for businesses but for all Americans and their families, and we will quickly double our electricity capacity, which we need to do to compete with China and other countries on Artificial Intelligence. With the lowest energy prices on earth, we will attract energy-hungry industries from all over the planet and millions of blue-collar jobs.\"\n\n[https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/markets/electricity-prices-are-soaring-under-donald-trump/ar-AA1JcrXr](https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/markets/electricity-prices-are-soaring-under-donald-trump/ar-AA1JcrXr)",

      "title": "Why Trump had to stop - Text Wall edition (spoiler: its not about China).",
      "text": "After Trump stared straight into the eyes of Xi and kept raising tariff percentages, he finally folded when he made the annoucement that all tariffs will be put on hold for 90 days and all other tariffs will be kept down to 10% (but 125% for China). Here are a few key take aways:\n\n* 125% for China barely matters. For the stuff that America cannot do without, double the price means passing the cost on to consumers. For the stuff that America consider are luxuries, China can and has always been side stepping tariffs via secondary markets like Vietnam, Mexico or Canada. They will figure out a way to pay the minimum tariff imposed. Will it reduce their trade? Definitely, but its a fraction of a fraction of a percent in their GDP.\n* 90 day pause is a 'face saving' way of saying he retracts his policy, because otherwise is to annouce a complete surrender (even tho this is already pretty close). If he make any indication he will 'restart' the tariff keffufle we went over last week, then it is a good time to prepare (read as: get out get out get out) before that time comes. Which means that entities that has money in the market that is risk averse (or just Trump averse) will be thinking about the best time to sell, cut losses, and scoot into a market that can operate even if America crashes and burns.\n* China is confident it could win (other than the cultural element of fighting to the end) is directly because that Trump's entire leverage over the rest of the world is an annual spending of approximately 3 trillion USD in imports and he is putting up tariffs as a threat to stop the US from spending this 3 trillion a year on foreign economies (to buy their stuff). Out of this 3 trillion, about 500 billion is spent on China and 2.5 trillion is spent on the rest of the world. So China is assured that that America will be hurting its other trading partners disproportionally. Now the tariffs will not achieve a compete end of all imports, it most likely won't even achieve a stop on the majority. But even in the worst case sceanrio that Trump cuts of all imports from the rest of the world in say, 3 years, then China is confident in the long run it can entirely replace the 3 trillion surplus demand and step in and began digesting these surplus supply, cutting America out and achieving a reverse economic isolation (self imposed no less) and have America achieve USSR-rification. \n* After a certain high % of tariff, numbers cease to have meaning. Its effectively a trade embargo and raising rates is less about economics than it is about politics. Numbers show less economic policy finess rather than attitude of the leader.\n\nNow, lets take a moment away from the tariffs and have a basic review of the US economy. US economy needs to give out USD, because if we want the other countries to use our dollar, then we need to give them enough USD to trade with us, but also trade with other people using our money. This can be done in two main ways, lending, and deficits. For countries that need capital investment, we lend them USD and they use it to buy shovels and cement and machinaries on the global market, for countries that runs a surplus with us, we give them USD and they give us goods (like China) so they can use that USD to buy other stuff from other countries (like China buys soy beans from brazil in USD). \n\nNow the key about USD is that like any currency its based on trust, foundamentally on trust. Even in the old Bretton Woods system where the dollar was pegged to gold, it was actually still based on trust because the rest of the world 'trusted' America to actually have enough gold reserves to back all its currency (and not to do dodgy stuff like issue too much currency and secretly sell off gold). Today, it is based on the trust in the US government's ability to continue as a stable government, to collect taxes, and to honour its debts. America borrows to the tune of 36 trillion but lenders continue to lend because they 'trust' America will at a minimum honour its debts and repay the interest on such debt. The debtor holder also 'trust' the American government to be stable enough to be around so that even if America never repay the principle of the debt, the debt holder can sell the debt to another person who is happy to collect interest for awhile.\n\nChina does this. Or as we could say now, China use to have no problem with this arrangement. It sells lots of stuff to the US, collect their USD, uses the USD to buy US debt (in the form of government issued bonds, this is important), and collect their bond returns (called 'yield'). China does this so that their massive stock pile of USD is generating yield (instead of sitting in a pile and losing value via inflation) and China use to enjoy having America be its massive consumer, so its happy to provide the USD to the US and earn it back via exports again. US is also happy to do this because its like a credit card, it can make money importing Chinese products and just run up the tab where no one really expect US to pay the principle, just service the interest, then let the bonds trade on the open market. \n\nBy this point, you might see the 'trust' problem. Normally, in a stock market crash, investors take their money out of stocks which are considered 'unsafe' and put them in US government bonds, so that it is 'safe', as it is a foundamental belief that regardless of how crappy the US economy is, the US government will be able to honor its bonds and pay yield on time. Because of the strength and continuance of the US government, US debt is literally the thing that gives USD value and it is the most foundamental unit upon which the entire financial market is built upon. Because if you can no longer sell US debt to another willing buyer and needs to wait for the US to generate enough income to pay the interest and the principle on the debt, it is basically mathematically impossible for the current US govenrment to do that (especially considering the US government runs deficits, always.)\n\nSince last week, after Trump's annoucement of tariffs, strange stuff started happening. US stock market crashed as expected main street business prospects had declined in anticipation of tariffs. Yet we did not see this money from sold stocks move into bonds (government debt) or other safe assets like gold. We saw gold drop 9%, we saw petroleum also fall in price (not helped by the OPEC+ annoucement of increase in production). This meant only one thing, that people were selling both stocks (and taking a loss) and selling their safe assets (for liquid USD). We don't know why, but it could be for many reasons. it could be that some traders needed liquidity to shore up their insurance, or pay out some of its more.. adventureous positions but did not want to sell all stocks because it may amplify the loss. It could be because a foreign government is selling to get liquid USD to rescue its own stock market (looking at you Japan). It could be in anticipation of reciprocal tariffs and moving cash back to their owners domestic jurisdiction (looking at you, EU). It could be that a foreign country is selling its US debt to free up its hands to fight a proper trade war (like China), or it could be worse and more foundamental issue: people were losing fatih in the US government, in US debt, in bonds, and wanted to relocate their holdings to a different market. \n\nThe US bond market has a automatic mechanism to account for rises and dips. The yield rate fluctuates. When a lot of people wants to buy US debt, then the US government does not need to provide a high rate of yield. but if not a lot of people wants to buy US debt, then the US government need to increase yield (as in the amount of interest you earn holding the debt) to make it more lucrative for potential buyers. Last night, the US bond market yield rate responded to the sudden drop in 'trust' in US debt and increased rapidly. Both the 10 year treasury bonds and the 30 year treasury bonds went up by about 0.5%, which seems low, but recall that the FED makes a bit deal to cut rates or increase rates by 'basis points'. 0.5% is 50 basis points and it rose rapidly in response to the selling.\n\nThis causes a liquidity problem. As previous stated, the US government always wants to sell more US debt for USD (and use this dollar for spending purposes). Most funds, investors and other governments holds US debt as a 'safe asset'. In the market of the US debt, traded between debt holder and someone who has liquid USD looking to become a debt holder, when there are too many sellers and not enough buyers, it means that suddenly no one can convert their 'safe assset' in to liquid USD, and if these asset holder would hypothetically need some quick cash to pay their position or shore up their insurance, or even to finance their trade or whatever, then the drying up of liquidity will cause a collapse. These holders will have to cut prices on these bonds to attract buyers, cause a yield spike (for the US government, another seller, to compete), and suddenly the bedrock upon which the US financial market is based upon, collapses.\n\nThis spike in bond yield is what spooked Trump and got him to reverse course. There are now reports in the news about this 'spike' and all sorts of crisis headlines but I have not seen any of them that explains why this is a problem. It is also why about mid night, trump started doing his PANICAN and CHILL tweets, and why they werent sleeping despite the Chinese has settled at 84% tariffs. \n\nSide note is that Trump originally planned and pushed the FED to cut rates to lessen the contractionary effects of his tariff policies. He called for this via tweet (like everything else he does). But if he does cut rates, then there is an even less reason for capital to remain in the US which will amplify the liquidity issue. Yield on debt and interest rates are basically tied, you cannot have high of one and low of the other. \n\nWhat would be the consequences of US debt markets running out of liquidity and blowing up in a spectacular manner? Well, to start we would see a historic collapse of both the stock market and the bond market, meaning America would effective immediately go into the mother of all depressions. It could mean that America have to balloon its debt even higher and go above 40 trillion. But worse still, if the problem is with 'trust' and America can no longer be trusted with everyone's liquid money, it could mean that America can no longer borrow enough to keep financing its current economic model and have to default on its debt, which could well mean the end of the American brand of capitalism. \n\nHow close did we get? I don't know. But I do know that most macro-economists can fairly confidentally tell you if the rate spike continued and Trump did not reverse his decision, America would be kaputz before the end of this week. Whether that would be in the morning before the rest of America woke up on 'tariff night' or it would be a day or so, I cannot say.\n\nWhy did it come to this? The loss in trust in the US government can be partly traced to Trump (duhhh) but there is also a more foundamental problem. If US government always borrows more and only intends to service the interest on its debts, then the logical breaking point is when the interest on existing debt exceeds America's ability to generate more money. In a Ponzi scheme, the whole scheme starts collapsing if the Ponzi scheme have to pay out more money to its creditors compared to the amount of money it can get from fresh 'investors' in the scheme. This year, with interest rate at say 4.5% on a debt of 36 trillion, the net interest is about 1.8 trillion. And America issues about 2 trillion worth of fresh debt each year, meaning the American Ponzi scheme is getting to that point. Once the tariffs piss off China to stop lending to America, and the rest of the world start selling US debt to 'fend for itself' in a Trump induced trade recession, then no double America would likely have to cross over this threshold to stimulate its economy, or at a minimum, keep the US economy liquid as the rest of the debt holders jump ship.\n\nWhat could the US government do? To be honest, not much. However, the FED probably should commence quantitative easing immediately and print more money, step into the US debt market and just  be the buyer of last resort. Give out liquidity to ensure there is not a sudden 'dry' that forces debt holders to go under and get the yield back under control. Whether or not this happened? I don't know, but it looks like America made it through the night in one piece, this time.",

I hope these problems have been overcome, for training AI models on Huawei chips. At the very least, inference can be run for DeepSeek on domestic chips.\n\nWhile US tech and chip companies have corrected, with single digit stock price reductions, Chinese chip companies have made gains of over ten percent.\n\nIf you are a believer in tech and AI, to diversify and hedge your bets, you should at the very least be invested in both China and USA. And in the long term, I think India is going to catch up. Europe has a large and rich market, but there is a large regulatiory burden, but if they focus on capital market integration, semiconductor industrial policy, and reduction of regulations, they are another market to look at for tech and AI \n\nReference: Financial Times",

      "text": "According to Foreign Affairs:\n\nThe United States does retain its advantage over China in several critical areas: software, biotech, and AI, as well as in its university-driven innovation ecosystem. But these institutions face an uncertain future. Since returning to office, Trump has set about defunding scientific research and depriving the country of skilled labor. Government agencies are now scrutinizing top universities, including Harvard and Columbia, and yanking government grants and threatening to revoke universities’ tax-exempt status over exaggerated charges of anti-Semitism. The White House has slashed funding for the National Science Foundation and the National Institutes of Health. Meanwhile, Trump’s hostility toward immigrants has driven researchers who would come to the United States to look for positions at companies and universities elsewhere. Aggressive deportations are hurting America’s construction industry. The country simply has not set up its innovation ecosystem well for the years ahead.\n\nAccording to fool49:\n\nChina needs to focus more on services to keep growing. While I believe that manufacturing goods that compete on price, will not lead to a competitive advantage in USA. Countries such as Vietnam and India, can benefit from low cost manufacturing for export, provided they can solve the problems with high American tarrifs, as USA remains one of the largest export markets and manufacturing outsourcers.\n\nIn the modern world, we are moving towards an information economy. Where the largest companies are driven by intangible assets, like brand value, patents, human capital, and software. There is no going back. Eventually energy and material intensity of products and services will start declining at a faster rate than GDP growth, even as workforce growth stalls. Also with the implementation of a circular economy, the economy will continue to dematerialize.\n\nGrowth will be in chips, AI, clean tech, biotech, and robotics, among others. Economies also need to invest in their possibly shrinking workforce, and degrading infrastructure, especially in developed economies. And not be left behind in digital infrastructure.\n\nReference: Foreign Affairs",

If prices go up too high, and people stop buying products, don't they have to come back down? A good example is the recent change to the McDonald's menu. They are attempting to regain their position one of the least expensive fast food options. So my question is why do we hear that this is never possible, or if it happens, it is bad news?",

This resident of Hockessin has succeeded in blocking even his/her street address from appearing online. And is now part of a group blocking affordable housing.*  \n  \nI have sooooo been waiting for this article (link below). Hunting for it, off and on, for months. America’s most famous politicians - who were advocates for affordable housing while in office - then block it the instant they return to private life. Case in point – residents of the toney enclaves of Hockessin and Yorklyn in Northern Delaware have bypassed county and other officials, to get affordable housing cancelled near their neighborhoods. And they appealed right to their governor – Matt Meyer – who is NOT a millionaire and DOESN’T live in a palatial mansion behind an iron gate. Let’s see how this goes. Mr. Meyer was just elected in 2024, so he might feel he can blow off these future campaign contributors for now. Or maybe the conversations and contributions predate the election?  \n  \nI get it . . . if you’re a billionaire heir to the DuPont fortune or the Gore treasure trove (WL Gore company, inventor of Gore-tex) you absolutely value your privacy. Biden does too. I dare you to try and drive down Biden's street. Just try. You can’t even turn onto that road unless you’re an actual resident. There is a 24/7 secret service enclave. You’d have better like driving by Oprah’s or Bezos’ estate. And probably a LOT more people have a beef with them, than with the former president.  \n  \nOkay, so someone COULD carve out a few hundred acres around Biden’s retirement home, and keep the proletariat at bay until he kicks it. But there’s a LOT of additional area which the residents want off limits. Their latest tactic is to claim their communities are “historic\" villages.  \n  \nI’d be sympathetic to this ploy if anyone was actually trying to tear down a mansion, historic or otherwise. But the land in question is completely undeveloped. Just green space. Rich people love green space. If you have millions or billions, green space around your home may be the most important part of your life. Other than your stock portfolio.  \n  \nToday's column is of course about the intersection of “wealth privilege” and “political hypocrisy”. The DuPonts, the Gores, the Bidens, the Astors, the Carnegies, the Fords . . . they will assert their ancestors are the ones who made America great. And that as descendants they deserve an exemption from the rules, to protect their buffer zones. The rest of us - people going to their jobs every day as teachers, police, nurses, and even restaurant help - will tell you they just want an affordable place to live. This dispute could go either way . . .  \n  \nI’m just sayin’ . . .  \n  \n  \n  \n[**Residents call on Delaware Govenor to halt reckless development - Brightgram**](https://brightgram.com/wilmington-de/8297181/residents-call-on-delaware-govenor-to-halt-reckless-development/)",

USA is increasing tarrifs. I think the impact in USA will be most felt by the lower to lower middle class. While in India the impact will be most felt by the middle class.\n\nI don't think the current US administration is looking after the interests of most people. Most adults in USA drink. People have the right to relax with the drink of their choice in their free time. While I am discussing whisky, the price of most imported European alcohol will go up.\n\nReference: https://www.reuters.com/world/us/how-us-alcohol-tariffs-may-hurt-some-businesses-hike-prices-americans-2025-08-21/",
