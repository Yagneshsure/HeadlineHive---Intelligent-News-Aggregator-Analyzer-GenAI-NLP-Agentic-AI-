I'm a 26-year-old progressive running for Congress in [Illinois' Ninth District](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illinois%27s_9th_congressional_district) because (1) I think there's a new way we can do politics and (2) *Democrats aren't -- and haven't been -- doing enough.* A little bit about me:\n\n>I am an expert in far-right narratives and misinformation, having worked at outlets like Media Matters, Mother Jones, and Zeteo News, both in research and original reporting capacities. My video explainers about right-wing BS have amassed tens of millions of views across platforms (here's my [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/@katmabu) and [TikTok](https://www.tiktok.com/@katmabu) for anyone interested). I'm also often targeted by the right. Elon Musk has personal beef with me, along with Tucker Carlson, Laura Loomer, Libs of TikTok, and a bunch of other unhinged figures who now control our most important institutions.\n\n>I decided to run for Congress because I got sick of waiting around for the Democratic Party, our supposed opposition party, to actually *do something*. I want to use my expertise to properly resist Trump's authoritarian agenda and my lived experience to push for a bolder vision that prioritizes working Americans over billionaires.\n\n>**We are a grassroots campaign.** We raised more than $400,000 in our first two weeks, have over 11,000 individual donors, and our average donation is around $33. Oh, and we're taking **no** corporate cash. Best of all, our money isn't getting wasted on consultants and pricey ads. We're using it for public service projects and making sure our events, outreach, and mutual aid efforts are accessible to *everyone* in the district, regardless of income.\n\nIf you want to know more about me and what I believe, you can go to [katforillinois.com](http://katforillinois.com/). And if you want to help us support our community \\*and\\* win an election, you can [donate here](https://secure.actblue.com/donate/abu-ama).\n\nOkay, that's enough yapping. Ask me anything!!\n\n[PROOF](https://bsky.app/profile/katmabu.bsky.social/post/3lmfxf6yns227)\n\nEDIT: Thank you to everyone who came and asked questions! I'm so sorry I couldn't get to every single person but if you're in the district and I didn't answer your question, drop us a line at [hello@katforillinois.com](mailto:hello@katforillinois.com) or come to one of our events! We'll be announcing more soon. Thank you again!!",

      "text": "In recent politics there have been two major political pushes for diversity and equality.  However, both instances led to backlashes that have led to an environment that is arguably worse than it was before.  In 2008 Obama was the first black president one a massive wave of hope for racial equality and societal reforms.  This led to one of the largest political backlashes in modern politics in 2010, to which  democrats have yet to fully recover from.  This eventually led to birtherism which planted some of the original seeds of both Trump and MAGA. The second massive political push promoting diversity and equality was in 2018 with the modern woman election and 2020 with racial equality being a top priority.  Biden made diversifying the government a top priority.  This led to an extreme backlash among both culture and politics with anti-woke and anti-DEI efforts.  This resent contributed to Trump retaking the presidency.  Now Trump is pushing to remove all mentions of DEI in both the private and public sectors.  He is hiding all instances that highlight any racial or gender successes.  His administration is pushing culture to return to a world prior to the civil rights era.  \n\nThis leads me to my question.  Will there be a backlash for this?  How will it occur?  How can democrats lead and take advantage of the backlash while trying to mitigate a backlash to their own movement?  It seems as though every attempt has led to a stronger and more severe response.  \n\nAdditional side questions.  How did public opinion shift so drastically from 2018/2020 which were extremely pro-equality to 2024 which is calling for a return of the 1950s?",

      "title": "How did the generation that once created powerful political protest music come to embrace Trump?",
      "text": "In the 1960s and 1970s, music was a powerful tool for political expression and protest. Songs like Bob Dylan's \"The Times They Are A-Changin'\", Edwin Starr’s \"War\", and The Beatles’ \"Revolution\" became anthems for change, speaking directly to the injustices of the time — civil rights struggles, the Vietnam War, and economic inequality. These songs echoed a collective desire for progress and a better future.\n\nFast forward to today, and many members of the Baby Boomer generation—the very ones who helped create this powerful music—are now among the most ardent supporters of Donald Trump. This is especially striking considering how much of the political activism and social consciousness of the 60s and 70s was a direct reaction to authoritarianism, injustice, and the excesses of the elite.\nSome examples of iconic political songs from that era:\n\n\t•\tBob Dylan – \"The Times They Are A-Changin’\" (1964): This song captured the essence of the 1960s political shift, urging people to embrace change and fight for justice.\n\n\t•\tEdwin Starr – \"War\" (1970): A powerful anti-Vietnam War anthem that called out the horrors of conflict and questioned the motives behind it.\n\n\t•\tThe Beatles – \"Revolution\" (1968): A song that challenged the status quo and called for a revolutionary change, reflective of the broader counterculture movements of the time.\n\n\t•\tBuffalo Springfield – \"For What It’s Worth\"(1966): A protest song addressing the social unrest and growing tension in the country, often interpreted as a critique of government repression.\n\nThese songs weren’t just catchy tunes; they were calls to action, social commentary, and even direct criticism of the establishment.\nSo, here’s the question: How did a generation that pushed for progressive political change through their music end up aligning with a political figure whose rhetoric and policies seem to contrast so starkly with the values of the 60s and 70s?\n\nIs it a case of cultural nostalgia clouding their judgment? A result of shifting political landscapes? Or has there been a fundamental change in values and priorities within this group?\n\nHow can the generation that created and embraced these songs now support someone like Trump? Was it the power of the political system or the media that shifted their perspectives, or something deeper? What do you all think?",

Assume nothing much changes between now and November, if Trump manages to defeat Harris, what will be the political headline story of why he accomplished it and thwarted Democrats with their replacement switch to Kamala?\n\nWill it be a reserved undercurrent of change from Biden, even if he is no longer running for re-election, but Harris is tied to his administration? May it be the hidden favorability Trump gained from being shot at and nearly assassinated? Will it be Harris being unwilling to literally meet the press in terms of having many interviews and press conferences that make voters weary of her campaign policies? It might just be that voters want Trump for one final term as president and then go back to normal elections.\n\nWhat do you think will be the narrative as to that reason why voters elected Trump should it happen?",

Clearly we're not at that point yet, as the majority party is pursuing both tax cuts AND spending increases.\n\nI specifically wonder about DEFENSE spending - this seems to be the one area that nobody dares to cut, but it seems to be the biggest area that we could cut back on.\n\nEDIT: I am *not* talking about the debt ceiling.

      "text": "On July 5, billionaire Elon Musk took to X to announce the creation of a new political party: the \"America Party,\" which, in Musk's words, \"actually represents the 80% in the middle.\" It's certainly a bold move for Musk, who, just a few months ago, donated millions of dollars to Donald Trump in an effort to support his presidential campaign. Since then, however, Musk's relationship with Trump has quickly deteriorated, leading to a very public feud in which the two exchanged insults and revelations about one another.\n\nEven before July 5, Musk had openly mused about forming his own political party--for example, he created multiple X polls on the idea, of which each garnered over a million votes. Some election pollsters went as far as to survey Americans about whether they would support such a party, to which nearly one-quarter of respondents said they would be at least somewhat likely to do so. While third-parties in the U.S. have historically failed to gain significant traction, the \"America Party\" seems to be polling considerably better than previous efforts. Combined with Musk's substantial resources, this raises questions about its potential impact on the political landscape.\n\nSo, what do you think? Is the \"America Party\" already set up for doom (i.e.: they receive a minuscule portion of the vote), or does it have the potential to disrupt the so-called \"Republican-Democratic uniparty,\" as Musk calls it? Will it merely split the conservative vote by swaying right-leaning independents away from the GOP, or could it turn the next election into a competitive three-way race? And what might this mean for Democrats and others across the aisle?",

Romney was the last GOP candidate to push for a both sides solution and Biden/Harris was the last Dem platform to push a both sides solution. In both cases the side that appealed to their base beat the side that catered to the “both sides” narrative. Their losses only seem to push the narrative that the average voter cares about expressing their grievances rather than meeting those politically opposed halfway. I feel the next few presidential elections will be about turning out base voters rather than finding the median position among all voters due to the current political climate.",

Other than a brief moment in 2011 with Occupy, the 2014/2020 BLM protests, and the women’s march at Trump’s first inauguration there have been little protest movements. Why did they happen so much more in the early 1900s and the 1960s? Are people less educated now than back then despite access to better resources? In general I just am confused why there is so much apathy when something such as a general strike involving tens of millions WOULD be so effectual? Is it organizational issues?",

      "text": "RCV means that instead of voting for one candidate, candidates are ranked -- who is the first choice, who is second, who third, etc. When votes are counted, a candidate receiving 50% or more of the votes immediately wins. If no candidate receives 50%, then the second choice of votes which supported the candidate with the fewest votes are given to the other candidates -- and so on for other candidates with lower vote totals until one candidate gets 50%. For example, in the 2004 presidential election in Florida, Bush received 2,912,790 votes, Gore 2,912,253 (a margin of 537 votes) and Ralph Nader received 97,488. If there had been RCV, the second choice of Nader voters would have been distributed between Bush and Gore.\n\nRCV advocates suggest that RCV allows a greater range of candidates and political parties while freeing voters from worrying whether they should vote for a candidate with a better chance of winning rather than a less popular candidate who they would really prefer. In addition, since candidates must compete for second-choice support from their opponents’ supporters they will have less incentive to run negative campaigns. \n\nRCV is used in Alaska, Nebraska (for the state legislature) and in many U.S. cities. Would it be beneficial to use more widely? What obstacles would prevent its wider adoption?",

This was not the case last year when the Liberals were falling behind in polls by double digits.

You can imagine a scenario where Trump's tariffs makes Canadians further sour on the Liberals and they drop further down in polling as incumbents. But that didn't happen, and the opposite occurred (as shown by polls). \n\nSo why did the Liberals benefit politically from Trump's threats but not the Conservatives?

      "text": "There's been a lot of things done by or for this administration that the vast majority of Americans disagree with. And there's now a long long list of reforms that aren't quite \"sexy\" enough to make it to a party platform or campaign obligation. (Like the supreme Court may come up, but impeaching Aileen Cannon probably won't.)\n\nI think we need to start holding elected officials accountable on the big stuff and little stuff. Trump cut taxes on the rich, is any Democrat going to campaign on increasing taxes on the donors they're trying to lure in? Probably not. Biden extended Trump's tax cuts on the rich, I expect the same will happen after this administration. \n\nSo should we as the public be keeping a list to keep our politians focused on what we want done? If so what are the items that should make the list?",

After 2019 defeat, Labour Party under new leader Keir Starmer witnessed a major rightward shift that saw the New Labour Blairites returning to dominance within the party. Corbyn was suspended from the party in 2020 in an antisemitism controversy and formally expelled in 2024 prior to the election.\n\nIn 2024 election, Labour swept back to power with the largest majority since 2001. However, critics on the left have long criticised Keir Starmer and his current Labour Party as being \"right-wing\" \"and \"Tories in red ties\". On the right, the right-wing populist Reform Party has siphoned large amount of voters from the Conservative and is now leading in the polls.\n\nYesterday, Corbyn and another independent ex-Labour MP Zarah Sultana announced the formation of a new left-wing political party focused on massive redistribution of wealth and power to \"take on the rich and powerful\" and support for Gaza.\n\nThe new party does not have an official name yet and its interim name is \"Your Party\". Many people have compared its policy platform to that of the Green Party. and voiced concern that it could benefit Reform by splitting the left vote.\n\nWhat do you think will be the impacts of this new political party on the increasingly volatile British political landscape?",

Once amplified by Redditors, the backlash against Musk has spread to the mainstream, where disapproval of Musk can be seen in the declining sales of Tesla cars, the fallen stock price and more recently protests and boycotts that have in some cases led to vandalism, arson, fire-bombings and other acts of domestic terrorism.\n\nIn response to these incidents, Trump and the DOJ have beefed up support for Tesla and have vowed to prosecute anyone who attacks a Tesla car or dealership with harsh penalties, including up to 20 years in prison. While some on Left and democrats in general haven't explicitly advocated for violence against Tesla, many have also cheered those who have done it or at least excused it.\n\nWhat are the political implications of the Left being associated with violent acts against Tesla and not just peaceful protests? How should Democratic politicians respond? How should Republican respond? Will the protests/violence against Tesla increase or decrease in the near future?",

The graph shows 93 percent of Democrats believe climate change is happening, but only 43 percent of Republicans age 55+.\n\nI regularly research climate change science, and it's clear that climate change scientists foresee an accelerating catastrophe.  Here's just one example:\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/climatechange/comments/1fhde02/methane\\_levels\\_at\\_800000year\\_high\\_stanford/?sort=top](https://www.reddit.com/r/climatechange/comments/1fhde02/methane_levels_at_800000year_high_stanford/?sort=top)\n\nYet the graph shows a vast difference in opinion based on political perspective.

The documentary also covers how he’s used the press to his advantage for decades, from planting tabloid stories to commanding nonstop coverage in 2016.\n\nTrump isn’t the first politician to shape his own narrative, but his ability to dominate media cycles, even through scandals, raises bigger questions about how much perception outweighs reality in politics. In an era where social media and 24/7 news drive engagement, does branding matter more than actual achievements?\n\nCurious to hear others’ thoughts: does the documentary change how you see Trump’s rise, or is this just how modern politics works?",

      "text": "Polarization has always been characteristic of American politics. Especially with our two-party system, it's nearly inevitable that opposing parts of the political spectrum will collide at one point or another. The last decade, however, saw political polarization in the U.S. reach new heights. What changed? America met Donald Trump.\n\nAfter Trump came along, it was obvious that the days of friendly political rivalry, notably, like that of Barack Obama and John McCain, were over. Trump quickly built a reputation for being ruthless against his opponents, spewing lies and other rethoric to put them whenever possible. But this paled in comparison to the attack on the Capitol Building on January 6, an event which arguably marked the peak of modern U.S. political division. And it didn't stop there. As president, Trump's aggressive conduct and authoritative approach to power continue to amplify the tensions in American politics.\n\nSo, is Trump simply a symptom of the deepening political polarization in America? Did he just capitalize on division that was already brewing? Or, is he the root cause of this division? In a post-Trump era, could American politics ever return to friendly and respectful competition? Can we \"depolarize\" without addressing the issues that led to Trump's success in the first place?",

One that if carried out as advertised, could have significant economic, social and political impacts.\n\nIn terms of economics, there is potential for such a crackdown to have [significantly effects on the agricultural and construction sectors](https://www.channelnewsasia.com/world/trump-mass-deportation-pledge-faces-legal-economic-barriers-4731381) that rely heavily on migrant labor. What is the potential for mass deportation to cause an inflationary spike on the economy not soon after Trump was elected on the back of discontent over inflation?\n\nSocially, Trump owed his victory to support from Latino voters, be it Mexican-Americans who are legal citizens that strongly dislike illegal immigration from Central America, or Guatemalan and Honduran migrants that genuinely believe Trump is blustering. If Trump goes as far as stated with deportation, is there a risk of eroding that support, particularly if legal migrants and naturalized citizens are caught up in the deportations as advocates have warned? Would it potentially lead to the pendulum swinging back in favor of pro-immigration sentiment much like the [family separation policy](https://www.vox.com/2024-elections/383845/trump-mass-deportations-immigration-family-separation) did during Trump's first term?\n\nPolitically, how would Trump try to negotiate with Mexico, Guatemala and other Latin American countries in trying to get them to accept deported migrants back? How would those migrants be sheltered and cared for while awaiting deportation? \n\nFinally, there has been talk as to whether Trump can even accomplish such a massive immigration crackdown. Aside from the sheer logistics in terms of manpower and resources needed to carry out such a task, there are other obstacles from [litigation in immigration courts](https://www.politico.com/news/2024/11/07/trump-immigrant-advocates-battle-00187971), to companies trying to plead for exemptions in their particular sectors. Then there is the influence of Trump's longtime adviser and architect on immigration policy Stephen Miller, who among other things had advocated sinking [migrant boats with drones](https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/jun/27/trump-stephen-miller-migrants-boats-drone-attacks-book) and supports [denaturalization](https://x.com/StephenM/status/1712094935820780029?lang=en) or stripping natural-born citizens of their rights. \n\nWould Trump inevitably balk at the sheer logistical, legal and economic challenges of pursuing mass deportation enough that he just does the classic Trump overpromising and underdelivering by deporting a few migrants before declaring Mission Accomplished? Or would the influence of ideological hardliners like Miller ensure that they will pursue mass deportation with no exemptions or compromises?",

      "text": "I recently watched a video of Francis Fukuyama where he argues that capitalism inevitably leads to inequality, and that inequality in turn produces political instability. Based on this, he suggests that societies should pursue wealth redistribution mechanisms to maintain stability.\n\nThis got me thinking:\nDoes inequality always lead to instability? Why or why not? Are there cases where high inequality doesn’t cause serious political unrest?\n\nAnd if inequality truly does threaten stability, what are some practical ways to reduce instability without undermining free markets or weakening economic liberalism? In other words, how can we balance the need for stability with preserving capitalist dynamism and freedom?\n\nI’d love to hear your thoughts and examples.",

      "text": "With Pride season and the recent surge in anti-LGBTQ+ legislation, I’ve been reflecting on whether Pride events should return to their more protest-oriented roots or continue emphasizing celebration and community building. Pride began as a response to the Stonewall riots, fundamentally a political act, but has evolved into large-scale festivals often featuring corporate sponsorship and mainstream appeal. While I understand the value of inclusive, joyful events that welcome questioning youth and build community solidarity, there’s also a compelling argument that we’ve become too comfortable while our rights face active threats. The tension between accessibility and activism feels particularly relevant when considering how different approaches might serve various segments of our community. Do we need to choose between political action and celebration, or can Pride events effectively balance both approaches? And given that our very existence remains politicized regardless of our personal preferences, how do we navigate the responsibility of advocacy while maintaining spaces for community joy and connection?\n\nI’m genuinely curious about different perspectives on this. Should Pride prioritize political activism given the current climate, or does the celebratory approach actually serve as a more effective tool for social change and community building?​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​",

      "text": "We are al suffering from political bias in American media.  Political bias has become a defining feature of the modern news landscape. Outlets like Fox News and MSNBC are accused of favoring specific ideological perspectives, shaping narratives in ways that deepen polarization rather than inform across divides. This bias often manifests in both **story selection** and **framing**, creating parallel realities for different segments of the public.\n\nWhile bias itself is not new, the current environment—driven by digital engagement metrics—seems to reward **outrage, confirmation bias, and emotionally charged content**. As noted in [Outrage industrial complex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outrage_industrial_complex), outrage is now a business model, where ideological intensity is profitable, regardless of nuance or accuracy.\n\nHistorical documents show these concerns are longstanding. For example, [Thomas Jefferson’s 1807 letter to John Norvell](https://founders.archives.gov/?q=norvell&s=1111311111&sa=&r=7&sr=) criticizes the press for substituting sensationalism for facts—a concern that seems even more relevant in today’s hyper-partisan environment.\n\nThis raises several questions worth exploring from a political and structural perspective:\n\n1. **What could the federal government do**—within the bounds of the First Amendment—to help reduce the spread or impact of political bias in news reporting? Are there examples from U.S. history or other democracies that offer guidance?\n2. **What role can a small number of organized citizens play** in promoting more politically balanced news coverage? Could boycotts, media rating systems, or cooperative funding models have an impact?\n3. **How might wealthy individuals or philanthropic organizations—who are not themselves media owners—intervene** to support more politically neutral journalism? Is there room to build trusted, nonpartisan institutions that rival biased legacy outlets?\n4. **How can this be organized -** considering that organization will take place on the media platforms themselves?  The owners control the algorithms and will suppress any organization for control.\n\nI’m interested in discussing practical, nonpartisan solutions that are achievable in today’s political climate—not just theoretical ideals.",

      "text": "Let me explain. \nToday’s shift in politics is in a more radical and polarized one, both sides agree on less and less issues each passing year, this is already happening in developed countries and it’s about the same in developing countries.\n\nIt’s argued that moderates want just to preserve a failed or in shambles system and don’t search to destroy and rebuild this system, thus more radicals from the left and the right win elections and change the status quo.\n\nIn fact, many people who vote in more ideological and radical parties and politicians want just big changes, so for example; many trump voters would vote for Bernie sanders if he trump didn’t run in the elections and vice-versa. They just want some big figure who dares to challenge the status quo and so, vote on radicals from both sides.\n\nIn my country (brazil) one of the reasons that explain why Bolsonaro won is because of the feeling that everything was the same and the old moderate parties were actually cooperating to maintain the status quo.\n\nAmerica is a curious case, trump redefined the Republican Party, shifting the party more right, Christian, nationalistic and made everyone who wasn’t supporting him obsolete, “too moderate”, or RINO. The Democratic Party also passed this as well, there was a time not too long ago when it was okay for Obama to say that he didn’t supported gay marriage, there was a time when democrats supported only “safe” “limited” abortions, Bill Clinton even signed a bill reaffirming that a marriage is between a man and a woman, there was a time when many democrats had a tougher instance on crime and immigration, even more than current day republicans (see Biden history on senate for example) Obama deported more people than trump. Today’s democrats embraced a surprisingly progressive agenda like trying to redefine the concept of free speech, over a third of democrats want to repeal the 2nd amendment, defunding the police became a serious discussion in certain circles, the idea to create a tax specifically for billionaires and of course, the embracing of identity politics.\n\nIt looks like it’s near impossible to find a mid ground in the present day. Polling is showing that Gen Z is becoming more conservative, traditional and religious, potentially even more than their grandparents, however the progressive gen Z and millennials uphold very robust progressive values so it creates a deep gap between them.\n\nWhat do you think?

      "text": "I’ve always thought big city mayors would be great candidates for president or Vice President, just as much as governors or senators, especially since there are cities that are more populous than entire states. \n\nBut they don’t tend to run or be spoken about/covered as potential candidates to the same extent as governors or senators, and I’ve always wondered why. What makes them not as viable? Similarly with state-wide politicians like Attorney General? What makes them less “serious” than a governor or congressman? \n\nBonus question: who would be some potential current or past big city mayor presidential candidates in 2028? My theory is that whoever is the next dem candidate will be someone who is an outsider to DC and untainted by national politics. \n\n**Disclaimer: I know Pete Buttigieg was a mayor himself, but he’s an anomaly looking at the past couple decades of dem presidential candidates",

      "text": "I’ve been following the Trump situation for years now, and I can't wrap my head around how he's managed to avoid any real consequences despite the sheer number of allegations, investigations, and legal cases against him. From the hush money scandal to the classified documents case, to the January 6th insurrection — it feels like any other politician would have been crushed under the weight of even *one* of these.\n\nI get that Trump's influence over the Republican Party and the conservative media machine gives him a protective shield, but how deep does this go? Are we talking about systemic issues with the legal system, political corruption, or just strategic maneuvering by Trump and his team?\n\nFor context:  \n📌 Trump was impeached *twice* — first for pressuring Ukraine to investigate Biden, and then for inciting the Capitol riot — yet he was acquitted both times because Senate Republicans closed ranks.  \n📌 The classified documents case (where Trump allegedly kept top-secret files at Mar-a-Lago) seemed like an open-and-shut case, yet it's been bogged down in procedural delays and legal loopholes.  \n📌 The New York hush money case involved falsifying business records to cover up payments to Stormy Daniels — something that would likely land an average citizen in jail — but Trump seems untouchable.  \n📌 The Georgia election interference case (pressuring officials to \"find\" votes) looks like outright criminal behavior, yet Trump is still able to campaign without serious repercussions.\n\n📌 Trump's administration recently invoked the Alien Enemies Act to deport Venezuelan migrants to El Salvador, directly defying a judicial order halting such actions. The administration argued that verbal court orders aren't binding once deportation planes leave U.S. airspace, a stance that has left judges incredulous. \n\n📌Trump's recent actions have intensified conflicts with the judiciary, showcasing attempts to wield unchallenged presidential authority. For instance, he proceeded with deportations despite court blocks, reflecting a strategy of making bold decisions and addressing legal challenges afterward.\n\n📌 In a landmark decision, the Supreme Court ruled that presidents have absolute immunity for acts committed within their core constitutional duties, and at least presumptive immunity for official acts within the outer perimeter of their responsibilities. This ruling has significant implications for holding presidents accountable for their actions while in office\n\nIt seems like Trump benefits from a mix of legal stall tactics, political protection, and public perception manipulation. But is the American legal system really that broken, or is there some higher-level political game being played here?\n\nIf you want to read more about these cases, here are some good resources:\n\n* [Classified Documents Case – DOJ Filing](https://www.justice.gov/)\n* [Georgia Election Case – Background](https://www.nytimes.com/)\n* [Stormy Daniels Hush Money – NYT Report](https://www.nytimes.com/)\n* [January 6th Capitol Riot – House Committee Findings](https://www.jan6th.house.gov/)\n* [https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2025/mar/17/donald-trump-kennedy-center-jd-vance-tariffs-ukraine-immigration-us-politics-live-news?utm\\_source](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2025/mar/17/donald-trump-kennedy-center-jd-vance-tariffs-ukraine-immigration-us-politics-live-news?utm_source)\n* [https://www.politico.com/news/2025/03/17/trump-presidential-power-courts-test-00234173?utm\\_source](https://www.politico.com/news/2025/03/17/trump-presidential-power-courts-test-00234173?utm_source)\n* [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trump\\_v.\\_United\\_States\\_%282024%29?utm\\_source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trump_v._United_States_%282024%29?utm_source)",

      "text": "In 2010, Matt Yglesias coined the term \"the Pundit's Fallacy\" to describe \"the belief that what a politician needs to do to improve his or her political standing is do what the pundit wants substantively\".\n\nEver since the election, the Pundit's Fallacy seems to have entirely taken over the discourse as the Democrats as a party try to figure out what to do next. As the full extent of the data from the election has yet to be examined and given shape yet for the public to consider, many people are clinging to whatever incomplete data they have to make the argument that the Democrats lost because they failed to embrace... whatever said pundit's existing beliefs about politics were. Moderates have been pointing to the unpopular social positions the Democrats as a party are associated with and advocating for more strident repudiations of them. Liberals point to the wave of anti-incumbency that has swept the world this year, or to the role of voters' media diets influencing their perceptions of the economy and policy toward negativity, or to Harris only having around 100 days to take over the campaign after Biden stepped down. Leftists point to the party not taking a stronger stance on the war in Gaza, or the perception that the party moved to the Right by embracing the Cheneys as campaign surrogates, or not having more ambitious Left-wing policy plans all costing the campaign support. The thing is, there is _some_ amount of evidence for all of these positions, some stronger and some weaker than others, and therefore the discourse is drowning in pundits with absolute confidence that that means their position is correct and that the key to success is to do what they already wanted us to do. \n\nBut what if it isn't? In politics there are very few definitive answers one way or another. We calibrate our beliefs based on our biases, our morality, our understanding of reality, our understanding of our communities, our experiences, but those are all subject to flaws in human psychology. Polls can be wrong, manipulated, gamed to produce a specific answer. Studies can be politically motivated, biased or the evidence could actually be much weaker than presented. Echo chambers can create the impression that a belief is more widespread than it actually is. Things we consider to be common sense can have blind spots from our own personal ignorance. It is easier to grapple with cognitive dissonance by rejecting evidence that we don't like than integrating it into our understanding.\n\nWhatever your beliefs are- about the election, about the support for the UHC CEO assassination and the public's opinions on private vs public health insurance, about trans people in sports and trans healthcare, about whether your party needs to moderate their beliefs or become more extreme, about whatever issues you strongly care about- how sure are you that they are true? What if there was some kind of irrefutable evidence handed down from an omniscient divine source that could definitively refute it? How would that change your political strategy to learn that a political position you hold was just factually wrong, or that your political beliefs that you fight for are an extreme minority?",

      "text": "The election of Donald J. Trump to the presidency in 2016 and again in 2024 represented a seismic disruption in the landscape of American political tradition. Lacking political experience, employing a combative and often incendiary rhetorical style, and defying the established norms of decorum that typically define presidential campaigns, Trump nonetheless succeeded in capturing both the Republican nomination and the White House. His victory, which defied the expectations of most political analysts, stands in stark contrast to the fate of another prominent conservative figure: Senator Barry Goldwater. In 1964, Goldwater, though similarly critical of the political establishment and committed to a strong ideological vision, was thoroughly defeated in a landslide election that many believed discredited the far-right wing of the Republican Party for a generation. Goldwater, a decorated military veteran and five-term U.S. Senator, offered a coherent—if controversial—vision of limited government and individual liberty, grounded in a tradition of constitutional conservatism. Trump, by contrast, eschewed detailed policy positions in favor of emotive, populist appeals and a media-dominating persona.\n\nThis paradox—that Trump, the more inflammatory and unorthodox candidate, succeeded where Goldwater, the more conventional and principled conservative, failed—invites a deeper inquiry into the transformation of American political culture across five decades. Why was the American electorate willing to embrace Trump’s populist nationalism in, while it had so forcefully rejected Goldwater’s ideological conservatism in 1964? What changed in the political, social, and media environment that allowed a candidate once considered unelectable by establishment standards to ascend to the presidency? And to what extent does Trump’s victory represent a culmination of the long-term realignment of the Republican Party that Goldwater’s campaign helped set in motion?",

      "text": "Over the weekend, the Trump administration deported approximately 250 Venezuelan migrants to El Salvador. At least one individual reportedly had a pending asylum hearing. The deportations occurred after a federal judge issued an order to halt them. According to administration officials, the order was not binding once planes had left U.S. airspace.\n\nThe deportees were sent to El Salvador’s Centro de Confinamiento del Terrorismo (CECOT), a large-scale prison described by international human rights organizations as overcrowded, isolated, and operating without meaningful due process. Reports indicate that detainees are held in near-total lockdown, denied communication with lawyers or family, and not guaranteed individual trials.\n\nThis situation raises several legal and constitutional questions. Is the U.S. executive branch permitted to deport individuals—especially those with pending legal proceedings—to foreign detention centers with documented rights violations? What are the limits of executive discretion under immigration law in cases like this? How should the courts respond if executive agencies defy their rulings in practice, even if not openly? Is this a violation of constitutional protections, or a legally ambiguous action within the bounds of current statutes?\n\nIt also raises broader questions about precedent. Could this approach expand in scope—using foreign penal systems to detain individuals without U.S. oversight? How does this compare to historical practices like extraordinary rendition, and does it reflect a shift in the balance of power between the judiciary and the executive?\n\nWould appreciate thoughts or historical/legal context from those familiar with similar cases.",

For instance Duterte led his country and the response was different, said to be Magnitsky-like. [ICHRP](https://ichrp.net/ichrp-announces-dirty-dozen-magnitsky-sanctions-campaign-against-philippine-human-rights-violators/) In the United States, the Magnitsky act reduced the property and travel rights of specific individuals as anti-corruption and anti-human-rights-abuse measures, as these people were said to park money and make safe comfortable bolt-holes to run away to so they could be insulated from risks associated with being oligarchs, if ever the winds should change against them.\n\nAre these targeted trade war measures aimed to harm Republican voters?\n\nAre these  targeted measures aimed to protect Democrat voters?\n\nAre the biggest exports from Democrat-led regions more difficult to target because the alternatives are worse or the price can't be as easily borne?\n\nWhy would anyone respond this way? If the responses achieved their purpose exactly as intended, what would the world look like?\n\nThis shit is moving really fast. Articles backpedaled because Trump backpedaled and other world leaders whose tariffs were paused backpedaled, and that's why I felt like the month/year callout would help the next person asking about the trade war, if they bother searching the sub.",

How do you feel about the doom-posting many on Reddit are doing, saying another Holocaust is imminent.\n\nOne point to start from: a recent political science paper has found that democratic backsliding is frequently followed by a \"U-turn\" towards more democratic governance. [Read here](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/13510347.2024.2448742#abstract).

      "text": "The idea that they should be involved in some way isn't too disputed. But there is much more to the general concept of a system as involving its citizens.\n\nObama had a petition system on the White House website where a petition could get signed and would cause the president, or more likely, his staff wrote a response which the president signed off on, to write a response, once it reached a quorum of 100,000 signatories. Britain has a petitions system on their website with 10,000 signatories causing a response from the executive cabinet, 100,000 would trigger a debate in Parliament (House of Commons). I imagine a threshold could be engineered where a committee of parliament would be required to write a report and hold a hearing pertaining to it. Legislation can even be initiated in some countries via a petition, forcing a vote in the legislature on whether or not to agree with it and putting a public record of that, and the possibility of enactment being on the table.\n\nPetitions of a certain size can in many places trigger a vote in some way, in Italy, 500,000 signatories in a country with roughly 50 million voters, or about 1%, can demand that a ballot question be put to the electorate related to legislation which was recently passed, and if a majority of voters turn out and the majority of valid votes are against the legislation, the legislation is defeated and repealed. In Bavaria, if one million people sign a petition, in a country of about ten million people able to vote, to call for a snap election of the Parliament of Bavaria, then such a referendum on whether to do so is held, a majority vote being necessary for such a snap election.",

The attacks were so severe that Michigan Senate Candidate Elissa Slotkin released her own ad disavowing the claim of banning gas cars and saying she drives a gas car too.

Did the activist movement just fizzle out. The voters not really believe in the supposed theory of accelerated transition away from fossil fuels as the only hope of survival? Did the rhetoric from the climate activists reach such apocalyptic levels that people just don’t believe them anymore?

Hardly anyone talks about what George Bush Jr and Laura Bush did with each other nor are concerned much at all with their personal families. Obama's older daughter got found with some cannabis once when she was 21, and certainly had quite the unusual experiences of growing up with a presidential father. \n\nI will criticize aspects of the Lewinsky affair on the part of Clinton, it is not wise to be with an intern with a relatively much lower level of power in such a relationship in my view in a society with norms and laws that don't give a lot of power to employees, young ones in particular, nor constrains their presidents very much with regard to office and personnel management, if for no other reason that it brings serious doubt and creates personality motives for people to behave and potentially abuse their power in trying to limit opposition and investigation, even though I also think that the Republicans focused on the wrong issue in that scandal in that they focused on Lewinsky far too much. \n\nIt becomes interesting to look at how countries around the world differ on this. Francois Hollande in France was found going to be with a mistress on his Vespa, and hardly anyone in France cares he's an atheist either, and he just won a seat in the Parliament again after being elected over the summer as a socialist legislator. I guess in that respect, people didn't think of him as being immoral, people just kept arguing over whether his policies were good ideas. One president happened to die because of their affair in 1899, but that was for medical reasons and nothing to do with murder.",

However, now that these concerns are becoming more widely recognized (and even prioritized) by larger parties, does that make the Greens less relevant?\n\nOf course, you could argue that Green parties still push for environmental policies that are more radical or uncompromising. Or that their broader commitment to anti-capitalism, degrowth, or direct democracy still sets them apart. But in practice (especially in Europe), it seem as if these parties often end up aligning with center-left coalitions anyway.\n\nI'm curious to hear what others think. Do Green parties risk becoming irrelevant or redundant if they’re increasingly outflanked by bigger parties with greener agendas?

      "text": "Joe Walsh, former Tea Party congressman and right-wing radio host, has gone through a significant public transformation in recent years. After years of contributing to the extreme rhetoric that dominated conservative media, he’s now admitted that he was wrong and is genuinely trying to make amends for the harm he helped cause. He’s been vocal about his regret, even starting a podcast where he consistently bashes the modern Republican Party and Trump, and repeatedly beats himself down for his past aggressive support of both. It really seems like a true “come to Jesus” moment, where Walsh is fully aware of the damage he’s done and is trying to reconcile with it.\n\nBut despite this intense self-reflection, his shift has largely made him irrelevant in the political landscape. My question is: How do we view someone like Walsh, who was once so loud and influential in shaping harmful narratives but has since tried to fix what he did? Is this kind of reckoning enough? Do public figures deserve credit for trying to right their wrongs, or is it too little, too late? What impact do you think Walsh’s shift really has, if any?\n\nIt also makes me wonder—how much of this is just a universal challenge for republics and democracies? Can we really expect someone’s political stance to remain rigid over time, or is this kind of transformation inevitable, even for the most hardline figures? How do we, as a society, deal with that change?",

      "text": "I know this title is going to sound like a partisan attack to some. But, I'm wondering if we should be seriously considering the possibility that the US president is an older man who has experienced notable cognitive decline and is behaving erratically. \n\nWhen Trump is discussed, you will occasionally here people using the term \"sanewashing\". This means acting like Trump's ideas are saner than they really are. His supporters want to believe he's playing 4-D chess. His opponents want to believe he has sinister intentions. But, could it be that his behavior legitimately does not make sense because he is unwell? \n\nThe man is currently threatening Canada, Greenland, and Panama. On the campaign trail, there was no mention of the idea that he might try to forcibly expand US territory. No one voted for that. I don't think his own party is on board with these ideas. These ideas seem legitimately crazy. \n\nNot that long ago, he was calling Zelensky a dictator because there haven't been elections. Later, when questioned, he said \"Did I say that?\". Now, he is apparently angry at Putin for questioning Zelensky's legitimacy. Is he seriously confused? \n\nSome people want to believe that Trump is attempting to implement madman theory. This was a political strategy popularized by Nixon who wanted US adversaries to believe that he was capable of anything. But...could it be that Trump is legitimately losing his mind? \n\nThere's an argument that the world has a problem with aging leaders. Famously, people began having doubts about Biden's cognitive ability. There also might be reason to question Putin's mental state. When asked to explain the war, he begins talking about medieval history. And now, the US is led by a man in his 70's whose behavior might be described as erratic. \n\nI don't want to be agist, but it’s an established medical fact that older people experience brain shrinkage and cognitive decline. In the US, we've seen examples of older politicians (like Diane Feinstein) who noticeably decline while in office. There's a problem with people continuing to elect well known incumbents, not realizing that they are losing it as they get older. \n\nShould we be seriously worried that the current US president is cognitively declining? And can the US system handle that? The US presidency is a very powerful office. Does the government self-destruct if the president loses their mind?",

      "text": "My wife showed me this Wall Street Journal poll from earlier this month. Says only 33% of voters view the Democratic Party favorably right now. That’s the worst rating they’ve had in decades.\n\nEven though a lot of people aren’t happy with Trump or the GOP, Democrats are now behind on most of the big issues; economy, immigration, etc. Only areas where they still lead are healthcare and vaccines.\n\nI’ve seen people blame the economy, infighting, weak messaging, or just burnout from both parties. Some think younger voters are tuning out altogether.\n\nWhat do you think is driving the numbers down? Curious what others are seeing where they live.\n\nSource:\nhttps://www.wsj.com/politics/elections/democratic-party-poll-voter-confidence-july-2025-9db38021",

      "text": "In recent years, observers have noted a blurring of lines between internet meme culture and the political process. “Meme logic”—the idea that viral stories, jokes, and rumors from the internet increasingly shape real-world policy and discourse—has been cited by some analysts as a force behind major developments in U.S. politics.\n\nFor example, viral claims and conspiracy theories about immigration have sometimes influenced public perception and, arguably, federal policy—such as the rise of narratives about certain immigrant groups or the proliferation of claims around Temporary Protected Status (TPS). Similarly, the ongoing discourse around the “Epstein files” has sparked repeated demands for government action, despite conflicting official statements.\n\nSome point to this trend as evidence that political decision-making is becoming more reactive to viral internet narratives, rather than grounded in traditional deliberation and fact-based governance. Others argue that internet-driven activism and meme-sharing can serve as a democratizing force, helping marginalized voices break through media gatekeeping.\n\n**Questions for discussion:**\n\n* How significant is the influence of internet meme culture on actual political decisions in the U.S.? Can you think of examples where a viral narrative appears to have shaped policy?\n* Does the integration of meme logic into politics represent a breakdown of traditional governance, or is it simply a new form of democratic engagement?\n* What are the potential benefits and dangers of political leaders responding to viral internet narratives?\n* How should institutions (media, government, education) respond to the growing role of memes and viral content in public life?\n\n**Background:**  \nFor further reading, see recent analyses of meme culture and politics in major news outlets (e.g., Vox, AP, The Atlantic). The “Epstein files” controversy, immigration policy shifts, and social media-driven activism are often cited as case studies.",

There’s also less push for reform within the institutions, and instead pointing to different group(s) as the issue/problem and calls to burn down the institution to create something totally different. That belief in its current form is even being promoted from both “accelerationists” labeled as domestic terrorists and elected politicians within the institutions.\n\nI’d like to hear if you agree or disagree if the parallels are enough to suggest we’re experiencing the same shift in forms of government or heading that direction and why.

      "text": "There was the 2025 German Federal Election held a few days ago. The citizen of Germany had cast their vote on which party will the lead the government of Germany and who will become the chancellor of Germany. The result is that the centre-right party CDU/CSU won the election by a majority, followed by the far-right party, AFD, then the social democratic party, SPD. The SPD had lost most of their seats and the election this year to those parties I mentioned. CDU/CSU won 208 seat, AFD won 152 seat and SPD won 120 seat. This marks another victory for right-wing parties again in Europe, since Austria and Italy. My questions is, why most European countries have a rising popularity of right-wing parties and what makes most Europeans fed up with the current left-wing parties or governments to the point that cause them to vote for these right-wing parties? Is it due to increase in immigration issues? Tired of left-wing woke ideologies? Uncontrolled inflations and tax rises? Let me know down in the comments below and give your reasons on why this sudden rise of right-wing parties in Europe keep ongoing like the rise of far-right party in United Kingdom, Reform UK, led by Nigel Farage.",

Are these rallies just for your base to rally support of your ground game?  Are they for the candidate as batting practice in an extremely friendly environment?  Are they there to gain the attention of local media and news?",

It will be the first result if you google it.)*\n\nIn summary, he asserts:\n1. That the US doesn’t need Canada\n2. That Canada is on US-supplied life support\n3. That shutting down trade with Canada will kill the country and allow it to be annexed\n\nI assume this is why he is currently refusing phone calls from the Canadian government. He doesn’t have demands for Canada. The demand *is* Canada. But *the question* is where this goes politically.\n\n**UPDATE**\n\nThe post I quoted has been removed from his Truth Social and Twitter account as of today (February 3rd). Now there is no posts about Canada dated from yesterday (February 2nd). Instead there is a post today hand-wavingly complaining about Canada not allowing US banks and not cooperating in the war on drugs.\n\nThe original post was on February 2nd, 8:26 a.m. eastern time. I’m far from the only person with screenshots, but DM if you would like copies for corroboration.\n\nI checked to see if there was any media coverage of this post and/or its removal but I have found nothing.

The final package was agreed to by all parties and signed off on by McConnell as well as Democratic leaders before Trump publicly came out against it and urged his allies in the House and Senate GOP to kill it. The reason, according to widespread reporting including the above, was that he wanted to run his campaign on there being chaos at the border and him being the solution to fix it, and he worried that the proposed bill would resolve the problem and deprive him of something to run on. \n\nSince then, Trump has made immigration and the idea of a border crises the central point of his campaign. He's gone to every border state to rant about it and lambast Democrats for not fixing it. He's brought it up in every appearance, at every interview, at the presidential debate. He's tied the border to false stories about migrants coming over to eat people's pets. He brings it up at every rally. Yet it was he himself who worked to ensure that it wasn't fixed, and now his own party's Senate leader acknowledges it. \n\nWhat sort of impact do you think this will have on the election?

Others counter that refusing to settle is important, that if voters keep accepting “good enough,” then politicians have no incentive to offer anything better.\n\nI’m curious what others think:\n\n* Do you see this fallacy influencing voter behavior more in recent elections than in the past?\n\n* Is it being amplified by social media and polarized politics, or has it always been a steady undercurrent?\n\n* How do you personally balance idealism with pragmatic choices when you vote?",

I'm 28, and in my entire memory, I've never seen the people around me so excited to vote. Hell, even my Mississippi parents are THRILLED to vote for Kamala.

There is no evidence, but a few things which add to this claim.\n\n1. Melania moved back to NYC and is not supporting her Husband in his campaign. Some media outlets rumoured that they might go through a split.\n\n2. there are videos showing Laura Loomer and Donald Trump very close and familiar to each other and even saying ‚I love you‘ (even if it’s in the context of the election and his ‘fight’ for America)\n\n3. She traveled with him on his plane to the debate even though she does not officially work for him or his campaign.\n\n4. Some rumours even go that far, stating that Loomer might be pregnant by Trump (showing a baby bump of her) \n\n5. There have been videos of Trump during rallies pointing to Loomer in the crowd and stating how much he likes her and how beautiful, etc she is \n\nEven if these are all just rumours this raises a few questions.\n\nQuestions about the rumour itself:\n\n1. If she doesn’t work for him, why is she travelling with him everywhere? (This could make the impression that they’re dating) \n\n2. If they’re not dating, why are they so touchy with each other? \n\nQuestions about the election:\n\n1. Could this rumour influence how conservatives vote? \n\n2. Also, Loomer is very controversial, even among Trump allies - could she draw an even bigger split in the Republican Party? (We know that the Republican Party is split, but she even scatters diehard Trump supporters)",

Do we think one of these potential candidates could keep momentum going long enough from right now to win a primary in 2028, or do we think that maybe a more up-and-coming player may emerge, perhaps someone younger like a Wes More?\n\nIf Trump wins, he would also be term-limited. It would seem then, logically, that JD Vance would carry that mantle into 2028 (kind of how Harris is for Biden right now). Perhaps he would face an open primary, or maybe the party will rally around him as the heir apparent. I think the more interesting scenario, though, is if Trump loses. His hold on the Republican Party is well-documented at this point, although at age 82 and losing 2/3 presidential elections is pretty damning. Should he want to run yet again, would he even have the support to do so? or would voters reject him for someone new, and who could that possibly be?",

There's also a growing movement against IVF in conservative Christian circles, with several churches and denominations coming out against it in recent months due to how it can create multiple embryos, not all of which get used.\n\nIf Trump wins the election, do you think access to IVF will be banned or at least further restricted? Every single Republican in the Senate voted against codifying it today with the exception of long-time moderates Susan Collins and Lisa Murkowski, while every Democrat voted in support.\n\nA pair of Republican senators (Ted Cruz of Texas and Katie Britt of Alabama) did offer a compromise bill in response to the failed vote, however their bill said nothing about protecting IVF but rather would restrict Medicaid funding from states that ban it. Supporters of the bill said it offered strong incentives, while critics argue that many conservatives have criticized Medicare and Medicaid for decades so this essentially amounts to a 2-for-1 value in conservative policy rather than a serious deterrent.",

Many Republicans keep saying \"look at what Trump will do based on his first term.\" Well, one of the very first things he did was enact an executive Muslim ban, sidestepping Congress. Wouldn't he likely re-enact it?",

      "text": "Democrats are often criticized for prioritizing decorum and civility in political discourse, especially when compared to the more confrontational approach often associated with Republicans. While this commitment to decorum aligns with their appeal to voters who value institutional norms and professional behavior, it raises the question of whether this strategy weakens their ability to energize their base or effectively counter aggressive political tactics. Are Democrats' efforts to \"stay above the fray\" helping their electability by appealing to moderates and independents, or does it hinder them by failing to inspire passionate support or adequately push back against opposition narratives?",

      "text": "It seems at least in the realm of possibility to me that if Trump is defeated in 2024, he may attempt to court other far-right leaders into sheltering him from prosecution as Orban did with Bolsonaro while he was being investigated for the attempted coup in Brazil in 2022. If he succeeds in this, I’m curious as to whether or not he would continue trying to lead the MAGA movement from overseas, or give up entirely, and how his followers would respond to this.\n\nOn one hand, I could see it being a crushing blow to the MAGA movement, as its head is essentially cut off. Without Trump in the public eye, making live appearances, hosting events, etc., the movement would lose a lot of momentum and political viability. Not to mention the fact that at least some MAGA Republicans would see it as cowardly and as a sign that he had abandoned them.\n\nOn the other hand, it might only add to the image that Trump is attempting to build around himself; that he’s a martyr who everyone wants to take down. With all that Trump has been through politically and legally, he has still maintained his core base of supporters, and it’s equally not hard for me to imagine such a scenario changing nothing.\n\nArticle on Bolsonaro hiding in Hungarian Embassy while under investigation: https://www.nytimes.com/2024/03/25/world/americas/jair-bolsonaro-hungary-video.html",

      "title": "President-elect Trump wants to end citizen-based taxation for US citizens, how can this be achieved?",
      "text": "One not-so-much discussed campaign Trump promised last month was to [end double taxation for US citizens living abroad](http://archive.today/2024.10.11-175150/https://www.wsj.com/politics/policy/donald-trump-tax-plan-americans-abroad-a74bfbdd).\n\nFor those unaware, the US is one of a handful of countries in the world, and the only country in the developed world, [that taxes based on citizenship, no matter where they live.](https://www.irs.gov/individuals/international-taxpayers/frequently-asked-questions-about-international-individual-tax-matters)\n\nFor over 7 million US citizens living abroad, it's less paying the tax itself, but more filing a US tax return in addition to that of their home country and adding complexity. Due to how the current taxation system works, [if you make under $120,000 a year abroad, you're excluded from paying any tax in the US](https://www.irs.gov/individuals/international-taxpayers/figuring-the-foreign-earned-income-exclusion), still need to file a tax return. There is also a tax credit system where you only pay the difference between the tax amount you pay in the US and your host country (but you can't do both the exclusion and credit options).\n\nChanging the taxation system to a residency-based one [has been expressed by both sides of the political spectrum over the years](https://www.newsweek.com/donald-trump-double-taxation-tax-cuts-election-2024-1967142), and [studies have shown it to be tax revenue-neutral.](https://www.americansabroad.org/aca_deg_analysis_of_revenue_effects_of_residents_based_taxation)\n\nNow that Trump is president-elect, how can his administration realistically switch the US to a residency-based taxation system?\n\nEdit: How far should Trump go in making it making it easier for US citizens living abroad? Should he eliminate the [requirement for US citizens to report their foreign assets to the IRS every year (FBAR)?](https://www.irs.gov/businesses/small-businesses-self-employed/report-of-foreign-bank-and-financial-accounts-fbar)\n\nShould he eliminate [FATCA, requiring foreign financial institutions to report US citizens and permanent residents to the US for taxation purposes?](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_Account_Tax_Compliance_Act) \n\nAsk any US person who's lived abroad and has tried to open a bank account. Most will tell you they've had some trouble or out right refusal by the bank due to FATCA. It *was* the Obama administration that pushed for and signed it into law...\n\nEdit 1: It's interesting to see the division in support-opposition in the comments are dependent on if you've lived abroad and have had to deal with filing FBAR and their tax return, dealing with FACTA, etc.\n\nIt's a very common misconception that it's solely wealthy people and \"expats\" that makeup most US citizens living abroad. \n\nEspecially since the US has unrestricted citizenship by birthright (via the 14th Amendment), there are hundreds of thousands of cases where children born of parents who've either immigrated or were here temporarily (vacation, work, study, etc) who've automatically obtained US citizenship. For the rest of their life, even if they never enter the US again, they have to deal with the hassle of filing yearly tax returns, filing FBAR, dealing with financial institutions refusing them due to not wanting to deal with FACTA, etc. And since they were born in the US, it will show on their other passport their place of birth, thus automatically showing they're a US citizen and can't ignore it.\n\nOne example, a child is born to Mexican parents who've immigrated to the US and has both Mexican and US citizenship. A few years later, they return to Mexico and the child grows up there. Upon moving out of the home after graduation, they want to open a bank account. Many financial institutions will give him hassle or outright reject them due to FACTA requirements. But they're lucky and finds a bank that's willing to deal with the hassle of interacting with the IRS. \n\nA few years later, the person has been working. The IRS will demand why have they not only not filed a yearly US tax return, but especially why didn't they file the annual FBAR? After much more hassle and back and forth, the IRS is lenient and will have a minimal penalty since the person genuinely didn't know about the annual FBAR and tax return filing requirements. But next time they won't be so nice.\n\nFrustrated with the situation and why they have to pay the US taxes when they're not even in the country, the next year they decide to renounce their US citizenship, much to the dismay of their parents and family. They're stubborn and don't want to deal with this for the rest of their life, despite the opportunities the US would have for them, so they go to the US consulate and applies to renounce their US citizenship. However, the filing fee is $2,350 just to get the process started. On top of that, the IRS and Department of Treasury demand they pay one more set of taxes for the year up to date so there's no \"outstanding balance\", otherwise it won't be approved. \n\nYou might think, this is such a niche example. But there are similar cases for hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of dual citizens living outside the US. [In Mexico alone, in 2017 there were almost 900,000 Mexicans that were born in the US.](http://www.un.org/en/development/desa/population/migration/data/estimates2/data/UN_MigrantStockByOriginAndDestination_2017.xlsx) \n\nIt's one of those issues you don't think about much, if at all, and likely have some misconceptions until you experience it personally. Then the more you research and/or deal with it, the more byzantine, absurd, and out of touch the whole system is.",

However, Trump has a history of talking like a mob boss. Although he doesn't explicitly say anything that's a dead giveaway of criminal intent, there is overwhelming evidence of foulplay. His main legal defense would almost certainly be that we cannot be sure of criminal intent beyond a reasonable doubt. Trump has a history of never accepting defeat or criticism of any kind and saying everything is rigged if he loses. He also ignores experts regularly and, again, never explicitly told someone he knew he lost or anything. His lawyers would use this history of behavior to argue there is a non-negligible chance that he was living in his own reality and is incapable of processing defeat due to narcissistic delusion or that we cannot be 100% sure of criminal intent due to no explicit statements of criminal intent. How do you think this would play out in court? What do you think the chances are of him being found \"not guilty?\"",

      "text": "Relative to Biden, Harris has surged in the swing states where non-white voters are above the national average of 33% (NC, GA, NV) (See YouTubelink below) in a manner few predicted back in July. Perhaps they should have? Georgia in 2024 is on the cusp of reaching 40% non-white voters and North Carolina is just shy of doubling Michigan and Pennsylvania non-white voters. GA and NC may well see record turnout 16 years into significant demographic changes extremely favorable to Democrats since Obama's  2008 NC win where there are now one Democrat Governor and 2 Democrat  Southern Senators (compared to zero in Alabama, Arkansas, Tennessee). Some people thought this was a 2020/2021 fluke but the demographic trends says otherwise. \n\nWith Non-white voters racing towards 40% of the population in two critical-for-270 swing states and an only 1% NC Republican margin of victory in a high 2020 turnout election (where an African American was not on the top of the ticket like there will be this time) is the sort of playing field that becomes very susceptible to a political last straw that swings just enough independents to join the Democrat coalition. That last  straw for independents may be the latest of many controversies surrounding the MAGA lieutenant governor Mark Robinson (who Trump compared to Dr. Martin Luther King) and has undoubtedly brought more embarrassing national attention to the NC governor's race. If you missed the coverage the anti LBGT Republican who prefers the era where women couldn't  vote (his own recent words), has repeated Adolf H and has dabbeld in holocaust denial, was indetified by former employees of adult stores for spending approximately $150 a week in adult movies, visiting as many as five times a week and often bringing his own box of pizza into the \"private booths\" where most faith based conservatives lieutenant governors are rarely present.\n\n Given the thread bare margins that may be coming with our only second ever nominated African American presidential candidate and how NC moderates and centrists may want to send a message to Trump and his endorsed NC GOP candidate, an endorsement that came AFTER the lieutenant governor called LBGTQ citizens \"maggots and filth\". Is there a political last straw that swings just enough independents to put Harris ahead in NC and GA? Recall Hershel Walker's comments and the controversies of his political circles (the Matt Schlapp incident) costing Trump Georgia?\n\n If Harris were to indeed flip Georgia which was famously decided by 11,779 votes or 0.23% in 2020 and Robinson ends up costing Trump North Carolina by crossing the independent voter ick threshold, then Harris lands at 283 electoral votes even with losing Pennsylvania, Nevada and Arizona.  Curiously, the 2016 NC governor's race that defeated a Republican governor was decided by a very similar to Georgia 0.22% of the vote.. whereas the 2020 election of Roy Cooper with Trump again on the ballot (pre January 6th attack) was decided by 4.5% in favor of the NC Democrat. Obviously there are some very flexible independents in the mix.\n\nhttps://slate.com/news-and-politics/2024/09/porn-mark-robinson-north-carolina-governor-maga-republican-trump.html\n\nhttps://youtu.be/2-LggIGSV5g?si=QJnbeje0rhvwyHSq",

      "text": "The 2024 US Senate election was highly unfavourable for Democrats as they lost 3 seats (Montana, Ohio and West Virginia) and are likely to lose another in Pennsylvania depending on recounts. Therefore, they will have 47 seats (including Sanders and King) to the Republicans 53 seats in the next Congress. So they will need a net gain at least 4 seats in 2026 to become the majority party.\n\nThe 2026 US Senate map is much more favourable to Democrats compared to 2024. In 2026, only 13 Democratic held seats up for election compared to 20 for Republicans (22 if you include JD Vance’s Ohio seat and Marco Rubio’s Florida seat). In addition, the 2026 election cycle is a during a midterm election hence the opposing party to the president usually performs well.\n\nMost seats up for election are uncompetitive so the Republicans should retain: Alabama, Alaska, Arkansas, Florida (special election - Rubio’s seat), Idaho, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, Montana, Nebraska, Oklahoma, South Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, West Virginia and Wyoming. This leaves them on 49 seats.\n\nLikewise the Democrats should retain: Colorado, Delaware, Illinois, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, Oregon, Rhode Island and Virginia. This leaves them on 45 seats.\n\nTherefore, there are 6 seats up for grabs including: Georgia, Iowa, Maine, Michigan, North Carolina and Ohio (special election - JD Vance’s seat). Democrats need to win all 6 just to get a majority which is challenging.\n\nGeorgia and Michigan are likely to remain Democratic. North Carolina has the potential to flip to the Democrats and they have ran close in the last few elections. Maine should be an easy Democratic win is complicated by the fact that Susan Collins is running for re-election and is popular in their state. Iowa is difficult and could only be flipped in a blue wave election. Ohio is trending Republican but if Sherod Brown stands, the Democrats have a chance to flip the state. Brown outperformed Harris in this state this cycle.\n\nSo what is the likely outcome of the 2026 US Senate elections? Do Democrats have a chance to gain seats and potentially flip control of the chamber?",

      "text": "As a non-American observing from Germany, I’m curious about the potential for military resistance in the face of Trump’s return to power. Could the U.S. military realistically take action to oppose him if they see his administration as a threat to democracy?\n\nI’m fascinated by the impact of U.S. politics on the world stage, and the potential consequences of the upcoming 2024 election. Given Donald Trump’s controversial track record and polarizing influence, I wonder whether a potential military response could arise if he were to return to power.\n\nFrom my understanding, Trump has often been at odds with the military community. He’s insulted veterans, notably referring to them as “suckers” and “losers,” and repeatedly clashed with military leaders on strategic and operational decisions. His previous administration saw notable instances of military figures speaking out against him—both retired and active-duty personnel. This has made me wonder if the military might view Trump’s leadership as a serious enough threat to consider drastic action if he attempts anything that undermines democratic norms.\n\nCould (or would) the military potentially step in to prevent perceived authoritarian overreach? Or would such a scenario be too far-fetched in a country with deeply ingrained democratic principles and a historical separation between civilian leadership and military authority?",

Will it neutralize any advantage Harris might have gained over the controversial comedian's joke and intensified Trump's supporters to vote for him? Will it become the equivalent of Clinton's \"Deplorables\" comment?\n\nWhat impact do you think Biden's remark will have on voters? Will Harris be asked about it and how should she respond? How will Trump energize his supporters to rally to him?\n\nN.B., while some may dispute whether Biden referred to \"his supporters\" or \"his supporter's\", the plain meaning in the video tips it towards that Biden was referring to Trump's supporters due to his known dislike of Trump, regardless of trying to shade or downplay the meaning.",

      "text": "I recently came across a video explaining something called the 'Russian tail' in election data analysis, and it got me thinking—how often does this pattern appear in elections worldwide? If it's been documented in contested elections before, could it be a sign of deeper systemic issues? And more importantly, could similar anomalies have influenced past U.S. elections—or even shape future ones?\n\nA Russian tail is a statistical anomaly often observed in elections with suspected fraud. Normally, vote distributions follow a smooth bell curve, but in some cases, an extra spike appears—suggesting that votes may have been shifted in specific precincts. This pattern has been documented in Russian elections, Georgia elections and and some watchdog groups claim to have seen similar anomalies in Romania most recently. There were independent journalists and analysts that reported they noticed the same anomalies in the November 2024 U.S election.\n\nWith all the concerns about election integrity and foreign interference—especially disinformation campaigns aimed at making people distrust results—do you think statistical anomalies like this could impact public confidence in the U.S. electoral process? Even if fraud isn’t proven, does simply showing these data patterns create enough doubt to destabilize democracy?\n\nCurious to hear what others think! Have you seen any credible research on this in U.S. elections? Could this be a real issue, or is it just another layer of political chaos?",

      "text": "Betting markets think there's a coin-flip-ish probability that if the vice-president Harris wins the election, she won't be elected with a Democrat senate. The last time a Democrat was elected president without control of the senate was when president Grover Cleveland was first elected in 1884. \n\nMaking the assumption that the probability of democrats keeping the senate and losing the white house is negligible, PolyMarket has a 25% probability that Dems win the Senate, with  a 51% probability that the VP wins the election. This means ~50% probability she wins the election without Senate control.\n\nBut from election day until January 5th, Democrats will continue to have control of the White House and the Senate. Beyond January 20th, there might be other ways that Kamala Harris might manage to make her political appointments.\n\nWhat would happen to the cabinet, agency, military, diplomatic, and all other positions that require Senate approval in this (in the past 140 years) unprecedented situation?",

Given that older voters traditionally show higher turnout in elections, what kind of impact do you think this will have on this year's election?\n\nWill the pandemic’s toll on older Americans shift how this demographic votes, or even affect turnout due to loss within this group? Could the response to COVID, especially in its early stages, influence whether older voters lean more toward one party or another?\n\nWhich political party do you think stands to gain or lose the most from this dynamic?

      "text": "Romania recently voided the first round of their presidential elections when the constitutional court found that illegal and unconstitutional foreign influence had pervaded the election, and that the candidate with the most votes in the first round also is basically attempting to overthrow the constitutional structure (in this case, getting rid of the idea of Romania as a multi party system). That candidate basically came out of nowhere with no discernable source of financing or expenditures. \n\nYou could see a lot of obsession in 1787 with the idea of a country keeping foreign powers from messing with the election. They had the president be necessarily a natural born citizen, or a citizen at the time of the adoption of the constitution as a grandfather clause (Hamilton was eligible). They required them to be a resident for 14 years as well, with senators being 9 years a citizen and representatives 7. The electors also crucially never met in the same place, they all voted in the state capitals and mailed the federal capital where Congress would count them and presumably vote between the top candidates if nobody had a majority. The military would have a lot of difficulty in attempting anything like a coup or forcing a person to be elected president, and foreign powers would have a hard time too. They could see how Poland-Lithuania was being carved up by Prussia, Austria, and Russia, and the Holy Roman Empire's prince electors were often rulers of foreign realms too and was becoming increasingly incapable.\n\nMuch of the European empires which reached their peak from 1840 to 1970 also took advantage of internal division in many cases. In Zanzibar, the British backed a rival to the sultan to become sultan himself, who would not have become or stayed sultan without British support and this did what the British told him to do, and similar tactics were used elsewhere like in India, and foreign powers also tried to mess with Greece in 1862 when they ordered them to elect a different king. The Franco-Prussian War also started when France tried to veto a Hohenzollern for the crown of Spain.\n\nWhat tools and enforcement mechanism do you see as most effective to safeguard this element?",

      "text": "After the 2012 presidential election, the Democratic candidate (Obama) won 322 electoral college votes, while the Republican candidate (Romney) won 206. For the GOP to win the presidency in 2016, they needed to flip 64 electoral college votes.\n\nBefore Trump was even considered the credible GOP nominee and transformed it into a populist party, the blue wall states of Michigan (16 EV), Pennsylvania (20 EV) and Wisconsin (10 EV) weren’t competitive for Republicans. Instead, the expected competitive states were Ohio (18 EV), Florida (29 EV), Iowa (6 EV), Virginia (13 EV), Colorado (8 EV) and Nevada (6 EV). Winning all of them would have been enough to clinch the presidency, but only four states were considered realistically winnable: Ohio, Florida, Iowa and Nevada. This would have given them 59 additional EVs, five short of the needed votes.\n\nThe GOP needed to win Virginia or Colorado, which had been trending Democratic since 2008, so it would have faced an uphill battle to defeat them. Their path to victory seemed narrow until Trump became the nominee. Trump picked up Ohio, Florida and Iowa, which any Republican would have expected to win anyway. Still, his populist rhetoric made the three blue wall states worth a combined (46 EVs) competitive. This widened the Republicans' path to victory at the presidential level. In 2016, Trump sacrificed losing Colorado and Virginia to gain Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin, worth double the electoral college votes.\n\nSo, did Trump revive the GOP as an electoral force at the Presidential level, and will this continue once he is no longer the GOP nominee for president?",

      "text": "Direct democracy was practiced in ancient Athens (although definitely not close to a complete one, because it excluded women, slaves, and others), where thousands of people would gather to debate and set laws. Would this be possible on a larger scale? Referendums already exist, but this would be as the main form of government. Obviously a fair number of people would choose not to participate, but that's currently the case with huge percentages of people choosing not to vote, and it was also the case in ancient Athens where many people chose not to participate politically.\n\nPotentially weekly debates would happen on a set schedule.\n\nWould this just disenfranchise people who wouldn't be able to get the time off to take part in the debates? Or maybe the country would make it a priority to allow everyone to take part who wanted to. Would the logistics of that kind of thing just be impossible? From actually having meaningful debates to preventing fraud, etc? Could this potentially work on the state level?",

However, once early and mail in ballots were counted, Trumps lead disappeared and he lost.\n\nDue to covid, 2020 saw huge amounts of early voting, mail in voting, and lots of voting other than election day. Now that we are back in \"normal\" times, how likely is a mirage of any sorts on election night 2024?\n\nEspecially since this time around Trump is not crusading against early voting, but has infact endorsed it, lots of states that made voting easier during covid have tightened up laws, and no outbreak of disease making people afraid of crowds.\n\nSo come election night 2024, while we may not know the winner, at the end of the night, will the trend be the accurate one, or could there be another mirage?",

Granted, these thoughts are held for extremely different reasons: the right thinks it’s flawed because their guy says so, with no hard evidence or examples. The left thinks it flawed because the US has a history of disenfranchising large categories of people such as women, Blacks, Native Americans, people of color, etc, all who have had to fight and struggle for their right to vote. This disenfranchisement continues today, most notably with felon disenfranchisement laws in various states, as well as measures to simply limit and restrict voting.\n\nAnd let’s not forget that the Electoral College was constructed specifically to prevent the ‘will of the people’ from winning an election, and/or -ironically- to prevent someone wholly unfit to hold office, or a foreign power who would subvert the popular vote to become president.\n\nFinally, something not discussed enough: the current election system with it’s two-year cycle, is a multi-hundred billion dollar industry, an industry that feeds on this rather dysfunctional system. Lots of people make lots of money with the status quo, no matter how unpopular and flawed it is. The US does not have a habit of disrupting industries that are so money-driven, especially when those who make the laws also profit from that industry.\n\nBut will the US ever actually do something about it?\n\nAnd if so, what’s the most likely change that the US will make?",

      "title": "Trump won on a wave of dissatisfaction with the government and a desire for change.   How can democrats restore that faith and what changes should they propose?",
      "text": "There have been many conversations about why Harris lost.  However, one of the most compelling ones I’ve found is that Trump was an antiestablishment candidate who promised change against a system that is extremely unpopular.  Democrats were left defending institutions that are unpopular and failed to convince the working class and the majority of Americans that they are on their side.  Democrats never gave the American public the idea of what a new reformed government could look like under Harris.  Trumps cabinet picks have primarily been focused on outsides and victims of the systems that they intend to run.  It’s clear that the appeal here is that Gabbard/RFK/Musk is going to clear out all the unpopular bureaucracy, inefficiencies and poor management of these institutions.  For the most part, Americans are receptive of this message.  Trump was elected by the plurality of the vote.  Musk, RFK, and Rogan all have strong bases of support for being non conventional.  Poll after poll voters have expressed extreme desire for significant change. \n\nAfter listening to Ezra Kleins latest podcast, they aren’t exactly wrong.  Americans don’t trust democrats or the government in power.  California and New York are the two most populous blue states that have the highest amount of people leaving.  People see how projects like a speed rail has wasted billions of dollars and nothing to show for it after decades.  They see how it cost $2 million dollars just to build a toilet.  Despite these two states being economic and societal powerhouses, there’s a reason that people are leaving that politicians are missing.  \n\nBut it’s not just at the state level.  Federal projects end up taking literally years due to the momentous amount of hoops and bureaucracy.  Despite the CHIPS act being passed over 2 years ago, most of the money still hasn’t been spent because of just how inefficient it’s being handled.  Simple things like investing in EVs end up being a confusing mixture of requirements bot h for consumers and companies that constantly moves on a yearly basis.  \n\nI used to think that M4A struggled to gain momentum because of the cost but it’s clear to me now that the hesitation that people have towards it is that they simply do not trust the government to run a system effectively or efficiently.  Thats another reason why gun restrictions may be popular but rarely are motivating because people do not trust the government to enact that laws.  I recall people talking about a government funded childcare and people are immediately worried about all the strings and bureaucracy that comes with it.  It’s a very common joke that anything the government does will be done poorly and take twice as long.  Even when the child tax credit wasn’t renewed because people didnt care enough.  \n\nIf people are so dissatisfied with the government and the status quo, why should democrats expect voters to give them more power?  So what can democrats do to restore the faith of the American public in government?  How can democrats make it take a year to rebuild a bridge, like the I95 collapse, instead of a decade?  What changes should democrats propose to make it clear that government is working for them and if not, can be held accountable?  What can democratic governors do to prevent the mass exodus from their states?",

      "text": "President Donald Trump's address this evening labeled: \"The Renewal of the American Dream,\" was full of grand visions ranging from a great national economy and global peace as well as discussing his accomplishments \\[during his second term first 43 days in office\\]. \n\nTrump noted he had probably accomplished more in six weeks than most presidents accomplish in 4 or even 8 years. That he had the mandate to act. Highlighting the number of Executive Orders he signed. Calling Biden the worst president in U.S. history. He blamed Biden for the price of eggs and inflation and that he left the economy in shambles and now he is working to reverse inflation by lowering the energy prices and price of gas. \n\nHe said it is called drill baby drill. He complimented Musk for eliminating appalling waste. Cting several examples such as funding DEI and assisting the undocumented and characters of Sesame Street...among many others.  \n\nHe bragged about withdrawing from the Climate Change Accord and \"Corrupt World Health Organization\" ceasing all federal foreign aid and federal hiring freeze. That he brought back free speech and asserted that government censorship has ended. He touted the new name of the Gulf of Mexico and how he finished off DEI via Executive Order. And that there are now only two Genders \"Male and Female.\" Trump also noted that now increasing number of soldiers guarding the Southern borders. Resulting in significant decrease of illegal immigrants. He also declared war on the Cartels and MS 13 calling them same as ISIS Terrorists. \n\nHe also promised to balance the budget. He is also calling for no tax on tips, none on social security retirement income and tax deductions for interest on car payments if made in American. Along with across-the-board tax cut \\[like last time\\]. \n\nHe belittled the CHIPS Act and referred to Taiwan that will be investing 100 billion in a factory for CHIPS in AZ.  He also talked of new tariffs in the future against Brazil, India and EU calling it reciprocal tariffs beginning April 2, 2025. Tariffs have already been imposed and include Canada, China and Mexico. Trump asserted that tariffs protect American jobs and helps the economy. \n\nTrump also mentioned that Ukraine is now ready to sign the mineral deal under his leadership and that he will build on the Abrams Accord in the Middle East. Trump added towards the end of his speech that he was saved in Butler by God to make America Great Again. \n\nObservers, however, express concerns over tariffs as they mount in a tit for tat trade war escalating with Canada, Mexico and China \\[and EU under threat of trade war as well\\], could weigh on the U.S. economy adversely impacting the national economy and the world at large, absent a quick cessation.\n\nMore specifically the U.S. imposed tariffs of 25 percent of Canadian goods with the exception for energy products, which face a 10 percent tariff. Trump also put a 25 percent tariff on imports from Mexico and an additional 10 percent on Chinese goods; raising the total to from 20 to 25%.\n\nWithin minutes of the United States hiking tariffs Beijing announced a slew of retaliatory measures. The moves included a 10-15 per cent increase in tariffs on certain US imports, export restrictions on some critical minerals, the addition of two US companies to a Chinese government blacklist, and an antitrust investigation targeting American tech giant Google. According to economists China’s moves were carefully calibrated – as some of them will hit areas that US President Donald Trump most cares about.\n\nCanadian Prime Minister Trudeau said Ottawa would respond with immediate 25% tariffs on $20.7 billion worth of U.S. imports and on another $86.2 billion if Trump's tariffs were still in place in 21 days. Adding that Americans will pay more for gas and groceries as a result. Separately, Premier Doug Ford canceled $100 million Starlink contract in tariff response \"It’s done, it’s gone.”\n\nPresident Claudia Sheinbaum said Mexico will respond with its own retaliatory tariffs on U.S. goods. She will announce the products Mexico will target on Sunday in a public event in Mexico City’s Central Plaza. Perhaps, giving time to Trump to reconsider.\n\nGiven concerns over tariffs, Musk initiated government dismantling, Ukranian uncertainty and Gaza conflict can one or more of his visions still come to fruition?     \n\n[https://www.realclearpolitics.com/video/2025/03/04/watch\\_live\\_president\\_trump\\_addresses\\_joint\\_session\\_of\\_congress.html](https://www.realclearpolitics.com/video/2025/03/04/watch_live_president_trump_addresses_joint_session_of_congress.html)\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wz\\_42pckM7w](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wz_42pckM7w)",

      "text": "I’ve been thinking a lot about how democracy works in practice. We always say it’s “majority rule,” but then there are times when what the majority wants can be harmful or unfair to certain groups. For example, laws passed by vote that restrict rights for minorities, or politicians who ignore smaller communities because they don’t have as many votes. I’m wondering where the line should be drawn—how do you make sure a government reflects what most people want without trampling on the rights of others? And are there any examples of countries that have handled this balance really well (or badly)?",

      "text": "The concept of \"[creative destruction](https://umatechnology.org/insights-on-creative-destruction-and-technology/),\" coined by economist Joseph Schumpeter, highlights the cycle of innovation that distrupts established industries, paving a way for new ones. Is it government's place to manage the cycle's consequences?\n\nOne one hand, shielding existing industries from creative destruction can preserve jobs, maintain economic stabiility, and protect communities reliant on traditionals sectors. As an example, government subsidies for coal mining aimed to safeguard livelihoods in regions that depend on fossil fuel industry. But many suggest such interventions often came at the cost of stifling innovation and delaying adoption of more cleaner more efficient technologies.\n\nOn the other hand, embracing innovation by investing in supporting infrastructure has lead to long-term benefits, such as increased productivity, improved standards of living, and emergence of entirely new industries. The rise of the internet, revolutionized commerce, media, and entertainment. But it rendered many traditional businesses obsolete.\n\nBelow are excepts from the linked article that touches on creative destruction within automotive and healthcare:\n\n>**Autonomous Driving**: Companies like Waymo and Uber are exploring self-driving technology, potentially rendering traditional driving models and even car ownership obsolete.  \n  \n**Telemedicine**: The COVID-19 pandemic accelerated the adoption of telehealth, resulting in clinics and hospitals re-evaluating their operational models. This shift has made healthcare more accessible but could also endanger traditional healthcare practices.",

The top 1% of households now hold more wealth than the bottom 90% combined, with a significant portion of new wealth disproportionately benefiting the ultra-wealthy. This has sparked debates about the role of government in addressing the widening gap. In the 2020 election, for example, candidates like Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren proposed policies such as a wealth tax, which aimed to tax fortunes over a certain threshold to fund social programs and infrastructure. On the other hand, candidates like Donald Trump focused on reducing corporate taxes to stimulate economic growth, arguing that wealth created at the top would trickle down through job creation and investment.

      "text": "Should the US government have policies in place to promote the manufacture, purchase and use of electric vehicles over combustion engine vehicles, and why or why not?  \n  \nEach respondent of course will bring their own unique reasoning, but here is my attempt to provide some limited summary of some of the arguments on both sides: \n\nSome of the criticisms of the US government having policies to promote electric vehicles emphasize that principles of capitalism and free markets should be respected, and that policies which involve the government favoring one technology over another are an inappropriate violation of basic principles of the American system.  Some of these criticisms also emphasize the importance of US consumers having a choice when they go to make purchases in the free market.  Other arguments brought to bear against installation of pro-ev policies include (but are not limited to):  \n\\- the prices of vehicles are claimed driven up by forcing manufacturers to build a new technology, and consumers are harmed greatly.\n\\- intervention is generally bad for automaker business.  Let the automakers compete and stay out of it.  \n\\- in this case, there is presently insufficent demand for the promoted product at present prices, and so the forcing of manufacture of the product is particularly harmful to the producers, and to the jobs they speak for, and to the economy which depends on well-functioning producers and employee forces.\n\\- there are questions of whether a transition to electric vehicles actually addresses the environmental challenges it is claimed to address.  \n\\- some may simply not think much of EVs, and do not see the point of policies which support them.\n[etc.]\n\nSupport for various EV support policies sometimes relies heavily on the perceived importance of addressing a claimed life-and-death global climate emergency.  Other arguments include (but are not limited to):   \n\\- the importance of accelerating American competitiveness in what appears to be a growing and very competitive new global technology,   \n\\- the importance of addressing additional (other than climate change) environmental problems caused by combustion engine vehicles such as contributions to urban air pollution.    \n\\- some may think EV technology is simply better in many ways and think that market intervention is appropriate to promote a disruptive new technology that they see as proven superior, but which established manufacturers (satisfied in the short-term with the old ways) are reluctant to bring to market.\n\\- some may disagree sharply with the claims that EV demand is insufficient or that policies supporting EVs are harmful to the producers, or the economy, or to net jobs.  They may see the loss of jobs as unrelated to a transition to EV and more part of an issue that inevitably comes up due to automation, manufacturing progress and product simplification and cost-reduction.\n[etc.]",

And if Musk were trying to do something similar to Cheney by exerting influence on the President’s policymaking, do you think the Legislative Branch would be able to prevent it in an effort to avoid a repeat of what happened during the Bush Administration? Why or why not?\n\nIf not, do you believe it is within the realm of possibility that Trump and Musk are instead working in tandem to attempt something akin to state capture?

      "text": "Recent announcements of Trump's picks for his cabinet have faced criticism due to the potential appointees being unfit for the roles, either due to lack of experience in the domain and/or navigating the federal bureaucracy, or national security concerns. The most prominent example being Pete Hegseth for Secretary of Defense, as well as Kristi Noem for Homeland Security, Tulsi Gabbard for Director of National Intelligence, and Matt Gaetz for Attorney General. How much of a hindrance will their lack of experience really be when it comes to achieving the goals of the Trump administration? Additionally, how will possible contention between the cabinet positions and senior career officials of the respective departments affect things? \n\n\n\nThere are already reports of officials and staffers at [DoD](https://www.politico.com/news/2024/11/13/pentagon-hegseth-lack-of-experience-00189424) and [DoJ](https://www.politico.com/news/2024/11/10/trump-return-justice-department-00188623) expressing lack of trust in the announced cabinet picks, but also some floating around the idea that they should stay in their positions and try to employ passive resistance, lest someone worse take their place. Are the remaining senior-most officials of the departments going to become the de facto leaders, with the cabinet positions and the leaders they install being given the illusion of control? Will there be more occurrences of malicious compliance, shadow agendas, and other forms of subversion? I'm reminded of how during the last Trump presidency, the [presidential daily briefings were significantly simplified](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-cia-briefings-challenge/) so he could consume them. Will we see similar things happen to the cabinet appointees? In the cases where career officials believe the administration's actions would damage national security, would they begrudgingly comply, or covertly defy them as much as possible? \n\n\n\nOf course it goes against the principles of democracy to have unelected workers and officials attempt to oppose agendas that have the mandate of the public. But considering the expert opinions that the goals of the Trump administration would be detrimental to the US in the long term, I suspect some in the military and federal civilian workforce might try to mitigate the damage as much as possible.",

I ask in part because of the generalization that those on the fence aren't always the most engaged voters on all of the key issues, understand the roles of the judicial branch, House and Senate, what the majorities are going to look like, or how the courts will affect the country. What areas to you lean on and how do you communicate this?\n\nKey points to consider:\n\nThe federal judiciary - How does one communicate the impact of the judicial balance? The federal judiciary is still largely Republican-stacked, including critically, the 6-3 Republican Supreme Court that has already made extremely controversial rulings many legal scholars say are based on questionable and inconsistent application of the law. They've also already ruled on granting Trump practical immunity from any crimes in office and are set to green light most executive actions he attempts. How does this judicial balance affect a Trump vs Harris presidency?\n\nSenate control - The Senate is very likely to be in Republican hands due to a very favorable 2024 map. So they would greenlight nearly all of Trump cabinet and judicial picks. Harris nominees that one imagines are too progressive or not qualified would be blocked. Similarly, they would block any legislation one believes would be too progressive that the House might pass (unclear which party will have the majority there).\n\nFitness for office - Examples: qualifications, understanding and adherence to the law, support of democratic institutions\n\nCharacter\n\nPolicies and Issues - healthcare, budget proposals and deficit impact, abortion, etc.\n\nAddress voter high priority concerns like inflation, pointing out the primary drivers of the global supply chain crisis and how each president might have impacted that or impact inflation going forward. Note job growth and real wage growth.\n\nProject 2025 \n\nOthers?\n\nWhich of these areas do you think reaches swing voters who value moderation and how do you go about communicating with them? I mean, one might argue that federal judiciary and Senate control are critical in this case, but not sure those voters understand what's at stake or how one might communicate that.",

They don't usually run in general elections nor are proposed during them.\n\nEdit two: There are a lot of misconceptions going on with the reactions here. Technocratic government in this context is about the origin of policy direction, which in a technocratic government has essentially nothing to do with the executive as they just apply the law as written, leaving the political initiative to do anything to the party leaders and the legislators. They keep things the way they run normally except as the political will is expressed by the partisans. No person is completely impartial, but they are generally accepted by most of the parties, and are not usually tied to any party's membership or electoral campaign, and held positions of respect like the chair of a central bank or the director of an intelligence council, and they don't have support from sources except through what they independently prove by achieving results in their administration and the confidence the parties have in them. They aren't going to popular rallies, people often have little interest in the technocratic leader and would not side with them in any political showdown, and no party claims them as one of their own, and they don't have a bunch of bureaucrats or governors loyal to them nor is their support from the military or espionage agencies.",

      "text": "Could common expenses that burden Americans—such as energy and healthcare costs—be reduced if the federal government took a more hands-on role in investing in transformative technologies like fusion energy and alternative medical treatments, such as cellular therapy for cancer, gene therapy for aging, biotechnology for neurological and physical disorders, among others?\n\nAlthough the development of fusion energy would likely cut into the profits of the natural gas industry, fusion is cleaner, more powerful, and potentially more cost-effective than fossil fuels. Similarly, current healthcare treatments and pharmaceutical costs place a significant burden on the American people. If the government were to invest in accelerating the development of more effective treatments, it could substantially reduce overall healthcare costs, lower pharmaceutical prices, and even bring down insurance premiums due to the availability of more efficient therapies. Such advancements could also help move the needle toward achieving universal healthcare.\n\nWhile the government already subsidizes many tech, healthcare, and pharmaceutical companies, to my knowledge, it invests relatively little in the development of fusion technology compared to its heavy support of the natural gas industry—an industry that would be directly and negatively affected by a breakthrough in clean, reliable alternative energy. Likewise, pharmaceutical and healthcare companies could see reduced profits if new treatments lead to fewer doctor visits and less reliance on prescription drugs.\n\nShould the government create contracts to directly support the development of fusion technology and life-changing medical innovations? Such contracts would encourage private sector competition, promote innovation, and drive economic growth. This approach also uses economic demand to force change, offering a more effective way to push for environmental and healthcare progress by building market-driven alternatives that challenge existing industries. These technologies wouldn’t just lower everyday costs for Americans; They could also expand opportunities for people to pursue healthier, freer, and more fulfilling lives.",

      "text": ">[150-year-olds are not receiving Social Security payments ](https://www.marketplace.org/2025/02/20/150-year-olds-are-not-receiving-social-security-payments/)\n\n>This week, he tweeted a spreadsheet showing how many people in the system are in each age bracket. [More than 1.3 million ](https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1891350795452654076)people are marked as between the ages of 150 and 159, while almost 2,800 are listed as 200 and older. \n\n>“If you take all of those millions of people off Social Security, all of a sudden we have a very powerful Social Security with people that are 80 and 70 and 90, but not 200 years old,” Trump said. \n\n>But data on the Social Security Administration’s website shows [that only about 89,000 people over the age of 99 ](https://www.ssa.gov/oact/progdata/benefits/primaries.html)are receiving payments on the basis of their earnings. And there are [only an estimated 108,000 centenarians](https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2024/01/09/us-centenarian-population-is-projected-to-quadruple-over-the-next-30-years/) living in the U.S., according to United Nations data, while the oldest known human being lived [to the age of 122](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/02/21/longevity-expert-3-reasons-the-worlds-oldest-person-lived-to-122.html). \n\n>Wired magazine reported that the number of people in the 150-year age bracket [may have to do with the programming language](https://www.wired.com/story/elon-musk-doge-social-security-150-year-old-benefits/) used by the SSA, known as COBOL, or the Common Business Oriented Language. The 65-year-old system [can still be found at government agencies, businesses and financial institutions. ](https://www.marketplace.org/shows/marketplace-tech/the-65-year-old-computer-system-at-the-heart-of-american-business/)\n\n>Basically, when there is a missing or incomplete birthdate, COBOL defaults to a reference point. The most common is May 20, 1875, when countries around the world [attended a convention on metric standards](https://usma.org/laws-and-bills/metric-convention-of-1875). Someone born in 1875 would be 150 in 2025, which is why entries with missing and incomplete birthdates will default to that age, Wired explained. \n\nWhat's the strategy here? Are they claiming fraud to justify program wide cuts to Social Security? Or will they claim they reduced Social Security fraud to highlight the effectiveness of DOGE?\n\nEdit:\n\nThank you kindly for the discussion, I appreciate everyone's viewpoints and answers to my questions.\n\nMy personal beliefs are the status quo is taking us down the wrong path, we need to change to a more empathetic and environmentally conscious future. We need to do this nonviolently and inclusively, and the more we are active about sharing the facts the better off we will be. We need people to understand that billionaires are only there because the workers are sacrificing a majority of their labor value to keep a job and collect Social Security. If you take SS away, just like taking away pensions or losing a major investment into a stock market dive—there will be public outrage. We must rise above the violence and  always remain civil whenever possible. The pardoning of the J6 folks was a slippery slope to the protection of democracy, essentially condoning their actions because their leader is now in power... that is a threat to democracy if I have ever seen one.  That said, never be afraid to rise up from those who seek to tread on you...\n\nI highly recommend the film Civil War from 2024.  Not only is it a cinematographic masterpiece but also serves as a borderline absurdist take on the USA if say, a third Trump term was introduced....",

      "text": "Athens is known for being a progenitor of democracy, but Athens did not elect most of its officials. The main ones who were would have been the strategoi, generals. Note that those who were voting were also its civil militia and they would have been soldiers too who knew what battle was like. The Boule had hundreds of members chosen by lot (having been elected in big batches, drawing some of those elected to the Boule) and this functioned as the governing senate of Athens. Juries of 201, 501, 1001, and 1501 people were also common, with the presiding magistrate also chosen by lot. They viewed elections as a risky way to govern a polity given that people could be bribed or intimidated to vote a certain way or otherwise to elect people who were risky people, but nobody could bribe the gods to choose one person over another in the drawing of lots, and an assembly of hundreds of people with time and ability to deliberate and seek information could make decisions likely to be representative of the whole people and not concerned over the short term political wish to be reelected or to otherwise climb in power.\n\nIn the modern era, we have juries, with jurors who are biased struck from the pool before the trial commences, but that isn't the only opportunity to use random chance. Some countries have turned to the idea of lottery to choose a large panel of people to deliberate on issues where it is seen that politicians might not be so good at, especially issues related to the rules of how politicians get put in office in the first place. In British Columbia, 19 years ago, a citizens assembly recommended a voting reform that was put to referendum and agreed to by 57% of voters, but the threshold had been set at 60% which was widely denounced as unconstitutional and illegitimate given that no such threshold was used to put the current system of voting into place and so why could it be legitimate to need 60% to change it? \n\nIreland used a citizens assembly to consider several issues, pertaining to whether snap elections can happen and if so how, how climate change reactions could occur, abortion laws, how pensions could be dealt with, and a few other things. They did divide over a few issues, but many votes actually had quite strong consensus. For months, they listened to people who presented their views, including experts, members of the public, affected people, members of the government, etc. \n\nIn principle, a citizens assembly could be given the power to compel information too from witnesses and to compel evidence too, or to demand a government official testify under oath on pain of perjury for lying or misleading them. Maybe they could do a budget analysis and plan and suggest that to the legislature or executive. They rarely have the power to make a binding decision of policy, but they may have their recommendation referred to a legislature or executive or the people for ratification. Maybe they could even be a third house of a legislature, even if it is more advisory or its decisions need approval by the people or the other houses to become policy or law.",

Does that, say, 25% tariff that's being added to the sale go to the US government?  If the money goes to the government, isn't that just a tax?  Does it mean that the government can do whatever they want with that money since it's not our tax dollars being allocated by Congress? \n\nWho benefits from these tariffs since it will take years for US companies to set up these manufacturing facilities, and they're likely going to being using machines and AI instead of hiring production employees.  If we become isolationists with these tariffs and these products are obviously already being produced somewhere else for cheaper, we'll have a significantly smaller market to sell these products to, basically just within the US. My feeling on this is that it will be impossible to make all products 100% here in the US.  Manufacturers will still order parts from other countries with a 25% tariff (or whatever it is), then the pieces that are made here will be more expensive because of the workforce and wages, so we will inevitably be paying more for products no matter which way you spin it.  So, who exactly wants these tariffs?  There has to be a a group of people somewhere that will benefit because it's not being stopped.",

      "text": "In Canada, amendments to the constitution take a few forms. The standard is 2/3 of the provinces which cumulatively have a majority of the population, their legislatures ratify an amendment which is also passed by the House of Commons. A few amendments need consent from all the legislatures and the House of Commons, and a few things particular to specific provinces like getting rid of a requirement to operate a ferry only needed that particular province's consent and the consent of the House of Commons. 1 amendment exactly has been passed by the first rule, one about Indigenous rights in 1983, and that's it. 0 have been ratified unanimously, and a few minor things about name changes and really technical things involved the last formula.\n\nAmerica's constitutional amendments need proposal from either a convention called on demand of 2/3 of the state legislatures or proposed by 2/3 of each house of congress, then ratification by 3/4 of the states by their legislatures or conventions held for the purpose of considering ratification. The last time this happened was in 1992, and that was with an amendment proposed 200 years ago, the last time an amendment was even proposed to the states was in the 1970s for 18-20 year olds to be able to vote following the Vietnam War.\n\nIndia has a similar rule to Canada. 2/3 of both houses of the Indian Parliament agree to the proposed amendment, then a majority of state legislatures ratify it. Mexico has basically the same rule. India has had over 100 amendments since 1947, Mexico 250, with an amendment in each case often a couple of times per year, maybe a couple of years between amendments at times of low activity. Argentina and Brazil are also federations, and they have amended their constitutions in significant ways, much more so in Brazil, despite the supermajorities needed in vastly divided societies, although in those cases the subnational governments don't have to ratify them. Germany needs 2/3 of the Bundestag to agree, and 2/3 of the state cabinets have to agree by a formula that weighs them, which isn't technically a senate but acts to some degree like one, and has made amendments dozens of times since 1949, usually once every few years at least. And Malaysia too has a large number of amendments despite being a federation too.",

      "text": "Harris discussed Increasing a tax deduction for new small businesses to $50,000, up from $5,000. Harris also talked of her plan to address the nation’s housing shortage including increased housing \\[3 millions by end of firsts term\\]. As well as 25,000 down payments for first time home buyer. Referring to the American Rescue Plan’s child tax credit increase to $3,600, up from $2,000, and call for it to be made permanent \\[occurred once in 2021\\]. She also attacked Trump's sales tax \\[dubbed tariffs\\] and Tax cuts to the super rich. She called her own plan an economic opportunity and the support it has garnered. She said Donald has no plan except for himself and a bunch of grievances.  \n\nShe also touched on immigration and abortion rights responding to the questions and blamed Trump \\[hand selected 3 Supreme Court Justices\\]. She also referred to Project 2025 to which Trump denied he ever looked at it.\n\nOn OBAMA Care, Trump said he did not approve of it, but acknowledged he did not have a plan but had a concept in his head about how to replace it. Harris noted he tried to overturn it 60 times.  \n\nTrump promised to enact an efficiency commission to reduce government spending. At the same time, he said he intends to repeal Biden’s tax hikes for tackling inflation and end what he called Biden’s “war” on American energy production. He also promised to stop Social Security Benefits tax. Trump said he will create the greatest economy in the world. He stated that under the Biden economy people are dying because they cannot afford bacon and eggs.\n\nTrump appeared frustrated with Harris hard hitting responses and he began calling Harris names such as a Marxist, called her father a Marxist too \\[he was a professor of economics\\] He added she is letting criminals in.  To which Harris noted she is the only one on the stage who has prosecuted transnational drug dealers, she noted that Trump called his friends in Congress to kill the bipartisan immigration bill for his talking point. Trump's come back was that the immigrants were killing and eating the pets. The panel rejected that as false on the stage having talked to the mayor of the locality at issue. \n\nTrump was questioned about his mass deportation plan, and he said yes, he would do it sending federal law enforcements, local police and national guard door to door to deport 11 million plus people. He also defended the people who rioted on January 6, 2021, claiming they were singled out. \n\nHe added he had nothing to do with the riot \\[he wanted peaceful protest\\]. In the end he blamed Nancy Pelosi. Harris in her response held Trump responsible for the insurrection and interjected Charlottesville during the conversation. When asked if he now acknowledges he lost the 2020 election, Trump denied on the stage he ever lost the election though he said, he lost by a whisker earlier during the week.  \n\nAs to wars Trump said it would never happen if he were in charge and that he could stop the Ukraine war before he even enters office.  Harris said Trump would just surrender Ukraine and that she believed in Ukraine's integrity and that she supported NATO. As to Afghanistan, Harris asserted Trump made the weakest deal to withdraw.  \n\nOn Climate change Harris noted that Trump has called it a hoax. Harris is said to have called it an existential threat and referred to the greatest legislation addressing climate change that the administration passed.  \n\nOn question of race and color Harris seemed to have hit a home run and recited Trump's history of race bating. Harris instead talked of unity and strength of diversity and how to help all Americans instead of dividing it...   \n\nDid one or the other candidate effectively establish a credible plan to appeal to the undecided voters in the swing states?\n\n[Watch Live: Harris and Trump face off in their first presidential debate, hosted by ABC News (youtube.com)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6GBklYSzOGk)\n\n[WATCH LIVE: Harris and Trump debate — PBS News simulcast of ABC’s 2024 Presidential Debate (youtube.com)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8pJrIOey7OQ)",

Was it a necessity born of the war, or do you think it was a strategic choice that ultimately benefited capitalist economies?\n\n\n\nLooking forward to your insights!",

      "text": "I’ve been thinking about a long-term approach to the plastic waste problem. What if the government (hypothetically) started collecting and storing all plastic waste separately from other waste, in a compressed and efficient way, almost like a national “plastic stockpile”? The idea is that we don’t currently have the best methods for dealing with plastic pollution—whether it’s recycling, breaking it down, or reusing it—but we might in the future.\n\nBy keeping plastic waste isolated and stored, we could prevent it from polluting the environment (oceans, landfills, etc.) while also creating a resource that could be used once better technologies emerge to recycle or repurpose it. It would require large-scale infrastructure for storage and maintenance, but could this be a more responsible way to handle plastic waste while waiting for innovations to catch up?\n\nI’m curious about the practicalities of this idea, especially regarding environmental impact, cost, land use, and whether it’s a good use of resources. Could this approach be a way to future-proof our handling of plastic waste?\n\nWhat are your thoughts? Could this work, or are there better alternatives?",

The President and Congress are pushing a massive bill of tax cuts for corporations and the wealthiest Americans, while simultaneously cutting support for the most financially vulnerable in American society. American troops have been deployed on American soil for a \"riot\" that the local Governor, Mayor and Chief of Police all deny is happening. The wealthiest man in the world has been allowed to eliminate government funding and jobs for anything he deems \"waste\", without objective oversight.\n\nAnd now today, while the President presides over a military parade dedicated to the 250th Anniversary of the United States Army, on his own birthday, millions of people have marched in thousands of locations across the country, in opposition to that Presidents priorities.\n\nI seems obvious that the right-wing of American sociopolitical ideology is in power, and pushing hard for their agenda.

Concentrated in states like Pennsylvania, Ohio, and Indiana, the Amish are often exempt from certain civic norms due to religious beliefs — including compulsory education beyond 8th grade (Wisconsin v. Yoder), military service, and in some cases, even Social Security participation.\n\nThese exemptions are rarely controversial in their local settings, and most Americans accept them as reasonable accommodations for religious freedom. Yet the broader implications are complex:\n\n* How do we reconcile the Amish’s limited participation in key civic obligations with expectations of equal citizenship?\n* Would similar accommodations be politically feasible if claimed by other religious or cultural groups?\n* Does the political tolerance extended to Amish communities reflect consistency in American pluralism, or selective acceptance due to their low-profile, insular nature?\n* What does their political neutrality (many do not vote or serve in office) reveal about the American expectation of civic engagement?\n\nThe Amish example raises bigger questions: Is the American ideal of citizenship flexible enough to include those who opt out of major aspects of public life? Or does this accommodation depend on cultural familiarity and low perceived political threat?",

      "text": "One of the most well known proposals for formulae in politics might be the idea of tying the legislature's size to the cube root of population, IE the number which when multiplied by itself three times equals the population (of some designated group, be it the adult population or the total population or registered voters or something of that nature). I would suggest rounding that to a whole number, it would be rather awkward to have to deal with the 0.305 legislator left over, and I also suggest rounding up to the next odd number so you don't have tie votes (assuming there isn't an ex officio member with a tiebreaker like the VP in the Senate). As long as such a rule is in the constitution with appropriate details like when this is supposed to be calculated, this can work quite well.\n\nAnother is probably the idea of the shortest split line method for legislative districts. I don't love single member districts, but so long as we are using a mixed member proportional system, this can still work OK. I would also suggest restricting the options for what lines it can choose to be the boundaries of a district so that you don't get absurd lines that cut people's houses into different districts, such as following municipal borders, rivers, freeways, and similar. 538 redistricting has done something like this using a formula that finds the most compact district following county borders and if used in a mixed member proportional system with something like 751 representatives, of whom 435 are district representatives and 316 are apportioned to the states by population to act as proportional representation, this could work very well.\n\nAnother option is to have a rule for dividing up time in Congress for motions and decisions in an I cut, you choose system, where one of the two parties is randomly chosen to propose a schedule of meeting days and debate time divided between parties A and B and the other party gets to choose whether to be party A or B. You could use it to apportion staff, resources, office space, and other things that aren't allotted by a formula. You had better not propose a schedule you believe to be disadvantageous or unfair because otherwise you'll be stuck with the side which is unfair.\n\nVenice also had an elaborate system of lottery to choose their doge. It probably isn't a good idea these days to choose a head of state that way, but you could plausibly use something like it to perhaps choose someone like the principal auditor or a judge of an important court.\n\nMath might be discovered or invented but can you think of ways of taking advantage of it for dealing with the politics of a whole country?",

During a year which was very favorable to democrats, desantis eeked out a win when Andrew gillum was  favored. Bill Nelson lost an extremely close race. It seems like losing both of those races were devastating to democrats because after that, Republicans gained a huge advantage and 7 years later Republicans hold a 1.3 million voter advantage over democrats and Florida is a ruby red state sort of in the mold of Texas.

      "text": "My understanding of our federal government's structure is that the Founders wanted to channel self-interest into preventing the centralization of power: create separate branches, give them the ability to knock the others down a peg, and any time a branch feels like their own power is faltering or being threatened, they can kick those checks and balances into gear and level the playing field. This separation of powers was also formulated across extremely fundamental lines: those who make the laws, those who interpret the laws, and those who execute the laws. It would be quite autocratic if any of these mixed, so they are by design separate. Such a fundamental separation also makes each branch very powerful in its own right and outlines very clearly the powers that they have. Barring momentary lapses, it seems like this experimental government has indeed succeeded in avoiding autocracy and oligarchy for some 250 years.\n\n\nWith this framework in mind, you'd think that Congress, even its Republicans, would be fast-acting in impeaching and removing a President who is attempting to assume huge and unprecedented levels of legislative/regulatory authority, and who obviously wants to be the sole authority on legislation. By not acting, they are acknowledging and *allowing* the loss of a great deal of their own power. Why? Were the Founders wrong? Can allegiance outweigh self-interest? Or maybe this is an extension of self-interest; Republicans think that by attaching themselves to a king or MAGA clout, they'll gain the favor thereof. So that would be self-interest that *serves* the creation of autocracy, rather than counteracts. \n\n\nI guess the simpler explanation is that impeaching Trump would be politically unpopular among the Republican base, and they fear they might lose congressional elections, but what is even the value in being elected to a branch with its power stolen by the Executive?\n\n\nWhat do you think? I'm not exactly well-studied when it comes to politics and government, so it's very likely that I'm making some naive assumptions here.",

      "text": "Edit: Hey all, I really appreciate the comments but what I’m hoping for is *sources* to back them up. If you claim that an event happened or an individual said something, please provide a link to show it, as that builds a stronger case. Thanks!\n\nOriginal Post:\n\nI’m currently reading *How Democracies Die* by Steven Levitsky and Daniel Ziblatt, which is a great book, and in it they reference political scientist [Juan Linz’s](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juan_Jos%C3%A9_Linz) “ ‘litmus test’ for identifying antidemocratic politicians” (chapter 1, pages 21-24 specifically). Linz proposed this test, but didn’t fully develop it, back in the 1970s, and it attempts to provide an object measure for identifying any politician who has authoritarian / antidemocratic behavior. Before we get into that though, I’ll take a minute to explain the purpose of this post.\n\n \n\nThese days, there’s a fire hose of news and information each day about happenings in America. This tends to be overwhelming, but also can cause specific events to become forgotten by the onslaught of the next day’s new events; without a significant amount of evidential backing, it can be difficult or frustrating to see the broad picture of what’s happening on a federal level (without significant evidence, claims that any administration leans authoritarian can be brushed off as mere fearmongering). I’m hoping to make this post a hub for organizing and discussing information that either discredits the idea of the Trump administration leaning authoritarian, or otherwise supports it by specifically using Linz’s criteria as an objective measure.\n\n \n\nIn an attempt to do this in an organized way, I’ve listed the categories of Linz’s test below (1, 2, 3, 4) along with each’s criteria (A, B, C, D). All are listed here in the main post for easy reading, but I’ve copied each of these points and posted them as individual comments below too. Feel free to have general discussions as separate comments on this post, but if you feel like you have an example that does meet one of the criteria then please post it under my appropriately corresponding comment (for example, if you feel like there's an instance when Trump or his administration sponsored or encouraged mob attacks on opponents, post a link evidencing it specifically under my comment labeled 3.B). For the sake of having higher odds of lesser biased and more accurate sources, when citing a media source I would ask that you please use the [Ad Fontes Media](https://app.adfontesmedia.com/chart/interactive) bias chart as a guide for selecting credible sites. If you do not view the current Trump administration as leaning authoritarian, please post links supporting that idea or otherwise point out how a cited example doesn’t violate the respective criteria (doing this would by its very nature ‘make’ a case that the administration is not authoritarian through lack of supporting evidence).\n\n \n\nNow that all of that’s out of the way, here are the four categories of Linz's test, along with each’s criteria:\n\n \n\n**1) Rejection of (or weak commitment to) democratic rules of the game.**\n\n**A)** Do they reject the Constitution or express a willingness to violate it?\n\n**B)** Do they suggest a need for antidemocratic measures, such as canceling elections, violating or suspending the constitution, banning certain organizations, or restricting basic civil or political rights?\n\n**C)** Do they seek to use (or endorse the use of) extraconstitutional means to change the government, such as military coups, violent insurrections, or mass protests aimed at forcing a change in the government?\n\n**D)** Do they attempt to undermine the legitimacy of elections, for example, by refusing to accept credible electoral results?\n\n\\-\n\n**2) Denial of the legitimacy of political opponents.**\n\n**A)** Do they describe their rivals as subversive, or opposed to the existing constitutional order?\n\n**B)** Do they claim that their rivals constitute an existential threat, either to national security or to the prevailing way of life?\n\n**C)** Do they baselessly describe their partisan rivals as criminals, whose supposed violation of the law (or potential to do so) disqualifies the from full participation in the political arena?\n\n**D)** Do they baselessly suggest that their rivals are foreign agents, in that they are secretly working in alliance with (or the employ of) a foreign government – usually an enemy one?\n\n\\-\n\n**3) Toleration or encouragement of violence.**\n\n**A)** Do they have ties to armed gangs, paramilitary forces, militias, guerrillas, or other organizations that engage in illicit violence?\n\n**B)** Have they or their partisan allies sponsored or encouraged mob attacks on opponents?\n\n**C)** Have the tacitly endorsed violence by their supporters by refusing to unambiguously condemn it and punish it?\n\n**D)** Have they praised (or refused to condemn) other significant acts of political violence, either in the past or elsewhere in the world?\n\n\\-\n\n**4) Readiness to curtail civil liberties of opponents, including media.**\n\n**A)** Have they supported laws or policies that restrict civil liberties, such as expanded libel or defamation laws, or laws restricting protest, criticism of the government, or certain civil or political organizations?\n\n**B)** Have they threatened to take legal or other punitive action against critics in rival parties, civil society, or the media?\n\n**C)** Have they praised repressive measures taken by other governments, either in the past or elsewhere in the world?",

      "title": "Why do white supremacists have so much freedom in the United States?",
      "text": "In the United States, the First Amendment to the Constitution protects free speech almost absolutely, allowing white supremacist groups, neo-Nazis and other far-right organizations to demonstrate publicly without government intervention, as long as they do not directly incite violence. Why has this legal protection allowed events such as the Right-wing Unity March in Charlottesville in 2017, where neo-Nazis and white nationalists paraded with torches chanting slogans such as 'Jews will not replace us,' to take place without prior restrictions? How is it possible that in multiple U.S. cities, demonstrations by groups like the Ku Klux Klan or the neo-Nazi militia Patriot Front are allowed, while in countries like Germany, where Nazism had its origins, hate speech, including the swastika and the Nazi salute, has been banned?\n\nThroughout history, the U.S. has protected these expressions even when they generate social tension and violence, as happened in the 1970s with the Nazi Party of America case in Skokie, Illinois, where the Supreme Court ruled in favor of the right of neo-Nazis to march in a community of Holocaust survivors. Why does U.S. law not prevent the display of symbols such as the swastika, the Confederate flag, or the Nazi-inspired 'Sonnenrad' (sun wheel), despite being linked to hate crimes? What role do factors such as lobbying by far-right groups, the influence of political sectors that minimize the problem of white supremacism, and inconsistent enforcement of hate crime laws play in this permissiveness?\n\nIn addition, FBI ([2022](https://www.justice.gov/hatecrimes/hate-crime-statistics-2022)) ([2023](https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-violent-crime-decreased-2023-hate-crimes-rose-fbi-reports-2024-09-23/)) studies have pointed to an increase in white supremacist group activity and an increase in hate crimes in recent years. Why, despite intelligence agencies warning that right-wing extremism represents one of the main threats of domestic terrorism, do these groups continue to operate with relative impunity? What responsibility do digital platforms have in spreading supremacist ideologies and radicalizing new members? To what extent does the First Amendment protect speech that advocates racial discrimination and violence, and where should the line be drawn between free speech and hate speech?\n\nI ask all this with respect, with no intention to offend or attack any society. The question is based on news that have reached me and different people around the world. Here are some of these news items:\n\n* [Charlottesville, Virginia, Reels From Deadly White Nationalist Rally](https://www.haaretz.com/us-news/2017-08-14/ty-article-live/charlottesville-virginia-reels-from-deadly-white-nationalist-rally/0000017f-e3c8-d38f-a57f-e7da10180000)\n* [Unity rally in Howell pushes back on recent white supremacy demonstrations](https://michiganadvance.com/2024/11/25/unity-rally-in-howell-pushes-back-on-recent-white-supremacy-demonstrations/)\n* [Neo-Nazis are on the March across America](https://www.wired.com/story/neo-nazi-demonstrations-trump/)\n* [White Nationalist Group Proud Boys March in DC to Celebrate Trump’s Inauguration](https://truthout.org/articles/we-are-back-proud-boys-march-in-dc-celebrating-trumps-inauguration/)\n\nAnd so there are a lot of other news...

Sure, they understand there will be political blow back in 2026, just as with every presidents first midterm year.  But they don’t think voters will either remember or care beyond that.\n\nAre they right?\n\nAfter 2024 the Republican Party has started to fully embrace unpopular initiatives.  They saw how Trump, who was on his political deathbed in 2021, defied political gravity and brought the Republican Party back into Congress in 2023 and the full government in 2025.  They saw how voters did not punish them for attempting to overturn Obamacare or the tax cuts during trumps first term.  They saw that democrats were and are the most unpopular they have ever been. \n\nWill this time be different?  Will this bill actually damage the Republican brand?

A unity government features most of the parties in the legislature, although a few parties may dissent and refuse to be part of it.\n\nOpposition parties do often still exist in the legislature outside of the coalition, and they may be needed to support certain things needing supermajorities like amending the constitution, although sometimes there aren't any members of the legislature to do this.\n\nAnd no RFJ Jr, this isn't anything related to the idea of a uniparty.",

If he wins, is he likely to implement these plans or is he saying all this in jest?\n\nSome of those who have worked closely with him in the past and others who have faced the wrath of Trump believe he is quite capable of following through with his threats. Others, like Johnson \\[Speaker of the House\\] have dismissed his comments as jest and comical or otherwise tried to rationalize it.\n\nHe has often threatened what he has described as democrats and leftists, but also named Nancy Pelosi and Adma Schiff specifically \\[among others\\].\n\nOn [Fox News](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kmmx1zQCQds&t=485s), Trump expressed support for using government force against domestic political rivals. Since 2022, when he began preparing for the presidential campaign, Trump has issued more than 100 threats to investigate, prosecute, imprison or otherwise punish his perceived opponents, NPR has found.\n\nA review of Trump’s rally speeches, press conferences, interviews and social media posts shows that the former president has repeatedly indicated that he would use federal law enforcement as part of a campaign to exact “[retribution](https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/109967829299924979).”\n\nVice President Kamala Harris “should be impeached and prosecuted,” Trump [said](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XgdVgxxELbQ&t=1590s) at a rally last month.\n\n“I will appoint a real special prosecutor to go after the most corrupt president in the history of the United States of America, Joe Biden, and the entire Biden crime family,” Trump [said](https://www.rev.com/transcript-editor/shared/bFORNS0mvNOxmr9cbwwpUJRzq-pofVnRhYN3vHJKQdeiFjefDAKwDpPowHng3r_kHNX-RDMkd2KrzETglXlCPsGi_Wk?loadFrom=PastedDeeplink&ts=1706.4) last year.\n\nJournalists who decline to identify the sources of leaked information would also face imprisonment, Trump said.\n\nWhen right-wing radio host Glenn Beck asked Trump if he would lock up his opponents in a second term, Trump [responded](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lywHT5uH71M&t=124s), “The answer is you have no choice because they’re doing it to us.”\n\nLegal experts said that there are few guardrails preventing Trump from pursuing his plans to prosecute opponents and noted that Trump pressured the Department of Justice to investigate rivals during his first term. In about a dozen cases, the Justice Department followed through and initiated investigations, according to one [analysis](https://www.justsecurity.org/98703/chronology-trump-justice-department/).\n\nIf he wins, is he likely to implement these plans or is he saying all this in jest?\n\n[Trump's 'enemy from within' threat spurs critics' alarm about his authoritarian shift - ABC News](https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/trumps-enemy-threat-spurs-critics-alarm-authoritarian-shift/story?id=114816374)\n\n[Trump doubles down on calling Democrats 'enemies from within' at Georgia town hall](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2024-election/trump-democrats-enemies-within-rcna175628)\n\n[https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/15/us/politics/trump-opponents-enemy-within.html](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/15/us/politics/trump-opponents-enemy-within.html)",

      "text": "Great Britain (1707-1801) had a King, Cabinet, House of Commons, and House of Lords, although does not and still does not to this day have a single court of appeal akin to a supreme court (I am not explaining that complex mess). That is the most obvious influence. While the Romans are cited a lot, I actually don't attribute too much to their government itself, with double consuls and other executive magistracies each having a veto over the other, a set of public assemblies, the constitutional position of dictator, and senate appointed governors selected from among former magistrates, although the theory of Rome's republic is influential.\n\nThe electoral college to me is primarily influenced by the way countries had tried to elect singular heads of states in the time before 1787, like the elective monarchs of Poland-Lithuania, the Protectorate period in England after the Puritan Oliver Cromwell tried to organize a republic after executing king Charles I, the Holy Roman Empire, and some maritime republics like the Dutch and Venetians, and the papal conclave. It was very hard to devise an election to such a position.\n\nHold the vote in the myriad of towns and hamlets and cities where people can show up to vote and your information is haphazard, slow, difficult to transport, and might not result in someone having majority support. Hold the vote in a single place and only a tiny number of people can show up. Make the legislatures of the state hold the vote and the president is likely to let their rebellions and antagonism slide even when they break federal law. Make the Congress hold the vote and the president won't be likely to check their misgivings and won't use their powers like that of the veto when they should and is prone to appointing the friends and allies of the legislators, this being especially true back when the Congress members themselves nominated the candidates and not a convention nor a primary election as was usual before the 1830s. Plus, if the people doing the vote are in one place, then the potential of the military to install their candidate or a foreign power installs their puppet rises (this happened in Poland Lithuania a couple times, notably in 1704 when the Swedes installed their puppet).\n\nIf I had to provide an ordered list, I would cite the then present system of the Kingdom of Great Britain and the corresponding system in the Kingdom of Ireland, the lessons learned by the Protectorate period from 1649-1660, the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, the Dutch Republic, the Holy Roman Empire, the Delian League (Athenian led hegemonic confederation), the Venetian Republic, and the Roman Republic.",

But experts agree that Trump is a [clear threat](https://www.gov.harvard.edu/2024/10/31/steven-levitsky-daniel-ziblatt-publish-op-ed-in-nyt/) to American democracy, not Harris or the Democrats. Why? In his first term, he tried to [overturn](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c93pdlg4dlno) the 2020 election that all [evidence](https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2103619118) shows he lost. During his first term he also used the powers of the federal government improperly to [go after](https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/12/amazon-claims-trump-blocked-10-billion-defense-contract-because-he-hates-jeff-bezos?srsltid=AfmBOorN76UwttQ_nXMj2DSE9TEa17Jk8XYRudocru8rk1VbrxCXIO2e) his opponents and to try to [sway](https://www.newsweek.com/irs-feared-trump-stimulus-checks-broke-law-1972140) voters. In his campaigning, he has repeatedly praised strongmen like [Putin ](https://www.politico.com/news/2022/02/23/trump-putin-ukraine-invasion-00010923)and Orban and said he wants to emulate them. He has threatened to [punish](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/sep/20/trump-election-opponents-threats) his opponents and to stay in office [past](https://www.politico.com/news/2024/05/18/trump-at-nra-convention-floats-a-three-term-presidency-00158786) a second term. \n\nSo why did the Trump threat to democracy not affect Trump voters?\n\nDo most Trump voters just not care about democracy all that much? Data from [exit polls](https://apnews.com/article/democracy-harris-trump-threats-authoritarianism-election-2024-56b4eb981f34f3e60aec1e45a67fc8a2) suggests that many voters for both Trump and Harris said their vote choice was motivated strongly by appeals to defend democracy. This was the number one reason for most Harris voters, but it was also the first or second most important reason cited for many Trump voters. Surveys also suggest [similar](https://today.yougov.com/politics/articles/48238-most-americans-support-democracy-and-oppose-dictatorship) levels of support for democracy among Democrats and Republicans. However, it is possible that Trump voters are not as committed to democracy even if they say it matters to them in surveys.\n\nAnother possibility is that Trump and Harris supporters just think democracy means different things, and Trump's actions are consistent with how Trump supporters think about democracy. Social science research suggests Republicans and Democrats understand democracy to mean [the same thing](https://theconversation.com/how-different-people-around-the-world-understand-democracy-and-why-it-matters-241617): free and fair elections and political freedoms like free speech. But maybe when you drill down into the details, Trump supporters have different ideas about what makes an election free and fair or which freedoms should be defended.\n\nIt could also be the case that Trump convinced his supporters he is the one defending democracy. If they believe the election in 2020 really was stolen from him, that Democrats are letting immigrants vote for them illegally, and that Trump's prosecutions were political retribution, they might accept the narrative that Trump was persecuted by a corrupt and authoritarian Democratic party. But maybe these beliefs are not deeply held and are just claims made to justify their political project, for which democracy doesn't matter all that much. \n\nIs there another possibility I am missing? \n\nI realize these different explanations will apply to some Trump voters and not others, but what do you think is the most important explanation?",

      "text": "Probably the most famous example of this is Switzerland, with a coalition of the same four parties lasting for over half a century so far. The United Federal Assembly elects people to a cabinet, who collectively decide on the policies, with no prime minister but does have a rotating chairperson, and among them the decisions are taken by a majority of those cabinet members, who all publicly support the cabinet's decisions even if they disagree with them privately. The legislature has chairpersons from different parties leading committees, there are several speakers and they rotate around from party to party each year, and similar. They even choose to divide up the Supreme Court seats this way, proportionally to party strength. \n\nThere are mathematical ways to make sure the executive is balanced like this as are the legislative chairships and speakerships. Also, what I said about permanent coalitions is true at the cantonal and municipal level in Switzerland as well. All the major parties in Parliament are in the coalition, and there isn't much of a thing as a major opposition party (although the Greens and Liberal Greens together could deserve one seat in the cabinet). Austria has had similar ideas too, with coalitions of the OeVP and the SPOe.\n\nCoalition in this sense means being part of the executive branch of government, not merely supporting a party to ensure they become part of the executive or the budget gets passed each year (which would be confidence and supply, not necessarily a coalition). \n\nDo you think that this sort of system is desirable or feasible? Why or why not?",

      "text": "For context, Mahmoud Khalil has been detained for possible deportation because of the Trump Administration's ire over Khalil's participation and organization of Columbia University protests against Israel's genocide in Palestine. Despite being a permanent resident and being married to a US citizen, the deportation was justified by \"national security concerns\" and his \"consequences for US foreign policy.\" \n\nMy understanding of free speech is that it's a universal, inalienable right -- in fact, the Declaration of Independence asserts the God-given nature of this fundamental freedom. If US policy was morally consistent, should it not be protected to the highest extent even for non-citizens? At the end of the day, if free speech is a human right, one's citizenship status should not give the government the ability to alienate that right. I understand that it's possible for non-citizens to promote an agenda among voters that is objectively against US interests...but that already happens on internet spaces, so it's quite literally impossible for the voting populace to be immune to foreign opinions on their politics. Is there really a good argument against free speech protections for non-citizens?",

      "text": "As being [covered by multiple news outlets today](https://www.cnn.com/2025/04/07/politics/trump-plans-military-parade-washington/index.html), the Trump administration is currently planning a military parade to celebrate Trump's 79th birthday and mark the 250th anniversary of the establishment of the US military.\n\n[Trump requested](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-48842428) a military parade to celebrate the Fourth of July in 2019, but that was denied due to the logistical challenges of getting America's armaments to D.C., and the damage tanks and other heavy weaponry do to roads, just by driving on them.\n\nWhile America [has held military parades before](https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2018/02/actually-the-us-has-a-rich-tradition-of-military-parades-but-normally-theyre-after-military-victories-and-stuff/), typically after military victories and for a handful of inaugurations, they don't happen often in the United States because, as top comments from US servicemen and women in a r/military [post last year suggest](https://www.reddit.com/r/Military/comments/196k856/why_did_usa_stop_parading/):\n\n\n\n>(1) When you've got the biggest stick on the block, you don't need to wave it around.\n\n>(2) The Desert Storm victory parade messed up the streets in DC. Those roads weren't built for tanks. That, along with the difficulty of getting tanks to DC, is part of why the military didn't want to do a parade for Trump. The other reason is that they don't want the president to look like a dictator.\n\n>(3) Military parades have become synonymous with military dictatorships who have to continually show force and rattle sabers in order to keep their populations under control. We would rather not be associated with such practices. There's still plenty of parades that aren't focused on our military might that the military takes part in in some shape or form though.\n\n\n\nGiven precedent and the current political climate, in the context of the current administration's pursuit of cutting wasteful government spending, and the recent removal of many of America's military leaders, do you think President Trump's requested military parade will happen, and why or why not?\n\n\n\n**EDIT**: Cleaned up the formatting of the quote to clarify that these are not *my* opinions, but rather those of American servicemen and women in a Reddit post on r/military last year.",

      "text": "Much of the frenzy around Elon Musk's DOGE initiative has been its speed in actually doing stuff by terminating contracts and laying off government employees. It's been about a month into the Trump administration and most of the political discussion has been about DOGE, both its positives and negatives.\n\nWhether or not you agree with what DOGE is doing, do you think it is correct for his team to take action immediately rather than carefully inspect government processes and deliver a report months later? The argument for the former is that there have been dramatic results already in terms of firings and contracts cancelled. The potential resistance hasn't yet been built up internally to thwart Trump's initiatives. The argument for the latter is that a studious audit report may be more comprehensive in what it can lay out and understand from its investigations. There is also the legal argument that a more throughout plan would be held up in court, though most of the lawsuits that have enjoined DOGE and Trump's executive orders have been done so by judges appointed by Democrats. However, the problem with a report that comes out several months later, from the perspective of the Trump administration, is that it becomes much harder to implement and much easier to ignore. Most government waste finding commissions have been shelved and ignored even internal audits done by inspectors general.\n\nWhat do you make of DOGE's efforts so far? Should they have proceeded cautiously or speedily? How will the public react to what they are doing? Given Musk's technology background is the motto \"move fast and break things\" justified in this instance?",

Why do we as a general society lack even a basic education and understanding of political science and theory?**\n\nWhat I mean is, we have data and examples going back thousands of years on how certain policies affect a governed people.\n\nI understand that societies evolve and societal wants and needs change, but shouldn't the core principles and policy drivers still basically be constant? Maybe not something as simple or elegant as PV=nRT (ah, volume goes up so pressure must go down or temp must go up), but... something... \n\nLike why are we still having debates (not the most recent presidential debate, but more like a generic political discourse) where one politician can say (just as a random example - I am not picking a political side one way or another - if you feel this example leans too far toward one side, make up another in your head going the other direction) \"I will cut taxes to promote spending\" and another will respond with something vague like \"we know that doesn't work\" or \"we've seen in the past that that's not how it plays out\" and then they just kind of... move on without anything changing. The first politician can just respond \"you're wrong\" or \"my plan is 'different'\" or \"'better'\" and we are just left to accept that that is that.\n\nWhy aren't they responding with something with explicit citations? \"My fellow candidate, that may be your \"opinion\" on the policy, but as the data has proven time and time again in cases X, Y, and Z, dating back to 1923, your \"opinion\" is as valid as that of believing the earth is flat.\"\n\nOf course that is getting more into political discourse theory. My question is more around the idea that shouldn't we have \"answers\" for most of the common issues by now? I guess, why do we (myself absolutely included) lack even a basic education and understanding of political science and theory?\n\nI feel like things would be much more amicable for society (or at least far less polarizing) if we were all (conservatives, liberals, middlers, whatever) like \"dude, we all learned in 3rd grade polisci that your plan is idiotic, get off the stage... next!\"\n\nI realize there's also a subtext that \"yes, I know that it doesn't work the way I am stating it, but it will benefit me and those who support me.. and if I can state it in such a way that you believe it will also benefit you, then you will vote for me.\"\n\nI also realize that politicians on both sides want people to be less educated on the policies so that they can manipulate them and come in as a sort of savior with their genius plans.\n\nLastly, I understand that issues evolve and that new issues arise as society changes. These would be new things to learn and test and gather data on... just like anything else \"new\" in any other field of science.",

Currently they hold collectively 7 seats in the House of Representatives, 4 in Sydney, 2 in Melbourne and 1 in Perth. \n\nThese seats for decades formed the base of the Liberal Party and prior conservative counterparts, often being held on substantial margins and almost always winning more than 50% of the popular vote (therefore not needing to rely on preferences). \n\nThese seats are typically much wealthier seats, in fact most of them (if not all) are in the top 10 wealthiest federal divisions in Australia. And I should know I live in one of them. Apparently these electorates are fiscally conservative or liberal, and socially progressive. To an EXTENT, that is true. \n\nNone of the ‘Teal Independents’ seats are held on high margins. And apart from Steggall’s seat in Sydney, all of the Liberals won the popular vote (but lost on preferences. A large part of why they lost is that some people chose the ‘Teal Independent’ as a tactical vote to remove the Liberal candidate (that is also, to an EXTENT, true, as the Labor and Greens vote declined in these seats). But many also changed from voting liberal. \n\nAs someone who even lives in one of these seats, I don’t even know myself whether the Liberals would ever have a shot at these seats again. The liberals got trounced in the cities in 2022 but comparatively did quite well in regional and rural areas. \n\nIs this the beginning of a political realignment in which the liberals can only form government through outer suburbs and the rural and regional areas? Or was this a setback which they can come back from?",

      "title": "Would this political system work ?",
      "text": "TL;DR : a federal parliamentary system with a 4th branch of government that controls public services (performance, corruption and audit). This 4th branch can also pass a bill to Parliament without government approval.\n\nI imagined a parliamentary federal system for my country (Mali) with a little twist here's how it works :\n\n1) Parliamentary regime : \n\nThe Federal President is the head of state, elected indirectly by an electoral college (regional+federal assemblies). They can appoint and dissolve the government under certain conditions, based on the Prime Minister's advice.\n\nThe Prime Minister leads the government, appoints ministers, and implements policies approved by Parliament.\n\nParliament has two chambers:\n\nThe Federal Assembly (main legislative body with 147 members, elected for 3 years).\n\nThe Council of Regions (45 regional representatives with longer 6-year terms). They focus on regional and federal balance in decision-making.\n\n\nLaws are debated and passed in Parliament, with mechanisms for resolving disagreements between the two chambers. Basically like Bundestag and Bundesrat\n\n\n\n2. Competence Bureau's Role:\n\nThe Competence Bureau is a specialized body designed to ensure government efficiency and reduce corruption. This 4th branch of government is inspired by Taiwan's Control and Exam Yuans.\n\nIt is led by a General Secretary and consists of 2 subunits each led by a secretary :\n\nExam Bureau: Organizes evaluations for government roles, ensuring qualified and capable people fill key positions.\n\nControl Bureau: Monitors government agencies, verifying performance and rooting out corruption. It has no power to directly remove people from office but an impeached official can face charges by administrative courts.\n\n\nExperts are assigned to specific fields within the Bureau. They analyze government performance, collect data, and report findings to Parliament for further action.\n\nEvery three years (or before elections), an Experts Congress is held, where performance reviews and recommendations are shared to the newly elected government. This would allow to correct mistakes and evaluate effectiveness of previous policies.\n\n\n\n3. Relationship Between the Competence Bureau and the Parliamentary System:\n\nThe Bureau acts as a safeguard for the parliamentary regime, ensuring that laws are implemented effectively and public officials perform their duties responsibly.\n\nParliament can use the Bureau's findings to make informed decisions, remove underperforming officials, or amend policies.\n\nCitizens indirectly influence the Bureau’s work since it reports to Parliament, which they elect.\n\nThe Bureau can pass a bill for the Parliament to vote, the government cannot block this bill. However as the secretaries are appointed by the prime minister (with Parliament approval), they should be likeminded and have similar ideologies.\n\n\n\n4. Regional and Citizen Participation:\n\nAt the regional level, Governors and Regional Assemblies manage local governance. They tie into the federal structure by contributing members to the Council of Regions. I chose a federal structure because of the complex ethnic diversity, federalism might reduce tensions.\n\nAll citizens can integrate the aforementionned bureaucracy through the Exam, thus guaranteeing a meritocratic institution.\n\nWould this system work? Is it unrealistic (mostly financially) to have this much bureaucracy or can it actually prevent corruption ? How would you improve it?",

      "text": "Title. I'm writing an argumentative essay for my Composition 3 class in college, and I have chosen to write about queer rights in the modern American political landscape. I have a few points I'm planning to argue already, but I was curious about something. Would the plans of Donald Trump (and by extension, the GOP as a whole) to restrict the voices and potential healthcare/support related rights of queer Americans be *literally* unconstitutional? Or are they likely to use legal loopholes/federal rulings to make it technically legal? For example, if he plans to rescind Federal policies about discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity, would that not violate the 14th Amendment? Thank you in advance.\n\nThis isn't bait and I'm not trying to start a flame war. I'm just trying to write an essay and I'm lazy.",

      "title": "Were any of the Pro-Trump or otherwise far-right Dank Memes on Vine astroturfed by groups like Cambridge Analytica?",
      "text": "When I was about 20 or 21, Dank Meme Vine compilations were a huge phenomenon on YouTube, and many of said compilations seemed to have strong populist right messaging, often featuring overtly Pro-Trump/Anti-Hillary memes, anti-feminist memes, anti-LGBT memes/jokes about how many genders there are, etc. Granted, these were interspersed with bog-standard absurdist or edgy memes, but the editorial slant of these compilations was pretty clear.\n\nHaving heard all the recent discourse about this Jubilee debate between Medhi Hasan and young conservatives (at least one of whom reportedly accepted the label of \"fascist\"), it occurs to me that a lot of the youths in that video are probably young enough to have seen these compilations when their political consciousness was just starting to develop and to have had their outlooks shaped by these memes on some subconscious level. More broadly, Gen Z is noticeably flipping right (as demonstrated during this past election cycle), and internet culture is playing an increasingly bigger role in youth politics, so I wonder if Dank Meme Vines were one of the initial catalysts for this shift, and if so, whether lobbyist/special interest/data mining groups were involved.\n\nAs cursory as my understanding of cyber warfare is, I do know that Cambridge Analytica used Facebook surveys to build psychological profiles of users, disseminate targeted Pro-Trump memes to these users, and covertly influence their voting decisions/political opinions. With that in mind, could a group like Cambridge Analytica or even a foreign political body like the Kremlin have produced Pro-Trump/populist right Dank Memes as a form of astroturfing and subsequently paid compilation producers to curate Dank Meme compilations in a way that favored far-right interests? Given how people like Peter Thiel are now essentially psyopping Zoomers into \"trad\" ideology with faux-grassroots \"new media\" or how Tim Pool (a self-proclaimed \"independent journalist\") was revealed to have taken funding from RT, it wouldn't surprise me if some Machiavellian organization had also used Vine/Dank Memes as a covert influence on youth politics circa 2016.",

Well-intentioned, but absolutely terrible decision politically.  Dems needed Pennsylvania in the bag, wrapped up, tied off in a bow.  If Harris loses Pennsylvania........ thats it, everyone goes to bed early IMO.  Shapiro might not have been the perfect progressive pick, but my lord, knowing how important Pennsylvania was..........it seems borderline criminal passing him up knowing what is at stake.  Michigan might have been at risk of a loss, but Im not sure Minnesota or Wisconsin were nearly the risks that people think they are.  Michigan would have been a painful loss........but minimally absorbable with a slim margin for error.  Pennsylvania, there is absolutely no margin for error.  Turning down Shapiro over Israeli sympathies might turn out to be extraordinarily stupid.  I hope im wrong, but dems are absolutely playing with fire by not putting him on the ticket.",

      "text": "I’ve been thinking ahead to the 2026 midterms and the final two years of President Trump’s term. What worries me the most is a full-blown debt ceiling standoff, government shutdown, and economic crisis.\n\nHistorically, when we have a divided government, we get the usual brinkmanship. Lawmakers hold the economy hostage for political points, and then — at the last possible second — they raise the ceiling like they were always going to. The system barely holds together.\n\nBut Trump doesn’t play by those rules. He doesn’t answer to Congress. He doesn’t respond to public pressure. If he wanted to tank the economy and blame Democrats for it, he could simply let the country default — and he might.\n\nSo I started thinking: What if we didn’t have to wait for Washington to do its job?\n\nAbout 26 states allow citizen-initiated ballot measures. The idea is to coordinate across those states to introduce ballot initiatives to form and join a 14th Amendment Fiscal Responsibility Interstate Compact.\n\nIf the federal government defaults on its debt, all member states would trigger an emergency statewide split-rate tax to pay federal obligations from within the state until the crisis is resolved.\n\nIn plain terms: if the federal government won’t do its damn job, then we will do it for them.\n\nThe compact is named in the spirit of Section 4 of the 14th Amendment, which states that the validity of the public debt “shall not be questioned.”\n\nWe could start with Florida and encourage other states to follow.\n\nI don’t care who takes the blame for a future default. I just don’t trust the current government enough to feel confident that they won’t destroy the economy on purpose. Again.\n\nCurious what others here think. Not sure what the implications are regarding a confederalist safety net like this or the feasibility or deadlines of getting something like this onto the ballot in time for the midterms",

I am asking about in general. Like when poly sci teachers talk about different strategies and practices between first and second term presidents.

      "text": "I live in New England; specifically, Vermont. Universal healthcare is a **hugely** popular policy goal in the northeast (with *maybe* the exception of NH, but don’t quote me on that).\n\nIn Vermont, the skyrocketing cost of healthcare/health insurance has snowballed into an array of other crises, notably one in education. Keeping our full-time ed workers covered by health insurance has become an enormously difficult task, and since our school systems are funded by local property taxes, that means homeowners are seeing close to 15-20% increases in property taxes each year. There are somewhat more complex issues here, but healthcare is definitely a big one. And while I’d love to just say “VT should just provide universal healthcare,” our small population & revenue base makes that exceedingly difficult. \n\nNow I grew up in Massachusetts, which as far as I’ve seen has shown huge success with “Romneycare,” basically state-provided Medicaid. \n\nSo what I’m wondering is: what’s stopping my state’s governor/legislature from reaching out to MA and negotiating a way to hop in on their plan? I understand there could be difficulties selling such a plan *politically*, I’m just wondering what logistical/legal hurdles, if any, are keeping this from happening?",

This population would not be swayed by anything and would only vote for this item. \n\n\n\nMy argument was that due to the amount of people with great influence and power not wanting a grand change or complication to their way of getting and holding power, this grand change could not occur simply through election. Since all government officials have a lot to lose by this item going threw, there would not be an opposing party check or challenge whatever methods would be used to undermine the voters wishes. \n\n\n\nWe landed on the conclusion that we do not understand the political and governmental system to reach a good answer. So am asking here, would the government be able to stop this process, or would simply electing local representatives and a 3rd party candidate be enough to reorganize the country's governing body by such an extent?",

Allowing him to use the army in whatever way he personally wants without anyone to challenge him if an order is illegal or not.\n\n2: Invading Canada.\n\n3: Trump getting ride of term limits and making himself president for life.\n\n4: Dismantelling, arresting, imprisoning, and execution of whatever members of the Democratic party he'd like.\n\n5: Federal nation wide abortion ban.\n\n6: Stripping women of the right to vote, either in some states or across all.\n\n7: Stripping all non-white/non-Christians of the right to vote, in some states or across the country.\n\n8: Arresting and imprisoning or executing, without trial, all political dissidents. Anyone from Harris to Jimmy Kimmal to youtube leftists.\n\n9: Arresting and deporting all gay, trans, or queer people.\n\nYes I'm anxious and yes I'm trying to stay away from the news, but sometimes news gets through anyway. I also don't know much about the American political process, so it's easy for me to think the answer to all of these is a resounding yes.",

      "title": "Once more with feeling: Upcoming Rule Updates and Enforcement",
      "text": "Now that the election is over and the immediate fallout has more or less settled, we wanted to inform you of some upcoming rule updates, how these are enforced, and how you can appeal.  The goal is to make answers better sourced and try to get higher quality sources as well.  We've still got a ways to go, but this should help.\n\nThe **first change** is to Rule 3 and top-level comments.  Before it was *heavily* suggested to include sources and **now it will become a requirement** and enforced by the automod.  In almost every case I can think of, you can find a source to backup your reply to the question, whether its Wikipedia, a news article or even a link to primary source such as a video or transcript.  If for some reason we find an edge case where there is no ability to provide a source, it can be appealed (detailed below)\n\nThe **second change** is not so much a specific rule but how we will view sources and that we will encourage *primary* sources to be used to reinforce *secondary* sources.  As a reminder, primary sources are the raw event generally recorded around the same time it was said, written, or done - a video of a politician's speech, a court opinion and so on.  A secondary source is one who takes that primary source and generally analyzes it or summarizes it for easier consumption - in this case, an opinion article about that court ruling or a YouTuber digesting what a proposed new law would mean.  The goal of this change is to try to get as close to the primary source, the raw information, as possible and then use the secondary sources to reinforce your post.  \n\nFor example, let's say Ronald McDonald said he'd provide free kids meals to fight childhood hunger, you'd link to the clown actually saying it on video or the release from the Office of Ronald McDonald.  But then, seeing as this might have impacts down the road, you might link to Burger King News calling the new plan a threat  (\"flame-grilled is better\") and their opinion that this will lead to further childhood obesity.\n\nThe ultimate goal of this rule is to help establish the facts surrounding the question so our time here isn't spent arguing over that (the raw data is there for anyone to see) but rather trying to explain what it means or how it works.  This will also help with baseless claims or bad takes since they'll be forced to address the ultimate source rather than sticking to talking points - which will help keeping things from breaking Rule 4.\n\nFinally, the **last change** will generally just be better rule enforcement.  Given the period, we let posts through that were not formatted as a question, some bad punctuation and grammar, as well as some \"short\" questions that didn't quite demonstrate that the poster had tried to do some research themselves.  We will begin starting to enforce this more rigorously going forward.\n\nNow, one last thing - **the appeals process**.  With anything removed by automod, there's a small link that says \"ask for a second opinion in modmail\".  Click this, explain yourself/make your case and we'll review as soon as possible.  Most of the appeal wins are because of our curse-word filter where a really good post gets removed for quoting someone saying one of them.  We'd rather be safe than sorry.  For active moderation where we take action ourselves, we'll start using the mod tools to post the reasons we're removing posts and comments.  And we'll also go back and expand the automod's reason from \"short response\" to \"This reply was removed because it was a very short response which generally does not adequately answer the question.\"  Or something like that.\n\nIt'll be a few days before we get all of this implemented, so please bear with us.  But that's it for now.  I hope you all have a great day and we look forward to elevating the discussion here at /r/ask_politics.\n\n(Resubmitted, **again** to see if the new, **new** rules work...)",

      "text": "Apologies if this has been discussed; I searched but didn't find an obvious post addressing this.  Apologies also for how pointed the question seems.  I tried to be more circumspect in my original post but got rejected for not being in the form of a question.\n\nWith the Manhattan DA agreeing to postpone the sentencing of Trump in the hush money case in New York, I got to wondering about the immunity of the President in general. I did some googling and didn't find an obvious answer, probably because this is unprecedented.\n\nWe are told that, in America, nobody should be above the law, and that would seem to include the President when he is convicted of a felony for actions taken in or out of office (ignoring the recent Supreme Court decision). Why would the courts not sentence a person to prison and issue an arrest warrant if they fail to surrender just because that person holds a political office? I doubt they would hold off on sentencing a sitting member of the House of Representatives or the Senate.\n\nAnd if the President cannot execute his duties due to being imprisoned, wouldn't the 25th Amendment allow the VP, Vance, to assume the office of Acting President until Trump is released?\n\nThis seems like the most straightforward path to following the rules-as-written but it doesn't seem to get discussed and I'm very curious as to why not. Surely it's not the court's responsibility to ensure the ability of one man to take office, regardless of the office, or to ensure that America has a President.\n\nI would appreciate hearing from people who are more deeply steeped in constitutional law on this one.\n\nTIA.",

This is different to other countries which will not denaturalize and deport a person who doesn't have another citizenship.\n\nIs this accurate? If so are there other countries who will do this to a person? Has anything like this ever happened or is it all theoretical?",

Right now in the key battleground state of Pennsylvania, Reps are doing better on early voting vs how they did in 2020. It's around 31% right now for R whereas the final early voting percent in 2020 was 23.7% for R. The race ended up being very close at 48% R vs 50% D after the election day counts. If there is indeed the same amount of rep voters on election day, then Trump definitely takes Pennsylvania. However, do you think more reps are just accepting the idea of mail-in ballots and therefore voting early? Or is there still a lot of hesitation on mail-in ballots here?",

Despite its name, the centrão is not a centrist political group,[1] generally composed of parliamentarians from the \"lower clergy [pt]\"[2] and big tent parties,[3] who act according to their own interests, linked to cronyism and logrolling.[4][5]\n\nAn link to the Article if anyone's interested: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centr%C3%A3o\n\nSo, the existence of several big tent parties with no clear ideological stances relying on schemes with themseves happens in another countries?

So, some of them might vote for something that their party didn't wanted. So my idea was, make each vote be actually two with some kind of automatic runnof. For example, suppose there are 10 seats in X party, 8 of them vote for enabling a policy while the other 2 doesn't. Instead of these being the votes in the final calculation, since the majority of the votes of the party were to enable it, it instead makes it so the party gains the vote, which would be 10 votes for enabling the policy.  \n\nI hope I explained it well enough.

      "title": "Why do the US parties project such confidence in the run-up to (presidential?) elections?  ",
      "text": "In the UK, there tends to be at least one party - usually the one in the lead - downplaying their chances at the next election, to try and avoid voters becoming complacent and thinking the election outcome is a done deal. In the general election earlier this year, Labour (who went on to win a landslide in terms of seats) downplayed their chances until the exit poll and remained reticent about expressing too much optimism until several hours into the count when it was clear who had won.\n\nFollowing the US election across the pond, representatives (and supporters) of both major parties seem keen to emphasise how well their party Is doing in the campaign and the fact they think they're going to win. To the extent that there are partisan pollsters with results showing their party in the lead. We have a couple of dodgy pollsters in the UK, but the parties often say not to look at the polls.\n\nI've seen multiple interviews with representatives of both parties where they are asked, with reference to polling numbers, if they can really win the November, and they all responded confidently that they were on track to win. In the UK general election campaign, I watched so many interviews with Labour politicians where it was the complete opposite, with the interview suggesting they were heading for a landslide and the interviewee downplaying their chances.\n\nI know there are big and well-funded, register-to-vote campaigns (I've seen many Democratic ones) and that there are  'get out the vote' operations closer to election day (and on the day itself). (Particularly, I think, for the Democrats?) These are clearly intended to combat the issue of complacency and drive up voter turnout, but I don't understand why both parties - knowing it'll be a close race (in the electoral college at least) - downplay their chances to make voters think their vote can make the difference.\n\nI've come up with the following possible explanations, but I'm not really sure which one, if any, is correct.\n\n1. The sort of thing I described happening in the UK does happen in the US and I've just missed it.\n2. Parties will be stressing how close the race is in adverts and interviews targeted in swing states, but want to project confidence on the national stage to make people they're running a successful campaign is successful. (If so, I would have missed them as I'm not following the race in enough detail to know what swing state voters are seeing.)\n3. American voters are more likely to back someone they perceive as a winner, so being viewed as being ahead of your opponent attracts enough votes to offset those lost to complacency.\n4. The UK parties' structures mean that the party HQ have more influence over the messaging going out to voters, so it is possible to maintain a more consistent message. \n\nOr perhaps it's something completely different.\n\n  \nA few notes (reading these is not essential to understand my question, but may help):\n\n* To pre-empt any comments saying that Labour is particularly cautious about expressing optimism after 1992: Yes, but I'm not sure that explains all the difference. From what I've seen, the party in front in the UK tends to stress how close the race is (even when it isn't) and I've also been surprised by the lack of expectation management, compared to the UK. Though that would probably be a different post (and not one I'd write, as I'm not 100% on the US parties' approaches).\n* I'm obviously not as familiar with US politics as the stuff going on in the UK, but I do follow it quite closely and studied it in a decent amount of detail as part of a Politics A Level (a weird qualification that's difficult to translate for Americans, we do three in our equivalent of the last two years of high school). There was a time when I could explain how Congress passed a bill in a silly amount of detail, unfortunately, that time has now passed. Still, you can treat me like I know the basics of how US elections work and how the parties are structured.\n* I've only followed US elections from 2020 onwards and can't remember the parties' messaging in the run-up to the 2022 midterms, hence the '(presidential)' in the question.\n* This isn't an attempt to criticise the US parties. I'm well aware they are extensive and capable campaigns that dwarf those in the UK. To make it exceedingly clear, I don't think the difference is going to be caused by political parties in the UK being smarter having figured out a trick the US parties haven't.\n\n  \n**Note:** I've done my best to make this comment legible, but I'm dyslexic and tired, so apologies for the inevitable mistakes and typos.",

      "text": "As we get closer to the election, we're seeing a greater and greater number of top-level replies that often times lack a single source even as they go about referencing things that are not common knowledge.\n\nWhile it is not an absolute requirement for top-level answers, except for only the most basic questions, sources should be used.\n\nWe are increasing this for a few reasons.\n\n1. The ultimate goal here is to increase political knowledge.  The only way to really do that is to expose people to more and more concepts, history and analysis.  You might cite the 1996 Presidential elections, for example, and even the wiki link for that election contains a lot of information that might be useful in answering that question or clarifying your answer.  Or perhaps another community member reads that source and comes with a completely different outcome to it... when has that ever happened in politics?\n2. By having to bring in sources, responses tend to be much less emotional and end up being fairly more detailed.  By bringing in the 1996 Presidential election, you notice that Florida was blue back then, flipping back to red, then blue, now red.  Perhaps that paints something else in your answer or, at very least, gives you the opportunity to note there could be other factors at play.\n\n3. It will create a standard that we hope will bring the entire community up to the level we want.  If in doubt, provide a citation for things that aren't in recent history.  Political nerds might know topics reflexively, but not everyone does.  And more education is almost always a good thing.\n\n(I'm just using the 1996 election as an example and ironically stumbled upon a few interesting things... so it even impacts us!)\n\nFeel free to post if you have any questions.  When it doubt, cite!",

      "text": "I am not an expert when it comes to tax policy, or really, anything political. That said, Over the last 10 years or so I’ve noticed a shared mantra to “eat the rich” or “tax the rich” which I have no real opinion on because I’m not rich. What I can’t understand is raising the corporate tax for large companies that provide consumer goods for people. Living in a capitalist country it’s only natural that when the corporate tax goes up, so does the cost of consumer goods which ultimately doesn’t hurt the large company or it’s investors but it hurts the lower-middle class. I’m just trying to understand how it is beneficial at all without speculating. In my mind, the corp. tax goes up, the price goes up on consumer goods. More taxes for the government from corporation and on sales tax for the government to continue to spend carelessly. Can anyone fill me in please?",

      "text": "I’ll start by saying I completely agree with Bernie. This has been one of my main criticisms of the Democratic Party for a while.\n\nTrump didn’t win as much as the Democrats lost. They lost voters because they aren’t the party of the people anymore. We used to have Republicans who stood for big business and Democrats who represented the people. The left is the reason we have a 40-hour work week, disability benefits, a middle class, Social Security, Medicare, labor unions, child labor laws, environmental protections, civil rights laws, workplace safety standards, unemployment insurance, and affordable healthcare reforms. These are just a few of the changes that have shaped the country for the better.\n\nSince the Clinton administration, the Democrats have been co-opted by big business, adopting policies rooted in Reaganomics. As a result, the middle class has continued to shrink under every president since, while wealth concentrates at the top. When the Democrats do fight for people, it’s minimal, and their victories no longer feel significant, as they once did. This shift is largely due to the influence of campaign financing, particularly after key decisions like Buckley v. Valeo (1976), which equated money with free speech, and Citizens United v. FEC (2010), which allowed unlimited corporate spending on elections. These rulings opened the floodgates for dark money and Super PACs, making it easier for corporations and wealthy individuals to exert massive influence over elections and policy. Both parties are bought and paid for by corporate interests. We've essentially legalized bribes, creating a corrupt democracy where policy is driven by money rather than the will of the people.\n\nWe need a party that represents the working class. Sadly, we no longer have that.",

      "text": "Hello! Im doing my research on candidates preparing for the upcoming election. On Kamala's website she is listing her stances on certain issues. Im particularly interested in how some of her ideas would play out if she were elected and those polices came to fruition.\n\nShe wants to provide up to $25,000 to help home owners with their down payment on a house. She wants to cut taxes for the middle class and those with children. She wants to go after the cost of health care and cancel 7 billion in medical debt. She wants to raise minimum wage. This is just a handful of her talk points on her website. All of them sound really good in theory but im concerned with the logistics and how each change to the economy would affect each other. Where is all this money coming from that she is going to use to build houses, help people buy houses, cancel medical debt with, etc.? You can't just print more money. It has to come from somewhere. So if she is proposing cutting taxes as well as providing financial relief to some, how will this play out? Wont all of this make inflation worse in some way?\n\nCan someone with more knowledge of government and economics help me understand better? Thanks.\n\nEdit: Sorry I miss spelled her name. I corrected it in my paragraph. I can't change the tile unfortunately :(",

Each source I've read about the process if no presidential candidate reaches 270 Electoral College votes makes it clear that the vote goes to the House and the vote is cast by state delegations rather than by each of the 435 House members. \n\nThere can be 50 votes cast. Republicans have majority control of 26 state delegations, Democrats have majority control of 22 delegations, while Minnesota and North Carolina are tied. \n\nHow does that state delegation vote happen?\n\n1. Does \"majority control of 26 state delegations\" simply mean a majority of a state's elected House members are Republican?\n2. Does each state House member get one vote, and the majority of that vote gets to cast their preferred vote in the House?\n3. What happens if a state delegation can't reach a majority opinion? \n\nThank you.",

The fair in particular is supposed to kick off on Memorial Day 2025 and run until July 4 2026.\n\nWas any of that or something similar in the original plans? Is this stuff they've laid the ground work for?\n\nBecause if not I'm seriously questioning the feasibility of this. \n\nOnce in office they'd have 5 months to get all 50 states on board, with plans, and coordinate logistics on the Iowa fair grounds.\n\nPlus building out a whole new national monument with 100 statues to start by 2026, plus the Patriot Games, which seem like a nightmare to organize for the kids who are supposed to perform in them.",

      "text": "I'm considering a career change from nonprofit work, and I'm hoping someone can share a bit more about what senate staff jobs are like - particuarly those in local offices rather than DC. I've seen titles like Regional Director, Constituient Services Representative, Legislative Director, etc., but most of the postings are much more brief than I'm used to seeing. Any advice on the general level of experience they're looking for in some of these roles, and what pay might look like? Assuming pay may vary based on regional cost of living - I'd be looking in the northeast/urban areas.",

Over the course of more than four decades, Attorneys General have issued policies governing communications between the Justice Department and the White House. The procedural safeguards that have long guided the Department's approach to such communications are designed to protect our criminal and civil law enforcement decisions, and our legal judgments, from partisan or other inappropriate influences, whether real or perceived, direct or indirect.\"\n\nNotwithstanding the fact that DOJ is a subset of the executive branch, and that the Attorney General, Solicitor General, all the US attorneys, etc. can be dismissed by the President at literally any time for any reason or no reason at all. And the fact that the Attorney General can't hold anyone accountable for violating the guidelines, since all his \"subordinates\" are also appointed by the President. \n\nWhat am I missing?",

Without doing any research, is it true most disasters occur in red states? CA wildfires, earthquakes maybe, Colorado fires, but majority of hurricanes and such happen in the south? Is this bias because the current floods are in Texas. If this is true, Florida and red states will have to carry a greater burden than what is otherwise being contributed to by northern blue states who have, on the whole, less disasters. Tl;dr will blue states end up paying less and red states paying more if disaster relief is shifted to states?\n\nI’m probably missing some things, more of a shower thought, but it seems like state management of natural disasters may mean each state is carrying its proper burden?",

So that explanation doesn’t seem to hold up. Why would they go three times higher than necessary if the goal was medical?\n\nIf they’re not building a bomb, then what are they doing it for?  \nThe whole thing seems suspicious, and I’m wondering if I’m missing something.",

      "text": "I know films and TV should be taken with a pinch of salt, but I feel like NSAs are often depicted doing far more than just \"advising\" the president - sometimes they go so far as ordering / overseeing intelligence / military operations themselves. Even in real life, the role seems quite prominent in comparison to other advisory roles.\n\nDo they actually have any statutory / legal authority to do things besides request intel reports from various agencies? Or is it more of an unofficial \"I can't technically order this, but I speak with the authority of the President, so....make it happen.\"?",

Are there geopolitical reasons behind this seeming support, or is it more about a lesser evil mindset compared to the Assad regime? What are the implications for Syria’s future and regional stability if HTS consolidates power?\n\nI’d appreciate any insights or perspectives on this complex issue. Thanks!",

The debate is slated to last for an estimated 90 minutes.\n\nUnfortunately, we didn't have enough available moderators tonight to run the live fact-checking thread we've hosted in the past (we'll be putting out a call to bring on more moderators soon), but [PolitiFact is doing live fact-checking](https://www.politifact.com/article/2024/sep/10/presidential-debate-live-fact-check-harris-trump/) on a variety of platforms. \n\n----\n\nThis thread is now locked.

The mods have had a chance to preview the question and may post our own responses. The idea here is to contribute some early comments that we know are well-sourced and vetted, in the hopes that it will prevent the discussion from running off course. \n\nUsers are free to contribute as normal, but please adhere to our [rules on commenting.](https://www.reddit.com/r/NeutralPolitics/wiki/guidelines#wiki_comment_rules) And although the topic is broad, please **be specific** in your responses. Here are some potential policy areas to address:\n\n* Appointments\n* Campaign promises\n* Criminal justice\n* Defense\n* Economy\n* Education\n* Environment\n* Foreign policy\n* Healthcare\n* Immigration\n* Rule of law\n* Public safety\n* Taxes\n* Tone of political discourse\n* Trade\n\nLet's have a productive discussion.",

Most submitters put it in the title, but that wasn't a requirement until now.\n* **The \"request for sources\" exemption to Rule D is eliminated.** *All* submissions must now include a link to a [qualified source.](https://www.reddit.com/r/NeutralPolitics/wiki/guidelines#wiki_sources) Submitters looking for sources are advised to include what they've found and explain why it's insufficient.\n* **Submissions that take the form of \"Does this label apply?\" are explicitly prohibited.** We've long rejected such posts, because they're reductionist, which runs directly counter to the subreddit's purpose to explore issues in depth. But this policy wasn't explicitly stated in the rules until now.\n* **The following guidance for Rule 2 has been added to match r/NeutralNews:**\n\n> All statements of fact must be clearly associated with a supporting source. Users can hyperlink a source for the claim (preferred), provide a footnote (^1 or [1]), or enclose the link in parentheses. If you're referencing a source in the submission or one that's already been posted in the same comment chain, please indicate that and block quote the relevant section.\n\n**Other announcements and guidance:**\n\n* The description of the subreddit as it appears in Reddit searches has been updated.\n* Reminder: our [submission rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/NeutralPolitics/wiki/guidelines#wiki_submission_rules) don't allow polls, requests for opinion, or promotion of one's own content. \n* Did you google it? Many submitted questions can be answered with a simple web search. The subreddit itself is also searchable.\n* Along those lines, our [Frequent Topics wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/NeutralPolitics/wiki/frequenttopics) is a resource for discussions about issues that come up often.\n* Previous META posts have good explanations of this subreddit's [origin,](https://www.reddit.com/r/NeutralPolitics/comments/4cxvz1/meta_neutralpolitics_origins_and_purpose/) [philosophy,](https://www.reddit.com/r/NeutralPolitics/comments/4wwj5n/meta_on_the_meaning_of_neutral/) and [moderation style.](https://www.reddit.com/r/NeutralPolitics/comments/8qvwvw/meta_reminders_and_clarifications_about_the_rules/)\n\nThanks to all our users for continuing to make this little corner of the internet a great place for evidence-based discussion.

I understand that Labour are saying there is no financial donations here - the volunteers pay for their own flights, and accommodation is provided for free by Democrats.\n\nBut what I’m really interested in, is whether this kind of thing happens every election cycle, or whether it’s unusual. Do Labour always send volunteers? Do the Tories ever send volunteers to campaign for the Republicans? Have the Tories ever sent volunteers specifically to campaign for Trump, either in this election cycle or the two previous ones?",

The winner is whichever candidate garners at least 270 votes in the electoral college. If no candidate reaches that threshold, the election is [thrown to the House of Representatives,](https://centerforpolitics.org/crystalball/republicans-retain-edge-in-electoral-college-tie/) which casts one vote per delegation. Presently, the Republican Party controls the majority of House delegations.\n\nThis year, there are four Presidential candidates on the ballot in enough states to reach 270 electoral college votes. They are:\n\n**Kamala Harris**    \nParty: Democratic    \nPolicy page: https://kamalaharris.com/issues/     \n\n**Donald Trump**    \nParty: Republican    \nPolicy page: https://www.donaldjtrump.com/platform    \n\n**Chase Oliver**    \nParty: Libertarian    \nPolicy page: https://votechaseoliver.com/platform/      \n\n**Jill Stein**   \nParty: Green   \nPolicy page: https://www.jillstein2024.com/platform\n\nA number of other candidates have [partial ballot access,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_United_States_presidential_election#With_partial_ballot_access) meaning not enough to win a majority in the electoral college.\n\n------\n\n**Voting FAQ:**\n\n*Q: Am I eligible to vote?*    \nA: If you are a U.S. citizen who will be at least 18 years old on the day of the election, you are likely [eligible to vote.](https://www.usa.gov/who-can-vote)\n\n*Q: Is it too late to register to vote?*     \nA: It depends. A few states' deadlines have passed, others are approaching, and a few allow registration up until the same day as the election. [Look up your state's information here.](https://www.vote.org/voter-registration-deadlines/)\n\n*Q: Where do I vote on Election Day?*     \nA: Voters are assigned a polling place based on the address where they're registered. Find your polling place [here](https://www.headcount.org/find-your-polling-place/) or [here.](https://www.vote.org/polling-place-locator/)\n\n*Q: What are the hours of my polling place?*     \nA: [Find the opening and closing times for your polling place here.](https://ballotpedia.org/State_Poll_Opening_and_Closing_Times_\\(2024\\))\n\n*Q: Do I need to show identification to vote?*     \nA: Most states require some form of identification when you register and/or when you vote. The rules vary state by state. [This interactive map will help you determine the requirements for your state.](https://www.ncsl.org/elections-and-campaigns/voter-id#anchor12536)\n\n*Q: Can anyone find out how I voted?*    \nA: No. Your vote is confidential. You enter the booth alone and make your choices in private. If your polling place gives some kind of receipt, it will only indicate *that* you voted, not *how* you voted. \n\n*Q: What if I go to the polls and they tell me I am not registered to vote?*     \nA: Per [this site:](https://www.rockthevote.org/voting-information/voting-faqs/) First, make sure you are at the right polling place. If you are at the wrong polling place they will not have your name on the list of voters. If you are at the correct location and are not on the list, you can still cast a ballot. Ask the poll worker for a *provisional* ballot. After the polls close on Election Day the state will check on the status of your voter registration and if there was a mistake made. The state must notify you as to whether your ballot was counted.\n\n*Q: On Election Day, if I think my rights have been violated, what should I do?*    \nA: Call or text the Election Protection Hotline at 866-687-8683. There will be lawyers on hand to answer Election Day questions and concerns about voting procedures.\n\n*Q: Can I vote if I'm out of the country?*    \nA: Yes. U.S. citizens who will be over 18 on election day may vote even if they're traveling, serving, or residing outside the country. The specific rules for overseas voters vary based on a number of factors. More information can be found through the [Federal Voting Assistance Program.](https://www.fvap.gov/)\n\n*Q: Do I have to wait until election day to vote?*     \nA: Probably not. Early voting has begun, or will soon begin, in all states that have it. Check the [rules and deadlines for your particular state here,](https://www.usvotefoundation.org/early-voting-dates) noting that early voting *ends* before election day in some states.\n\n*Q: Do I have to be registered with the party of the candidate I want to vote for?*    \nA: No. In general elections, you can vote for any candidate of any party, no matter your personal affiliation. Depending on the state where you're registered, primary elections may be different, but those have all passed for this cycle.\n\n*Q: Do I need to vote on every candidate and issue in order for my ballot to be valid?*    \nA: No. Your ballot is valid even if you decline to vote on specific races or questions. Your vote will still be counted in the contests where you voted.\n\n*Q: May I bring notes and/or a sample ballot into the voting booth?*    \nA: Yes, you're allowed to bring notes with you, but some polling places restrict the use of cell phones, so notes should be on paper.\n\n*Q: Where can I learn more about the candidates and issues on my ballot?*    \nA: For ballot initiatives, your Secretary of State's office will usually send a voter information booklet and sample ballot, which may also be available on their website.

      "text": "As I've watched the increased divisiveness in US politics, I've become interested in historical and modern examples of institutional neutrality. I'm particularly interested in whether those examples have had a unifying effect on the underlying political system, haven't had much effect, or have caused disruption.\n\nPlease reply to this post with examples of institutional neutrality you are aware of and any documented effect of that neutrality. I will add one example to start us off:\n\nSpeaker of the House of Commons in the UK ([link](https://www.parliament.uk/business/commons/the-speaker/speaker-and-the-chamber/)): I was not initially aware that the UK had institutionalized complete neutrality in their Speaker of the House of Commons. The person who fills this office must resign from their political party and cannot be part of a political party for the rest of their life, even after retirement. They have relatively neutral rules on who can talk when. The speaker doesn't take part in debate or vote, except as a tie-breaker, but even then, there are a set of [rules](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speaker_Denison's_rule) they traditionally follow in order to maintain their relative neutrality.\n\nAs to whether the neutrality of the speaker is seen as unifying or disruptive, the claim is given (on the official speaker's website, so likely some bias there) that it is universally considered \"one of office's most important features - and most emulated or aspired to outside the UK.\" ([link](https://www.parliament.uk/about/living-heritage/evolutionofparliament/parliamentwork/offices-and-ceremonies/overview/the-speaker/procedures-and-impartiality/)) That site also claims this is accepted by all sides in the UK. I'm not terribly familiar with the effect of the neutrality on parliament, but I tend to believe that claim, considering I couldn't find any substantive sources online complaining about that neutrality or calling for non-neutrality of that office. I would be interested in folks from the UK discussing this from their better-informed position.\n\nPlease add any other examples you are aware of. I am especially curious about people from countries or localities listed on [this](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-partisan_democracy) Wikipedia page. Apparently those countries/localities have institutionalized non-partisan democracy to some extent.",

      "text": "Trump and JD [Vance](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/vance-trump-2020-election-b2623517.html), along with most of the rest of the Republican party, continue to repeat the lie that the 2020 election was \"stolen\", which Trump first began to tell a few weeks before the 2020 election. As [conservative legal experts](https://lostnotstolen.org/), [Stanford researchers](https://www.cato.org/blog/two-scholars-revisit-trumps-election-fraud-claims), and many other analysts have shown, these are lies. Not only lies, but transparent lies. From the Stanford report:\n\n> At no point did Trump or his allies present even remotely plausible evidence of consequential fraud or illegality.\n\nNone of these cases showed any significant vote or election fraud, and [most](https://campaignlegal.org/results-lawsuits-regarding-2020-elections) were found to be without any merit. While there's nothing illegal or even necessarily wrong with challenging election results in court, the basis of these challenges were lies, which Trump and the GOP continue to endorse. In part fueled by those lies, the Republican party attempted to overthrow the 2020 election and appoint Trump for a second term. Those events culminated most dramatically on January 6th, when, according to the [January 6th committee](https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/GPO-J6-REPORT/html-submitted/index.html):\n\n> Based on false allegations that the election was stolen, Donald Trump summoned tens of thousands of supporters to Washington for January 6th. Although these supporters were angry and some were armed, Donald Trump instructed them to march to the Capitol on January 6th to “take back” their country.\n\nHowever, the attempts to overturn the 2020 election were not limited to the riot on January 6th. The [new filing](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/02/us/politics/trump-jan-6-case-jack-smith-evidence.html?unlocked_article_code=1.PU4.Phgi.FCBFT7VUGWWs&smid=url-share) by Jack Smith's team in the case charging Trump with attempting to overthrow the election adds new details, in addition to confirming the findings of the January 6th Committee's report. The plot also was much larger than the riots of January 6th. The indictment and [other reporting](https://americanoversight.org/investigation/the-alternate-electors-plot-to-overturn-the-2020-election/) has detailed the \"fake electors\" scheme, in addition to attempts to overturn the votes of individual states. Some of these attempts have resulted in [criminal convictions](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/republican-election-denier-tina-peters-sentenced-to-9-years-in-prison-for-voting-data-scheme). The plot (or plots) to overturn the election were not supported by all Republicans, with key Republican elected officials and judges refusing to comply. Many, however, did, including [147 congress members](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2021/01/07/us/elections/electoral-college-biden-objectors.html). Since then, many Republicans who opposed Trump have been replaced with [election deniers](https://electiondeniers.org/), and many Republicans who originally condemned January 6th have [since recanted](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2021/10/06/nikki-haley-biggest-gop-flip-flops-trump-post-jan-6/).\n\nMultiple plots by Republicans to overturn the 2024 election are already [known to be underway](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Republican_Party_efforts_to_disrupt_the_2024_United_States_presidential_election&oldid=1248655479#False_allegations_of_rigged_election). Trump is both the Republican presidential nominee and de-facto [leader of the RNC](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/trump-officially-takes-over-republican-national-committee-rcna142362), so these plots aren't just fringe groups, they are backed by the Republican Party and [financed by](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/apr/05/heritage-foundation-election-voting-rights-republican-states) wealthy conservative groups and individuals. While [many Republicans](https://www.axios.com/2024/10/03/harris-anti-trump-republicans-2024-endorsements) have endorsed Harris, in part because of these attempts to overturn the election, nearly all of them are \"former\" elected officials, or those who are not seeking re-election. [70% of Republican voters](https://www.cnn.com/2023/08/03/politics/cnn-poll-republicans-think-2020-election-illegitimate/index.html) claim Biden lost the 2020 election.\n\nElection integrity experts have identified [many points of vulnarability](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/13/us/politics/republican-election-campaign-2024.html?unlocked_article_code=1.PU4.D5K8.v8X7iDz7UocB&smid=url-share) in the US election system, presenting a large attack surface rather than a single point of failure. This also allows individual actors to attack races at the destrict, state, and national levels without needing to coordinate directly. In fact, this process is [already underway](https://popular.info/p/how-republicans-could-subvert-the).\n\n> ...in 2020, “at least 17 county election officials across six swing states attempted to prevent certification of county vote totals.” In 2022, it grew to “at least 22 county election officials” who voted to delay certification in swing states. This year, there have been “at least eight county officials” that have already voted against certifying election results for primary or special elections.\n\nIn the event that Republicans try to disrupt and overturn the results of the 2024 Presidential election, what actions are being taken to thwart that effort and preserve democratic norms?\n\nWhat, if anything, can ordinary citizens do about this?",

Schumer. It seems to me that is one way for the Legislature to retain some measure of control.  \n\nOn the other hand, should the CR pass, it will mean strengthening the Exec. branch and weakening the Legislative.  \n>“It is not a simple stopgap that keeps the lights on and the doors open,” said Rep. Rosa DeLauro, the top Democrat on the House Appropriations Committee. “This is Republican leadership handing over the keys of the government, and a blank check to Elon Musk and to President Trump.”  \n[Source: AP](https://apnews.com/article/congress-budget-funding-government-shutdown-e027a644af4152377b8cf99f6a91102f)  \n\nWhile the dollar amount is much smaller, in [an interview with CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2025/03/13/politics/ocasio-cortez-schumer-democratic-shutdown-plan/index.html), Rep.

Most predictive models are largely predicting a \"50/50\" result for the upcoming 2024 election, including basically 50/50 chances in most battleground states [\\[1\\]](https://www.economist.com/interactive/us-2024-election/prediction-model/president) [\\[2\\]](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2024-election-forecast/) [\\[3\\]](https://www.natesilver.net/p/nate-silver-2024-president-election-polls-model).\n\nMy questions and appeal for conversation/discussion:\n\n* If predictive models are simply summing up and weighing error-prone polls, how does such a summation result in a more accurately framed \"probability\" for election outcomes?\n* How are elections \"probabilistic outcomes\"? The election will be determined by voters - there is no skill, chance, or luck involved, and certainly not to the degree of something like a professional sports match.\n* If a predictive model can't really tell who wins the election at 70%+ probability, then what value does it provide and what insight does it provide and what value does it add to the conversation? I understand a 30% chance of something happening is a far cry from \"impossible\" but what value does it add when we can simply look at polls to understand who is likely to be ahead?\n* Would we be better served and informed by looking at individual polls to make a guess at who is ahead?\n* What do the \"predictive models\" add to the conversation?\n\nI can see models adding some value to the discussion by calling out inaccurate polls or polls with flawed methodology ([Nate Silver's post calling out \"herding\" is a great example](https://www.natesilver.net/p/theres-more-herding-in-swing-state)). I'm not sure how the \"predictive models\" themselves add anything to the conversation.",

As it happened so close to the presidential election, the federal government's response to Helene has become a big political issue, with Republicans criticizing the Biden administration's response to the hurricane. This has come with some misinformation, e.g. [the false claim](https://www.fema.gov/node/fema-will-only-provide-750-disaster-survivors-support-their-recovery) that hurricane victims are only receiving $750 from FEMA (there are other FEMA programs that help victims in addition to the $750 program). Democrats have largely deflected criticism towards Republicans, making the point that many Republicans [voted against increasing FEMA funding](https://www.latintimes.com/hurricane-helene-florida-fema-relief-republicans-voted-matt-gaetz-marjorie-taylor-greene-nancy-mace-560943) right before Helene made landfall. In the midst of this partisan discussion, something that I think has been overlooked is the *actual* state of the federal government's response to Helene.\n\nAt the same time, there may be legitimate concerns about the response to Helene that are being overlooked in partisan discussions. For example, in the aftermath of Helene, FEMA faces the risk of [running out of money](https://apnews.com/article/hurricane-helene-congress-fema-funding-5be4f18e00ce2b509d6830410cf2c1cb) before the end of the hurricane season, which was also an issue [last year](https://www.politico.com/news/2023/08/30/fema-disaster-low-funds-00113468) and at [other points in the past](https://money.cnn.com/2011/08/29/news/economy/fema_funds_hurricane_irene/index.htm). Earlier this year, FEMA [changed its rules](https://apnews.com/article/fema-disaster-assistance-7291e5b45c8246266613ba8d8bec75de) to better respond to hurricanes, but those changes came with an estimated $671 million annual cost which FEMA may not be able to afford without more funding. These rules were in effect for Helene, but not for past hurricanes.\n\n**These are my questions: What is the actual state of the federal government's response to Hurricane Helene? What have been the biggest shortfalls of the federal government's response to Helene (especially compared to past hurricanes like Idalia, Ian, and Ida)?**",

At the core of its deterrent functions is [Article 5,](https://www.nato.int/cps/en/natohq/topics_110496.htm) whose collective defense principles mean that an attack on one ally is considered as an attack against all allies. Article 5 has long been considered a successful deterrent to aggression in Europe, at first countering the Warsaw Pact countries, and later Russia.\n\nBut things changed with the rise of Donald Trump, who has been [openly critical of NATO.](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/02/11/us/politics/trump-nato.html) It was widely reported that soon after Trump took office, NATO's mutual defense obligations were explained to him and he responded, \"You mean, if Russia attacked Lithuania, we would go to war with Russia?\" adding, \"That’s crazy.\" Just the suggestion that the United States could not be depended on would compromise the value of such an alliance, but in 2020, Trump went a step further, reportedly [telling the European Commission President,](https://www.politico.eu/article/donald-trump-vow-never-help-europe-attack-thierry-breton/) \"You need to understand that if Europe is under attack we will never come to help you and to support you.\" He then added, \"By the way, NATO is dead, and we will leave, we will quit NATO.\"\n\nNow, despite Russia [annexing part of Georgia in 2008, Crimea in 2014, and fomenting a war in Donbas,](https://mwi.westpoint.edu/countering-russian-aggression-twenty-first-century/) all prior to [invading Ukraine in 2022,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_invasion_of_Ukraine) nine NATO countries have still [not met their recommended military funding targets.](https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/blogs/econographics/whos-at-2-percent-look-how-nato-allies-have-increased-their-defense-spending-since-russias-invasion-of-ukraine/) And after nearly three years of war in Ukraine with an intensive [sanctions regime against Russia,](https://carnegieendowment.org/research/2024/03/why-russia-has-been-so-resilient-to-western-export-controls?lang=en) weapons production in NATO countries still [lags way behind Russia.](https://www.lemonde.fr/en/international/article/2024/07/11/the-scale-of-russia-s-rearmament-has-nato-worried_6681537_4.html#)\n\nOn the other hand, NATO countries still have the [nuclear umbrella](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_umbrella) that didn't extend to Ukraine.

Lindsey Graham visited Nebraska Gov. Jim Pillen, Secretary of State Bob Evnen, and two dozen Republican legislators to discuss how the state allocates its electoral votes. If Nebraska were to switch to a winner-take-all system, it would almost certainly give former President Donald Trump an extra electoral vote in what is expected to be a tight presidential race.That one electoral vote could prove decisive.\n\n[If Vice President Kamala Harris wins Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin but loses every other swing state](https://www.nbcnews.com/specials/road-to-270-electoral-college-interactive-map-2024-election/#id=463507d1-6bc3-11ef-a686-83f68d396a14), she and Trump would be tied at 269 Electoral College votes under a winner-take-all setup in Nebraska with Trump winning the state. In that scenario, the race would be thrown to the U.S. House, where each state delegation would get one vote for president. Republicans hold a majority of delegations and are favored to retain it, even though the House majority could change hands after the November election.\n\nIs there a precedent for a state changing how electoral votes are allocated so close to the election? \n\nAnd is this a tactic to benefit their preferred candidate?

The two particular aspects of the report I would be most interested in are as follows:\n\n1 - Did the No Labels movement take neutrality too far by being tagged as not standing for anything? If that is the case, what sorts of positions could a political movement advance while still being viewed as politically neutral? I have my own strong opinions on this topic, but I will refrain.\n\n2 -  Did the No Labels movement fail by going after the presidency instead of congress? Going after the presidency is an especially interesting choice considering that both houses of congress currently have extremely tenuous majorities (46 Democrats, 49 Republicans, and 4 independents for the [senate](https://www.senate.gov/senators/) (on the left column of the website) where 51 is a majority, and 220 Republicans and 211 Democrats for the [house](https://radiotv.house.gov/house-data/party-breakdown), where 218 is a majority).

Unfortunately, Tuesday is not likely to be the end of it, so this post is designed to let people know what to expect moving forward.\n\n----\n\n* **Votes take time to be counted.** Many states [do not even begin counting their absentee/mail-in ballots](https://ballotpedia.org/When_states_can_begin_processing_and_counting_absentee/mail-in_ballots,_2024) until the polls close on Election Day, meaning they will take an especially [long time to report and certify a full count.](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2024-election/when-race-called-election-2024-harris-trump-president-rcna175473) In 2020, fifteen states [didn't certify until at least four weeks after the election,](https://ballotpedia.org/Election_results_certification_dates,_2020) and in 2016, [some were even later.](https://ballotpedia.org/Election_results_certification_dates,_2020)\n* As the results are coming in, **changes to the count are normal**. The fact that someone is leading at one point and then behind at another is entirely a function of which ballots from which districts are being counted. It doesn't indicate that anything unusual has happened. Moreover, areas with higher population density logically take longer to process their ballots and they [tend to lean left,](https://www.econlib.org/why-are-there-zero-republican-mega-cities/) so [late shifts leftwards are quite common.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_shift_\\(politics\\))\n* Based on the [polling,](https://www.realclearpolling.com/polls/president/general/2024/trump-vs-harris) this could be [**one of the closest races** in the last 60 years.](https://edition.cnn.com/2024/09/22/politics/closest-presidential-race-harris-trump/index.html) Don't let anyone tell you it should be a landslide just because they're immersed in communities, social circles, or media silos that unflappably support one side.

Some challenges have already been filed and there will assuredly be others up until and after the polls have closed. This is not unusual, though given the political climate, the volume may be higher this year. More claims does not indicate malfeasance or unreliability in the system.\n* **Legal challenges are not the same as \"election denialism,\"** which can be [defined as](https://reason.com/volokh/2022/08/29/three-reforms-to-protect-democracy-from-election-denialism/) a willingness \"to deny *the lawfully determined outcome* of an election.\" If a candidate is unwilling to accept the results *after* the challenges have been filed and adjudicated, *that* is denialism.\n* **There may be recounts and runoff elections** in some races.

For context, I'm someone in high school who is very into politics (really elections and somewhat ideologies, mainly focused on the US Political system), and I am very much capable of forming my own opinions on issues, and bills, whether it be through knowledge or my view on current affairs. However, I'd like to go further in my knowledge about political systems, since I've delved into obscure rabbit holes focusing on small ideas, but I'd like to broaden the scope.\n\nI've read books such as [Maus](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/15196.Maus_I) and [Persepolis](https://www.amazon.com/Persepolis-Childhood-Pantheon-Graphic-Library/dp/037571457X), and I've loved it, however, it's been a bit hard to find some more graphic novels like that or actual intrinsic thinking books that relate to these geopolitical issues and economics.\n\nThe real thing I'm looking for is something that can be applied to economic systems and geopolitical intentions, such as things on the Middle East, or \"What are flaws of different economic systems like, capitalism, laissez-faire economics, trickle-down economics, communism, etc?\" I'd like some concrete bases on these things and actually understand the intentions of such economic systems, and understand the intentions of stark geopolitical conflicts and interests being pushed over the world.\n\nThank you so much!",

      "text": "**Background**\n\nThe [U.S. general election](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_United_States_elections) is 10 days away. Voting is not compulsory in the U.S., but it is [widely regarded as a civic or moral duty.](https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2022/11/04/most-americans-say-its-very-important-to-vote-to-be-a-good-member-of-society/)\n\nI've seen some posts lately questioning if voting is worthwhile or if it can make an appreciable difference in one's life. Participants in this subreddit presumably have a pro-voting bias, but for the sake of neutrality, let's try to set that aside when discussing this issue.\n\n**Pros**\n\nThere are many lists of reasons why one should vote. I found [this one,](https://www.dukechronicle.com/article/2024/10/102224-hildebrand-why-your-vote-matters) directed mostly at younger voters, to be appealing, because of it's arguments that [one's vote is effective](https://80000hours.org/articles/is-voting-important/) and gives people a seat at the table. \n\nAlso, the next president will determine some policies that will affect our long-term future, such as [Supreme Court appointments](https://www.politico.com/news/2024/07/28/warren-biden-supreme-court-ballot-00171530) and [climate change.](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/climate-change-action-depends-on-the-2024-election/) Even for people who don't vote in the swing states that will likely determine the presidential race, there are [down-ballot contests that will decide important questions of law and representation.](https://www.usatoday.com/story/graphics/2024/09/17/voters-guide-2024-down-ballot-races/74877540007/)\n\n**Cons**\n\n[Jason Brennan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jason_Brennan) is a well-known opponent of the idea that one's vote matters, and in fact, of democracy overall as a governing mechanism. Some of his reasons are that [the odds of affecting a race are vanishingly small,](http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~gelman/research/published/probdecisive2.pdf) most [citizens are uninformed,](https://www.annenbergpublicpolicycenter.org/political-communication/civics-knowledge-survey/) and the particular party that gets voted into power [doesn't have much of an effect on policy outcomes.](https://adamdynes.com/documents/0WP_2019_APSR_dynes-holbein_noisy-retro.pdf)\n\nAs a student of policy, and especially its cumulative effect, I don't find the first and last of those particularly convincing, though I'm open to other perspectives. I have some sympathy for the second point, though. Not everyone is interested enough in politics to research the issues, or informed enough to understand the nuances. Perhaps there's an advantage to the population not being subject to governance determined by the choices of such people. \n\n**Questions**\n\n* What's the evidence supporting why someone should or shouldn't vote? \n* What are the historical consequences of high or low voter turnout? \n* How do democracies deal with the issue of under-informed voters and is their prevalence a reasonable argument against encouraging widespread voting?",

      "text": "After the 2000 election, in which there were controversies over absentee ballots being counted in Florida, the New York Times completed a landmark investigation into the process around counting ballots and uncovered several irregularities which allowed Bush to be declared the winner in the state over Gore.\n\n[EXAMINING THE VOTE; How Bush Took Florida: Mining the Overseas Absentee Vote](https://www.nytimes.com/2001/07/15/us/examining-the-vote-how-bush-took-florida-mining-the-overseas-absentee-vote.html)\n\nThe article calls out several process failures which would not necessarily fall under the commonly considered \"voter fraud\" umbrella (whereas voter fraud is commonly referring to things like double voting, voting with a stolen identity, voting on behalf of a deceased person, etc).\n\n>In an analysis of the 2,490 ballots from Americans living abroad that were counted as legal votes after Election Day, The Times found 680 questionable votes. Although it is not known for whom the flawed ballots were cast, four out of five were accepted in counties carried by Mr. Bush, The Times found. Mr. Bush's final margin in the official total was 537 votes.\n\n>The flawed votes included ballots without postmarks, ballots postmarked after the election, ballots without witness signatures, ballots mailed from towns and cities within the United States and even ballots from voters who voted twice. All would have been disqualified had the state's election laws been strictly enforced.\n\nThere is information about high level, abstract \"ballot rejection\" statistics, such as this MIT paper:\n\n[A Deep Dive into Absentee Ballot Rejection in the 2020 General Election](https://elections-blog.mit.edu/articles/deep-dive-absentee-ballot-rejection-2020-general-election)\n\nAnd this article applying regression models to voting intentions:\n\n[No evidence for systematic voter fraud: A guide to statistical claims about the 2020 election](https://www.pnas.org/doi/full/10.1073/pnas.2103619118)\n\nBut similar models were also applied to the 2000 election in Florida and did not uncover statistically significant conclusions based purely on the data:\n\n[Statistical Issues in the 2000 U.S. Presidential Election in Florida](https://scholarship.law.ufl.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1253&context=jlpp)\n\nThe conclusions of the statistical analysis stands in stark contrast to the process irregularities uncovered by the New York Times report from 2001.\n\nWhat I am looking for is a deep dive into the actual specifics and potential inconsistencies in actually applying different standards across ballots to influence a winner (process irregularities, process fraud). Has there been any journalism with a similar level of detail to the 2000/2001 New York Times investigation regarding the 2020 election, potentially as a result of either legal discovery owing to the various lawsuits or research uncovered via investigative journalism, one way or the other?",

Is democracy itself eroding from within, with parts of the population becoming increasingly skeptical or even hostile toward it?\n\nCould superpowers like Russia and China be benefiting from this? We know Russia has been highly effective in disinformation campaigns, influencing divisions and amplifying social rifts in democratic societies. ( https://publications.armywarcollege.edu/News/Display/Article/3789933/understanding-russian-disinformation-and-how-the-joint-force-can-address-it/ ) But there also seems to be a deeper, internal shift going on that might go beyond any foreign influence, or maybe not?\n\nSo, where is this paradigm shift really coming from? Are these long-standing societal issues that are only now coming to the surface? Or is this part of a larger strategy by external powers to destabilize the West? \n\nI’m really interested in hearing different perspectives, especially from those who follow global geopolitics / history closely.

Admittedly anecdotal, but my personal SPAM volume greatly exceeds the \"8 per user per month\" stated in this source: mine is more like 10-20 per DAY.)\n\nGiven the FTC's assertion about this being their \"top consumer complaint\" I am surprised that (AFAIK) some enterprising elected official hasn't gone after this issue. Or have they?\n\nWhat new legislation has been proposed to address the problem? What has prevented existing regulation from being effective? Why is the Do Not Call Registry (Source: [https://www.donotcall.gov/](https://www.donotcall.gov/)) ineffective? Does the SPAMers' business model depend on acquiring new phone numbers in bulk, so limiting those sales is a reasonable target for new regulation?\n\nI look forward to your explanations!",

      "text": "And as a secondary question, what direct evidence is there that Musk exaggerated or was flat out wrong about fraud, waste, and abuse he claimed existed?\n\nI've largely spent the past couple days combing through social media and the news surrounding Elon Musk's DOGE, and I have to say it's absurd how hard it is to actually verify all the claims that both sides are making in this debate. It's honestly beyond frustrating how much time it takes to attempt to be informed, and I think it's a real problem for our democracy that quality information is so hard to come by.\n\n**Here's a sample of a few things I've found evidence for on the \"Musk and Trump's are eliminating fraud, waste and abuse side\"**\n\nDOGE has done everything it could to shut down USAID, and it does seem that USAID made some questionable spending decisions (among doing some quality work as well). First, it seems they were at least negligent in preventing funds intended for aid for ending end up in the hands of terrorists such as Hamas in Palestine, the Taliban in Afghanistan, [Source](https://dailycaller.com/2025/02/04/biden-admin-terrorist-1-3-billion-trump-foreign-aid/) and Al-Qaida in Syria. [Source](https://oig.usaid.gov/node/7283?utm_source=chatgpt.com). To be clear, this happened over the course of multiple administrations, not just Biden's.\n\nSecondly, they gave millions for different projects to an organization called Eco Alliance, before ceasing the grants when the organization was ultimately found to have run research with a lab with Wuhan, China without proper oversight. [Source](https://oversight.house.gov/release/breaking-hhs-formally-debars-ecohealth-alliance-dr-peter-daszak-after-covid-select-reveals-pandemic-era-wrongdoing/?utm)\n\nThird, USAID did use American taxpayer funds to develop DEI initiatives abroad, including $1.5 million in Serbia for advancing DEI and economic empowerment for LGBTQI+ people [Source](https://www.usaspending.gov/award/ASST_NON_72016922FA00001_7200) and $2 million for an organization that funds gender affirming care and advocates for LGBTQ+ rights in Guatemala. [Source](https://editorials.voa.gov/a/realigning-foreign-assistance-with-american-interests/7953297.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com) (you can argue whether this was waste/abuse, but it was done).\n\nUSAID's budget is roughly $40 billion, so you could make the case shutting it down saves taxpayers this amount - whatever we spend on foreign aid through any replacement mechanisms (foreign aid can still be distributed in other ways, like by the State Department, so it's almost certain even if USAID was totally shut down the savings would be less than $40 billion).\n\n**Here's a sample of a few things I've found evidence for on the \"Fake news/exaggeration by Musk/Trump about fraud, waste and abuse\":**\n\nDOGE eliminated the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), but according to their records, the CFPB has gotten back nearly $20 billion for American consumers who were defrauded or taken advantage of by corporations ([Records](http://consumerfinance.gov/enforcement/enforcement-by-the-numbers/)).\n\nMusk and Trump have also claimed USAID and other federal agencies were stealing $8 million a year from taxpayers, and giving it to Politico to write positive stories about Democrats. However, Politico has provided evidence that the fees were merely subscriptions that both Republican and Democratic policy makers had with the outlet ([Article](https://www.npr.org/2025/02/07/nx-s1-5290282/politico-subscriptions-usaid-x-musk-trump)).\n\nOn top of that, Musk has claimed that DOGE discovered FEMA decided to give $59 million to house immigrants in luxury hotels, instead of providing hurricane relief to Americans. But people pointed out these funds were publicly authorized by Congress separate from any disaster relief funding, and only distributed FEMA in accordance with Congress’s orders ([Post](https://x.com/David_J_Bier/status/1888976312456417373) and [Law](https://www.congress.gov/118/plaws/publ47/PLAW-118publ47.pdf)) In other words, DOGE didn't discover anything and this was Congress’s decision not FEMA’s. And FEMA officials have said the amount spent on standard and temporary housing for migrants was $19 million in accordance with Congress’s direction. On top of that, they note 13,000 North Carolinian households stayed in hotels FEMA paid for after the hurricane, and 3,000 still remain in those hotels ([Press Release](https://www.fema.gov/press-release/20250207/north-carolina-153000-families-receiving-fema-help?)).\n\n**I'm curious what others have found on both sides of this debate. It feels like it take a village to curate the news these days, and this seems like a community that is dedicated to that sort of noble effort. Please let me know what you've found!**\n\n**\\[Edit\\] Just want to thank everyone for all the comments and engagement! I'm new to reddit obviously, so I'm very excited about the potential to work together here to find the best answers on everything going on in our world.**",

It includes US government payments to countries like Serbia, Bangladesh, and Cambodia for the promotion of civil rights, gender rights, voting rights, etc. in those countries. \n\nSuch programs are often referred to as a way for the US to project [\"soft power:\"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soft_power) *the ability to influence the behavior of others to get the outcomes you want... [through] economic and cultural influence, rather than coercion or military strength.*\n\nOne argument that often appears in commentary on this subject is that [China will supposedly swoop in and become the new \"soft power\" in these regions.](https://foreignpolicy.com/2023/09/29/congress-shutdown-us-china-ccp-soft-power-competition-biden-xi-jinping-beijing/)\n\nMy question is, what actual tangible benefits is the US getting from \"soft power\" in Cambodia or Serbia?

      "text": "The U.S. is currently using tariffs and trade restrictions as primary tools to influence trade relationships and protect domestic industries. According to the Council on Foreign Relations, tariffs are designed to protect local industries by making imports more expensive, thereby encouraging consumers to buy domestically produced goods. However, tariffs can also increase prices for consumers and reduce national income. A 2019 study published in the *Quarterly Journal of Economics* found that tariffs imposed by the U.S. in 2018 led to a $51 billion increase in costs for U.S. consumers and firms, and a net real income loss of $7.8 billion.² Similarly, the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) reported in 2020 that tariffs implemented between 2018 and 2020 would reduce U.S. real GDP by 0.5% and increase average consumer prices by 0.5%, with an average household income loss of $1,277.\n\nWould it be more effective or sustainable for the U.S. to negotiate trade access using a different mechanism — such as requiring partner countries to remit a small percentage of tax revenue collected from goods exported to the U.S.?\n\nFor example, if a country exports $20B of goods to the U.S. annually and agrees to remit 1.5% from those goods, the U.S. could collect $300M without directly impacting consumer prices. This structure would maintain price stability while reinforcing the idea that access to the U.S. consumer market is a privilege with associated obligations. The exporting country is still generating tax revenue from those goods — this model would simply give the U.S. a share of the pie. It's similar to the Apple App Store: developers gain access to a massive marketplace, but pay a percentage in return.\n\nHas any government ever implemented a model like this? Would it be practical or beneficial as an alternative to tariffs?\n\n**Sources:**  \n¹ Amiti, M., Redding, S. J., & Weinstein, D. E. (2019).

What does it depend on? (Some context with https://www.reuters.com/world/africa/what-are-west-africas-options-reverse-nigers-coup-2023-08-04/)\n\nAs a first point, instinctively I would say that it depends on what amount of support the current government receives from Russia (https://apnews.com/article/wagner-russia-coup-niger-military-force-e0e1108b58a9e955af465a3efe6605c0) (and possibly China, or other relevant countries?), and at the same time, on which amount of effort western countries would put into restoring the previous government.\n\nWhile the help from Russia may only depend on the mood of Putin, and on the results of the war in Ukraine, what determines the efforts (or lack of) of western powers?\n\nAs a second point, I am wondering about the intervention of Burkina Faso and Mali (https://www.reuters.com/world/africa/mali-niger-burkina-faso-sign-sahel-security-pact-2023-09-16/). Do they act more indipendently or accordingly to influences from third parties? And what about the ECOWAS?\n\nFinally, and most importantly, I am wondering about the relationships between Niger and western countries and western companies (I am thinking about uranium mining in particular, since https://www.reuters.com/markets/commodities/uranium-mines-niger-worlds-7th-biggest-producer-2023-07-28/).\n\nOn one side, I could think that Niger's new government should want to have bad relationships with western countries, France in particular. The government has been hostile with some western companies (https://www.reuters.com/markets/commodities/canadas-goviex-uraniums-stripped-niger-mining-rights-2024-07-05/, https://www.reuters.com/world/africa/niger-junta-temporarily-stops-granting-new-mining-licences-2024-01-25/), while pretty collaborative with others (https://www.globalatomiccorp.com/investors/news/news-details/2024/GLOBAL-ATOMIC-ANNOUNCES-NIGER-GOVERNMENT-SUPPORT-FOR-THE-DASA-PROJECT/default.aspx). Why is this happening, and what are the real intentions of the government? \n\nI asked my questions on Niger, but i would be happy to read any interesting consideration about similar situations in other african countries.",

      "title": "What are the goals and legality of US President Trump's 'Liberation Day' tariffs?",
      "text": "**Background**\n\nToday, the US President [announced tariffs](https://www.axios.com/2025/04/02/trump-tariffs-april-2-liberation-day) on 76 countries (49 plus the European Union), bringing the average effective US tariff rate to the [highest since 1872.](https://budgetlab.yale.edu/research/fiscal-economic-and-distributional-effects-20-broad-tariff)\n\nThis is a two-part question. \n\n**Goals?**\n\nFirst, what are the goals of the tariffs? \n\nIn the announcement, Trump said, \"We will supercharge our domestic industrial base, we will pry open foreign markets and break down foreign trade barriers.\" \n\nI can see a certain kind of logic in the first point there. If imported goods become more expensive, it stands to reason that at least *some* production would move to domestic facilities. For example, 18 car companies already [have plants in the US.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_automobiles_manufactured_in_the_United_States) If their imported models are subject to higher tariffs, they could theoretically shift production of those to US sites. Is that feasible? I don't really understand how tariffs pry open foreign markets.\n\nThe announced tariffs also claim to pursue \"fairness\" and \"rebalancing\" in trade. What's the evidence that US trade is unfair and imbalanced now?\n\nAre those the main goals of this policy shift and is there historical precedent for tariffs achieving them? \n\n**Legality?**\n\nMy second question is about the legality of this action. \n\nThe US Constitution explicitly [grants the Congress,](https://constitutioncenter.org/the-constitution/articles/article-i#article-section-8) not the President, the power to levy duties. \n\nIn the [executive order](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/04/regulating-imports-with-a-reciprocal-tariff-to-rectify-trade-practices-that-contribute-to-large-and-persistent-annual-united-states-goods-trade-deficits/) announcing today's moves, Trump claims authority under the [International Emergency Economic Powers Act,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Emergency_Economic_Powers_Act) which authorizes the president to regulate international commerce after declaring a national emergency in response to any unusual and extraordinary threat to the country. What is the threat on which the president is declaring a national emergency?\n\nThe order also claims authorities under the \"section 604 of the [Trade Act of 1974,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trade_Act_of_1974) as amended (19 U.S.C. 2483), and section 301 of title 3, United States Code.\" Is today's action a covered or typical use of those extra-legislative authorities?",

It offers some intriguing insights that raise important questions for discussion. The data show that labor migrants, particularly from Western countries, tend to contribute positively to public finances, with an average lifetime contribution of €42,000. In contrast, non-Western immigrants often face challenges, resulting in an average fiscal deficit of €167,000 over their lifetime. Native Dutch citizens, by comparison, contribute an average of €98,000.  \nInterestingly, even the second-generation immigrants that achieved education levels similar to native citizens, their earnings still lag behind, maintaining negative fiscal contributions.\n\nThis makes wonder: why it happens ? Do we need to revisit how newcomers are integrated into the labor market, ensuring they have the opportunities to contribute more effectively ?  \nThis study doesn’t provide all the answers but serves as a starting point for constructive dialogue. \n\nWhat policies have been implemented to enhance the economic impact of immigration and what's the evidence for their efficacy?\n\nStudy available here:  \n[https://www.iza.org/publications/dp/17569/the-long-term-fiscal-impact-of-immigrants-in-the-netherlands-differentiated-by-motive-source-region-and-generation](https://www.iza.org/publications/dp/17569/the-long-term-fiscal-impact-of-immigrants-in-the-netherlands-differentiated-by-motive-source-region-and-generation)",
