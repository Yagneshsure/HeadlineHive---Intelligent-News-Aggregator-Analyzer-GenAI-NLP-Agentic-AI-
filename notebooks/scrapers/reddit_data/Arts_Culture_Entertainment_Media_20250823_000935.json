      "text": "Dakota Johnson thought \"Madame Web\" was part of the MCU. When she realized that it was part of the godawful live-action Spider-Verse with no relation to the MCU or even Tom Holland's Spider-Man, it was too late. So she pretty much slept through the whole movie, speaking in a monotone voice that actually made her performance unintentionally hilarious and added into its status as a modern campy cult film. \n\nRooney Mara hated doing the Nightmare on Elm Street remake so much that she bragged about giving a bad performance on purpose. She still hates that movie with the force of a thousand suns. \n\nWhoopi Goldberg tried to get away from making \"Theodore Rex\", so much so she ended up getting sued for not doing her job, so she asked for a hefty paycheck, and did the movie in a black leather cat suit and a permanent grouch in her face. \n\nElizabeth Taylor didn't want to do Butterfield 8. She was grieving Mike Todd and ended up being forced to do it because she was under contract. She had to say lines like \"I'm the Slut of All time\" in the movie and it got released during the Eddie Fisher scandal which made it worse. Even winning the Oscar didn't change Taylor's mind, she thought she only won because she nearly died of pneumonia and threw the Oscar into the trash.",

You change one little thing and the future can change drastically. \n\nAnd yet ... The main character, in a situation where he wants to prove to someone that he has special Jesus like powers, goes back to his own childhood to a moment in class and makes a drastic change by violently mutilating himself in front of everyone, and then *ZIP* somehow we're back to the same point in the future and the only thing that changed was that he now has scars on his hands?!?\n\nWHACK\n\nAnyone have some other candidates?",

In the historical drama released earlier this month, Cynthia Erivo plays the legendary abolitionist — but one Hollywood executive initially thought the role should go to Julia Roberts. \n\n> Gregory Allen Howard, the screenwriter and producer of \"Harriet,\" recently revealed in multiple interviews that Roberts was suggested to play the lead role during a meeting with a studio president in 1994. \n\n> \"The climate in Hollywood… was very different back then,\" Howard said. \"I was told how one studio head said in a meeting, 'This script is fantastic. Let's get Julia Roberts to play Harriet Tubman.'\"\n\n> Howard said that a black person in the meeting said casting Roberts would be impossible because she is white. \n\n> \"That was so long ago. No one will know that,\" the executive replied, according to Howard.",

      "text": "***EIDT 3 PLEASE READ:*** I just wanted to say how incelby happy i am to see the insane amount of replies and support people have offered up. Im sorry to say that about 99% of the stuff suggested ive already seen, But there have been a few things. The biggest winner has been the classic \"Poirot\" series, ive seen all the \"Murder She Wrote\" stuff, and even every episode of Columbo, but \"Poirot\" had completely slipped through the cracks. Ive started watching now and its very enjoyable, perfectly what i was looking for!  \n  \nThank you again, while i cant possibly reply to all of you, not even read all the comments, i jist want to say thank you for everything. Even if what you suggested was on my list, or if what you suggested wasn't on the list but ive already seen it, it still means a lot to me that you took the time to offer something up.  \n  \nSo, thank you again!  \n  \n***EDIT 3 ENDS***\n  \nEdit 1: So far  I've seen literally ever suggestion so far. Ive spent most of my time in the last 10 years being really sick. Ive been hospitalized *countless* times so ive had an incredible amount of free time on my hands. I started this post because I couldn't think of *anymore* movies to watch that fit this bill.   \n  \nEdit 2: People don't really appreciate the amount of time being sick gives. Im asking this question in this post because ive already watched *every* popular movie or TV show from the past 30+ years. Most people can only carve out enough time to watch one or two movies a week, i have enough time to watch 5-7 movies a *day.* Being hospitalized as often as me, plus being sick outside of the hospital leaves you with *to much* free time. Honestly, it sucks. Again, im not asking htis because im lost and i need my next movie or show, im asking this because ive literally *run out* of movies and shows.  \n  \nTo be honest, this post is a bit depressing, i appreciate the immense amount of help, but its really putting into perspective all the time lost to this illness.  \n  \nI try googling this sort of thing but looking up \"competence porn\" just gets you... well.. porn. The best way to show off what im thinking is House M.D. im looking for movies or TV shows.  \n  \nIm going to lost everything I've already watched.  \n  \nHouse\nPerson of Interest  \nWhite Collar \nOceans 11 (plus the other ones)  \nInside man  \nSherlock  \nTinker Tailor Soldier Spy  \nCatch Me if You Can  \nHeat  \nThe Killer   \n   \nYou know what the mote is list the more I realize this is my favorite genre and ive probably seen a *lot* of these.  \n   \nHeists, spies, detectives, politic thrillers etc. Any kind of show where the characters are *super* good at something, usually running scams or working their ways around people, or just being better at something.  \n   \nI'll keep adding to this list if I remember more of someone recommends something ive already scene.     \n   \nEdit: reposted because autocorrect.  \n  \nThis list is what I've ALREADY seen.\n   \nThe original Law and Order seasons.  \nThe big short  \nWolf of wall street   \nMoneyball  \nCollateral  \nStar Trek  \nDoctor Who  \nNo country for old man  \nDREDD  \nBeekeeper  \nHunt fir red October (plus all the other Ryan films)  \nBourne series  \nMission impossible series   \nBurn notice  \nAll the presidents man  \nThe accountant   \nBaby driver  \nApollo 13  \nSpotlight  \nLeon the professional   \nThe town  \nDen of thieves  \nThe Martian.  \nThe Pitt  \nMaster and commander  \nArrival  \nMicheal Clayton  \nMad max moves   \nCast away",

Chel pops up from near Tulio’s lap, and Tulio looks flustered.",

The terrorists make a rule where they do a headcount of the kids and teachers every hour on the hour and for every kid missing they will execute 5 others.  So Sean Astin character sneaks out to hand US Army people intel of all the terrorists but is delayed getting back.  And here is the stupid part... To try and fake out the headcount to make it seem like everyone is there, one of the more prominent characters tries to get his head counted twice by sneaking up the line.  The guy that tries to do it = the biggest blackest kid in school made up of mostly white kids and like maybe 2 other black kids that are quite small AND don't wear glasses!!!  If you are trying to fake out the terrorists like this... don't choose the one guy that stands out a lot and will be easily remembered.\n\nWhat stupid things have you seen in a movie?  Scenes or moves by characters that make you genuinely scratch your head....  And I don't wanna read any comment about running away from a T-Rex in high heels!",

He'll then sit back down having missed 5-20 minutes without saying a word and never asks questions after the movie. \n\nIt used to drive me nuts when I lived at home over a decade ago and recently I stayed over one night and watched him do the same thing.  My mom doesn't even bother asking if she should pause. \n\nQuality doesn't matter either. It could be the greatest movie he's ever seen, but he'll still miss 10 minutes of it doing whatever. I've seen him take out the garbage, cook popcorn on the stovetop, and even fold laundry in another room all while a movie he wanted to watch was playing. \n\nThis is insane right? I understand not being in to a movie and getting bored, but in my 30+ years I've never seen or heard of him sitting through an entire movie.  This is the same guy who can sit on the porch for an hour or two doing nothing. I don't understand. \n\nTo be clear, I'm not trying to change him or anything. I just truly don't understand and want to see if anyone else knows someone like this.  \n&nbsp;  \n****EDIT**** People keep saying it's about spending time with others or not wanting to interrupt.

      "text": "Hello\nI'm pretty stressed lately and I'm looking for movies that are, in all aspects, calm and peaceful. It's okay if its a little sad or bittersweet or even funny—but I'm looking for something with almost no tension.\n\nMost movies, even really calm ones like howl's moving castle, have an act with a lot of tension and fighting, i'm looking for a movie without that. The first examples I come up with are where is marnie, which has beautiful scenery but is essentially devoided of big tension acts—and it's still great. Another example is lady bird, which even though had some tension with the mom plot, is pretty easy and not stressful to watch. For a show counterpart i'd say adventure time, midnight ghospel, gumball or hilda, since they are mostly quacky adventures that get resolved easily (I've watched those like a 100times though so thats why im looking now xD)\nIf you have ideas for series/shows too im up to it!\nI hope yall have some good ideas! Have a beautiful day everyone!\n\n\nEdit: Wow so many answers! I didnt expect it im so thankful for all I've received so far but I might not be able to answer to everything 😅. I'll watch them over the next few days. Thanks again!",

Interesting concept of the afterlife and solid world building and it also has a bit of suspense, considering that they don't know what will happen to them because they are in purgatory.\n\nWell, this movie has obviously met the typical 1990s romcom fate and disappeared into oblivion, but for me personally, since i watched  \"Defending your Life\" in the early 2000s, to quote Citizen Kane's Mr. Bernstein, not a month has gone by, that i haven't thought about that movie.\n\n\nDo you have a movie that isn't very popular or maybe considered a generic mass product in the general popculture conscious, that stuck with you?",

      "text": "Roger Ebert had this great quote about movies and watching them at different points in your life. Presented in full below.\n\n“Movies do not change, but their viewers do. When I saw La Dolce Vita in 1960, I was an adolescent for whom “the sweet life” represented everything I dreamed of: sin, exotic European glamor, the weary romance of the cynical newspaperman. When I saw it again, around 1970, I was living in a version of Marcello’s world; Chicago’s North Avenue was not the Via Veneto, but at 3 a.m. the denizens were just as colorful, and I was about Marcello’s age.\n\nWhen I saw the movie around 1980, Marcello was the same age, but I was 10 years older, had stopped drinking, and saw him not as a role model but as a victim, condemned to an endless search for happiness that could never be found, not that way. By 1991, when I analyzed the film a frame at a time at the University of Colorado, Marcello seemed younger still, and while I had once admired and then criticized him, now I pitied and loved him. And when I saw the movie right after Mastroianni died, I thought that Fellini and Marcello had taken a moment of discovery and made it immortal.”\n\n\\*\\*\n\nWhat are some movies that had this effect on you? Based on a previous discussion, 500 Days of Summer was one for me. When I first watched it, I just got out of a serious relationship, and Tom resonated with me. Rewatching it with some time, I realized Tom was flawed, and he was putting Summer on a pedestal and not seeing her as a person.\n\nDiscuss away!",

The writers wrote the story, then upon speaking to their representatives, they learned that Bad Robot was looping in pre-existing screenplays into the Cloververse, which became a cause for concern for the two writers. It was Paramount who decided against this, and allowed the film to be developed and released independently of the Cloververse as intended. \n\nEdit: As suggested in the comments, don't forget to provide sources to properly prevent the spread of more rumours.

Just movie stars being movie stars in a film that knows it’s featuring a shit ton of movie stars so the movie makes the most awesome decision of leaning into its movie star-ness. Everyone is cool. Everyone is a smooth-talking, smug, and intelligent bastard. Everyone is sexy. A movie so up its own ass that’s it’s actually endearing. Plotholes? Who gives a shit. Just enjoy Soderberg’s kinetic cinema unfold with snappy editing, great soundtrack, innovative camerawork, and witty dialogue. A turn your brain off movie that actually forces your brain to stay switched on due to the sheer amount of dopamine hits. Endlessly rewatchable and goes down super easy.\n\nLot of shit movies get defended because they’re “fun”. This movie is just straight up good BECAUSE it’s fun. Cinema with a capital “C”.",

He’s living with family members when an assistant coach says he could stay with him in his fancy house because it will be easier for him to go to school.\n\nWell, The Blind Side is on TV and it’s insane. They portray Michael as a homeless, scared simpleton who gets taken in by the rich family before he even joins the football team.\n\nThis has to be be one of the biggest difference between a true story and what’s on film I’ve seen (or at least know about).",

      "text": "Every year I try to go to the movies as much as possible. It’s my main hobby. I keep track of my thoughts/scores throughout the year, along with all of my ticket stubs. In theaters, I saw: 5 movies in 2015, 9 movies in 2016, 146 movies in 2017, 162 movies in 2018, 192 movies in 2019, 44 movies in 2020, 86 movies in 2021, 270 movies in 2022, 325 movies in 2023, and 298 movies this year. This doesn’t include rewatches, but those are pretty rare for me (7 this year). This is my 7th year doing this ranking on /r/movies. \n\nI have a subscription with AMC’s A-List, Regal’s Unlimited, and Cinemark’s MovieClub. I’m also a member of the Fort Lauderdale, Miami, and Toronto film societies. \n\nI attended 8 film festivals this year, for a total of 117 films. I attended 24 World Premieres, 11 North American Premieres, 7 US Premieres, 10 East Coast Premieres, 22 Southeast Premieres, 4 Canadian Premieres, and a few Florida/Georgia Premieres. \n\n96 of my screenings had cast and/or crew present for Q&As/intros. \n\nI do these rankings and reviews/random thoughts for fun. It’s not meant to be taken super seriously. I just like movies, and I like ranking them.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**Red Rooms** - 10/10 - The most gripping psychological-thriller since *The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo*.  Extremely disturbing and unsettling at times, but also stylish and sleek. The courtroom scenes and vampire-movie-like score stick with you for a long time. Juliette Gariépy puts in the best performance of anyone this year. There's so much amazing stuff happening with French-Canadian cinema recently and this is another great addition. Best movie of the year. One of the best movies of the past decade.\n\n**Dune: Part Two** - 9/10 - Sci-fi doesn't get much better than this. I have the seemingly-unpopular opinion that the first movie is better than the second, but both are near-perfect. Everything that can be said about Dune 1/2 has pretty much already been said. \n\n**Anora** - 9/10\n\n**Civil War** - 9/10\n\n**Nosferatu** - 9/10 - Gothic horror is so back. Lily-Rose Depp does things in this movie physically that I've never seen before on the big screen. Extremely impressed with her performance (and with Hoult/Dafoe/Skarsgard/Corrin as well). A great ensemble surrounded with perfect set design, direction, and cinematography. Loved the scenes in the castle that almost appeared black-and-white. Robert Eggers has not missed for me so far, and this is my favorite of his.\n\n**Challengers** - 9/10\n\n**Sing Sing** - 9/10 - Colman Domingo, give that man his Oscar [John Malkovich Rounders voice].\n\n**The Substance** - 9/10\n\n**You Are Not Alone** - 9/10 -\tPart La La Land, part Under the Skin, part Eternal Sunshine. A beautiful and hypnotic sci fi love story with a slight horror edge and with layers upon layers of metaphor.  It has a lot of interesting things to say about mid-20s loneliness/thoughts of suicide/love/etc.\n\n**Didi** - 9/10 -  I'm a sucker for coming-of-age dramas set in recent times. Give me more of this and mid90s-type movies pls.\n\n**The Order** - 8/10\n\n**We Live In Time**\t- 8/10 - I went in expecting heartbreak (which I got), but I didn’t expect how funny/sharp it would be. Florence and Andrew have 10/10 chemistry. Only thing keeping it from a higher score is the goofy Super Bowl of Food or whatever scene near the end. The scene at the beginning in the parking garage might be one of the most heart wrenching and well-acted scenes of the entire year. Top-tier score as well.\n\n**Love Lies Bleeding** - 8/10 - I would watch a 2-hour movie montage of Katy O'Brian working out beneath a highway underpass. A violent & twisted mess of sweat/blood/sex/tears/ungodly bodily noises. A real wicked fun time.\n\n**The Goldman Case** - 8/10 - French courtroom dramas, so hot right now. An insanely smart and water-tight screenplay with engrossing performances. It reminded me a lot of Anatomy of a Fall then I realized the co-star (Arthur Harari) in this film is the co-writer of Anatomy.\n\n**The Beast** - 8/10 - A movie that's almost impossible to describe but I'll try: Dystopian-future-sci-fi, period-drama, modern-incel-breakin-thriller, all while staying completely original and beautiful. Extremely layered story and performances. Lea Seydoux and George MacKay are 2 of my favorite actors and they pulled this off with extreme precision and care. One of more harrowing final scenes of the year for sure. \n\n**Conclave** - 8/10\n\n**Saturday Night** - 8/10 - Frenetic, engaging, and a really fun time. Flies by. I wanted more. So much energy.\n\n**September 5** - 8/10\n\n**The Brutalist** - 8/10 - I have some problems with the ending, feels like it undid a lot of what was experienced, but otherwise an impressive monster of a movie. Brody and Pearce are outstanding.\n\n**Io Capitano** - 8/10\n\n**Fremont** - 8/10 - I love movies that flow like light poems, like Petite Maman or Journey to A Mother's Room. It was a very sweet and cozy. The psychiatry sessions in particular were hilarious, and the bit where the diners are reading their fortunes in the restaurants were perfect. One of my favorite lines of the year is when the old lady fortune cookie writer dies at her desk, and the boss says “she was getting too old to write about the future anyway”. The lead and Jeremy Allen White were only onscreen together but their chemistry was infectious\n\n**Seagrass** - 8/10\n\n**LaRoy, Texas** - 8/10 - A hilariously-dark Coen Brothers throwback with wonderful performances from Steve Zahn and John Magaro (who I was lucky enough to meet prior to the screening). It's bloody and smart, and that's a rare combination.\n\n**A Quiet Place: Day One** - 8/10\n\n**The Last Showgirl** - 8/10 - Apart from a few awkward line-deliveries and questionable dialogue in spots, this was a very lowkey, engaging drama with a career-best performances from Pamela Anderson and Dave Bautista. Very dreamy and light.\n\n**Friendship**\t- 8/10 - It's so fucking stupid. Absolutely no plot to speak of. There's no character development. It's barely even a movie. It's basically a 90-minute sketch. All that being said, it's so goddamn hilarious. Non-stop laughs. Most I've laughed since Red Rocket probably. It's a can't-miss for any Tim Robinson fan and a can't-miss for any fans of laughing. Kate Mara was the perfect foil character. \n\n**The Wild Robot** - 8/10 - Yes, I cried, what of it?\n\n**Relay** - 8/10 - A very solid, tight, throwback to the type of paranoid corporate-thrillers they don’t really make anymore. A super fun twist that I didn’t see coming at all, and a standout turn from Lily James. It slightly loses its way near the end.\n\n**Good One** - 8/10 - Familiar and lowkey, but with a dark edge that slowly reveals itself, and a superb breakout role from Lily Collias. Great debut film from director India Donaldson.\n\n**A Complete Unknown**\t- 8/10 - There's definitely a lack of plot but at the end of the day we all just want to see Bob Dylan's Greatest Hits performed by a generational talent in Timothee Chalamet and it definitely delivers in that aspect.\n\n**Midwives** - 8/10 - One of the more stressful movies I’ve seen in a while. My anxiety was through the roof, especially in the first half. It’s so realistic and graphic at times (and some of it *has* to be real, some birth scenes especially) that you almost get a sense that it’s a documentary. Totally nails the landing too, making you feel real anger/empathy about how Midwives are treated in France (and other places I assume).\n\n**Hellbent On Boogie** - 8/10\t\n\n**Alien: Romulus** - 8/10 - Put Cailee Spaeny in anything and I'll watch it.\n\n**Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga** - 8/10\t\n\n**The Old Oak** - 8/10 - British realism cinema at it's finest. Just another classic added to Ken Loach's resume.\n\n**Longlegs** - 8/10\t\n\n**Babygirl** - 8/10\t\n\n**One Life** - 8/10 - I'm not a huge movie-cryer but I was absolutely balling my eyes out near the \"moment\". You know it's coming and it's still hit. Impressive when a movie can do that. Last movie that hit me like that was probably Tori and Lokita, and before that Moonlight. This was up there in terms of tears. Did not really expect it going in. Devasting. Anthony Hopkins kills these types of roles, he has a way of showing bottled up regret/sadness that not many others can.\n\n**The Ministry of Ungentlemanly Warfare** - 8/10 - Over-the-top violent fun time. Totally ridiculous but it doesn't take itself seriously and that's what keeps it from veering into. Also, Eiza Gonzalez. That is all.\n\n**Strange Darling** - 8/10\n\n**Los Frikis** - 8/10\t\n\n**Suncoast** - 8/10\t\n\n**Drive-Away Dolls** - 8/10 - I want more unapologetically horny movies like this. Loved all of Beanie Feldstein's bits and the slow, sleep-deprived descent into madness of the henchmen especially. Not too sure abou the weird-cheap transitions and trippy scenes though.  \"You're a day late and a penis short\" and \"Suki that's your wall dildo!\" are two of the funniest lines of the year, within context. Give me more fast-paced 75-minute movies.\n\n**In A Violent Nature** - 8/10 -This made me feel physically nauseous several times, would strongly recommend. Some of the gnarliest kills I've ever seen on the big screen. \n\n**A Real Pain** - 8/10\n\n**Abigail**- 8/10 - As a French-Canadian, big shoutout to Kevin Durand for his on-point Quebecois accent. Also, \"Sammy, those are fucking onions\" was one of the best/funniest line deliveries of the year. Really entertaining gory vampire flick. Dan Stevens is straight up having a fun time this year and I'm enjoying it every time. Melissa Barrera is now competing with with Mia Goth and Samara Weaving as top Scream Queens.\n\n**Deadpool & Wolverine** - 8/10\n\n**Bring Them Down** - 8/10 - I love me a slow-burn family feud drama that slowly snowballs into something dark and sinister. Christopher Abbott is one of my favorite working actors today and he does incredible work here, especially with the accent/Irish/body language. Disclaimer: Not recommended to people sensitive to animal violence/cruelty. There's a lot of that.\n\n**The Piano Lesson** - 8/10 - As far as Denzel Washington-produced, August Wilson adaptations are concerned, this is way above *Fences*. Felt less like a straight-up filmed play. The supernatural element and amazing Danielle Deadwyler performance (give her an Oscar soon pls) make this more layered and interesting. Bonus: I was sitting with/near the cast/crew for this one, 5-10 feet away from Denzel/Danielle/John David/Malcolm/Corey Hawkins/Ray Fisher/Michael Potts. Amazing experience.\n\n**Nickel Boys** - 8/10\n\n**Fresh Kills** - 8/10 - A really solid mob-drama told from the perspective of a mob boss' daughter, which I appreciated. It's rare you see this story from that angle. Emily Bader's scene with her dad near the end. Holy. Fucking. Shit.\n\n**Between The Temples** - 8/10 - Carol Kane was absolutely magnetic and a joy to watch in this, and Jason Schwartzman was her perfect endearing counter. Lovely movie, that makes you want to curl up into a ball and cringe to death near to end, in a good way. The most painful-to-watch family reunion/dinner since Shiva Baby. \n\n**Problemista** - 8/10 - I stand with Bank of America. Julio Torres is kind of a revelation in this. His facial expressions (and hilarious run-walk thing) are perfect. Absurd, funny, and sweet comedy with so much flair and uniqueness. Some fun little details that got good laughs out of me, like Tilda's character always having her phone light on. Chaotic in all of the right ways.\n\n**Sisterhood**\t- 8/10\n\n**Days of Happiness** - 8/10\n\n**The Apprentice** - 8/10 - It's not breaking any new ground but Sebastian Stan is a pleasure to watch transform into Trump as the movie goes on. Grimy and gross like the streets of New York in the 80s.\n\n**Wil** - 8/10\n\n**Naked Ambition: Bunny Yeager** - 8/10\n\n**Soul** - 8/10 - I didn't get to catch this during it's original run due to COVID so I'm glad it came back. My favorite Pixar movie in a little while.\n\n**Femme** - 8/10\t\n\n**I Saw the TV Glow** - 8/10 \n\n**Heretic** - 7/10 - A fun horror with sharp dialogue and an incredibly-hammy Hugh Grant performance.\n\n**Emilia Perez** - 7/10 - Some amazing musical numbers, especially the opener and \"El Mal\", and Zoe Saldana has an amazing performance where she carries the entire thing (Gomez and Gascon are getting lots of praise but I didn’t see it), but it just felt like it never fully came together to reach full potential.\n\n**Mountains** - 7/10 - A very small and warm movie about the very big and cold issue of gentrification and the real estate crisis in South Florida. Monica Sorelle is a director to watch for sure.\n\n**Skywalkers: A Love Story** - 7/10\t- Other than a few moments that seemed a bit scripted (mostly the relationship drama), this is the most thriller documentary since Free Solo.\n\n**Ghostlight** - 7/10\t\n\n**Shoshana** - 7/10 - Israeli true-life spy-thriller, a bit Bond-like. There's a few kills in here that are insanely brutal and the explosions/gunshots catch you by surprise. It had me jump a few times.\n\n**The Dead Don't Hurt** - 7/10- Extremely slow, don't go in expecting an action-packed Western, but Viggo has a really good eye for beautiful backgrounds and settings. Vicky Krieps is top-tier as always. This movie doesn't work without her. I like slow Westerns.\n\n**The Fall Guy** - 7/10\t\n\n**Thelma** - 7/10\t\n\n**Twisters** - 7/10 -Natural disaster flicks just work for me. Getting to look at Daisy Edgar-Jones for 2 hours never hurts as well.\n\n**Cuckoo** - 7/10 - Insanely impressive and physical performance from Hunter Schafer. Cool visual style and flair, but ultimately dragged down by a total clusterfuck of a plot. I was confused throughout. Hilarious German accent from Dan Stevens\n\n**Peak Season** - 7/10\t\n\n**Kneecap** - 7/10 - Some of the funniest one-liners of the year (\"Look who it is, Bone Thugz and no harmony\", \"I feel like I discovered the Beatles, if the Beatles were shit.\"). The whole RRAD storyline kept it from greatness though, that was a bit too goofy for its own good.\n\n**Wolfs** - 7/10 - I went in wanting Pitt/Clooney banter and that's exactly what I got.\n\n**Blink Twice** - 7/10\t\n\n**My Old Ass** - 7/10\t\n\n**Better Man** - 7/10\t\n\n**Nightbitch**\t- 7/10 - Your mom's favorite movie of 2024. The awful first trailer didn't do it justice, this was solid, it just doesn't get dark like you'd hope it would.\n\n**Out of Darkness**\t- 7/10 - Saw this during a Mystery Movie Monday and was pleasantly surprised. Pretty brutal, atmospheric, and violent. Some cool overhead shots and a nice score. One of the better Mystery Movies I've seen.\n\n**We Grown Now** - 7/10\t\n\n**The End We Start From** - 7/10\t\n\n**Kinds of Kindness** - 7/10 - Not the best Yorgos but deliciously-freaky and daring filmmaking nonetheless.\n\n**Babes** - 7/10\n\n**Fancy Dance** - 7/10\t\n\n**MaXXXine** - 7/10 - Definitely the weakest of the trilogy but still a solid slasher with a very interesting setting. Mia Goth has great moments like in the first two.\n\n**Horizon: An American Saga Chapter 1** - 7/10 - I don't care, the montage at the end was sick. I really hope Costner gets to fund as many of these as he wants.\n\n**Wicked - 7/10** - Pretty good, not great. Ariana Grande was the standout. There were only 2 songs that were really catchy though, wish there were more.\n\n**Juror #2** - 7/10\n\n**Fly Me to the Moon** - 7/10\t\n\n**The End** - 7/10 - Gorgeously-shot, super well acted, beautiful set design and production, but way too long and had no reason to be a musical. The songs were all exactly the same and pointless and there much so much time in between that you would forget it was even a musical. George MacKay kills it.\n\n**Being Maria** - 7/10\t\n\n**Cabrini** - 7/10 - Maybe a bit overlong but honestly not bad. Surprised it's from the same director as Sound of Freedom, it's quite a step up from that. Much larger and ambitious in scope, and the lead actress was really really great. It solidly panders to its intended audience but it’s well made enough that you can just gloss over the eye-rolling moments.\n\n**In the Land of Saints and Sinners** - 7/10 - The best Neeson action-flick in a while, so that's something. Kerry Condon as the big villain was awesome. Need more of her in stuff.\n\n**Y2K** - 7/10 - The single-funniest death scene of the year was the skateboard scene. Laughed so hard, made my night. Audience really dug this one too, good atmosphere. Fred Durst.\n\n**The Queen of My Dreams** - 7/10 - I was getting massive Deja Vu with The Persian Version last year. Extremely similar story and vibe, equally fun/honest/heartfelt.\n\n**Speak No Evil** - 7/10\t\n\n**Immaculate** - 7/10 - Sydney Sweeney stepping out of her comfort zone and doing a nun-horror is cool. Long take near the end was sick.\n\n**Gladiator II** - 7/10 - Doesn't hold a candle to the original but it was still an entertaining sandals & swords story. Fred Hechinger is so awful in this though. Man, that took me out of it. \n\n**Back to Black** - 7/10 - This movie is conflicting. In a vacuum, ignoring Winehouse's actual story, it's a solid music-biopic carried by a powerhouse breakthrough performance from Marisa Abela and an amazing soundtrack (obviously). On the other hand, it's a disgusting whitewash by her estate to downplay her truly awful father. The fact that he had final approval over this movie, and will financially benefit from it, is just gross and hard to ignore. The 2015 documentary does a better job telling Amy's whole story in an emotional way, and that doc made my blood boil (and is one of my favorite docs ever). \n\n**Coup!** - 7/10\t\n\n**The Hypnosis** - 7/10\t\n\n**The Last Stop in Yuma County** - 7/10\t\n\n**Your Monster** - 7/10\n\n**Blitz** - 7/10 - The cartoonish villains and improbably scenarios the kid kept finding himself in took this down a notch for me. Could've been great, but it didn't quite get there. How much bad shit can happen to one kid in 24 hours? Find out with Blitz. On a technical level it had a lot going for it though.\n\n**In the Summers** - 7/10\t\n\n**Maria** - 7/10 - Jolie kills it and it looked gorgeous but a really big step down from Jackie/Spencer for Pablo Larrain, a big 'style over substance' movie and weirdly disrespectful to Jackie Kennedy as well for some odd reason. Very weird structure.\n\n**Lost Soulz** - 7/10\n\n**The Girls Are Alright** - 7/10\n\n**All We Imagine As Light** - 7/10 - With all the hype I was expecting to be blown away. It was good but kind of a let down.\n\n**Girls Will Be Girls** - 7/10\t\n\n**Ezra** - 7/10\n\n**Young Woman and the Sea** - 7/10 - An inspiring sports-biopic with a very old-school and authentic feel. The Remember the Titans of swimming movies. It hits all of the cliches and it's super cheesy, but in all of the right ways. It just works. Daisy Ridley was great, and as far as swimming movies are concerned, it's definitely ahead of Nyad.\n\n**Hundreds of Beavers** - 7/10 - It's funny and original, I just wish it was a bit shorter. Some of the bits definitely outstay their welcome after a while. I really like the grassroots campaign they've built around this movie though, everything from the independent theatrical showings to the support of physical media. A great success story for indie film this year.\n\n**The Idea of You** - 7/10\t\n\n**Crossing** - 7/10\n\n**Sleep** - 7/10\t\n\n**Monkey Man** - 7/10 - Solid action flick for the first and third acts, but dragged down by a super boring 2nd act (where it loses all of the momentum it built) and lots of sloppy/confusing editing, especially during chase sequences. Credit for the Terrence Malick-like flashback scenes with narration/sweeping music/shots of nature/etc, pretty cool to throw those into an action movie.\n\n**The Color Purple** - 7/10\t\n\n**The Damned** - 7/10 - You're hanging out with the soldiers on the frontier of the American Civil War and almost nothing happens for the entire runtime except you learn about the characters and their thoughts on life/god/religion/etc. I enjoyed it.\n\n**Mean Girls**\t- 7/10\t\n\n**Driving Madelaine** - 7/10\t\n\n**Late Night with the Devil** - 7/10\n\t\n**Snack Shack** - 7/10 - Aside from the needless death at the end that tries too hard to squeeze tears out of your eyeballs, I thought this was a fun, raunchy, summer-y throwback comedy. This would've been one of my favorites in middle school probably.\n\n**Beetlejuice Beetlejuice** - 7/10\t\n\n**Joker: Folie a Deux** - 7/10\t\n\n**The Outrun** - 7/10 - Less a compelling story and more a showcase on Saoirse Ronan's acting abilities. The camera basically doesn't move from her for a single second and she completely carries it. She's the best.\n\n**Flow** - 7/10\n\n**Black Box Diaries** - 7/10\t\n\n**Queer** - 7/10\n\n**The Return** - 7/10\t\n\n**New Life** - 7/10\t- I really respect a movie that can pull off a wild genre-switch halfway through the movie. Went in fully blind so it was totally unexpected. Also impressive this tiny movie could license Bob Dylan’s Like A Rolling Stone (played a few times).\n\n**Lisa Frankenstein** - 7/10  - The ultimate \"could've been truly great with a R rating\" movie.\n\n**Bob Marley: One Love** - 7/10 - It does just enough to keep it out of the Super Generic Biopic Genre and any movie that can squeeze a few tears out of me gets an extra point. Sorry, that's just the rules.\n\n**Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes** - 7/10\t\n\n**1992**- 7/10 - Other than Ray Liotta being written like a ridiculous cartoon villain and some eye-rolling dialogue issues, it actually was a pretty solid crime drama... and Tyrese Gibson was…good? (/r/brandnewsentence)\n\n**French Girl** - 7/10\t\n\n**The Peasants** - 7/10 - Visually impressive and a sick score, but a schmaltzy/melodramatic story kinda kept it from the next level.\n\n**The Monk and the Gun** - 7/10\t\n\n**Bad Boys: Ride or Die**\t- 6/10\t\n\n**Seven Blessings**\t- 6/10\n\n**Knox Goes Away** - 6/10 - Michael Keaton does his best and commits but the writing & performance of every single side character brings the whole thing down a bit. The cop/ex-wife/son characters are bumbling, distractingly-dumb goofballs that keep the plot from ever grounding to reality, but it ultimately gets dark and violent enough to stay pretty entertaining. The script really could've used some more cleaning up.\n\n**Trap** - 6/10 - Listen I have a lot (*a lot*) of problems with this movie but Kid Cudi randomly showing up for 5 minutes and randomly delivering insane lines like \"“I specifically said i wanted honey suckle kombucha biiiiitchhhh” made the trip to the theater worth it.\n\n**Small Things Like These** - 6/10\t\n\n**Sometimes I Think About Dying** - 6/10\t\n\n**Kidnapped**\t- 6/10\t\n\n**Asphalt City** - 6/10 - Standout performance from Tye Sheridan but this leaned a bit too much into misery porn for my liking. Every single day is the absolute worst day on the job. Extremely stress-inducing first hour. Mike Tyson being cast as the medic chief was certainly a choice...and it worked somehow?\n\n**Eden**\t- 6/10 - Had trouble getting past the awful accents and the sinking feeling that this was missed potential. I was at the World Premiere for this and someone in the audience had a medical emergency, they had to pause the screening and turn the lights on while the person was carried out on people's shoulders. Jude Law/Sydney Sweeney/Ana de Armas/Ron Howard were all there wondering what was going on. Kind of a crazy situation.\n\n**Land of Bad** - 6/10\t\n\n**Unstoppable** - 6/10\t\n\n**Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire** - 6/10 - Skull Island's bland and less impressive/memorable little brother. Thumbs up for Baby Kong and the Rio de Janeiro destruction sequence, thumbs down for the lame story and unlimited amounts of annoying human characters.\n\n**Bad Shabbos** - 6/10\t\n\n**Inside Out 2** - 6/10\t\n\n**Firebrand** - 6/10\t\n\n**A Different Man** - 6/10 - I didn't connect to this as much as most people did. Sebastian Stan is great as usual but the whole thing didn't do much for me.\n\n**Love Me** - 6/10 - 10/10 for the attempt, 4/10 for the execution. There's a really good movie hidden in here somewhere, but there needed to be some cuts made to the animated portions of the film for sure.\n\n**Shell**\t- 6/10\n\n**Housekeeping for Beginners** - 6/10\t\n\n**Totem** - 6/10\n\n**The Fire Inside** - 6/10\t\n\n**Widow Clicquot**\t- 6/10 - This starts off really really really slow but then finds its footing late and ends on a solid note. Career-best performance from Haley Bennett, she really carries this.\n\n**Tuesday** - 6/10\t\n\n**Piece by Piece** - 6/10\t\n\n**The Cut** - 6/10 - Standout turns from Orlando Bloom and Caitriona Balfe, brought down by some weird editing choices. The neon-green hallucinations were a wild choice. I sat next to Katy Perry for this movie, AMA.\n\n**Memoir of a Snail** - 6/10\n\n**The Romano Twins** - 6/10\t\n\n**Mufasa: The Lion King** - 6/10\n\t\n**Film Geek** - 6/10\t\n\n**Self-Reliance** - 6/10 - Pretty cute movie with a few laughs, but the ending lost its focus and felt rushed. The Andy Samberg bits were great. I wanted more from the relationship with Anna Kendrick's character, feels like there was more to explore there. \"This an intervention.\" \"For me?\" \"No, we're just all facing the wrong direction.\"\n\n**Queen of the Ring** - 6/10\t\n\n**Coup de Chance**\t- 6/10 - It's nowhere near peak-Woody Allen but it's a passable return to form since Rifkin's Festival, Wonder Wheel, and A Rainy Day In New York (all 3 awful, with Rifkin's Festival being rock bottom for Allen's filmography). The one thing it was missing was humor. I can always trust an Allen film to at least have a few funny/witty lines (even the bad ones), but this was very cut and dry. Could've used a few more good lines.\n\n**Sasquatch Sunset** - 6/10 - I was excited for the premise and there's a few sweet/funny moments, but most of it ends up being mindless shitting/pissing/fucking. Credit for the unique idea and great views.\n\n**Bird**\t- 6/10 - One of the more disappointing films of the year. Even after the lukewarm reception at Cannes, I had super high hopes because I’m a huge Andrea Arnold fan, but the surrealism in this movie just didn’t work. It threw off the whole balance and wasn’t at all what I expected/wanted. Nikiya Adams and Barry Keoghan were both very solid, and the scene where the group sang Coldplay’s Yellow to the frog was amazing.\n\n**Omni Loop**- 6/10\t\n\n**Here**\t- 6/10 - A valiant attempt but ultimately kind of a hot mess. A few good moments keep it watchable. Some real uncanny valley shit in there too though.\n\n**Queen Rock Montreal** - 6/10\t\n\n**Turning Red** - 6/10\t\n\n**Scrambled** - 6/10\t\n\n**The Book of Clarence** -  6/10 - LaKeith Stanfield was great and committed as usual (although I don't like twin dual-roles), and James McAvoy and Cumberbatch chewing on scenery was fun, this movie had a lot of trouble figuring out what it wanted to be. I really wish it leaned more into the funny/satire and less into the serious Mel Gibson/Jim Caviezel-type biblical drama. Cool that a movie like this can be made/funded and released in theaters though.\n\n**Booger** - 6/10\t\n\n**Irena's Vow** - 6/10 - Great story, extremely generic period drama.\n\n**A Great Divide** - 6/10\t\n\n**Riff Raff** - 6/10 - A bit outdated and mean-spirited, this would've slapped in 2006, but Bill Murray and Pete Davidson as the incompetent mob assassins makes it worth a watch. \n\n**Rosalie** - 6/10\n\n**Skincare** - 6/10\t\n\n**Yellow Bus** - 6/10\n\t\n**Arcadian** - 6/10 - It's fine and stretches its tiny budget so its absolute limit but it's basically a Dollar Store A Quiet Place. The monster design and animation was hilariously-bad though, like an Asylum knock-off movie. I'm also now convinced that Nic Cage is contractually obligated to have his face smothered in fake blood for any movie.\n\n**Nutcrackers** - 6/10 \n\n**The Invisibles** - 6/10\n\t\n**Riley** -6/10\t\n\n**Rob Peace**\t- 6/10 - A well-shot movie with great direction and performance from the supporting characters (Mary J Blige and Chiwetel Ejiofor) completely dragged down by an awful lead performance by Jay Will. Also the script was a bit silly, they were trying way too hard to make him 100% infallible.\n\n**Christmas Eve in Miller's Point** - 6/10 - I liked the hectic atmosphere of the crazy Christmas family party that we've all been at, and the very scratchy look of the camera.\n\n**Rumours** - 6/10 - I can appreciate what Maddin was going for, and there's some moments that work (mostly with Cate Blanchett and Charles Dance, they were awesome), but overall surreal-absurd-fantasy-comedy like this just doesn't work for me.\n\n**Fallen Fruit** - 6/10\t\n\n**Birthrite** - 6/10\t\n\n**Crumb Catcher** - 6/10\t\n\n**Anselm** - 6/10\t\n\n**Scapegoat** - 6/10\t\n\n**Seeds** - 5/10 - There’s clearly heart and maybe a great movie in here somewhere, but it’s such a tonal mess that it’s hard to find anything to love.\n\n**Sujo** - 5/10\t\n\n**The Beekeeper** - 5/10 - This is the Rebel Moon of Jason Bourne movies. A few cool kills and classic Statham one-liners keep it from being a total loss, but it's not very good.\n\n**Unsung Hero** - 5/10\n\n**Jeanne du Barry**- 5/10\t\n\n**Treasure** - 5/10\n\n**A Sacrifice** - 5/10\t\n\n**The American Society of Magical Negroes** - 5/10 - All over the place and it gave a constant feeling of \"missed opportunity\" (a la Book of Clarence). Justice Smith is straight-up not a convincing lead. An-Li Bogan was the standout, and I saw her end twist coming from a mile away so I got that going for me which is nice.\n\n**La Syndicaliste** - 5/10\n\n**Sonic the Hedgehog 3** - 5/10\t\n\n**The Watchers** - 5/10\n\n**Borderlands** - 5/10 - Went in expecting a 1/10, got a 5/10. Nice. Life is all about the little wins.\n\n**Ghostbusters: Frozen Empire** - 5/10 - Just give this franchise a permanent rest. It wasn't awful in any particular way, but it was totally soulless and heartless. It felt like nobody really gave a shit except Kumail Nanjiani. Safe, sanitized, studio slop. They couldn't even fully commit to the one interesting thing (the gay ghost love story).\n\n**National Anthem** - 5/10\t\n\n**The 4:30 Movie**\t- 5/10 - Kevin Smith jerking himself off for 80 minutes. Would make a fun double-feature with *Snack Shack* though.\n\n**Universal Language** - 5/10 - This had a lot of hype of out Cannes and it's Canada's submission for the Oscars so I had a lot of hope, but it just didn't do much for me. Surreal-absurdism just isn't my cup of tea. The only real standout scene was the one with the Quebec democrat. A rare case of the Q&A being more interesting than the movie itself.\n\n**Kraven the Hunter** - 5/10\t\n\n**Time Still Turns the Pages** - 5/10\t\n\n**Upgraded** - 5/10\t- Basically a Great Value The Devil Wears Prada. Good as rom-com-background-nois. Marissa Tomei is awful in this. One of the worst performances of the year.\n\n**Sound of Hope: The Story of Possum Trot** - 5/10\t\n\n**Out of Season** - 5/10\t\n\n**Miller's Girl** - 5/10\t\n\n**Latin for All** - 5/10\t\n\n**Argylle** - 5/10 - How a movie like The Creator can be made for $80M but something so awful-looking like this needs $200M blows my mind. \n\n**I.S.S.** - 5/10 - I love a good sandwich-making climax as much as the next guy, but what a painfully awkward ending. The first 25 minutes made me think something decent could be happening then it derails hard and never recovers. The worst thing to happen to the space program since Challenger.\n\n**Get Away** - 5/10\t\n\n**Brothers** - 5/10\t\n\n**Life's a Bitch** - 5/10 - France's (bad) answer to Yorgos Lanthimos. A dry, twisted, gross, weirdly-sexual, anthology film with a lot less nudity but a lot more dogs than Kinds of Kindness. Kinda loses its way comedically and becomes a chore after the first chapter.\n\n**Azrael** - 5/10\t\n\n**Monster Summer** - 5/10 - Like a G-rated IT, with Mel Gibson for some reason (?)\n\n**Kung Fu Panda 4** - 5/10\t\n\n**Garfield** - 5/10\n\nV**illains, Inc** - 5/10 - It had a certain cheap charm but an overwhelming sense of \"SNL Digital Short sketch stretched way too thin\".\n\n**Excursion** - 5/10\t\n\n**Sleeping Dogs** -  5/10\n\n**Notice to Quit** - 5/10 - The kid actor was really good but I'm just a bit over following an extremely unlikeable lead around doing shitty things to people.\n\n**Reunion** - 5/10\n\n**The Boy in the Woods**\t- 5/10\t\n\n**Paradise** - 5/10\t\n\n**Karaoke** - 5/10\t\n\n**It Ends With Us**\t- 5/10\t\n\n**Poolman** - 4/10 - The ugly, boring,  confused lovechild of Inherent Vice and Under the Silver Lake.\n\n**Avenue of the Giants** - 4/10\t\n\n**Arthur the King** - 4/10 - Marky Mark has really devolved as an actor honestly, really tough performance from him here. It's like he's completely forgotten how to convincingly deliver lines. Right from the GoPro scenes at the beginning I knew it was gonna be a rough time. This movie is like 85% exposition.\n\n**Janet Planet** - 4/10 - Bookended by 2 great scenes, but filled with mostly pointless garbage.\n\n**Dandelion**\t- 4/10\t\n\n**By the Stream** - 4/10\t- I enjoy Hong Sangsoo movies in very small doses. This dose was just way too big.\n\n**Venom: The Last Dance** - 4/10\t\n\n**Red One** - 4/10\t\n\n**Oh, Canada** - 4/10 - Dreadfully confusing, and Jacob Elordi puts in one of the worst performances of the year, but at least that Phosphorescent soundtrack kept me engaged. \n\n**Slingshot** - 4/10\t\n\n**Adios Buenos Aires** - 4/10\t\n\n**Humane** - 4/10\t\n\n**Some Other Woman** - 4/10\t\n\n**My Daughter, My Love** - 4/10\t\n\n**Madame Web** - 4/10 - Slop.\n\n**IF** - 4/10 - Not really for adults, not really for kids/teens. Who was this movie even for?...\n\n**Freud's Last Session** - 4/10\t\n\n**Werewolves** - 4/10 - So much lens flare. I am now blind.\n\n**Ramona at Midlife** - 4/10\t\n\n**The Last Front** - 4/10\t\n\n**My Penguin Friend** - 4/10\n\t\n**Augure** - 4/10\t\n\n**Which Brings Me To You** - 4/10 - Looking back over this ranking, I'm gonna be honest and say I have no idea what this was. Don't remember. To producers out there: please stop making your movie titles random vague sentences.\n\n**Mai** - 4/10\t\n\n**Meanwhile on Earth** - 4/10\t\n\n**Lizzie Lazarus** - 4/10\t\n\n**Or Something** - 4/10\t\n\n**The Way We Speak** - 4/10\t\n\n**Cult Killer** - 3/10 - Antonio Banderas shows up for like 5 minutes and then nopes the fuck out. Total paycheck movie.\n\n**The Feeling that the Time for Doing Something Has Passed** - 3/10 - There were some funny lines (especially the 9/11 dating profile bit) but this was so painfully dry and slow that I could never really connect. If desert-dry, awkward, deadpan delivery, with an absurd amount of BDSM-sex-stuff thrown in is your thing, you might find a few things to like. I could not.\n\n**Never Let Go** - 3/10\t\n\n**The Throwback** - 3/10\t\n\n**The City** - 3/10\t\n\n**Rats!**\t- 3/10 - This would've worked well as an edgy Youtube short in 2012.\n\n**The Best Christmas Pageant Ever** - 3/10\t\n\n**He Went That Way** - 3/10 - Half roadtrip comedy with a chimp, half brutal serial killer drama. Tonally all over the place. The kind of movie you'd expect Jacob Elordi to try to bury (a la Dicaprio with Don's Plum) and fire his agent over before it sees the light of way. Baffling decisions made by everyone here. \n\n**Megalopolis** - 2/10 - I went in expecting a mess but I was still not prepared for how bad this was. It’s Neil Breen with an unlimited budget. It felt like 6 hours. It looked so cheap and awful. A mix of Lifetime movie and a middle school play. I refuse to believe it’s bad on purpose for comedy. The only thing keeping this from a 1 is that Adam Driver/Coppola/Nathalie Emmanuel/Giancarlo Esposito were at my screening for Q&A (god bless their sweet little souls for having to seriously promote this hot mess). \"What do you think of this boner I got right here?” is a line 85 year old Jon Voight actually says in a real movie in the year of our lord 2024. My therapist will hear about this.\n\n**A Boy Who Dreamt of Electricity** - 2/10\t\n\n**Isle of Hope** - 2/10 - Sometimes I wonder why I do this to myself.\n\n**Chosen Family** - 1/10\t- This was borderline unfinished and full-on embarrassing. The production value of a daytime soap opera mixed in with the sound editing of a local high school play. It's impressive how much filler (drone shots of surrounding neighborhood) can be squeezed into 84 minutes of movie. Sitting a few seats away from Heather Graham was a nice bonus (with Q&A), but it couldn't come close to making up for this disaster.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n*Unranked (Re-Releases and/or TV Series):*\n\n**Dune** (Re-Release) - 10/10\n\n**Interstellar** (Re-Release) - 10/10\t\n\n**Ex Machina** (Re-Release) - 9/10\n\n**The Shawshank Redemption** (Re-Release) - 8/10\t\n\n**Bound** (Re-Release) - 8/10\n\n**Mr. & Mrs. Smith Episodes 1 & 2** (TV Series)\t- 7/10\n\t\n**Possession** (Re-Release) - 7/10\n\n**But I'm A Cheerleader** (Re-Release) - 7/10\n\n**The Acolyte Episodes 1 & 2** (TV Series) - 6/10\n\t\n**Society** (Re-Release) - 6/10\n\n**Black Christmas** (Re-Release) - 6/10\n\n**Apples Never Fall Episode 1** (TV Series) - 6/10\t\n\n**Maniac Cop 2** (Re-Release- 6/10\n\n**The Room** (Re-Release) - 5/10\n\n**Cruel Intentions Episode 1** (TV Series)\t- 5/10\n\n**La Maquina Episode 1** (TV Series) - 4/10\n\n**After Annecy** (Short Film) - 3/10\n\n**Maniac** (Re-Release) - 3/10\n\n**Mother** (Re-Release) - 3/10\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**Stats:**\n\n**Multiple Viewings:**\n\n* Dune: Part Two (x2)\n* Babes (x2)\n* Deadpool & Wolverine (x2)\n* Sing Sing (x2)\n* Back to Black (x2)\n* The Wild Robot (x2)\n* Anora (x2)\n\n**Theater Distribution by Venue/Chain:**\n\n* AMC - 96\n* Regal - 66\n* Silverspot - 18\n* Cinemark - 8\n* Landmark - 1\n* Other/Festival/Independent - 109 (Including: Arsht Center, Autonation IMAX, Cinema Paradiso, Classic Gateway, Coastal Creative, Coral Gables Art Cinema, Enzian Theater,  Hard Rock Ballroom, Koubek Center, TIFF Lightbox, Lucas Theater, Miami Theater Center, Movies of Delray, O'Cinema South Beach, Princess of Wales, Roy Thomson Hall, Royal Alexandra, Savor Cinema, SCAD Museum, Scotiabank, Tampa Theater, Trustees Theater)\n\n**Film Festivals Attended:**\n\n* Toronto International Film Festival - 30 Movies in 8 Days\n* Savannah SCAD Film Festival - 20 Movies in 8 Days\n* Miami Film Festival - 20 Movies and 1 TV Series in 10 Days\n* Florida Film Festival - 19 Movies in 6 Days\n* Miami Jewish Film Festival - 10 Movies in 7 Days\n* Popcorn Frights Film Festival - 7 Movies in 4 Days\n* Fort Lauderdale International Film Festival - 6 Movies in 4 Days\n* Gasparilla International Film Fstival - 5 Movies in 2 Days\n\n**Theater Visits by Month:**\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/sKQYFp9.png\n\n* January: 32 \n* February: 17 \n* March: 27 \n* April: 54 \n* May: 18\n* June: 18\n* July: 12 \n* August: 24\n* September: 38 \n* October:  23\n* November: 22\n* December: 13\n\n**Theater Visits by Day of the Week:**\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/xC7pt1S.png\n\n* Monday - 25\n* Tuesday - 23\n* Wednesday - 23\n* Thursday - 49\n* Friday - 64\n* Saturday - 67\n* Sunday - 47\n\n**Notable Missed Movies:**\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/iPhOD5s.png\n\n**Cast/Crew/Filmmaker Q&As/Appearances:**\n\n* Part 1 - https://i.imgur.com/a6JsfR0.png\n* Part 2 - https://i.imgur.com/YQIJZUl.png\n* Part 3 - https://i.imgur.com/9cyEkKY.png\n\n**Favorite Performances:** \n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/Sfv5OZB.png\n\n**Past Rankings:**\n \n* [2018 \\(162 Movies\\)](https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/aavyrr/i_saw_162_movies_in_theaters_in_2018_here_is_my/)\n* [2019 \\(192 Movies\\)](https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/eh71gy/i_saw_192_movies_in_theaters_in_2019_here_is_my/)\n* [2020 \\(44 Movies\\)](https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/kp39ku/i_saw_44_movies_in_theaters_in_2020_here_is_my/)\n* [2021 \\(86 Movies\\)](https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/ruaxif/i_saw_86_movies_in_theaters_in_2021_here_is_my/)\n* [2022 \\(270 Movies\\)](https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/zzvg5y/i_saw_270_movies_in_theaters_in_2022_here_is_my/)\n* [2023 \\(325 Movies\\)](https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/18v7k6g/i_saw_325_movies_in_theaters_in_2023_here_is_my/)",

[Now studios have a much harder time using actor likenesses without permission. ](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/business/business-news/back-future-ii-a-legal-833705/)\n3. **Indiana Jones and The Temple of Doom**:[ led to the creation of the PG-13 rating. ](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/indiana-jones-temple-doom-changed-mpaa-ratings-system-999618/)\n4. **Howard the Duck** was such a financial failure it forced George Lucas to sell Lucasfilm's computer graphics division to Steve Jobs, [where it became Pixar. ](https://screenrant.com/howard-duck-failure-pixar-george-lucas-steve-jobs/)Also was the reason Marvel didn't pursue any theatrical films until Blade.",

And from a strictly entertainment standpoint, you could write up a million different scripts that would put Private Ryan to shame.\n\nAlso, the few movies I have seen about Japanese in WW2 tend to portray them as noble warriors when in reality they were every bit as evil and diabolical as the Nazis, and committed some of the worst atrocities of the last hundred years.  \n\nTheir treatment of POWs was also probably the worst fates suffered during any US military war. They would literally mass execute captured soldiers and sailors, often by beheading....\n\nWhy is there no Inglorious Bastards Japanese version to date?",

Those people don't get how this is a time-honored tradition in high school movies, going back to the 50s (\"Grease\" openly mocked it). The 80s films that \"Stranger Things\" draws inspiration from had some especially egregious examples. James Spader in \"Pretty in Pink\" looks like a Wall Street yuppie trolling a high school for jailbait. Alan Ruck was pushing 30 in \"Ferris Bueller's Day Off (a decade older than Mia Sara who was an actual teenager when they made it). And to use a \"Stranger Things\" cast member as an example, Matthew Modine was a married dad when he played a high school senior in \"Vision Quest.\" The list goes on.",

His sign language wasn’t even good when his kid was in high school. Eventually they had a big fight, he realized he’s been an absent dad, he sang to his son (with sign language) and everything is good again! \n\n\nI know it’s a movie, I guess it’s because I have kids now, the whole “father and son quickly bond again” storyline just seems so fake to me. \n\n\nThen there’s the most disturbing part. A student had a huge crush on him, he also seems to have feelings for her too???? The part they almost kiss just made me feel gross. \n\n\n\nEdit: apparently I am wrong about the symphony part so I am gonna delete it.\n\n\nHusband said, I didn’t know it’s so weird when I first saw it, I only remember it was pretty touching. \n\n\nFamily still had a great time. Funny how sometimes our old favorite films are not as good as we remember.",

      "text": "Seth Rogen has been a major figure in the film industry for almost two decades now, and in that time, a lot has been said about him, his abilities, the type of movies he makes and more recently, his political values\n\nThe one thing I've rarely seen people discuss is his insane record in terms of well made [movies and shows ](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/celebrity/sethrogen)(both as a performer and producer)\n\nJust in the past few years, he has acted in movies like Dumb Money, Fablemans, Long Shot and American Pickle, while producing TMNT:Mutant Mayhem, Joy Ride, Good Boys and Blockers. That's without talking about his hit-making run in the mid 2000s to mid 2010s, or his TV show resume, which is arguably even more impressive (he's literally about to come out with a show that has near-universal critical acclaim pre-release)\n\nUnlike other leading men who have a lot of well regarded stuff in their filmography, Rogen isn't really playing a numbers game. The man hasn't really been in a whole lot, it's just that a large portion of what he does do, is some version of good",

If you want a tl;dr I made some [tier list](https://imgur.com/a/KeG9QqG) infographics as well.\n\nMostly these are \"Groundhog Day\" type loops. Or, more generally, movies where the same scenarios get replayed multiple times for various reasons (usually technological, supernatural, or psychological). This is pretty much every movie of this type I could get a hold of.\n\nText list, sorted by year, with low-spoiler review blurbs:\n\n* [The Little Girl Who Conquered Time (1983)](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0086456/reference/) (JAPANESE) *Romance*\n * The second (of like 5) adaptation of [The Girl Who Leapt Through Time (1967)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Girl_Who_Leapt_Through_Time). A cute little sci-fi romance.\n* [Urusei Yatsura 2: Beautiful Dreamer (1984)](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0088334/reference/) (JAPANESE) *Comedy*\n * The second Urusei Yatsura movie. Directed by Mamoru Oshii (Ghost in the Shell). This is *really* trippy, and highly recommended.\n* [Mirror for a Hero (1987)](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0094371/reference/) (RUSSIAN) *Drama*\n * Soviet era time travel movie. Sort of an allegorical examination of generational relations and consequences of the era. Or something. If you like late stage Soviet cinema give it a watch.\n* [12:01 (1993)](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0106188/reference/) *Comedy/Drama/Romance*\n * Moderately entertaining *loose* adaptation of [12:01 P.M. (1973)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/12:01_P.M.) starring Jonathan Silverman.\n* [Groundhog Day (1993)](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0107048/reference/) *Comedy*\n * You know it, you love it.\n* [Christmas Every Day (1996)](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0115891/reference/) *Comedy*\n * The first of a dozen Christmas themed time loop movies. Vaguely based on the 1892 short story. Main character is a moody teen. Rather bad.\n* [Retroactive (1997)](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0117468/reference/) *Action*\n * Moderately entertaining. Jim Belushi plays a zero dimensional violent caricature, but the story is elevated with time travel shenanigans.\n* [Run Lola Run aka Lola rennt (1998)](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0130827/reference/) (GERMAN) *Action*\n * Fun little crime/romance looper with a lot of details to pick up on subsequent rewatches.\n* [Naken (2000)](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0269604/reference/) (SWEDISH) *Comedy*\n * Barely tolerable boner comedy.\n* [A Christmas Carol (2000)](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0291816/reference/) *Drama*\n * The best of the Christmas time loop movies. A contemporary retelling of A Christmas Carol, but with the day repeating.\n* [Stork Day (2004)](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0374358/reference/) (ITALIAN) *Comedy*\n * Tribute/remake of Groundhog Day. Character driven, and somewhat entertaining.\n* [If Only (2004)](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0332136/reference/) *Romance*\n * Highly rated, but completely forgettable.\n* [Primer (2004)](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0390384/reference/) *Drama*\n * Really good zero budget movie about the dangers of time travel abuse.\n* [The Twelve Days of Christmas Eve (2004)](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0436855/reference/) *Comedy*\n * Another retelling of A Christmas Carol, starring Steven Weber. Not very good.\n* [Slipstream (2005)](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0381601/reference/) *Action*\n * Moderately awful crime/romance/drama/action movie, starring Sean Astin.\n* [Camp Slaughter aka Camp Daze (2005)](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0462220/reference/) *Comedy/Horror*\n * Some friends on a road trip in 2005 get stuck in a 1980s slasher movie on repeat. Amusing.\n* [The Girl Who Leapt Through Time (2006)](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0808506/reference/) (JAPANESE) *Adventure*\n * Anime adaptation of 1967 novel, by Mamoru Hosoda (Summer Wars, The Boy and the Beast). Highly acclaimed.\n* [Salvage (2006)](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0492754/reference/) *Horror*\n * Moderately competent psychological thriller about a young woman being repeatedly murdered.\n* [Christmas Do-Over (2006)](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0840303/reference/) *Comedy*\n * Personality-driven comedy starring Jay Mohr. Skippable.\n* [Timecrimes (2007)](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0480669/reference/) (SPANISH) *Horror*\n * Classic and intense ontological drama. Worth a watch.\n* [The Deaths of Ian Stone (2007)](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0810823/reference/) *Horror*\n * Forgettable semi-psychological slasher.\n* [The Last Day of Summer (2007)](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0859622/reference/) *Family*\n * G-rated vanilla time loop movie, starring a 12 year old Jansen Panettiere.\n* [1000 Congratulations (2009)](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2210425/reference/) (ARABIC) *Comedy*\n * Moderately interesting Egyptian time loop movie.\n* [The Time Traveler's Wife (2009)](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0452694/reference/) *Drama*\n * This one is hard to classify. Comedy/Drama/Romance/Tragedy, with Eric Bana.\n* [Portal (2009)](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0929241/reference/) *Horror*\n * Extremely low rated, obscure, micro budget movie. Tolerable.\n* [And Then Came Lola (2009)](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1123894/reference/) *Romance*\n * Tolerable lesbian romcom.\n* [Triangle (2009)](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1187064/reference/) *Horror*\n * Really good situational horror with some unexpected twists.\n* [Time Traveller: The Girl Who Leapt Through Time (2010)](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1614408/reference/) (JAPANESE) *Adventure*\n * Another adaptation of the 1967 novel. This one is also pretty good.\n* [Repeaters (2010)](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1580426/reference/) *Action*\n * A bit unusual in that multiple people remember the loop. Moderately entertaining.\n* [The Road (2011)](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2063008/reference/) (FILIPINO) *Horror*\n * Another one hard to classify. Not very good.\n* [Wake Up and Die aka Volver a Morir (2011)](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1583251/reference/) (SPANISH) *Horror*\n * Really obscure, lots of nudity, some gore, very psychological. Worth a watch if you can find it.\n* [Source Code (2011)](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0945513/reference/) *Action*\n * Rather good action/thriller, with Jake Gyllenhaal.\n* [12 Dates of Christmas (2011)](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1846442/reference/) *Romance*\n * Highly rated, if you like Lifetime/Hallmark/ABC Family romcoms. Otherwise skip.\n* [Plan de table aka Perfect Matches (2012)](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2062990/reference/) (FRENCH) *Romance*\n * More of a \"What If\" than a time loop, exploring possible iterations of a randomized event. So-so.\n* [Mine Games (2012)](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1928337/reference/) *Horror*\n * Similar to Triangle above, but a bit slow to get anywhere.\n* [I am a Ghost (2012)](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2076862/reference/) *Horror*\n * Psychological intimate character study. So-so.\n* [41 (2012)](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2319739/reference/) *Drama*\n * Moderately entertaining, time travel abuse and repercussions.\n* [A Christmas Wedding Date (2012)](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2334090/reference/) *Romance*\n * Below-average Christmas romcom.\n* [Prometheus Trap (2012)](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2411516/reference/) *Action*\n * Super super low budget obscure. Skip.\n* [About Time (2013)](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2194499/reference/) *Romance*\n * One of the better romcom time loops.\n* [Haunter (2013)](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2345567/reference/) *Horror*\n * Disturbing psychological horror. Okayish.\n* [Plus One aka +1 (2013)](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2395385/reference/) *Romance/Horror*\n * Yeah, it's a romance-horror with time-duplication aspect. So-so.\n* [Coherence (2013)](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2866360/reference/) *Mystery*\n * This one barely qualifies, but events keep repeating from different points of view. And it is really really good.\n* [Pete's Christmas (2013)](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3004544/reference/) *Comedy*\n * Another moody teen holiday time loop. Meh.\n* [The Incident (2014)](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3528756/reference/) (SPANISH) *Horror*\n * This is one of my very favorite space/time loop movies. Just watch it.\n* [Oru Kanniyum Moonu Kalavaanikalum (2014)](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3569748/reference/) (TAMIL) *Comedy*\n * Ridiculous but fun Bollywood fantasy/action/comedy time loop movie.\n* [Edge of Tomorrow (2014)](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1631867/reference/) *Action*\n * Yeah, it's pretty great.\n* [Premature (2014)](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2182256/reference/) *Comedy*\n * The bonerest of boner comedy time loops. The protagonist resets the day whenever they prematurely ejaculate. Nuff said.\n* [Cruel & Unusual (2014)](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2379080/reference/) *Thriller*\n * This is yet another \"[they are already dead and trapped in hell](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadAllAlong)\" time loop movies, but it isn't really a spoiler for this one, as it is the initial premise. Tolerable psychological thriller.\n* [The Infinite Man (2014)](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2553424/reference/) *Comedy*\n * Psychological comedy. Feels like a short film premise padded out to feature length. So-so.\n* [Blood Punch (2014)](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2825230/reference/) *Thriller*\n * This one has some unique time loop mechanics, such as who retains the memories the next day. Slasher/horror. Pretty good.\n* [The Final Girls (2015)](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2118624/reference/) *Comedy*\n * Another \"dragged into a 1980s slasher movie on repeat\". Okayish.\n* [Project Almanac (2015)](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2436386/reference/) *Drama*\n * Another movie showing the escalating consequences of time travel abuse. Tolerable.\n* [Magnetic (2015)](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3194622/reference/) *Fantasy*\n * Arthouse nonsense, but mildly distracting.\n* [I Do, I Do, I Do (2015)](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4380748/reference/) *Romance*\n * The Hallmark Channel romcom of Hallmark Channel romcom timeloops.\n* [Erased (2016)](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4882964/reference/) (JAPANESE) *Drama*\n * Live action adaptation of the [Erased manga](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erased_%28manga%29). Really good, but the story isn't as fleshed out as in the manga, anime, or later TV series.\n* [Incarnation aka Inkarnacija (2016)](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4588874/reference/) (SERBIAN) *Action*\n * Straight up action/mystery/thriller repeating the same sequences over and over. Okayish.\n* [Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children (2016)](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1935859/reference/) *Fantasy*\n * Enjoyable.\n* [Displacement (2016)](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2712758/reference/) *Thriller*\n * Forgettable psychological mystery.\n* [Bangkok Rush (2016)](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3399078/reference/) *Action*\n * Mildly entertaining action mystery thriller.\n* [Christmas All Over Again (2016)](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3503454/reference/) *Comedy*\n * Another moody teen holiday time loop. Meh.\n* [Infinity Chamber (2016)](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3839880/reference/) *Mystery*\n * Super low budget. Mildly entertaining. The vague time loop aspects are a bit of a B-story.\n* [ARQ (2016)](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt5640450/reference/) *Action*\n * Tolerable action-loop.\n* [Reset (2017)](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt5342650/reference/) (CHINESE) *Action*\n * Moderately fun time travel action movie.\n* [La Colle (2017)](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt7023354/reference/) (FRENCH) *Comedy*\n * One of the better moody teen time loop movies.\n* [A Day (2017)](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt6890376/reference/) (KOREAN) *Drama*\n * Psychological hard-boiled action with some interesting twists.\n* [2:22 (2017)](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1131724/reference/) *Drama*\n * Confusing and unsatisfying.\n* [Before I Fall (2017)](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1691916/reference/) *Drama*\n * Rather good. Has emotional weight to it, too.\n* [The Endless (2017)](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3986820/reference/) *Fantasy*\n * From Benson/Moorhead (Synchronic, Loki season 2). The best of the best time loop movies, although micro-budget.\n* [Happy Death Day (2017)](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt5308322/reference/) *Comedy*\n * Very good.\n* [Inoperable (2017)](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt5325604/reference/) *Horror*\n * So-so mystery-thriller in a hospital full of weird/homicidal characters.\n* [Naked (2017)](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt6048930/reference/) *Comedy*\n * Remake of the Swedish film, starring Marlon Wayans. Enjoyable if you like boner/humiliation comedies.\n* [Mega Time Squad (2018)](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt5758726/reference/) *Action*\n * Entertaining adventure story about the autointerpersonal consequences of abusing time travel.\n* [When We First Met (2018)](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt5783956/reference/) *Comedy*\n * Time loop romcom. A bit obnoxious.\n* [Portal Man (2018)](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt6291000/reference/) *Action*\n * Ultra-obscure nano-budget Tubi movie about dimension-hoppers repeatedly fighting each other.

It happened again!? Also very good.\n* [The Ascent aka Black Ops (2019)](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt8439934/reference/) *Action*\n * Military action horror.

Not very good.\n* [See You Yesterday (2019)](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt8743064/reference/) *Adventure*\n * Teens using time travel to save someone. Tolerable.\n* [The Obituary of Tunde Johnson (2019)](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt8815382/reference/) *Drama*\n * A black teenager is repeatedly shot by police, reliving the same day over and over. Similar to the short films \"Groundhog Day for a Black Man\" (2016) and \"Two Distant Strangers\" (2020).

Tolerable.\n* [Nina of the Woods (2020)](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt6089744/reference/) *Thriller*\n * Forgettable, obscure, no budget, similar plot to The Blair Witch Project.\n* [Boss Level (2020)](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt7638348/reference/) *Action*\n * Action-driven schlock-fest. Check it out.\n* [Flashback (2020)](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt8372094/reference/) *Drama*\n * Moderately entertaining romance/drama. More about altering the past, than repeating it.\n* [Palm Springs (2020)](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt9484998/reference/) *Comedy*\n * Straight-up Andy Samberg day-repeating comedy. Highly recommended.\n* [El Ascensor (2021)](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt7685962/reference/) (SPANISH) *Drama*\n * A married couple trapped in a short time loop in an elevator during an argument.

Micro budget, micro plot.\n* [Rise of the Mummy (2021)](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt12352250/reference/) *Horror*\n * Possibly the worst time loop movie on this list.\n* [Nothing Else (2021)](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt12435010/reference/) *Thriller*\n * Intimate and claustrophobic. Tolerable.\n* [Christmas Again? (2021)](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt13465140/reference/) *Comedy*\n * A Christmas time loop movie with a twist: this time it's a moody *pre*-teen.

Turns out it is not that good.\n* [Sawed Off (2022)](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt14562632/reference/) *Horror*\n * Schlock no-budget violent horror, that is (unintentionally?) funny too.\n* [Brightwood (2022)](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt14736734/reference/) *Horror*\n * Pretty good movie, people trapped in both a space and time loop around a pond.\n* [Meet Cute (2022)](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt14900738/reference/) *Comedy*\n * Tolerable \"get the guy\" romcom.\n* [The 12 Days of Christmas Eve (2022)](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt22527810/reference/) *Comedy*\n * Kelsey Grammer as Scrooge.

Not recommended.\n* [Breaking the Loop (2022)](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt8482258/reference/) *Drama*\n * Confusing \"have to saver her\" Tubi time travel movie, but not bad.\n* [Vampyrz on a Boat (2022)](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt9843390/reference/) *Thriller*\n * Confusing \"have to saver her\" Tubi time loop movie, but bad.\n* [River aka Ribâ nagarenaide yo (2023)](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt27695005/reference/) (JAPANESE) *Comedy*\n * Nice intimate story of a small Japanese village caught in a 2 minute time loop.\n* [One More Time (2023)](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt21216870/reference/) (SWEDISH) *Comedy*\n * Comedy/drama about a woman making a wish and stuck reliving a day in her youth. Tolerable.\n* [Breaking Infinity (2023)](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt14204244/reference/) *Thriller*\n * \"Unstuck in time\" prevent-the-apocalypse. Meh.\n* [No Tomorrow (2023)](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt14906086/reference/) *Drama*\n * A Tubi \"stuck in a time loop\" movie set during the pandemic. Slightly interesting for having different time mechanics and consequences than most such movies.\n* [Time Addicts (2023)](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt21081126/reference/) *Thriller*\n * Pretty good, if you can stand a thick Aussie accent.\n* [Jagged Mind (2023)](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt22496012/reference/) *Horror*\n * Psychological abusive relationship horror. Not terribly good.\n* [Round and Round (2023)](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt29244163/reference/) *Comedy*\n * A Hanukkah time loop romcom. Made by the Hallmark Channel. Bad, unless you like that sort of thing.\n* [Room 0 (2023)](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt29931567/reference/) *Thriller*\n * Zero budget, one set, one character. Impressive how much they can fit into that, but not very good.\n* [Hypnotic (2023)](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt8080204/reference/) *Drama*\n * Ben Affleck stuck in a repetitive loop. A bit out of the ordinary, but not great.\n* [Everything Happens at Once (2024)](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt6416112/reference/) *Comedy*\n * Interesting zero budget Tubi time loop movie in an office.\n\n⸻ ⸻ ⸻ ⸻ ⸻ ⸻ ⸻ ⸻\n\nI also watched a LOT of movies that didn't quite fit the theme, while searching for time loops. Some soft exclusion criteria (with more leeway for more obscure titles): \n\n* Movies where the plot/action/scenario just restarts at the end once, like Open Graves (2009), Baskin (2015), or Nightmare City (1980).\n* The characters travel back at the end and become the instigators of the initial plot, like Devil's Pass (2013) or The House by the Cemetery (1981).\n* Mainstream movies with minimal or nonrepetitive looping, like Doctor Strange (2016), Next (2007), Butterfly Effect franchise, Terminator franchise.\n* Weird *other* time travel movies like Premonition (2007), Tenet (2020), Looper (2012), Predestination (2014), Twelve Monkeys (1995), Detention (2011), Synchronic (2019).\n* TV shows with [one time loop episode](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/GroundhogDayLoop/LiveActionTV). It happens a lot.\n* TV Shows that are all time loops, like Hounded (2010), Looped (2015), Russian Doll (2019), Topi (2021), Day Break (2006), Reset (2022), The Lazarus Project (2022), No Through Road (2009), Worst Year of My Life, Again! (2014)\n* Short films. I watched 60+ of these too, they might be on a different list.\n\n⸻ ⸻ ⸻ ⸻ ⸻ ⸻ ⸻ ⸻\n\n**Edit**: Letterboxd list by u/bungtoad --> https://boxd.it/yXFIo",

Is Miles Teller off tempo? Is that trombone guy out of tune in the beginning? Or am I as the average viewer with no musical background, just fooled into believing I'm not capable of hearing the subtle mistakes and thereby tricked into believing JK is correct when he actually isn't? Because that changes his character. Is he just yelling and intimidating because he thinks it'll make them better even though they're already flawless? Or does he hear imperfections?",

The movie rarely slows down long enough to allow its characters to meditate on their shifting realities. That’s one reason it falls short of the top tier of superhero cinema (“The Dark Knight,” “Superman II,” “The Batman,” “Guardians”). I’d characterize the film as next-level good (a roster that includes “Iron Man,” “Thor,” “Batman Begins,” “Captain America,” and the hugely underrated “Iron Man 3”). Yet watching “Superman,” we register the layered quality of the conflicts, and we’re drawn right inside them. Gunn constructs an intricate game of a superhero saga that’s arresting and touching, and occasionally exhausting, in equal measure\n\n[The Hollywood Reporter (80)](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-reviews/superman-review-david-corenswet-rachel-brosnahan-james-gunn-1236305764/)\n\n>What matters most is that the movie is fun, pacy and enjoyable, a breath of fresh air sweetened by a deep affection for the material and boosted by a winning trio of leads.\n\n[DEADLINE](https://deadline.com/2025/07/superman-review-james-gunn-reboot-1236450641/)\n\n>Overall, Gunn might be trying to do too much here, basically throwing everything against the wall and hoping some of it sticks. More than enough does in this entertaining new direction, but at times *Superman* suffers from overload, much like Gunns’ *Guardians of the Galaxy* trilogy, which wore out its welcome with Vol. 3 where Rocket unfortunately got the *Babe: Pig in the City* treatment. Nevertheless he is a talented and skilled director, no question, and one with optimism himself. It will be interesting to see where the future lies for DC under his (and Safran’s) more hopeful vision.\n\n[Indiewire (58)](https://www.indiewire.com/criticism/movies/superman-movie-review-james-gunn-1235137386/)\n\n>Gunn is right to recognize that a certain amount of silliness is key to Superman’s charm, but here it mostly just distracts from the seriousness of what’s at stake. It’s hard to make a comic book come to life at the same time as you’re trying to bring life into a comic book, just as it’s hard not to admire Gunn for trying. But it’s even harder to care if a man can fly when there isn’t any gravity to the world around him. Grade: C+\n\n[IGN (8)](https://www.ign.com/articles/superman-2025-review-james-gunn-david-corenswet-rachel-brosnahan-nicholas-hoult)\n\n>Superman is a wonderfully entertaining, heartfelt cinematic reset for the Man of Steel, and a great new start for the DC universe on the big screen.\n\n[The Atlantic (90)](https://www.theatlantic.com/culture/archive/2025/07/superman-movie-2025-review/683462/)\n\n>The First Superman Movie Worth Watching in Years. The newest take on the caped hero wisely embraces his corniness.\n\n[Consequence (83)](https://consequence.net/2025/07/superman-review-james-gunn-2025/)\n\n>Grim and gritty are words this movie firmly rejects, instead leaning into the human side of everyone involved, even its villains. There are a few choices that work less well than others, but the end result is a movie that doesn't sacrifice its titular character in service to franchise-building. Instead, it focuses on celebrating the values that Superman himself has embodied from the beginning.\n\n[Collider (80)](https://collider.com/superman-2025-review-james-gunn-dc-david-corenswet/)\n\n>Superman is a magnificent feat, a film that makes the Man of Steel fascinating in a way we’ve rarely seen on film, with a take on the hero that is trenchant, clever, and delightful. Gunn is paying tribute to the past while also making a very clear mark on this world’s future, crafting an introduction to the DCU that inherently makes the viewer want to know where this world goes from here. At this point, it’s rare for superhero films to give a sense of wonder and a reminder of how beautiful these films can be when executed well. But Gunn has brought optimism, hope, and care back to Superman. It ends up becoming one of the best DC films in years, and one of the best movies of the summer.\n\n[The Guardian - UK (2/5)](https://www.theguardian.com/film/2025/jul/08/superman-review-david-corenswet-james-gunn)\n\n>From the very beginning, this new Superman is encumbered by a pointless and cluttered new backstory which has to be explained in many wearisome intertitles flashed up on screen before anything happens at all. Only the repeated and laborious quotation of the great John Williams theme from the 1978 original reminds you of happier times.\n\n[The Wrap (88)](https://www.thewrap.com/superman-2025-review-james-gunn-david-corenswet/)\n\n>A fabulously smart and entertaining film whose flaws stem from trying too hard… which are the best flaws a film can have.\n\n[Entertainment Weekly (67)](https://ew.com/superman-review-david-corenswet-rachel-brosnahan-soar-kryptonite-script-11768207)\n\n>Whether Gunn fell victim to the kryptonite of excessive studio notes, his desire to populate the film with his stalwart company of actors, or the hubris of not needing to offer reasons to be invested in these characters beyond the mere fact of their existence is unclear. Because there is an unquestionable love for the material and a passion for the goofier, larger-than-life scenarios of comic book lore. With a cast this excellent, there's a capacity for something truly super in a future film — if only Gunn chooses to put the characters' humanity first. **Grade: B-**\n\n[BBC (3/5)](https://www.bbc.com/culture/article/20250708-superman-review)\n\n>It's a shame that Gunn didn't give his story more time to breathe. It's a shame, in particular, that he didn't devote more time to showing us that Superman really is the paragon that his supporters keep saying he is. Corenswet is well cast – he has plenty of all-American charm both as Superman and as his mild-mannered alter ego, Clark Kent – but we have to take it on trust that he is a selfless gentleman who helps his friends and enjoys Lois Lane's company. We don't see any of that. Indeed, Corenswet plays him as an oddly hot-headed manchild who can't get through a conversation with his girlfriend without shouting angrily at her. Was Gunn racing through his material so fast that he forgot to put in the scenes that show Superman's sweeter and nobler side? Maybe so. In a film that whirls with flying dogs and bright green baby demons, the most bizarre element is a Man of Steel who keeps having meltdowns.\n\n[Empire Magazine - UK (2/5)](https://www.empireonline.com/movies/reviews/superman-2025/)\n\n>David Corenswet takes on the blue-and-red mantle admirably, and glimpses of Gunn’s signature sense of fun shine through — but a lack of humanity, originality and cohesion means the movie around them just doesn’t work.\n\n[Rolling Stone (80)](https://www.rollingstone.com/tv-movies/tv-movie-reviews/superman-review-james-gunn-dc-universe-1235374965/)\n\n>It’s faint praise, even in the post-MCU era of the genre, to say that Superman is a solid superhero film; the caveat is hiding in plain sight. What Gunn has pulled off is something more complicated, more interesting, and far tougher: He’s given us a Superman movie that actually feels like a living, breathing comic book.\n\n[SlashFilm (80)](https://www.slashfilm.com/1906722/superman-james-gunn-movie-review/)\n\n>Yes, \"Superman\" is a frequently corny movie because Superman is a corny character, a Kansas farm boy alien who saves squirrels in danger and listens to lame pop music. There's nothing grim or dark here, just a real sense of entertaining silliness that left a big, stupid smile on my face. In our current media landscape, such an approach feels surprisingly bold.\n\n[Independent - UK (4/5)](https://www.the-independent.com/arts-entertainment/films/reviews/superman-review-james-gunn-david-corenswet-b2782165.html)\n\n>David Corenswet, Rachel Brosnahan and Nicholas Hoult lead a movie that doesn’t just serve as a referendum for superhero films, but for the cinematic future of DC as a whole.\n\n[New York Times (90)](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/07/08/movies/superman-review.html)\n\n>As both a story on its own and a prequel to a whole bunch of others, this movie must introduce us to a variety of characters we’ll meet later, and it does it without feeling too much like fan service or exposition.\n\n[Vulture (90)](https://www.vulture.com/article/review-james-gunns-superman-cant-help-but-be-political.html)\n\n>There’s a lot about how we complicate and obfuscate what should be obvious goods, such as saving the lives of children. But the film’s approach isn’t ham-fisted, and it makes room for gleefully fun stuff, too.\n\n[The Times - UK (2/5)](https://www.thetimes.com/culture/film/article/superman-film-review-david-corenswet-vbzrgpdhh)\n\n>This migraine of a movie is superhero soup. David Corenswet is serviceable as Hollywood’s latest Man of Steel, but director James Gunn has turned the ninth big-screen film into an indigestible mush\n\n[The Irish Times (2/5)](https://www.irishtimes.com/culture/film/review/2025/07/08/superman-review-utterly-charmless-and-as-funny-as-toothache/)\n\n>The cartoonish closing battles make it clear that, not for the first time, Gunn is striving for high trash, but what he achieves here is low garbage. Utterly charmless. Devoid of humanity. As funny as toothache.\n\n\\---\n\n**SYNOPSIS:**\n\n>Follows Superman as he reconciles his heritage with his human upbringing.

      "text": "I see musicals getting a lot of hate from cinephiles but I consider myself a big fan of both musicals and movies. I think a lot of movie fans don’t understand that musical fans hate a bad film adaptation of a musical even more than they do. I am personally offended by Russel Crowe as Javert in Les Miserables. \n\nAnyway, I think we should take a second to appreciate how good movie musicals can be. What is everyone’s favorite movie musical and why? Also, if anyone has more thoughts on why musicals get hate from movie lovers I would love to hear it. (Other than the classic excuses about realism vs. corniness that don’t apply to the good stuff)\n\nMy favorite is Cabaret (1972). I highly recommend movie musical skeptics give it a shot. It is serious and political with eight Academy Awards (it was up against the godfather too!). It is especially relevant to the climate in America right now and the musical numbers are diegetic if you are picky about people breaking into song.",

I’m talking primarily about Little Mermaid, Beauty and the Beast, Aladdin, and Lion King. Afterwards the 90s run is still good but these four movies aren’t just classics, they’re arguably the finest children’s films ever created. \n\nLike sitting here right now watching Beauty and the Beast (for the hundredth time lol) and “Bonjour” may be one of the best musical numbers I’ve ever heard. The quality of these movies is just off the charts. Makes me wonder - has there ever been a similar run where a studio just releases consecutive smash hits in such a brief period of time?",

The whole parent-child theme, the idea of sacrificing everything for a slim chance to save humanity—it’s way more emotional.\n\nAlso, Hans Zimmer’s score still gives me chills, especially during the docking scene. Christopher Nolan might get flak sometimes for being “too ambitious,” but for me, this movie is one of his masterpieces.\n\nCurious—where do you rank Interstellar among Nolan’s films? Do you think it’s underrated compared to Inception and The Dark Knight?",

      "text": "We know that the approach to the four Pirates of the Caribbean movies, as well as movies like Rango, was basically: write some thematic suites that encapsulate the tone of the movie, other composers use that thematic material to write the actual score of the movie under his supervision.\n\nI have theorized that Zimmer may take a more active \"real composer\" role in the movies he's done for Nolan, aside from occasional help from trusted collaborators like Lorne Balfe, who we know contributed to Inception. \n\nBut what about the movies that Zimmer couldn't possibly be bothered to write even a suite for? For instance, Zimmer is credited as sole composer for all three Madagascar movies. But does anyone really believe he wrote even a single note of music for those films? If anything at all, it amounted to \"here's 3 minutes. Interns 1-5, write the other 70 minutes.\" Rinse and repeat another two times. Basically the Pirates approach, but with far less work put in. \n\nDitto for Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2, where it's generally accepted that Zimmer wrote the \"main theme\", and Lorne Balfe wrote literally everything else. In which case, crediting the score as being composed by \"Hans Zimmer and Lorne Balfe\" feels like a sick joke. \n\nBut I'm not certain even that level of involvement would be required. Contracts are a beautiful thing. They can be written in a way that doesn't mandate Mr. Zimmer actually create any music himself, but he's still credited as sole composer. \n\nWhat do you think? I know music is a relatively niche aspect of the filmmaking process, but I'm sure some of you here are interested in it, and some of the you who are interested in it also know about the widespread practice of ghostwriting film scores. A practice largely pioneered by Zimmer. \n\nThis is not a \"hate Zimmer\" thread. The man is supremely talented on multiple facets. But he is pretty much the exemplar of \"work smart, not hard\" in film music.",

      "title": "Juno is totally different as an adult",
      "text": "I recently watched Juno for the first time since I was about 13 or 14. I was in junior high I believe when the movie first released, and seeing it as an adult really blew my mind. The creators somehow perfectly captured the awkward and intense feelings of not being a kid, but not quite an adult yet either. \n\nFirst note, Mark was a massive creep and weirdo. Kissing a teenage girl when you’re an adult is creepy and gross all on its own. Then you throw in that SHE WAS CARRYING THEIR ADOPTIVE CHILD. What the actual fuck! What a disgusting pathetic man. Watching the scene when he took Juno to the basement to show her the comic of a pregnant super hero was so disgusting. Their relationship in general was coming off very grooming, then he was seducing a pregnant 16 year old girl who was extremely vulnerable. In my young teenage mind, I thought Vanessa was such a wet blanket, suppressing his creative side and making him and Juno both feel like losers. In reality, she was a saint who should have kicked him to the curb way sooner. He deserved no grace. I cannot imagine my partner not only cheating on me, but cheating with a teenager. And not just a teenager, a pregnant teenager who is carrying my adoptive son. Vanessa was such a great person and didn’t deserve anything that pathetic excuse of a man put her through. \n\nSecond note, Juno(and company) is extremely immature and the creators did a great job of showcasing it. I love her quirkiness, but the way she did not understand why it was inappropriate to be popping up at Mark and Vanessa’s house was very telling. There are two sides to that coin, because she may have known it was inappropriate but was too young and naive to see the long term outcome of the situation. She definitely didn’t understand why a man of his age shouldn’t be chumming it up with her. In fact, she seemed to enjoy the fact that he was even giving her attention at all. It helped that he liked the same things, so in her mind it was confirming she was cool. It just shows exactly how immature she was, unable to look past your own bubble to see the rest of your life. \n\nOn another note, it was implied that she and Bleaker were way better friends than what we saw in the movie. It seemed that they were hanging out everyday, had all the same interests and hobbies. But, when Juno came up pregnant Bleaker fell off the map. He never seemed pressed when she would stop and say hey, but he did absolutely nothing to try and help her in the situation. He also didn’t understand why it hurt her so much he was taking someone else to a dance. At that point in the plot, we really got to see how the normally confident and abrasive Juno was becoming self conscious and confused by the weight of her feelings. Highlighting how juvenile everyone was, while dealing with such a serious situation was just top tier writing. The whole movie did such a great job of capturing exactly how it feels to be 16. Too old for childhood, but nowhere near an adult yet. Even though every single 16 year old in the world thinks they’re an adult. It takes growing up to realize exactly how childish you still are at that age. \n\nI do think it’s worth mentioning how great of parents her dad and Bren were. Bren was her step mom and they didn’t seem particularly close, but she didn’t hesitate when it came to Juno. Of the jump, she was getting her to a doctor, coming to her defense when needed, and making sure she had everything she needed. And her father, who was obviously uncomfortable with emotional bridges with his teenaged daughter, made sure she knew she was loved. The scene of her in hospital after giving birth brought tears to my eyes. \n\nAs a whole, the movie is great. I’m not sure what category you could out this movie in, but they somehow captured a vibe of nostalgia I didn’t know I was missing. And just to bring it in again, we should all beat Marks ass if we ever happened to see his character out in the real world. \n\n*Edit Note: \n\npeople are being gross about Elliot Page being in the movie. Elliot is an amazing actor and their gender at any point in their life has absolutely NOTHING to do with the character of Juno. I’m referring to Juno as she/her, not Elliot. You’re weird if you care about someone else’s gender enough to be a dick about it. No one cares what you think. Elliot is happy and that’s all that’s important. Keep your weird ass comments to yourself if you’ve got something nasty to say. You’re the weird one if you can’t just simply respect what a person wants for their own autonomy.

As Skate puts it: “Our world is a tire fire floating in an ocean of piss.” Despite all of the clout and capital at their disposal, the Russo brothers can think of nothing better to do than stick our faces in it.\n\n-[David Ehrlich, IndieWire](https://www.indiewire.com/criticism/movies/the-electric-state-netflix-movie-review-1235101527/): D–\n\n> There’s no rule that says book-based films shouldn’t diverge from what’s on the page. Stanley Kubrick’s “The Shining” and Paul Verhoeven’s “Starship Troopers” certainly did, and those stories found their audiences in both mediums. In this case, however, the filmmakers have diluted the source material, showing a clear lack of interest in making their creation just as haunting, searing and satisfying as the original product.\n\n-[Courtney Howard, Variety](https://variety.com/2025/film/reviews/the-electric-state-review-1236330760/)\n\n> AI-loving Marvel hitmakers Joe and Anthony Russo join forces again with Netflix to deliver a $300-million sci-fi epic you can safely half-watch while doing the dishes or making dinner. Everything about the film, from its formulaic hero’s-journey plot to its nostalgic mascot imagery to the casting of streaming-friendly stars Millie Bobby Brown and Chris Pratt, feels calculated to remind you of something you’ve already enjoyed. It’s a synthetic crowdpleaser that would look a little less odious were it not flattening the spooky grandeur of its source material, the striking illustrated novel of the same name.\n\n-[A.A. Dowd, IGN](https://www.ign.com/articles/the-electric-state-review-netflix-millie-bobby-brown-chris-pratt-russo-brothers): 4.0 \"bad\"\n\n> I’m not surprised that Netflix and the Russos want to tell a story about how humans and machines can live together in peace, but I struggled to find much humanity in a picture so gleefully soulless.\n\n-[Matt Goldberg, The Wrap](https://www.thewrap.com/the-electric-state-review-millie-bobby-brown-chris-pratt/)\n\n> There is a gallery of wacky individuals of all shapes and sizes, providing some undemanding work for voice-artists including Brian Cox, Woody Harrelson, Alan Tudyk and Colman Domingo. But there’s no soul, no originality, just a great big multicolour wedge of digital content.\n\n-[Peter Bradshaw, The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/film/2025/mar/07/the-electric-state-review-millie-bobby-brown-chris-pratt-simon-stalenhag): 2/5\n\n> The Electric State is somehow both punishingly obvious and completely incoherent. Ultimately, however, the only real point is that pop culture should be revered as humanity’s prime sustenance. Cosmo is based on a children’s cartoon that’s presented as the only real emotional bond between Michelle and her brother; the surrounding landscape is nothing but malls and fairgrounds, temples to consumerism where characters practically salivate while listing off menus items from Panda Express; and there’s a searingly earnest piano cover of “Wonderwall” at the end. The Electric State isn’t about dystopia. It’s the dystopia itself.\n\n-[Clarisse Loughrey, The Independent](https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/films/reviews/the-electric-state-review-netflix-b2710157.html): 1/5\n\n> The Electric State loses some of the quiet profundity of the original text, but as a breezily watchable retrofuturistic jolly, it has just enough juice.\n\n-[John Nugent, Empire](https://www.empireonline.com/movies/reviews/the-electric-state/): 3/5\n\n> Throughout, the film essentially functions as a plea to its viewers to put technology aside and embrace the power of human connection. It's a noble message – and one which most audiences members will surely be able to emphasise with – but in truth it feels hollow coming from a work that seems so clearly to have been made with the Netflix algorithm firmly in mind.\n\n-[Patrick Cremona, Radio Times](https://www.radiotimes.com/movies/scifi/the-electric-state-review/): 2/5\n\n> Should we expect more from a Netflix movie by now? Probably. But The Electric State is indicative of too many blockbuster offerings from the streaming service that do just enough to get you to watch, but are rarely good enough to be memorable.\n\n-[Ian Sandwell, Digital Spy](https://www.digitalspy.com/movies/a64069135/the-electric-state-review-netflix/): 2/5\n\n____________________________________________________________________________________________\n\n**PLOT**\n\nIn a retro-futuristic past, orphaned teenager Michelle traverses the American West with an eccentric drifter and a sweet but mysterious robot in search of her younger brother.\n\n**DIRECTORS** \n\nAnthony & Joe Russo\n\n**WRITERS**\n\nChristopher Markus & Stephen McFeely (based on the novel by Simon Stålenhag)\n\n**MUSIC**\n\nAlan Silvestri\n\n**CINEMATOGRAPHY**\n\nStephen F.

But though overloaded at times, it's the rare mainstream horror film that's about something weighty and soulful: the wages of sin in Black America.\n\n[Deadline](https://deadline.com/2025/04/sinners-review-ryan-coogler-michael-b-jordan-x-2-reteam-vampire-movie-1236365142/):\n\n>*Sinners* marks another strong reason why Ryan Coogler is at the top of his generation of filmmakers, and Jordan continues to show why he is a real deal movie star.\n\n[Hollywood Reporter](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-reviews/sinners-review-michael-b-jordan-ryan-coogler-horror-1236186742/) (90):\n\n>The movie is smart horror, even poetic at times, with much to say about race and spiritual freedom. It’s not in the Jordan Peele league in terms of welding social commentary to bone-chilling fear. But *Sinners* is a unique experience, unlike anything either the director or Jordan has done before.\n\n[SlashFilm](https://www.slashfilm.com/1831292/sinners-ryan-coogler-movie-review/) (9/10):\n\n>\"Sinners\" is several things at once — a monster movie, a blood-soaked action film, a sexy and sensual thriller, and a one-location horror flick as intense and paranoia-driven as anything from the original \"Assault on Precinct 13\" or Quentin Tarantino's filmography – but its greatest strength comes from how well Coogler blends every big idea on his mind.\n\n[The Wrap](https://www.thewrap.com/sinners-review-ryan-coogler-michael-b-jordan-vampire-horror/) (88):\n\n>“Sinners” is a bloody, brilliant motion picture. Ryan Coogler finds within the vampire genre an ethereal thematic throughline; and within the music genre a disturbing, tempting monster. Stunningly photographed, engrossing cinema — epic to the point where it seemingly never ends, which is undeniably indulgent, but no great sin. This is a film about indulgence, the power indulgence wields and the dangers indulgence invites into our lives. It’s a sweaty, intoxicating, all-nighter of a movie, and its allure cannot be denied.\n\n[The Independent](https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/films/reviews/sinners-movie-2025-michael-b-jordan-cast-ryan-coogler-b2730833.html) (4/5):\n\n>If cinema weren’t in such a sickly state, *Sinners*’s electric fusion of genres – historical epic, horror, and squelchy actioner – would be a guaranteed box office sensation. Instead, the film arrives with an uneasy sense that this is some kind of final stand for original ideas. One can only hope audiences recognise its bounty of riches.\n\n[The Guardian](https://www.metacritic.com/movie/sinners/) (3/5):\n\n>For many, the movie could as well do without the supernatural element, and I admit I’m one of them; I’d prefer to see a real story with real jeopardy work itself out. But there is energy and comic-book brashness\n\nVanity Fair (80):\n\n> Sinners is propulsive and stirring entertainment, messy but always compelling. The film’s fascinating array of genres and tropes and ideas swirls together in a way that is, I suppose, singularly American.\n\n[IndieWire](https://www.indiewire.com/criticism/movies/sinners-review-ryan-coogler-michael-b-jordan-vampire-movie-1235114698/) (83):\n\n>Sinners is nothing if not a film about genre, and the distinctly American imperative of cross-pollinating between them to create something that feels new and old — high and low — at the same time.\n\n\n\n\\------------------------------------\n\nWritten & Directed by Ryan Coogler:\n\n>Trying to leave their troubled lives behind, twin brothers Smoke and Stack (Michael B. Jordan) return to their hometown to start again, only to discover that an even greater evil is waiting to welcome them back.\n\nCast:\n\n* Michael B.

This month I decided to change that, and for a Halloween challenge I've watched one horror movie for each day in October (I wasn't exact, some days I missed and others I watched a couple, but for the most part I kept my schedule).  I tried to pick culturally significant horror movies. After watching each one, I reviewed and ranked them.  I decided to give a one to ten number rating each movie's scare value (S), how disturbing (disgusting or revolting imagery, actions or themes) the movie is (D), and how fun the movie is to watch (F).  Lastly, I ranked them in order of my least to most favorite movie overall.  I considered overall quality and not necessarily the S, D and F ratings to make my final rankings at the bottom of the post.\n\n\n\nI'm interested in feedback and would love to see others rank these movies as well!  Minor spoilers in the reviews.\n\n\n\nOct 1st: Halloween 2018. Solid soundtrack, Jamie Lee Curtis forever! I enjoyed the revenge plot and the cat and mouse play.  Entertaining, but a bit ridiculous.  I had a great time, but this isn't high minded stuff.  I realize now that I probably should have watched the original first.  S 3, D 4, F 8.\n\n\n\nOct 2nd: The Blair Witch Project.  I feel like this was only a hit because it pulled off the hand held faux docu-movie in a way that fooled the public because it was relatively unique at the time. I was bored, and not scared. Maybe it would have been different if I'd watched it in 1999 and thought it was an actual documentary.  S 2, D 1, F 1.\n\n\n\nOct 3rd: The Witch.  Eggers clearly has a style (I've seen The Northman).  This was creepy and engaging, and had some real gross and memorable scenes, especially involving children and an infant.  I feel like the ending didn't pack as much of a wallop as the build-up seemed to promise, although it still hit well enough with a memorable closing shot.  Eggers clearly was going for arthouse horror and succeeded.  Also, thank you for bringing us Anya Taylor-Joy.  S 6, D 8, F 4.\n\n\n\nOct 4th: Nightmare on Elm Street. Eighties camp, here we are. Disco electronica soundtrack, Johnny Depp's massive blood volume, and a memorable but not that scary villain.  Didn't age incredibly well, but fun for what it is. S 3, D 4, F 6.\n\n\n\nOct 5th: Friday the 13th. This one was kinda dumb.  Maybe the sequels are better, since I suppose they have more Jason.  But I did get to see Kevin Bacon get an arrow slow-pushed through his cricoid, so there's that. S 2, D 3, F 2.\n\n\n\nOct 6th: Hereditary. Jeesh.  This is peak disturbing, especially *that* scene, taken together with the characters' upsetting responses.  Ari Aster clearly knows how to upset his audience.  I wish there was more exposition around the mythology and story in a way that made the movie's plot and ending more immediately accessible.  Still, Toni Collette was incredible and this movie seems deserving of its modern horror classic designation. S 9, D 10, F 2.\n\n\n\nOct 7th: Midsommar.  Two Ari Asters in a row.  This time he nails disturbing with crazy memorable images in the opening, middle, and closing sections. I didn't know a movie could be so upsetting without resorting to dark rooms and hallways. Also, Florence Pugh's closing expression, yikes.  S 6, D 10, F 5.\n\n\n\nOct 8th: Psycho. This is a pretty excellent movie.  I've never seen Hitchcock before this month.  I recognize why he's one of the greats after watching this.  The plot twist is great.  The lead up and execution of the famous shower scene is great.  The script and acting are great.  Bravo.  S 6, D 5, F 4.\n\n\n\nOct 9th: The Birds.  This Hitchcock didn't do it for me.  Birds ultimately just aren't that scary.  I couldn't buy into the plot device or the romance at the center.  But filming all the birds must have been pretty tricky! S 3, D 3, F 2.\n\n\n\nOct 10th: The Shining.  Peak horror.  Nicholson at his best.  The story, the style, the imagery, the scares are all spot on and memorable in the best ways.  It feels like a work of art.  I wish Kubrick had done more straight horror.  That said, he could have helped Shelley Duvall with her \"scared running\" technique a little.  S 8, D 6, F 8.\n\n\n\nOct 11th: The Exorcist. I've grown up hearing that this is the scariest movie ever.  After watching, I get it.  That possessed girl is not cool.  Ellen Burstyn is fantastic.  Some of those scenes are absolutely unforgettable.  How was this made in 1973?  Deserved its best picture nom.  Horrifying.  Do not recommend.  S 10, D 9, F 3.\n\n\n\nOct 12th: Texas Chainsaw Massacre. This is just fine movie making.  I can see how this influenced so many horror movies to come.  Incredible dinner table scene, and the closing shot is clearly iconic.  This movie has aged almost perfectly, with the chase scene being the only exception (could have done with a few less clips of him running after her through the trees).  S 5, D 8, F 3.\n\n\n\nOct 13th: Rosemary's Baby. So, she was raped by Satan?  Ok then.  Honestly, this is obviously elite direction, writing, character development and acting.  The movie was clearly way ahead of its time for horror. The ending is disturbing and effective. I imagine this movie is even more upsetting to those who've experienced pregnancy, especially as Rosemary is being manipulated by her husband and doctors.  I know I can never show this one to my wife. I'm no movie historian, but I understand why this is on a lot of all-time best movie lists.  S 3, D 8, F 6.\n\n\n\nOct 14th: The Mist. Pretty standard, kinda fun and scary creature flick until that ending. I'm sure the ending has been talked about ad nauseum because it is so impactful and shocking. Let me just say this: it made me feel physically ill.  It's burned in my head forever now. I'm not sure I'm happy about it. And isn't that what a good horror is supposed to do?  S 5, D 10, F 5.\n\n\n\nOct 15th: It (2017).  I haven't seen the original, but I thought this movie was really solid.  Steven King knows how to weave a yarn.  Seems to me this movie is the reason that Stranger Things exists, and it did the \"80s kids on bikes who outshine and outsmart the adults\" thing as well as it can be done.  Real solid scares too, that clown is creep town.  Some of the scare set pieces felt a little forced, though.  S 8, D 6, F 8.\n\n\n\nOct 16th: Get Out.  I think the social commentary delivery by this movie is pitch perfect. The plot is well done with an engaging cast, and there are some nice shocking reveals. The movie built suspense well, is perfectly directed, and kept me engaged throughout. This is a solid horror. However, I may have expected more than I got given all the awards and recognition hype. S 6, D 6, F 6.\n\n\n\nOct 17th:  Paranormal Activity. Really freaked me out for some reason. The nanny cam view capturing spooky stuff at night messing with oblivious people sleeping in their bed captures one of my unreasonable fears by violating my primary safe space, my room. I don't like it.  Other than the scare device, though, there's not much to this movie.  S 9, D 2, F1.\n\n\n\nOct 18th: Nope. Unpopular opinion alert: This is my pick between the two Jordan Peele movies I watched.  I love this movie so much. It is riotously funny in parts and pretty atmospheric and frightening in others. I can't take my eyes off of Daniel Kaluuya, he's so intense. I love the juxtaposing stories all driving home the message that non-human intelligent beings (whether chimps, horses, or aliens) don't exist just to be gawked at by a paying human public. They just might get their revenge.  What a ride.   S 7, D 5, F 9.\n\n\n\nOct 19th:  It Follows.  The best premise to a horror flick I've ever seen or heard of. Of course there should be a movie about a horror STD.  And it happens to be expertly executed.  The movie managed to get under my skin by exploiting my fear of being followed.  It crafts a sense of dread because the bad guy can always be anyone and it never stops walking toward you unless you have sex to pass the scourge onto someone you might really care about.  Talk about moral dilemmas.  If any horror movie deserves a sequel, it's this one. C'mon David Robert Mitchell, give us \"It Still Follows,\" we would all watch it.  S 8, D 7, F 6.\n\n\n\nOct 20th: Talk To Me.  From the jump, this flick knows how to shock and build suspense.  It has a couple of pretty memorable frightening moments and manages to stay creepy, with a solid ending.  I'm learning that people getting possessed is a really scary thing for me to watch, and this movie has that in spades.  This is a lesser known horror gem IMO.  S 9, D 8, F 3.\n\n\n\nOct 21st:  Scream.  The opening was destined to become a classic moment in horror. This is meant to be a fun self-aware movie, with clever horror genre references throughout and a twist for the reveal.  And lots and lots of stabbing.  I definitely had a good time.  Not very scary though.  S 3, D 3, F 8.\n\n\n\nOct 22nd:  The Thing.  Yes!  Inject this into my veins.  Would make a perfect double feature with Alien.  Everything was just right: Kurt Russell's paranoia, John Carpenter's direction, Rob Bottin's creature work, the suspicion created by the genius plot device, the chill-to-the-bone setting, and the perfectly ambiguous ending.  I love this movie.  S 6, D 8, F 10.\n\n\n\nOct 23rd:  Saw.  This is where the Escape Rooms trend came from?  My kids thank you, Saw.  This was a fun ride with a clever ending. Also, why don't people with one leg ever stand and hop in the movies? Dragging themselves around smh.  S 6, D 7, F 8.\n\n\n\nOct 24th:  Barbarian.  What the?  I honestly didn't find it terribly scary, but it's high on the disturbing scale.  Props working in a \"me too\" theme.  The kill at the end was definitely a gruesome shocker.  But c'mon, that last set piece defies physics in too many ways to give it a pass.  S 4, D 8, F 2.\n\n\n\nOct 25th:  Pearl.  Mia Goth's acting deserves a shout out for that closing credits clip alone. Not sure about the southern girl accent despite her being raised in relative isolation by her German speaking mother.  It feels a bit over the line manipulative, although I suppose that is partly the point, to feel ridiculously, sarcastically manipulated - but not fooled - by Pearl. Such an interesting movie. Lots of buildup to a pretty upsetting conclusion. I admire the risks it takes and the artistry it shows. Felt like pre-tornado Wizard of Oz with a Return to Oz below-the-surface creepiness.  S 4, D 8, F 5.\n\n\n\nOct 26th:  Sinister.  I read a study that tried to scientifically prove which horror movie is the scariest based on the heart rate increase of the audience. Sinister was officially named by the study authors as the Most Scary Movie. So I watched it. And, yes, it's pretty high up on the list for me. The soundtrack is pulsating, the family snuff videos awful, and the darkness prevalent. The movie is almost all in the dark. Ethan Hawke is always excellent. The end reveal is mostly predictable, but this movie definitely delivers the scares. Edit: This movie ended up freaking me out so bad I had trouble sleeping and had to watch some SNL at 1am to settle down.  S 10, D 7, F 2.\n\n\n\nOct 27th:  Hellraiser (1987).  It tried to be an interesting \"how far would you go to get what you most want\" movie, which is more theme than most of the other 80's horror I watched this month. Most of the runtime I was thinking \"dang, the makeup and creature effects are really good for '87\" and then the special effects at the end made me want to take it all back. Overall pretty disturbing and gruesome, and fairly well done without being very scary.  But the ending was a dud in almost every way.  S 3, D 8, F 3.\n\n\n\nOct 28th: Candyman (1992).  I went in with low expectations after being burned by Hellraiser, and the movie beat them comfortably. I thought it was really solid. I loved the soundtrack, the villain was memorable, and the plot was tightly wound and appropriately suspenseful.  It even mostly stuck the landing.  S 6, D 6, F 7.\n\n\n\nOct 29th:  The Descent.  I saw this one mentioned a lot so I gave it a go and I'm glad I did.  It's like A Quiet Place but dialed up to 11 with its pitch black cave setting, claustrophobia, and bloody violent (and quite upsetting) kills.  The action in this movie is breathtaking in spots.  A plot choice made at the end really upset me, which makes the film all the more memorable.  S 9, D 7, F 6.\n\n\n\nOct 30th: The Wicker Man (1973).  Not sure what I was expecting with this one, but it wasn't the cross between a hyper-sexualized The Sound of Music and Midsommar that I got. Overall a bit slow and unscary but turns the corner in the last 20 minutes with an incredibly impactful ending that really delves into questions of the ethics of religious piety and perspective. And it was super cool to watch a Christopher Lee masterclass from his younger days.  S 1, D6, F2. \n\n\n\nOct 31st (watched it yesterday):  The Evil Dead (1981). Oh wow. Ok. Well, Sam Raimi certainly did some stuff here!  Nice use of fog and camera perspective work, and the creature makeup is crazy. This movie has some hilariously messed up images and kills. I didn't know whether to laugh or freak out or throw up through most of it.  And the gore.  Oh, the gore.  It was often hard to distinguish whether it's high camp or high art, and maybe it's both.  This movie obviously birthed a lot of horror tropes.  I can't believe what I just watched.  And I can't believe I almost didn't watch it, being the last film on the list.  S 7, D 10, F 7.\n\n\n\nOverall Rankings:\n\n\n\n31: Friday the 13th\n\n\n\n30: The Blair Witch Project\n\n\n\n29: The Birds\n\n\n\n28: Nightmare on Elm Street\n\n\n\n27: Hellraiser\n\n\n\n26: Paranormal Activity\n\n\n\n25: Barbarian\n\n\n\n24: Halloween (2018)\n\n\n\n23: Scream\n\n\n\n22: The Wicker Man (1973)\n\n\n\n21: The Mist\n\n\n\n20: It (2017)\n\n\n\n19: The Witch\n\n\n\n18: Sinister\n\n\n\n17: Pearl\n\n\n\n16: Saw\n\n\n\n15: Candyman (1992)\n\n\n\n14: Talk to Me\n\n\n\n13: Midsommar\n\n\n\n12: Get Out\n\n\n\n11: The Evil Dead (1981)\n\n\n\n10: Hereditary\n\n\n\n9: Psycho\n\n\n\n8: The Descent\n\n\n\n7: The Exorcist\n\n\n\n6: Texas Chainsaw Massacre\n\n\n\n5: It Follows\n\n\n\n4: Nope\n\n\n\n3: Rosemary's Baby\n\n\n\n2: The Thing\n\n\n\n1: The Shining\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat did I get right or wrong?

      "text": "We all love Tim Curry... but I don't think we stop to appreciate just how amazing he really is. He's an actor, sure... but he can also sing. And sing well! He's willing to undergo makeup and prosthetics to transform himself into crazy characters. But he's also very open to various role offers; from The Hunt For Red October, to Home Alone 2: Lost In New York.\n\n\nBut on top of his amazing live action roles... he is a very prolific voice actor too! Ferngully, Scooby Doo, Wild Thornberrys... if you grew up in the 80s and 90s, dollars to donuts you know his voice! And if you grew up after the 80s and 90s... he has also narrated a few books on Audible. I personally own A Christmas Carol, read beautifully by the man himself!  \n\nHe's had a pretty diverse career in TV. Tim even made the venture into video games. Most infamously was Command & Conquer. I don't know much about his career on stage... but apparently he did that too! And two music videos! Thank you, Wikipedia! \n\n\nHe's worked with Muppets, kids, and even Alec Baldwin! Just goes to show that he is patient and open minded as an actor. But, he's also a very kind person. Seldom will you ever hear anyone say anything but positive things about meeting Tim Curry. He is always very grateful for his career, and has so much time for his fans. \n\nHe has suffered some health problems in recent years... and that sucks. But he hasn't given up! Tim Curry is a fighter and still has all his charm and quick wit that we've come to know him for throughout the years.\n\nI personally will always remember him best from Legend, Muppet Treasure Island, and Home Alone 2... three movies from my childhood. If you line all three of his characters up side by side and told a random person in the street that it was all the same actor... they'd probably laugh in your face. Speaking of laughing... he apparently auditioned for The Joker before Mark Hamill got it. Would've loved to hear that take!\n\n\nHe is the reason so many people are afraid of clowns... but he is also the reason so many people fell in love with his films. \n\n\nTim Curry.\n\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/29qFh8i.jpeg",

Of course, like many, I saw them back in high school—but watching them now, with fresh eyes and a bit more life behind me, left me in absolute awe.\n\nQuentin Tarantino truly crafted something unreal with these films. The stylistic range, the pacing, the character arcs, the music, the cinematography… it’s all so intentional, so bold, and so damn cool. It reminded me of just how thrilling movies can be when every frame feels like it was made with love and madness.\n\nI’ve been craving that “holy sh*t, THIS is cinema” feeling for a while now, and Kill Bill delivered it in spades. It’s a reminder of why we fall in love with film in the first place.\n\nSo if it’s been a few years—or you’ve only ever seen it once—this is your sign to queue it up. You won’t regret it.",

      "text": "[Rotten Tomatoes](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/jurassic_world_rebirth): 54% (100 reviews) with 6.00 in average rating\n\n[Metacritic](https://www.metacritic.com/movie/jurassic-world-rebirth/): 53/100 (38 critics)\n\nAs with other movies, the scores are set to change as time passes. Meanwhile, I'll post some short reviews on the movie. It's structured like this: **quote first, source second.** Beware, some contain spoilers.\n\n> The blend of physical locations with sets and digital imagery is seamless and the CG work on the creatures is first-rate, notably so in the scary climactic stretch when the lumbering D. Rex joins the fray. Edwards clearly is a devoted Spielberg fan, embedding subtle homages throughout, notably in the open water sequences that recall Jaws. Jurassic World Rebirth is unlikely to top anyone’s ranked franchise list. But longtime fans (count me among them) should have a blast.\n\n-[David Rooney, The Hollywood Reporter](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-reviews/jurassic-world-rebirth-review-scarlett-johansson-1236302373/)\n\n> Scenes between Ella and her potentially ill-advised pet, along with tender moments involving several other species, introduce a surprising counter-argument to the earlier “Jurassic” movies: namely, that they have a right to exist. But entertaining as it can be at times, stripped of the silliness that tainted the second trilogy, “Rebirth” doesn’t necessarily make the same case for itself. The movie offers an updated version of the same basic ride Spielberg offered 32 years earlier, and yet, it hardly feels essential to the series’ overall mythology, nor does it signal where the franchise could be headed.\n\n-[Peter Debruge, Variety](https://variety.com/2025/film/reviews/jurassic-world-rebirth-review-1236443872/)\n\n> Needless to say, “Rebirth” doesn’t do itself any favors by so frequently harkening back to the original. Bad as some of the previous sequels have been, none of them have been so eager to measure themselves against Spielberg’s masterpiece. Nothing in this movie is quite as maddening as the second trilogy’s attempt to make audiences invest in a specific Velociraptor (though Edwards half-heartedly tries to sweeten us on an adorable baby Aquilops named Dolores), but the extent to which this franchise is just fending off its own extinction has never been more obvious than it is in during the “Rebirth” sequence that pays homage to the kitchen encounter from the first movie. The “Jurassic” sequels were bad enough when they made an effort to evolve — they’re even less worth seeing now that they already come pre-fossilized.\n\n-[David Ehrlich, IndieWire](https://www.indiewire.com/criticism/movies/jurassic-world-rebirth-review-1235135932/): C–\n\n> There’s a disappointing amount of “same old thing” to Jurassic World Rebirth. Scarlett Johansson, Mahershala Ali, and the rest of the cast are intriguing and sympathetic throughout, but Gareth Edwards doesn’t quite recapture his signature flair for grand-scale visuals nor does David Koepp find the magic of his original Jurassic Park screenplay, opting to follow that movie’s structure as more of a remix than a rebirth.\n\n-[Clint Gage, IGN](https://www.ign.com/articles/jurassic-world-rebirth-review-scarlett-johansson-mahershala-ali): 5.0 out of 10 \"mediocre\"\n\n> So why the hell does this feel so generic, so by-the-numbers, so instantly forgettable? The whole thing resembles the blockbuster version of a readymade, assembled from various, recognizable spare parts and elevated only by virtue of its name. Fans and completists may still get giddy over a ScarJo vs. Dinos showdown, and you should never underestimate the power of giant, toothy jaws chomping down on poor, hapless humans. But long before the big showstopping climax, you’ll start to understand why the movie’s jaded public became bored by what once seemed thrilling and unique. Subtitling this Rebirth seems to have been an act of extreme optimism.\n\n-[David Fear, Rolling Stone](https://www.rollingstone.com/tv-movies/tv-movie-reviews/jurassic-world-rebirth-review-scarlett-johansson-1235372435/)\n\n> This new Jurassic adventure isn’t doing anything so very different from the earlier successful models, perhaps, and I could have done without its outrageous brand synergy product placement for certain brands of chocolate bar. But it feels relaxed and sure-footed in its Spielberg pastiche, its big dino-jeopardy moments and its deployment of thrills and laughs. Maybe the series can’t and shouldn’t go on for ever: we need new and original ideas. This one would be great to go out on.\n\n-[Peter Bradshaw, The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/film/2025/jun/30/jurassic-world-rebirth-review-scarlett-johansson-runs-show-as-near-extinct-franchise-roars-back-to-life): 4/5\n\n> “Jurassic” has to live with setting a high bar, of course — the original film revolutionized the industry, a status that “Rebirth” is all too aware of, as seen in its meta theme of dinosaurs becoming old news to a jaded populace. Yet just because cheeseburgers are now available anywhere doesn’t mean that they can’t be damn tasty. “Jurassic Park Rebirth” is just a well made cheeseburger, and whether that’s filling and interesting enough is up to your own appetite. \n\n-[Bill Bria, The Wrap](https://www.thewrap.com/jurassic-world-rebirth-review/)\n\n> “Science is for all of us, not just for some of us,” Dr. Loomis tells Zora, advocating for their work to have a more noble purpose than lining their pockets. That aspirational notion has always sat at the heart of the Jurassic Park films. Jurassic Park Rebirth is one of the more successful and satisfying entries in the franchise precisely because it, uh, finds a way to keep Loomis’ mantra close, foregrounding the film’s sense of wonder above a mere blatant cash grab.\n\n-[Maureen Lee Lenker, Entertainment Weekly](https://ew.com/jurassic-park-rebirth-review-scarlett-johansson-jonathan-bailey-help-franchise-roar-back-11763036): B+\n\n> It might sound like a challenge to believe these humans would sign up to visit a forbidden jungle for guaranteed encounters with truly frightening and gigantic creatures out of another time in order to essentially get blood samples, but if you are game to go with that premise a good time will be had for all. If there is to be an eighth installment, count me in.\n\n-[Pete Hammond, Deadline](https://deadline.com/2025/06/jurassic-world-rebirth-review-scarlett-johansson-spielberg-1236445462/)\n\n> This is a monster-adventure movie, with passages that recall Jaws and King Kong; maybe not the most original influences, but certainly not shabby ones. In its fusion of Edwards’ craft with characters who aren’t thunderously stupid or unlikable, this is the best Jurassic movie in ages – in part because it works so comfortably as an ooh/ahh/run/scream monster movie.\n\n-[Paste](https://www.pastemagazine.com/movies/gareth-edwards/jurassic-world-rebirth-scarlett-johansson-mahershala-ali-gareth-edwards-dinosaurs): 7.0\n\n> “Jurassic World: Rebirth” is a very imperfect film. On one hand, it seems to be recycling every successful character trope and set piece from the franchise, which may be considered lazy and uninspiring, but it is still captivating. Even in its faults, the objective of a “Jurassic Park” film is to scare, thrill, and amaze its audience, and this film does that in its set pieces.\n\n-[Lauren LaMagna, Next Best Picture](https://nextbestpicture.com/jurassic-world-rebirth/)\n\n> There are worse exercises in IP-extension out there in the marketplace. But it is hard to imagine what possible basis there could be for an eighth Jurassic film. We’ve overused the extra-island trope; we’ve done dinos invading the mainland a couple times now. We’ve seen enough long necks poking up from the grass. We’ve seen too many T-rexes thundering after their prey. Now even the oceans have been exhausted. I suppose they could send some dinosaurs to space next time, where no one can hear them roar. But that wouldn’t really make much of a difference: the sound barely registers anymore.\n\n-[Richard Lawson, Vanity Fair](https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/story/jurassic-world-rebirth-review)\n\n> To his credit, Edwards immediately injects \"Rebirth\" with a sense of stakes and tension that the entirety of the previous trilogy struggled to depict. But every time the plot kicks in again and writer David Koepp's script goes through the motions of a standard \"Jurassic\" movie, those dizzying peaks soon begin to flatten out into overgrown valleys. For those simply hoping for a watchable movie on the heels of the disastrous \"Dominion,\" your wish has been granted with a safe rehash punctuated by a handful of genuine thrills. For everyone else curious about whether this was the ticket to teaching old dinos new tricks? The inherent limits of the \"Jurassic\" IP are as glaring as ever.\n\n-[Jeremy Mathai, /FILM](https://www.slashfilm.com/1899528/jurassic-world-rebirth-movie-review/): 5.5/10\n\n> And there are some sporadic joys here in the clever sight gags, the sleight of hand, the bait and switch. These moments remind us of the mindless summertime excitement the “Jurassic” movies have long provided, albeit with diminishing returns. But that giant footprint just isn’t as imposing as it used to be. \n\n-[Christy Lemire, RogerEbert.com](https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/jurassic-world-rebirth-scarlett-johannsson-movie-review-2025): 2/4\n\n> Worst of all, this hoary adventure story is rendered soulless by the blatant product placement: Henry crunching on Altoids, Reuben scolding Xavier for eating too many of their bags of Doritos, and Isabella feeding Twizzlers to her little dino friend. After a while, you may wonder if the entire film was subsidized by the snack food industry. Rebirth even goes so far as setting its final action scene in a long-abandoned but still fully stocked convenience store. How meta: a franchise trying to distract us from how past its sell-by date it is with expired potato chips.\n\n-[Derek Smith, Slant Magazine](https://www.slantmagazine.com/film/jurassic-world-rebirth-review-scarlett-johansson-jonathan-bailey-gareth-edwards/): 1.5/4\n\n> Audiences may not have run out of enthusiasm for what the Jurassic Worlds are selling, or at least they haven’t yet, but the people tasked with making them sure are out of ideas.\n\n-[Alison Willmore, Vulture](https://www.vulture.com/article/review-jurassic-world-rebirth-makes-dinosaur-carnage-dull.html) \n\n____________________________________________________________________________________________\n\n**PLOT**\n\nFive years after the events of *Jurassic World Dominion*, the planet's ecology has proven largely inhospitable to dinosaurs.

      "text": "I used to do SFX and my first job out of university was a shock to me because I realized motorbikes and gunshots on screen didn't sound like actual motorbikes or gunshots. I suddenly realized the studio's collection of 100 000 sound effects was useless without the experience to know which 50 effects the audience had been conditioned to accept as authentic by other films. And then there as the foleying that I helped with, in which a man kneeing a watermelon doesn't sound like a Hollywood effect, a real punch to the face doesn't sound like a Hollywood effect, but a man kneeing a watermelon with olive oil on his leg sounded \"right\" for reasons I can't explain.\n\nSomething I appreciate in the filming of movies is when the actors are actually shouting in loud environments (nightclubs, windstorms) because they're recorded in silence and the music/wind is added later. What this usually results in is the audio being loud to establish it's loud, then the SFX editor has to radically drop the levels because the actors have been recorded talking in their normal voices. I appreciate it when the director gives them directions to act like they're in a loud place. I was on a set once where the director had the actors put earplugs in so they HAD to yell (everyone in the scene had long hair or were given weird hats to hide the ear plugs).\n\nAnyways, I'm watching Bullet Train Explosion right now and they just used the Wilhelm scream for a student getting punched. I had to burst out laughing because, well, it sounds right when someone falls off a cliff, not when someone falls over a train seat.",

Their musical numbers, both duets and solos, have a vitality that the more often dour film desperately needs.\n\n[Variety](https://variety.com/2024/film/reviews/joker-folie-a-deux-review-joaquin-phoenix-lady-gaga-1236127989/) (50):\n\n>Joker: Folie à Deux may be ambitious and superficially outrageous, but in a basic way it’s an overly cautious sequel.\n\n[IGN](https://www.ign.com/articles/joker-folie-deux-review-joaquin-phoenix-lady-gaga-todd-phillips) (5/10):\n\n>Despite the best efforts of Joaquin Phoenix, Lady Gaga, and an opening hour set in Arkham Asylum, Joker: Folie à Deux wastes its potential as a movie musical, a courtroom drama, and a sequel that has anything meaningful to say about or add to the first Joker.\n\n[The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/film/article/2024/sep/04/joker-folie-a-deux-review-joaquin-phoenix-and-lady-gaga-musical-spirals-out-of-tune) (3/5):\n\n>There’s a great supporting cast and a barnstorming first act but Todd Phillips’s much-hyped Gotham sequel proves claustrophobic and repetitive\n\n[IndieWire](https://www.indiewire.com/criticism/movies/joker-folie-a-deux-review-joaquin-phoenix-lady-gaga-1235043195/) (C-):\n\n>Phillips struggles to find a shape for his story without having a Scorsese classic to use as a template, and while a certain degree of narrative torpor might serve “Folie à Deux” on a conceptual level, its turgid symphony of unexpected cameos, mournful cello solos, and implied sexual violence is too dissonant to appreciate even on its own terms.\n\n[The Wrap](https://www.thewrap.com/joker-folie-a-deux-review-lady-gaga-joaquin-phoenix/) (80):\n\n>What’s most impressive about Joker: Folie à Deux is the way Phillips willingly undercuts his own billion-dollar blockbuster. He’s looking inward. Arthur is looking inward. Hopefully the audience will too, and question why they care so much about Arthur Fleck in the first place.\r\n\n[Total Film](https://www.gamesradar.com/entertainment/superhero-movies/joker-folie-a-deux-review/) (2/5):\n\n>Unlike 2019’s Joker, a knotty film with big ideas and profound empathy for its central figure, Folie à Deux feels smaller and more insular. Gone is the sense of Arthur’s explosive transformation mirroring a Gotham City at a tipping point. The film hardly even ventures beyond the claustrophobic walls of Arkham or the courthouse. \n\n[Vulture](https://www.vulture.com/article/review-joker-folie-deux-wastes-lady-gaga.html):\n\n>Mostly, Arthur is acted upon, even when he thinks he’s seizing control — a punching bag for the world and, more importantly, for the director, who subjects the character to so many indignities that he actually stops being pitiable and starts resembling the punchline to a very long, shaggy joke. By the end of *Joker: Folie à Deux*, that joke feels like it’s on us.\n\n[The Times](https://www.thetimes.com/culture/film/article/joker-folie-a-deux-review-joaquin-phoenix-lady-gaga-sequel-05bkvdmz9) (2/5):\n\n>The director Todd Phillips said there would be no follow-up to the original, but he changed his mind  and the result is a derivative musical\n\nDirected by Todd Phillips:\n\n>Two years after the events of Joker (2019), Arthur Fleck, now a patient at Arkham State Hospital, falls in love with music therapist Lee. As the duo experiences musical madness through their shared delusions, Arthur's followers start a movement to liberate him.\n\nCast:\n\n* Joaquin Phoenix as Arthur Fleck / the Joker\n* Lady Gaga as Harleen \"Lee\" Quinzel / Harley Quinn\n* Catherine Keener as Maryanne Stewart\n* Zazie Beetz as Sophie Dumond\n* Harry Lawtey as Harvey Dent\n* Steve Coogan as Paddy Meyers",

      "text": "I recently bought Mortal Kombat 1 on sale with all the DLC and was trying to figure out who to play.\n\nI decided to go in reverse order on the character select menu which made me choose Conan first. I knew very little about the movies or character other than Arnold plays him\n\nSo after playing Conan I really started enjoying him and decided I needed to see where he came from.\n\nMy expectations were that Conan The Barbarian and Destroyer were just dumb 80s action movies and there would be a lot of violence and bravado without much substance.\n\nBoy was I wrong. Instead I found its an Epic Dark Fantasy movie with awesome music, tons of camp, and a great performance by the late James Earl Jones.\n\nBoth movies reminded me of a DnD campaign. I did not expect the movies to be so nerdy in the fantasy element. I was expecting Expendables level of dumb but instead I got Lord of the Rings movie before Lord of the Rings.\n\nI liked how the movies did little to explain things or even hype up certain moments. There's a part in Conan 1 where Conan gets crucified. Any other movie would have a super hyped up, dark and depression lead up to him getting tortured, etc.\n\nIn the actual movie, James Earl Jones says \"crucify him\" and it immediately just jumps to Conan on a tree with 0 build up.\n\nSimilarly Conan somehow sneaks into the enemy stronghold at the end with absolutely no fighting any guards and gets all the way to Thulsa Doom to kill him with 0 explanation. \n\nIt doesn't feel the need to baby the audience and I like that.\n\nConan 2 felt more like a standard fantasy adventure until the end. I did not expect the final battle to be against a giant fish monster god.\n\nMy wife and I ended up really enjoying the movies and I can tell why they are cult classics. \n\nI really enjoyed all the side Characters. Valeria was badass. Subotai was a total bro helping Conan after just meeting him. Malak made a good comedy relief while being super helpful in key moments. Zulu was a badass and had some awesome goofy facial expressions throughout.\n\nI'm glad I decided to finally watch these cult classics. Is the 2010 reboot with Jason Mamoa any good?",

So, nearly two years ago, I set out to watch every movie from Walt Disney Animation Studios (so, no live-action remakes, no made-for-TV sequels, etc.), in chronological order, to refresh my memory and fill in my blind spots. Overall, it was a wonderful experience. I ranked all of the movies on Letterboxd, and included my favorite moment from each one (usually an animated flourish, but occasionally a quote or an extended sequence). And below, I listed some good and bad surprises, and I ranked villains, vocal performances, and songs, just for fun!\n\nhttps://letterboxd.com/grant692/list/disney-ranked/\n\nGood Surprises:\n\n1. Cinderella - I really, really did not expect to come away from this with Cinderella as my favorite Disney movie and one of my favorite animated movies of all time. But it is. In my memory, it was the classic \"helpless princess, handsome prince, happily ever after\" story. Imagine my surprise when I find that it's a movie about a woman overcoming the most dreadful circumstances with kindness and humility and persistence and self-confidence. She's not immune to the weight of her terrible life, but when life gets her down, she picks her head up and gets back to solving her problems. She is a role model not just for little girls, but for all of us. AND it's beautifully animated, well-paced, and has one absolutely remarkable sequence (the transformation of everyone/everything in preparation for the ball). It's just splendid.\n\n2. One Hundred and One Dalmatians - I expected One Hundred and One Dalmatians to be relatively minor Disney, but I was blown away. From the gorgeous, painterly animation style, to the thrilling plot, to the devious villain, to the delightful side characters (Horace and Jasper are all-time great laughable lackeys)...it all just works.\n\n3. The Emperor's New Groove - I knew I was going to love The Emperor's New Groove, but not this much. It's just one amazing sight gag after another, coming in at an efficient 72 minutes (not including credits), and its blistering pace never runs out of steam. Amazing.\n\n4. Robin Hood - Robin Hood was one of my favorite Disney movies as a kid, but as an adult, I realized it didn't have the best reputation, so I wasn't optimistic going in...but I still loved it. It's fun, it's got some great music (\"Phony King of England\", especially), and a ridiculous villain+sidekick combo (Prince John and Sir Hiss).\n\n5. Atlantis: The Lost Empire - The crew could not be any more trope-y if it tried. Milo, the out-of-his-depth, nerdy scholar who the group reluctantly depends on. Rourke, the gruff, grizzled captain who clearly has ulterior motives. Helga, a young German woman and Rourke's second-in-command, who thinks she has to act all tough to look like she belongs next to her superior. Vinny, the cavalier Italian demolitions expert who just wants to run the family flower shop. Dr. Sweet, the physically imposing African-American/Native American doctor with a heart of gold. Audrey, the plucky, teenage Puerto Rican mechanic trying to impress her dad (who really wanted a son). Wilhelmina, the chain-smoking communications officer who looks and acts like she should have retired years ago. Cookie, the elderly chef of the expedition, who seems to have come from the Confederate South. Geatan Moliere, a Frenchman who goes by Mole, and also acts like a mole, and also looks like a mole. But it leans into those tropes with such affection, that I couldn't help but love it. \n\nBad Surprises: \n\n1. The Sword in the Stone - Like Robin Hood, The Sword in the Stone was one of my favorites growing up. I don't know what childhood me was thinking. The wizard duel is entertaining, but the plot is just totally inert otherwise. \n\n2. Tarzan - I didn't find the story all that interesting, nor the characters compelling. Much to my surprise, I also didn't love the music - it all sounded the same and didn't hook me whatsoever. RIP to the Phil Collins burning piano meme :(. \n\n3. Fantasia - Hailed as one of the all-time greats of Disney, I was excited...but it was too inconsistent. The Sorcerer's Apprentice is among the best things Disney has ever done, and Night on Bald Mountain is a good time...but otherwise? Couldn't find much to latch on to.\n\n4. The Black Cauldron - Yet another of my childhood favorite that I ranked lower than I'd hoped. I still probably have it higher than most, maybe due to my affinity for all things spooky and the fact that this is certainly the darkest Disney has ever gotten...but still didn't live up to expectations.\n\n5. Wish - This movie is SO bad. I skipped it in theaters when it came out a couple years ago (shortly after I started this project, actually) because of the so-so reviews, but I still thought I'd at least give it a solid 3/5 stars. But it looks terrible (like something from Disney Channel 10 years ago), the songs aren't the least bit memorable, there are no interesting characters, and the plot doesn't carry half the weight that it feels like it should. I LOVE the idea of this movie, and it fits so well into the mythology of Disney...which I think made me all the more angry at how it turned out. \n\n\nTop 10 Villains:\n\n1.

      "title": "Jojo Rabbit, a comedy about a 10 year old Nazi.",
      "text": "Jojo Rabbit\n\nA comedy about a ten year old boy who loves being a Nazi. That shouldn’t work. When I first saw Jojo Rabbit, I didn’t know much about it. All I saw was a quick summary along the lines of, “A boy in Nazi Germany towards the end of WWII discovers that his mother has been helping a young Jewish girl hide out in their attic.” I thought I was about to watch a serious drama, but then it kicks off with a little boy and his imaginary friend, Hitler, and their banter. “I guess it’s a comedy,” I told myself.\n\n\n\nThis movie is very funny. Sam Rockwell and Rebel Wilson at the youth camp are hilarious. Not only is the writing witty, the physical comedy hits the right notes of goofy. My favorite side character is Yorki. He gets to have the best lines:\n\n* “I’m going home to my mom. I need a snuggle.”\n* “Guess I’m just a kid trapped in a fat kid’s body.”\n* “Somehow I just keep staying alive.”\n* \"The Japanese are our only allies left, and between you and me, they don't really look that Aryan.\"\n\n\n\nWhat the movie does with tone throughout the runtime is what I believe makes it a great film. The first time we see Jojo looking upon people hanging in the square, and is told that what they did is what they could, this hilarious comedy lets us know that the reality of the situation is extremely bleak. We also find out that Jojo’s father is in the war, and that his mother is having the hardest time raising a young boy who has been brainwashed by the Nazis’ propaganda. When Johansson pretends that she is her husband, it really makes me feel bad that she is alone in trying to raise a boy amidst the war, a war that she hates and knows how her country is in the wrong.\n\n\n\nThe “shoes scene”, as I like to call it, may be the largest gut punch any comedy has ever put to screen. We just had seen the most tense scene, where we think that Elsa has been found out by the Gestapo, but then gets away. There is a butterfly and nice music, and it feels like maybe everything is going to be alright. But then we see the shoes. Again, how a comedy can turn the mood so fast is where this movie earns its greatness.\n\n\n\nThe dilemma Jojo finds himself in, where he wants to be a good Nazi and turn in the hiding Jewish girl, but he knows if he does so, he, and especially his mother, would be in trouble, is quite unique. If Jojo wasn’t ten years old, I don’t think this plot would work. How can we have any feelings for someone who loves Hitler? It makes me feel bad for any youth who are raised to hate others.\n\n\n\nSo how did Taika make a movie about Nazis funny? He made sure to let the audience know that Nazis are stupid. It has a repeating gag of Hitler offering him a cigarette. If you watch this movie and get nothing out of it, at least you will know, Nazis are stupid.",

Unlike several recent tuners, which tried to hide their musical dimension from audiences, “Wicked” embraces its identity the way Elphaba does her emerald skin. Turns out such confidence makes all the difference in how they’re perceived.\n\n[The Hollywood Reporter (90)](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-reviews/wicked-review-cynthia-erivo-ariana-grande-1236062372/)\n\n>Grande and Erivo give Stephen Schwartz’s songs — comedy numbers, introspective ballads, power anthems — effortless spontaneity. They help us buy into the intrinsic musical conceit that these characters are bursting into song to express feelings too large for spoken words, not just mouthing lyrics and trilling melodies that someone spent weeks cleaning up in a studio.\n\n[Deadline:](https://deadline.com/2024/11/wicked-review-cynthia-erivo-ariana-grande-movie-musical-adaptation-1236181476/)\n\n>Chu has made a movie musical (the best since *Chicago)*, even if it ends with its own “intermission” , that manages to stand on its own as a fully satisfying screen entertainment, and also serves as a delicious invitation to an upcoming second half I quite frankly can’t wait to see.\n\n[IndieWire (67)](https://www.indiewire.com/criticism/movies/wicked-review-jon-m-chu-adaptation-ariana-grande-cynthia-erivo-1235065351/)\n\n>Jon M. Chu’s Massive Musical Adaptation Defies Gravity (and Logic) to Spin a Tale Mostly for Established Fans. Ariana Grande is an absolute scream and Cynthia Erivo's voice is unparalleled, but expanding out the Broadway musical into two (very long) parts doesn't offer the opportunity for depth we were promised.\n\n[TheWrap (80)](https://www.thewrap.com/wicked-review-ariana-grande-cynthia-erivo-universal/)\n\n>The story’s playful, subversive reinterpretation of 'The Wizard of Oz' as a work of propaganda, designed to obfuscate the true story of how political dissidents and minority groups are demonized by fascist con artists who trade in theatricality instead of competence, is fully developed and still (to our collective dismay) incredibly salient.\n\n[IGN (90)](https://www.ign.com/articles/wicked-review-ariana-grande-cynthia-erivo-jon-m-chu)\n\n>Wicked is a well-oiled machine in the hands of Jon M. Chu. This film adaptation epitomizes what modern movie musicals can and should be, embracing its source material while cleverly translating it to screen. Tear-jerking performances by Ariana Grande and Cynthia Erivo make the movie, playing to their individual strengths to bring to life the rapport between Glinda and Elphaba, who’ll go on to become the good and wicked witches of Wizard of Oz fame. If as many people love this film as much as I did, Wicked will undoubtedly immortalize the Grande and Erivo in movie musical history.\n\n[The Guardian (80)](https://www.theguardian.com/film/2024/nov/19/wicked-review-cynthia-erivo-ariana-grande-wizard-of-oz-stephen-schwartz)\n\n>It’s arguable if Wicked could ever be a meaningfully persuasive prequel for the characters in The Wizard of Oz as we actually see them in the 1939 film, as this would involve cancelling their powerfully timeless, mythological aura, and instead substituting the more banal idea of human development. But this is the joke, and this is the story, and what an enjoyable spectacle it is.\n\n[BBC (3/5)](https://www.bbc.com/culture/article/20241119-wicked-review)\n\n>It might have been lighter on its feet if the editors had cut a subplot about magical talking animals, which doesn't add anything except several minutes of running time. And they could have cut Elphaba's sister, who is given perplexingly little to do. That way, the film could have been packed the whole musical into one fast-moving, satisfying entertainment. As it is, I have a strong suspicion that Wicked will work much better as the first part of a double bill, with Wicked Part 2 being shown after an interval. But we'll have to wait another year to know for sure.\n\n[Independent - UK (3/5)](https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/films/reviews/wicked-movie-review-ariana-grande-b2649890.html)\n\n>Cynthia Erivo and Ariana Grande showcase phenomenal vocal ability in this adaptation of the blockbuster musical, but they’re let down by a film that is aggressively overlit and shot like a TV advert.\n\n[Telegraph - UK (2/5)](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/films/0/wicked-review-ariana-grande-cynthia-erivo/)\n\n>Utterly exhausting and hopelessly miscast. Ariana Grande and Cynthia Erivo don’t come close to defying gravity in this bloated, beige screen adaptation of the Wizard of Oz prequel.\n\n[Total Film (100)](https://www.gamesradar.com/entertainment/musicals/wicked-part-one-review/)\n\n>A great deal of expectation and pressure had been placed on Wicked, with fans waiting decades for it to reach the screen. This makes what Chu has achieved an even greater feat, turning one of the world's most popular musicals into a cinematic phenomenon. And while Wicked is only one half of this story, it never feels incomplete. As part two will take this story to some weird, wonderful, and heartbreaking places, I cannot wait to see what he and his team accomplish. But at this rate? I don't think anything can bring them down.\n\n[Empire Magazine (80):](https://www.empireonline.com/movies/reviews/wicked/)\n\n>Chu amps up the colour and spectacle to extraordinary, almost overwhelming heights, but the real magic comes from Erivo and Grande as the frenemies at the story’s heart. \n\n[Consequence (83)](https://consequence.net/2024/11/wicked-part-1-review-cynthia-erivo/)\n\n>The film is effective at capturing what made the original musical so beloved, and in turn, will belong to a new generation of kids — those kids who might then envision themselves cathartically singing “Popular” or “Defying Gravity” on stage, just as Ariana Grande had as a child.\n\n[Collider (90)](https://collider.com/wicked-movie-review/)\n\n>The film works on an emotional level, and yet there are also well-delivered lessons about growing fascism that are tragically poignant in our American era. The set pieces are big and bold, and the dance numbers are creative and colorful. Grande is continually hilarious as the charmingly vapid Galinda, while Erivo is breathtakingly powerful as the so-called Wicked Witch. **Both Grande and Erivo sound glorious** through beautiful interpretations of modern musical classics like \"Defying Gravity.\" It all coheres into **one of the best silver screen adaptations of a musical in ages**, and easily one of the year's best pictures.\n\n[Entertainment Weekly (75)](https://ew.com/wicked-review-musical-adaptation-hits-right-notes-lacks-visual-variety-8747457)\n\n>For now, like Denis Villeneuve’s first Dune, this Wicked manages to end on a note of “to be continued” while still feeling like a complete story. If only its imagery had a little more magic!\n\n[Screenrant (90)](https://screenrant.com/wicked-movie-review/)\n\n>Save for the tiniest of things, Wicked is a worthy screen adaptation of the musical, guaranteed to make viewers feel like they could defy gravity too.\n\n[The Times - UK (80)](https://www.thetimes.com/article/d6c0c3b5-efcc-4d7e-bca6-6c98ec4e997b)\n\n>Hollywood finally delivers a worthy successor to The Wizard of Oz with this musical adaptation, starring the superb Erivo as Elphaba and a startlingly good Ariana Grande as Glinda.\n\n[Vanity Fair (80)](https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/story/wicked-movie-review)\n\n>Wicked succeeds because of some unreproducible, lightning in a bottle convergences—of director, stars, craftspeople, and high-status material. But Wicked also makes a broader case for patience and careful thought, for grand ambition honed over the course of many years. In order to defy gravity, gravity must first be understood.\n\n[iNews - UK (100)](https://inews.co.uk/culture/film/ariana-grande-wicked-review-3388833)\n\n>It joyfully expands on the source material with extended musical numbers and astute childhood flashbacks in a combination that will delight committed Ozians and newcomers alike.\n\n[San Francisco Chronicle (100)](https://datebook.sfchronicle.com/movies-tv/wicked-cynthia-erivo-ariana-grande-19901874)\n\n>Fueled by exquisite performances from Tony winner Erivo (“The Color Purple”), as Elphaba, or the Wicked Witch of the West, and Grammy winner Grande as Glinda the Good Witch, “Wicked” is the best movie musical in years, representing a rare instance when performances, visuals and songs are of equally high quality.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**SYNOPSIS:**\n\n>Elphaba, a misunderstood young woman because of her green skin, and Glinda, a popular girl, become friends at Shiz University in the Land of Oz.

      "text": "Tom Cruise seems to be winding down his death-defying era, if the rumors around MI:9 being the last one with Ethan Hunt are true. But I don't think hanging off cliffs or holding his breath for 10 mintues are his true forte. \n\nFor me, Cruise's best roles have always been men who are deeply broken and fight vigorously and belligerently to deny that reality. Collateral, Magnolia, Minority Report, Eyes Wide Shut, War of the Worlds, all of these performances, I find to be the most compelling in his career, because they all carry that contradiction of an emotionally and psychologically broken and stunted man, fighting vigorously to maintain a facade of having it together.\n\nIf Cruise is hanging up the parachutes and helicopters for good, now, I think he should look past Xenu and revive that Seminarian guilt, and maybe finally get that Oscar.",

But somehow, no matter how many times I see this movie, I never get tired of it. The scene where Steven Strait javelins the Pharaoh and shouts \"He is not a god!\" is one of my favourite movie scenes ever. Also, the music is awesome, the filming locations are gorgeous, and the miniature pyramid models used in production are fantastic. So despite the story being illogical and stupid, and the historiography being absolutely batshit, 10,000 BC will always be one of my guilty pleasures.",

      "text": "I was intrigued by something lately.\n\nNo matter how bad most films are (both critic/audience wise), I've always thought that the music made was pretty good, regardless of genre, audience or time period. If the music was made specifically for the movie, then the artist(s) put somewhat of a good enough effort into it to the point that it is one of the very few areas a reviwer can't fault. If the music was liscenced or bought, it tends to be worse, yeah, but most film scores, IMO, rarely drag the film down any worse than any other element of it.\n\nBut what are those rare, few times were the music is genuinely of itself a critique? Where the music is poorly made, poorly edited in, does not match the movies' theme at all, is too quiet, is too overbearing, makes no sense for the plot, has no sustenance or meaning, is placed in at all the wrong times, etc? \n\nAnd when this happens, who do you normally cite as responsible? The executives? The director? The musician? Whoever directly chose the music? \n\nI'm going to include SFX/ambience in as well, since even the simplest of sounds can invoke all the wrong emotions.",

Which ones come to your mind? \n\nIt's easy to think of iconic scenes made memorable by music. The scenes let down by music may be harder to recollect, no?",

      "text": "There are countless amazing soundtracks out there, but very occasionally I find movies whose soundtracks are better remembered than the film itself.\n\nI wasn’t around for the release of ‘The Big Chill’ in 1983, but I feel as though the only time I ever hear of the movie is in relation to its soundtrack, which spawned two seperate releases (including a release called ‘More Songs From The Era’).\n\nI’ve seen multiple soundtrack volumes happen occasionally (‘Trainspotting,’ for example), but rarely with films which aren’t in the frequent ‘best of’ conversations.\n\nAny others that come to mind for you? \n(Keep in mind, I’m not talking about movies whose soundtracks are simply memorable, but ones whose soundtracks outshine and seem to have outlasted mention of the film itself.)",

      "text": "I don’t like to share my opinions or preach, but this seems worthy of discussion.\n\nAfter careful consideration, I decided to cancel my Spotify Premium subscription, which I started around 2014. Over the last few years, the service shifted from a music-centric platform to something with bigger aspirations: podcasts, audiobooks, video, and even social-like elements.\n\nI get it—companies need to diversify to stay competitive in a brutally fast-paced market. But I started asking myself: how much of my subscription fee actually goes to the artists I love? The short answer is: very little, and even less if they’re not backed by a major label. Maybe you can’t stop progress, but I no longer want to be a cog in the machine, throwing money at a corporation that treats music & media like expendable assets when, instead, they're supposed to be the core of their business.\n\nAs a musician, I’ve always found it off-putting to see artists placing themselves on a moral pedestal, demanding recognition. Music is everything to me, but it’s also a hard life—one that’s cost me friends, relationships, money, and stability. Still, I thought - I’m the one who chose this path; it's my burden. I can't expect the general public to feel like they owe me in any way.\n\nThen, COVID happened, and I changed my mind. I realized how crucial art and entertainment really are to our lives. Can you even imagine those days without your favorite songs giving you comfort or movies & books keeping you company during those long days filled with nothing but uncertainty? Call it art, call it entertainment - it kept us emotionally afloat when everything else failed. The world doesn't need to fall apart for people to see the value in music, but in a way, it was the shake-up I needed to realize that the worth of art in our world is absolutely unquestionable, deserving much more than what a faceless tech corporation is willing to give. Artists deserve at least a fair chance to spend 100% of their time working on their music without the fear of constantly going under.\n\nThis isn't an attack on streaming services or people who use them, as much as it is an invitation - If you are a \"consumer\" of music (like I am) and believe artists deserve your support, consider where your money is going and who is really benefitting from it the most.",

      "text": "One of the central themes of the movie \"Sister Act\" is the fact that Whoopie Goldberg's character could easily co-opt Motown standards from female acts and turn them into Christian devotional songs with little or no changes to the lyrics. The things I noticed was that, first, since the Christian God is universally male, the songs needed to be songs from females to their male companions and, second, they had to be songs about complete devotion or being rescued by that man.\n\nSo I got to wondering, are there any modern female fronted rock bands who's songs could be co-opted the same say? Avoid the actual Christian bands and find secular bands who's songs could easily be swapped into a Catholic service as a hymn . . . and I couldn't find any. None of the modern female fronted rock bands I could think of have such songs. Some female Pop artists, but no rock artists. Not even Heart, which I thought, for sure, would have one that could be co-opted. It was an interesting shift in tone from Motown.\n\nThe closest I could come was a all male metal band. Metalica's \"Nothing Else Matters\" could perversely be turned into a Christian hymn given the correct context and gestures.\n\nCan anybody else think of any?",

I promise I'm not an AI post. But.... isn't that what one would say?), Rocket Ship by Kathy McCarty from hearing it on Futurama (I don't recommend this song, I just happen to like it), New Slang by the Shins because Zack Braff used it in his movie and I saw the trailer, and I even really like Your Man by Joji from hearing it in an episode of Invincible.

      "title": "Who would play Ozzy and the rest of the family, bandmates, friends in the inevitable movie about his life.",
      "text": "As it is well known and well documented Ozzy led a good life.  He is the godfather of metal period.  If you are into any sort of rock or heavy music he is at least partially if not completely the reason why most of the music sounds the way it does.    He was a captivating personality.  A pop culture icon, someone who whenever he had something to say about anything you knew it was going to be gold.  He was a family man behind all the craziness and loved his friends, family, bandmates and fans more than almost any musician I can think of.   He was a class act even though he was completely off the wall.  Everyone loved him and it’s safe to say even if his music didn’t resonate with you, he as a personality was infectious to watch.   My question as the post title says is he will almost definitely have a bio pic movie about his life and career.   If someone wrote a movie about the things he actually did people would say it seems too far fetched.  But it was all real.   Many of you have probably seen the dirt which is the bio pic about Motley Crue and has an actor that plays Ozzy sniffing ants poolside.   Who would you think would be a good cast in the Ozzy movie? We are talking about everyone,  bandmates,  family,  friends and Ozzy himself.   As someone who as a kid was on line 20 plus years ago to get a record singed but I was too young to know that you needed wrist bands and sign up ahead of time I found that I had traveled to the city for nothing.  I was on the outside of the ropes,  Ozzy looked over and could see the disappointment on my face and my friends.  He had us walk through after his obligations were already done.  He signed our records and chatted for a while,  he was kind,  happy,  grateful and just a wonderful person.  I have remembered that moment my whole life.   He was aware of his surroundings and had a big heart for his fans.   He did this after signing for hours on end.   I will miss him because that moment shaped my musical career and life forever.  He was a god in that moment to me.",

      "text": "Hey everyone! I’ve recently been listening to a few albums on vinyl by Dire Straits (Dire Straits, Making Movies and Brohters in Arms), and I’m absolutely hooked. But I can't quite figure out *w*hy they’re so amazing. Mark Knopfler isn’t a technically impressive vocalist, and his guitar work isn’t particularly fast or aggressive (nothing too crazy or flashy). Yet, I find myself completely mesmerized by their sound.\n\nThe way Knopfler plays guitar is so unique, almost hypnotic, with such subtlety and precision, even though it’s technically simple. His voice isn't the most powerful either, but there's something so intimate and sincere about it. And the compositions, there's a kind of storytelling and groove to their songs that I can’t quite explain, but it just works.\n\nFor those who love them, what do you think makes Dire Straits so special? What is it about their music that captures your attention so deeply despite the lack of typical rock ‘n’ roll showmanship?\n\nLooking forward to hearing your thoughts!",

Wes Anderson is known for needle drops that get people really connected to a song that might not have been massively popular before, like Elliott Smith's Needle in the Hay or Nico's These Days. Are there songs that you put on and it feels like it should be that song in a movie or TV show?\n\nFor me the song that comes to mind is [Rise by Josh Rouse](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GD8hguUm0Q4). I don't know many people who are familiar with this song but if feels very cinematic and melancholy.",

I fear we will never have his voice again, but perhaps a Writer/Producer can work around the voice and tell the story of the meager beginnings, the rocket surge to fame, and the bittersweet break up of the band, along with the arrival and rejuvination of the band with Arnell.  I think each member has a significant story to tell, but I think their personal perspective is skewed by raw emotion and pride.  Its probably not yet the time for it to come out, but I eagerly wait for it, before I leave this planet.",

I’m sure I’ve heard Kiss from a rose somewhere along the way but I seriously couldn’t have named you one song by him until a couple weeks ago. I was on a United Airlines flight and there was a Seal concert movie that piqued my interest for some reason. Long story short, I absolutely loved every minute of this performance and I’m trying to find the video or just a tracklist from that performance. I’ve listened to a few albums and compilations that I’ve loved since then but Im pretty sure there was a cool mix of hits and deep cuts at this concert so if anyone could knows this video I would be eternally grateful. It was in Europe somewhere, I think he made a joke to the audience about them speaking French and German and I believe the name of the concert series started with a “B”. He was wearing a red leather jacket and took it off at some point and was wearing a black dress shirt. The concert must’ve been post 2010 or sometime around then. The lineup was simple, just a guitarist, keyboardist, bassist, fdrummer and seal. Any help is appreciated!",

After this movie people are suddenly posting “that Irish music is alright”, “those Irish guys are onto something”. People are dancing to it on TikTok, listening to the soundtrack. I’m hoping it opens people up to other unfamiliar genres of music overtime. There’s a lot of great things to listen to out there.",

There have been some movies within the past 10 years such as Into The Spider Verse which have had original songs made for them, but other than that I can’t think of any others. Where are the Highway to the Danger Zones, Hero, or Sunflowers? I enjoyed buying the CDs for movies growing up and wish that still a thing.",

      "text": "As in, a movie you would love to see made but know it probably never will be.\n\nMine are a biopic about Ed Sullivan. He introduced Elvis and his famous hound dog dancing, America to the Beatles, and many performances of classic Broadway tunes. The rights would be a total nightmare, and it'll never happen it I would love it if it could.\n\nThe other is a movie focused on the 1968 comeback special by Elvis, where he reinvigorated his career. The documentary is good, and I loved the presentation of it in Elvis (2022), but I would love to see a full movie based on the fall and rise of Elvis in the 1960s. Good tragedy to be made too as he always wanted to be actor, but kept getting screwed over because of Tom Parker and the way of movie making no longer making money.",

      "title": "How Did the Generation that Created The Greatest Political Protest Music Embrace Trump?",
      "text": "In the 1960s and 1970s, music was a powerful tool for political expression and protest. Songs like Bob Dylan's \"The Times They Are A-Changin'\", Edwin Starr’s \"War\", and The Beatles’ \"Revolution\" became anthems for change, speaking directly to the injustices of the time — civil rights struggles, the Vietnam War, and economic inequality. These songs echoed a collective desire for progress and a better future.\n\nFast forward to today, and many members of the Baby Boomer generation—the very ones who helped create this powerful music—are now among the most ardent supporters of Donald Trump. This is especially striking considering how much of the political activism and social consciousness of the 60s and 70s was a direct reaction to authoritarianism, injustice, and the excesses of the elite.\nSome examples of iconic political songs from that era:\n\n\t•\tBob Dylan – \"The Times They Are A-Changin’\" (1964): This song captured the essence of the 1960s political shift, urging people to embrace change and fight for justice.\n\n\t•\tEdwin Starr – \"War\" (1970): A powerful anti-Vietnam War anthem that called out the horrors of conflict and questioned the motives behind it.\n\n\t•\tThe Beatles – \"Revolution\" (1968): A song that challenged the status quo and called for a revolutionary change, reflective of the broader counterculture movements of the time.\n\n\t•\tBuffalo Springfield – \"For What It’s Worth\"(1966): A protest song addressing the social unrest and growing tension in the country, often interpreted as a critique of government repression.\n\nThese songs weren’t just catchy tunes; they were calls to action, social commentary, and even direct criticism of the establishment.\nSo, here’s the question: How did a generation that pushed for progressive political change through their music end up aligning with a political figure whose rhetoric and policies seem to contrast so starkly with the values of the 60s and 70s?\n\nIs it a case of cultural nostalgia clouding their judgment? A result of shifting political landscapes? Or has there been a fundamental change in values and priorities within this group?\n\nHow can the generation that created and embraced these songs now support someone like Trump? Was it the power of the political system or the media that shifted their perspectives, or something deeper? What do you all think?",

I was looking in the comments and description when I realised that all of the songs are fucking ai. What the actual fuck. I had spent 2 hrs listening to ai junk. No wonder why I thought it sounded bland. I have nothing against ai use like chatgpt etc. But implementing ai in music and art and tricking others into listenting to it having no idea that it's ai is just fucking wrong. And now I can't even find any videos with music that isn't ai generated. Youtube has become a fucking shit show with ai taking over. It's just thousands upon thousands of ai genereated robot junk. FUCK AI.",

It was a long, quiet day so I paid more attention to the lyrics than I normally would, and it just kinda surprised me that alcohol as a topic came up more than any other theme. Plenty of songs were about nothing BUT drinking, but it comes up constantly in all sorts of songs. I simply found this normalization and glorification of alcohol strange, even though I drink alcohol myself and don't really object to it. Somewhat related, but country music culture is absolutely OBSESSED with self referential lyrics about a particular way of life. That's practically all it is.",

      "title": "My dad just passed away. You probably haven’t heard of him, but he made music that mattered.",
      "text": "Hi everyone. I’m posting here with a heavy heart. My dad, Tommy McLain, passed away this week at the age of 85.\n\nI know most of you probably haven’t heard his name before, and that’s okay. He never chased fame, but he lived for music. He was part of the swamp pop scene in Louisiana, which was music that blends R&B, country, soul, and early rock 'n' roll. In 1966, he had a hit with a cover of “Sweet Dreams” that took him onto the national charts. But his voice that was high, aching, and full of feeling was uniquely his own.\n\nEven in his 80s, he was still chasing songs. Just a couple years ago, he released his first album in over 40 years, an album called [I Ran Down Every Dream](https://tommymclain.bandcamp.com/album/i-ran-down-every-dream)*.* It featured Elvis Costello, Nick Lowe, and other legends who saw in my dad what I always did, a heart that broke wide open when it sang.\n\nWhat meant the most to me wasn’t the records or tours (though he had plenty of wild stories). It was how seriously he took the responsibility of being a songwriter. He believed music could save a person’s soul (or at least make their worst day bearable). He’d cry listening to Roy Orbison or sing harmony in the car without realizing. He was, to the very end, in love with the sound of a beautiful song.\n\nIf you’re the kind of person who likes discovering music that *feels* like something, like late night heartbreak or a warm Southern wind, you might connect with Tommy. Start with [“Sweet Dreams”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiABttoehxw&list=RDoiABttoehxw&start_radio=1&pp=ygUZc3dlZXQgZHJlYW1zIHRvbW15IG1jbGFpbqAHAdIHCQnHCQGHKiGM7w%3D%3D) or [“I Ran Down Every Dream.”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LjBWpQPWFLc&list=RDLjBWpQPWFLc&start_radio=1&pp=ygUWaSByYW4gZG93biBldmVyeSBkcmVhbaAHAQ%3D%3D) Or just listen to him sing [“Before I Grow Too Old,”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x93Lbk08gyw&list=RDx93Lbk08gyw&start_radio=1&pp=ygUiYmVmb3JlIGkgZ3JvdyB0b28gb2xkIHRvbW15IG1jbGFpbqAHAdIHCQnHCQGHKiGM7w%3D%3D) and you’ll hear a man holding back time with every note.\n\nThanks for letting me share this here. I know this subreddit is filled with people who live and breathe music, just like my dad did. I think he would’ve loved knowing his songs were still out there, waiting to be found.\n\n  \nEDIT: Thank you everyone for the overwhelmingly kind support of my dad's music. I'm gonna copy below this message someone asked about how to best support my dad's music:\n\nI would recommend Bandcamp since they are the most artist-friendly of all music platforms\n\nHere's his album I Ran Down Every Dream: [https://tommymclain.bandcamp.com/album/i-ran-down-every-dream](https://tommymclain.bandcamp.com/album/i-ran-down-every-dream)\n\nAnd here's my dad's long-lost psychedelic gospel album Moving to Heaven (a bit too on the nose now but still one of my favorites of his): [https://tommymclain.bandcamp.com/album/moving-to-heaven](https://tommymclain.bandcamp.com/album/moving-to-heaven)",

      "text": "In the 1960s, music was a major part of the cultural conversation. Anti-war and anti-Nixon songs topped the charts. In the 1980s, huge artists like Springsteen, Mellencamp, and Billy Joel were openly singing about the struggles of the working class and the effects of globalization.\n\nNow, in the 2020s, we've lived through a global pandemic, mass protests for racial justice, extreme political polarization, economic shifts like tariffs and inflation, etc., but where’s the music reflecting all that?\n\nIt feels like there's way less mainstream music engaging with these themes, or at least it's not getting the same attention. Has protest music gone underground? Are artists more hesitant to speak out? Has music's role in culture shifted?\n\nCurious what others think. Is it just me not aware of this music, or has something changed?",

      "text": ">\"I think the music industry is a tough one these days, and for people who are recording in it, the rewards are not justifiable. The rich and the powerful have siphoned off the majority of this money. I was lucky to be part of the golden years when there was a much better share going to the musicians, so I support anything that could be done to make that easier. The working musician today has to go out and play live – they can’t survive any other way. They won’t do it by the recording process and that’s a tragedy because that is not encouraging new music to be created. It’s not the greatest era that the world has been through, as gradually all the work moves to robots and AI, and the amount of people creaming off the money gets smaller and smaller and they get richer and richer.\"\n\nFull article:\n\n[https://www.theguardian.com/music/2024/oct/03/david-gilmour-the-rich-and-powerful-have-siphoned-off-the-majority-of-music-industry-money](https://www.theguardian.com/music/2024/oct/03/david-gilmour-the-rich-and-powerful-have-siphoned-off-the-majority-of-music-industry-money)",

The ability to express music and/or lyrics that you have heard in your head and want to play is a very human thing, over Millenniums (that’s 1000s of years, though the early stuff was pretty basic). All of the great classic music of the past 4 Centuries has been made this way. Music is a very human artistic means of communication.\n\nDo You want to listen to machine invented music rather than human music that is driven by our emotions, experiences, and knowledge of the language that is music? Not I, no thank you.\n\nIf you are not capable of being a Real musician who can compose or play a real instrument, don’t feel bad and try to fake it with AI, just enjoy the enormous body of work that other humans’ are inspired to produce and play; those human musicians need your support more than ever with the lack of living income that streaming pays.\nAI does seem to be good at performing many but not all Google searches, summing up your question nicely. I still do however look at all the links shown below an AI-generated summary, which take you to real research details or comments - made or undertaken by humans.",

I still can tell when videos aren't real, I still can see a picture and somehow see that it was created by AI, but there are already millions of people who can't. Recently, it was news that this AI band is quickly rising on streaming services. I had no intention to hear it, although I ended up hearing a few seconds on social media. It felt soulless and generic, but in a way some human music does. And I asked myself: will I be able to recognize if a song was created by Ai in 5 years? In 10 years? Or if I'll be able to tell if a video is real, or an audio excerpt or picture is real? That's kinda scary and I don't know the answer. I'd like to hear your opinion on this.",

He’s also in a band that plays covers of older songs so he’s only really surrounded by older music. He’s very much of the idea that music today sucks and that there’s nothing good releasing anymore. I’ve shown him artists from the 2010’s like Tame Impala and Mac Demarco but he doesn’t seem to think they’re anything special. what would be some albums that could win him over?",

Like you get the visual and the sound together, and more importantly you can't just stop the way you can stop reading a book, which is a more intentional and active activity.\n\nHe used the example of the movie Psycho and also Requiem for a Dream, saying a book could never be as intense because authors can't do visual tricks and use music the way those movies do.\n\nI don't agree but can't think of any examples to counter that. Where do you stand? Can you think of any examples where a book can match movies in terms of being upsetting and disturbing?",

Some can visualize it, some can't, some people have to literally read every word with their inner voice, and others can read words silently (hard to explain).\n\nI honestly thought everyone reads like me, since everyone I know does it similar to me (maybe it's more common this way). I can visualize a movie in my head pretty clearly (with crappy frame rate), and I can 'hear' dialogue in the characters' voices in my head when the are speaking. I don't hear the narrator though, I just imagine it like a movie.\n\nI would say that I can feel, smell and taste things in a book but that's bullshit lol",

I always thought the series was lame so I never cared for the pop culture surrounding it. \n\nI made a previous post about not liking Hermione when I was reading the books and that was I believe after finishing the prisoner of azkaban and the whole crookshank and that rat fight. But after finishing the book I realise they have all had their insufferable moments since they are teens. Actually them being annoying little shits to each other made them more endearing to me cause they felt like real teenagers. \n\nI kept some notes for each book in my notes app that I will copy down below. I don’t think I will be watching the movies. I remember finishing the goblet of fire book and deciding to just watch that one and being slightly disappointed that they left out Winky. I feel like my favourite parts will probably not make it into the movies, like I need Kreacher in the movies. \n\nMy favourite book has to be between the Prisoner of Azkaban and The Halfblood Prince. I went from thinking Sirius was some super crazy terrifying thug to him being my favourite character.\n\nRandom notes while reading:\n\nGoblet of Fire thoughts:\n- Love what was done with Winky \n- It took them a very long time to get to the Hogwarts part in the book, that kind of annoyed me.\n- Strange that Mrs. Weasley was cold towards Hermione after the rumours by that Skeeter woman spread\n- Poor poor poor Cedric, teared up thinking about his classmates\n- The romance thing is not for me, I wish it wasnt there between the gang\n- My heart absolutely broke for Neville. He has gone through so much, I actually cried again damn it.\n- At no point did I suspect mad-eye moody to be the person behind putting Harry’s name in the Goblet. Well played, very well played. But from now on im suspecting every defence against the dark arts teacher.\n\nOrder of the Phoenix Thoughts:\n- I felt so sad for Harry, he felt like everything and everyone was against him. Dumbledore was ignoring him and leaving him in the dark and the Ministry was being evil to him.\n- I really like Luna, she is so whimsical and so herself.\n- Umbridge needs to go to hell. \n- Weirdly enough, I always liked Percy cause he reminded me of myself (overachiever because feels overshadowed and invisible due to big family). I just cannot bring myself to hate him cause I understand him.\n- Umbridge is a fascist.\n- Meeting Neville in the hospital BROKE ME.\n- Snape’s going to hell because why are you beefing with a teenager because you hated his daddy.\n- Admittedly, I never cared about any parts with Grawp or Hagrid’s trip with the giants.\n- I love that they have to sit exams and also do a lot of normal student stuff. Hermione reminds me of myself back then and it is all just nostalgic.\n- Sirius dying RUINED ME. I loved that Harry finally had someone to call his close family 😫. \n\nHalf-Blood Prince Thoughts\n- Romance between the gang was full on in this book. I didn’t mind it actually, comes with the age. \n- Shout-out to Slughorn, I was waiting for a Slytherin who wasnt evil. I really wish we had more likeable slytherins\n- Ginny is cool af. \n- I loved going through memories, those parts were so fun to read especially getting Voldemort’s backstory.\n- Dumbledore’s death has shook me up. I was CONVINCED this book was going to give us a Snape redemption story. That man is sick and evil, he has been rude to Harry for all of the books. \n\nDeathly Hallows Thoughts\n- Kreacher and Regulus story is hella dark omg… I feel so bad for Kreacher\n- How the hell is any parent still sending their kids to Hogwarts?? \n- I love the name of Luna’s dad, Xenophilius Lovegood is an awesome name. \n- When Remus Lupin came to the Black house where the gang was hiding and he was acting strange, I was convinced he was just an undercover death eater. That’s why I thought Harry was picking a fight with him.\n- Dobby’s death and burial made me cry, Harry getting the last horcrux from the snitch aan having all his deceased loved ones around him as he walked to his death made me cry. Neville’s grandmother being proud of him and joining him in battle made me cry.\n- Ron is my favourite character, he is just so real. If I was heavily injured wearing a depression necklace while starving and camping in the rain in freaking England, I would lose all my shit as well. i teared up when he came back. \n- This book actually scared me in certain parts ngl. Them dementors and death eaters lurking everywhere… very scary.\n- Snape was actually a double agent all time… He was still a dick to Harry but I guess he just really couldnt see past the fact that Harry reminded him of James. & Dumbledore was already on borrowed time… well played JK Rowling, well played. \n- Harry saying Voldemort’s name and them then getting caught because of that pissed me off so bad. \n- Kreacher leading an army of elfs against Voldemort had me laughing but also so heartwarming\n- Admittedly since finding out that Neville and Harry were both born in the same month and that Neville also lost his parents… since book 4 that the plot twist would be that Neville was actually the chosen one and the one to defeat Voldemort. \n- Bellatrix LeStrange dying at the hands of mrs. weasley only feels right. \n- Making Teddy Lupin an orphan is ice cold…",

Often they’d even expand on the lore, like the Home Alone novel which finally explains why the McAllisters are so rich.\n\nSo whatever happened to these? Did the increasing accessibility of home media make them obsolete? Did they ever sell that well in the first place? I’ve never heard anyone talk about this.",

      "text": "Lately I've checked out some books from the library because they were showing up at the top of the library's \"popular\" list, only to read them and find out that they're possibly the worst books I've read in the last few years.\n\nBooks like \"Tomorrow, and Tomorrow, and Tomorrow\" are hugely popular, but I was bored out of my mind and couldn't stand the characters. I'm also currently reading \"The Heaven and Earth Grocery Store\", another popular book, and I just find it so ungodly boring, with far too many characters to keep track of and very little of note happening, as the characters in the book just seem to be living their daily lives with little plot development.\n\nSo... why is this? It's not even just that the recent books I've read are mediocre, they're actively dull to read. If you look at other forms of media, you don't really have this problem. Popular movies may not always be the *best*, but they at least have a level of production quality that makes them enjoyable to watch. Popular TV shows have complex characters and thrilling narratives.\n\nSo why is it so hard to find good books? I see that a lot of popular books tend to be about romance, but even though I'm a guy, I'm not necessarily opposed to romance novels. Still, every time I try reading one, I find it to be terrible.\n\nI have more luck when I filter by sci-fi or history, but I really dislike limiting myself to certain genres, so it's hard to branch out without quickly retreating into my comfort zone. So what is it? Why are so many awful books bestsellers?",

      "title": "Harrison Bergeron by Kurt Vonnegut is one of the most important short stories ever written and everyone should read it.",
      "text": "It’s seven pages long, under 3,000 words can be read in less than 10 minutes and is eerily poignant for the present time.\n\nWiith the increasing power of AI, stories like these  become something like prescient beings themselves, fully aware of our own reality and how the human condition conducts itself. This is the mark of a brilliant satirical story, as time presses on, we find more and more instances of their power in the everyday. Harrison Bergeron to is set in the dystopian future where no one is allowed to be smarter, better looking or in any sense more able than anyone else. Equality laws are enforced by ugly masks for those who are too beautiful, and if anyone uses their brain to think too hard they are equipped with a government transmitter--- a mental handicap that every twenty seconds sends out a sharp noise to keep people from “taking unfair advantage of their brains.\"\n\nSomething like a government transmitter in this story is literal, but it could also something figurative in our every day---how often are own thoughts interrupted by text messages, e-mails, tik tok reels, and all sort of sounds to remind us to change our focus and keep us from thinking in anything but short bursts?\n\nIt’s one reason why Vonnegut is considered a genius along with his distinctive style, and there’s perhaps no better example of this than the opening sentence of this story--it is fundamentally brilliant in its double meaning, and construction:\n\n\"The year was 2081, and everybody was finally equal. They weren’t only equal before God and the law. They were equal every which way. Nobody was smarter than anybody else. Nobody was better looking than anybody else. Nobody was stronger or quicker than anybody else. All this equality was due to the 211th, 212th, and 213th Amendments to the constitution, and to the unceasing vigilance of The United States Handicapper General.” \n\nI don’t believe AI is capable of writing a sentence like this opening. At least currently. It’s snarky, it's thought provoking, it's unique as well as concise and interesting sentence structure that has foreshadowing, establishes context, and has depth and real human thought behind it. AI currently is incapable of providing things like subtext or anything beyond the literal such as what we may call reading and writing between the lines.\n\nThe story of Harrison Bergeron is a satire and a nightmare. It is set in a world where human thought, human intellect and beauty may be strictly enforced by the government. And what makes a good satire effective is that it is often only a few degrees from our own reality. The story is an exaggeration of the effects of removing all the things that make the individual unique, or in a sense devaluing human beings and the human soul---being shaped by our detriments, finding beauty in them, using them to succeed, or simply having the right at birth to be who we are without government overreach or willingly giving something such as our own intellect and ability away for the sake of equality. In this instance equality does not mean everything improves, it means we all meet at the bottom, unable to think for ourselves or have any advantage. Yes, things are equal now, but only in the sense that everyone thinks, feels, looks and acts the exact same at the bottom of the barrel in terms of IQ and ability. \n\nThe ending of this story is horror. And reading it I am reminded of things such as the improvement and willingness to give our most wonderful and beautiful things like  our mind, our music, our stories, our paintings, our art, and in essence our own human individuality to AI to create these things for us. In Harrison Bergeron it is government overreach which has decided thinking too hard about anything for too long is too much of an advantage for the average person. The irony is that in our own reality,  many are more than willing already to give up human thought for the natural convenience of having AI think and make decisions for us. \n\nThere may be a point where the ability of AI becomes indistinguishable from reality. It’s why stories like Harrison Bergeron are so vital. We are still in the  infancy of AI, and stories such as these, are not just a poignant reminder---they are a fair warning that right now we are still capable of decisions. We still have the intellectual advantage, however whether this ability is taken by never ending regulation or willingly outsourced---it means the plug has been pulled on humanity.  \n\nI believe it's essential reading for anyone living today, and there's much more in this story I have not even touched. But I've always remembered it since high school and am always amazed by it's brevity and genius. I think it is as important as a novel like 1984 or Farenheit 451 and it's completes this in seven pages.\n\nThoughts on this story and reading it today?",

Some might argue that he's always had trouble (infamous IT scene as a glaring example), but after so many 1930-50s-type references coming from kids' mouths I just started rolling my eyes.\n\nOne kid makes a \"this is another nice mess you got me in,\" jab at another like it's something people do every day, which is from 1930s Laurel and Hardy. Another instance has a teen casually saying something like, \"like Lon Chaney dancing with the Queen,\" either from the 1941 The Wolf Man movie or more likely the 1970s Werewolves of London song.\n\nMaybe I'm wrong, but do kids and teens know Laurel and Hardy references? Was The Wolf Man or Waren Zevon still on some people's radar like it's second nature when Obama was president (which is when the book takes place)?\n\nJust wanted to rant, because it's the biggest thing that kept taking me out of the story to Google references to understand where these kids got their lingo.",

I've seen a few movies based on them but I don't remember much about them.  Most of what I know about Dan Brown is through pop-culture osmosis, but that was enough to know at least roughly what The Da Vinci Code was about.\n\nAnd at the time, it was huge.  Everyone was reading and talking about that book, and most of what I heard seemed to be positive.  It kickstarted a new wave of interest into both Leonardo Da Vinci and the holy bloodline theory, and to a lesser extent, other conspiracy theories.\n\nBut decades later, things have changed.  Now the world laughs at and parodies this guy.  As someone who was mostly out of the loop, what happened?  I know there was a backlash against his work among religious organizations, but lots of things get a backlash from such organizations and most of them don't have their clout eroded by such backlashes.  So was it just that his subsequent books were bad?  That his writing was always bad and only the intriguing subject matter saved it?  That eventually historians caught up and debunked his claims?\n\nShare your thoughts on this, here.",

Maybe book like this are all a sign of a writer who is not confident in themself, somebody who thinks that if they're not entertaining the reader, if they're not shocking or hilarious or weird or disgusting, they will lose the reader. Because unlike with a movie, it's much easier to DNF a book. Reading a book requires a lot more effort than passively absorbing a movie.\n\nSo I kind of get it. But it doesn't make reading any more pleasant. In the beginning, yes, I mean it's like junk food. Can't resist it initially, but eventually you want a real meal.

It kind of spoiled my day yesterday after reading about the courtroom trial. Maybe I wouldn’t have had such a reaction a few years ago. A few years ago Obama was elected and I felt like maybe this country was becoming less bigoted. I had hope. Unfortunately Obama’s election caused a huge portion of our country to lose their minds and now we are seeing the ugliest manifestations of racism on the rise. I loved the book. One of the best I’ve ever read and I recommend it to everyone. But it also made me feel sick. Can we humans ever rise above this insanity?",

      "title": "I've spent 2024 reading modern and classical sci-fi - here are some reviews",
      "text": "At the beginning of 2024, I’ve decided to try my hand at an (almost) completely new genre for me,  science fiction. Previously I’ve mostly read fantasy and historical fiction, so most of these books were completely new to me. In total, I’ve read 31 books from 13 series in 2024.  \n\nAnd since I’ve read so much sci-fi in a relatively short time, I thought it’d be fun for me to summarize my reading year and review each book/series I’ve read. Hopefully some of you will find it helpful when searching for some sci-fi to read.  \n\nI’ve tried to get a good collection of classical and modern titles included, as well as some non-western works. I’ll try to avoid spoilers; however, I consider a book’s main premise and plot points that could be on the back cover fair game - so if you want to go into these books completely blind, don’t read further.  \n\nSo here are my reviews (in reading order):  \n\n- **Dune (Frank Herbert), up to Children of Dune**  \nDune (series) is a fantastically unique story that tries to balance between philosophy, sociology, political commentary, and telling a good story. It does a good job with this balancing act for a long time, however, the later we go in the books, the more philosophical and abstract it gets to the expense of the story and readability. **8/10**  \n\t* **Dune** is the best Herbert does with the above-mentioned balancing act. Want a good war story? – you got it; a discussion about how myths form? – says no more; looking for political intrique? – got you fam. However, it has its flaws, as there are storylines that lead nowhere, and the ending feels very rushed (e.g. does anyone remember that >!Paul had a son who died before Leto II?!<), and the prose itself can be quite janky. **8/10**  \n\t* **Dune Messiah** is my favorite book of the series – it’s very rare to see a writer tackle the story of their hero after their hero won. Winning an empire is one thing, but governing it? The dealing with the inertia of bureaucracy, the dogmatization of a new religion, where even the all-powerful emperor can feel trapped in his role are all wonderfully shown. Here’s where Herbert’s political commentary and sociological approach really shine. **9/10** \n\t* **Children of Dune** is the one where Herbert becomes very self-indulgent with his own philosophy. There are passages that felt like he was just writing for himself. Possibly I’m not smart enough for this book, but by the end all the abstract, overcomplicated philosophizing was just too much for me and took away my desire to read further in the series. **6/10** \n\n- **Hyperion Cantos (Dan Simmons)**  \nHyperion Cantos reads more as two separate series than one (the first two Hyperion books vs. the later Endymion books), so I’ll give separate scores for them. The Hyperion books are fantastic sci-fi, with deep characters, massive (even if sometimes quite confusing) worldbuilding, and a deep message about humanity’s connections with empathy, poetry and religion. **9/10**  \nThe Endymion books, on the other hand, seemed to lack almost everything that was positive about the first two books – it’s hard to believe that they were written by the same author. The characters were either passive or uninteresting, the narrative slow and boring. The only redeeming quality is that the themes of Hyperion are expanded into a conclusion. My advice is, read Hyperion, Fall of Hyperion and don’t read further. **5/10**  \n\t* **Hyperion** was the book that actually convinced me to start reading more sci-fi. The mystery, the suspense, the characters are all so great. There were sections where I felt my heart racing. There were sections that made me choke up. Even when I wasn’t reading the book, I couldn’t stop thinking about it. Sure, there is some weird stuff in there, but I can completely overlook that for the reading experience this book has given me. **10/10** \n\t* **The Fall of Hyperion** expands the world with more politics, more characters, more transendency, and more mindf-ckery. In the end it becomes a little bit too much, and (despite a Matrix architect-like scene) the reader can get lost in all the layers of the story. However, the main story is brought to a satisfying conclusion, the characters elegantly complete their arcs, and so the book as a whole becomes a worthy sequel of the first one. **9/10** \n\t* **Endymion**, in turn, is not a good book. After all the colorful characters of Hyperion, our protagonist here has no motivation to be in the story, no real agency (he’s being told by a clairvoyant what he has to do and just does that) and barely any noticeable traits (except for surviving things that shouldn’t be survivable and than whining about it). In addition, the weird factor is much more noticeable than it was in Hyperion (e.g. >!a 13 year old clairvoyant girl tells the protagonist (25+) guy that they’re gonna shower together in the future!<). There are a few story threads that are interesting, but the main story is just really isn’t good. **4/10** \n\t* **The Rise of Endymion**, while definitely better than the 3rd book, isn’t a return to form. Thankfully, the themes of Hyperion come back and we get a final conclusion, which I actually enjoyed. But to get there, the reader has to chew through pages and pages of annoying characters, boring descriptions, and plots that go nowhere (there was a point during reading when I realized I could’ve skipped the last 100 pages I’ve read and it wouldn’t have made a difference). In addition, much of the ending of Fall of Hyperion is retconned, which is always annoying, especially when done in a story that is subpar to the original. **6/10**  \n- **Foundation (Isaac Asimov)** *incl. Foundation Trilogy, Foundation’s Edge, Foundation and Earth*  \nThe oldest series on this list, I can see how Foundation is truly a foundational (heh) precursor to all modern sci-fi. Its main idea (psychohistory, essentially completely predictive sociology) is unique to this day in its adaptation, the way it drives the narrative, and is as relevant as ever. As stories, the books have better and worse parts, and some aspects of the books became understandably antiquated. But even with these flows, the idea of psychohistory and its implications stay with me to this day. **8/10**  \n\t* **Foundation** is a tricky book to review. It’s more of a demonstration of an idea rather than a story. The main idea (psychohistory) behind the series is such a unique and interesting concept that it keeps popping into my mind even though I finished the series more than 6 months ago. However, as the book is basically just a vessel for this idea, there’s barely any narrative structure, things are just happening without much suspense or conflict (everything just happens as predicted) and so it really doesn’t work as a story. **7/10**  \n\t* **Foundation and Empire** fixes most of the issues of the first book, as we get a much more compelling story, and Asimov thankfully steps out of the ‘everything happens as predicted’ flow, which addresses the main problems with the first book. The characters are still a bit bland, but everything else is great. **9/10**  \n\t* In **Second Foundation** Asimov once again subverts his own prediction-based idea, but now it turns out that instead of things not happening as predicted, we’re not privy to all the things that were predicted – which I found a very fun new way of adding suspense. Storywise, it’s mostly compelling, however, I found it a little bit less interesting than the 2nd book. **8/10**  \n\t* **Foundation’s Edge**, published 29 years after the original trilogy, and its sequel are the most story-driven books of the series. However, even though the story is compelling, the characters are still kind of meh. The ideas of the book noticeably become less science and more fiction as telepathy, extrasensory abilities and hive minds get introduced. This is a change I’m not sure I like, as the idea of the relentless mathematical approach of psychohistory is what made the original trilogy so unique. **7/10**  \n\t* **Foundation and Earth** is a direct sequel to Foundation’s Edge in characters, tone and story, so it has similar strengths and weaknesses. It ties up the story of Foundation nicely and provides some much-needed answers and closure – with a little bit of question mark at the end for flavor. But to be honest, besides the ending, not much of what happened in the book stuck with me. **7/10**   \n- **To Sleep in a Sea of Stars (Christopher Paolini)**  \nTo Sleep in a Sea of Stars is a decent read. It doesn’t offer anything groundbreaking, but I don’t get the feeling it wanted to. It doesn’t sell itself as being any more than a regular space adventure, with a few cool new ideas (e.g. ship minds and the FTL science is very well thought out). My biggest criticism of the book is that in the narrative, things always happen very conveniently for our protagonist, and the plot points are tied together quite randomly (we go to a setting, find out information about where to go for the next setting, where we find out where to go next, etc.). The rest (worldbuilding, characters, etc.) are fine, but nothing amazing. **6.5/10**  \n- **Remembrance of Earth's Past/Three Body trilogy (Liu Cixin)**  \nWhat a fantastic series of books this is. It really is my favorite series I’ve read all year. It provides such a unique and unnerving notion of what might be _out there_ that the reader just can’t help but feel a sense of existential dread and anxiety, and that’s just one of the extremely well-presented ideas of the books. Sure, there are things that can be criticized, like characters being just vessels for the story rather than real people, and that the author has some weird thoughts on masculinity, but for me that’s nothing compared to the sheer genius of these books. Liu Cixin also masterfully increases the scale of the story throughout the series, seamlessly transitioning from a planet-wide crisis to a universe-wide one – this is not a feat many can pull off. **10/10**  \n\t* In **The Three-Body Problem** the series starts off slow with a mystery and the investigation into the mystery, which I think is a little over-dragged (we know, it's >!aliens!<). However, as the narrative builds up, it becomes more and more engaging, but the best stuff is later in the series. **8/10**  \n\t* One of the absolute peaks of my reading year, **The Dark Forest** is an extremely captivating book. When your mind tries to solve the problems proposed by the book in your sleep, you know it’s something special. The concepts of the first book are broadened and more are added to it, along with a sense of existential dread. The twists are excellent, so it works better as a story than the first one as well. **10/10** \t\n\t*   By **Death’s End**, when one thought the main topics were already added, some of the most unique science fiction concepts are introduced in the third book (e.g. >!life itself changes the whole universe, with civilizations slowing the speed of light and decreasing the number of dimensions!<). The scale of the narrative is also masterfully grown into a universe-wide, end-of-spacetime story, without making the earlier, smaller scale insignificant. The only thing that bugged me a little is that the first quarter of the book is set in the past (compared to the 2nd book), so it took a while for the story to get to the really interesting part. **9/10**  \n- **The Expanse (James S. A. Corey)**  \nI’m not going to review all 9 books of the series individually, mainly because it’d be too long, and the books aren’t that different in quality. Sure, there are somewhat worse and better parts, but the series maintains a consistent quality throughout the books. And what quality is that? I’d say that The Expanse is a very good series, with only a few things in the way of being one of the best. The worldbuilding, the characters, the politics, the sociology of marginalized groups and the presentation of humanity’s desire to mess with everything are all amazing. However, the plot itself is very individual-focused to the point of unbelievability, given that we’re talking about a handful of individuals driving everything in the whole solar system throughout the series. The authors seem to be conscious about this and try to adjust during the series (e.g. >!by lampshading from the ‘white guy saves everything’ trope!<), but even when they try to introduce society-wide tragedies, they fail to show the effects on the people in general, and in the end, all big events come down to just a few (and what’s more unrealistic, the same) people. But, if the reader can suspend their disbelief about this one aspect, they are in for a real treat of a sci-fi that’s rich, keeps up the quality through its course and sticks the landing. **8.5/10**  \n- **Children of Time (Adrian Tchaikovsky)**  \nThe series deals with a lot of ideas not found in other books – specifically alternative biological and technological evolution, effects of a species’ inherent qualities on its societal structures, in-group and out-group behaviors and so on. It brings in all these concepts quite seamlessly, without overcomplicating (at least until book 3) or overexplaining. A very interesting read, however, most of these ideas are already introduced in book 1, and there’s not very much added by the later books. The author tries to switch it up in book 3, but that doesn’t quite work out. Book 1 is a must-read; the later ones are more like optional. **8/10**  \n\t*  **Children of Time** has so many unique, original concepts that it’s hard to list them all (I tried including a few above), an absolutely thrilling read, and I didn’t feel like the themes and ideas cannibalize the story itself, which is quite rare. The only criticism I have is that the human story is not that engaging, and I always wanted to get back to the non-human evolution part. **9/10** \n\t*  **Children of Ruin** is very similar in its story, themes and ideas to the first one. We have a different species for alternative evolution and a different threat to it, but all the beats are the same. To be honest, I found this book quite unnecessary after the first one, even if it has a few cool new things. **7/10** \n\t*  **Children of Memory** is Tchaikovsky’s attempt to switch up the series, however, he went in a direction that doesn’t really work. The story becomes super-convoluted, especially thanks to the author’s desire to drag things out and not provide a clear explanation of what’s happening. This drags on for a while, so in the end, when we get some answers, the reader is already frustrated enough that the answers aren’t satisfying. There are few new cool themes (e.g. what intelligent life is exactly), but not enough to save the book. **5.5/10** \n- **Project Hail Mary (Andy Weir)**  \nProject Hail Mary is the Marvel movie of sci-fi books, with all the pros and cons of a Marvel movie. While it’s definitely a fun read that’s well paced and clever (and there’s no doubt it’s at the top of the game in these aspects), there’s not much beneath the surface. The aliens are friendly and quippy (with a remarkably quick understanding of human handsigns), the problems can always be solved and the sacrifices are never long-lasting. It’s a fun book, but it won’t change your life.  **7.5/10**  \n- **Solaris (Stanisław Lem)**  \nA very interesting book, Solaris explores the limits of human understanding and our inability to cope with these limits. It shows our habit of forcing our own reasons and desires onto things so alien that such efforts are completely meaningless. This is a very original concept, not found in many western books. In western literature, usually even alien life-forms have some sort of human-like reasoning or at least reasoning that’s understandable by us, or analogous to something we know. Not in the case of Solaris, which is what makes it so unique. As a story, Solaris works well enough in the first half of the book, after which it felt like the author lost his interest in the human-story and focused completely on dry descriptions of humanity’s futile attempts to understand Solaris. There’s barely a real ending to the story, which might underline the idea of our limits of knowledge, but it ultimately results in a less engaging narrative. **7.5/10**  \n- **Roadside Picnic (Arkady and Boris Strugatsky)**  \nProbably the most depressing book I’ve read all year, and that’s what makes it so good. It deals with humanity’s insignificance (hence the title: our civilization-altering event might have been just a roadside picnic for the aliens that caused it), but more than that, it is saturated with an extreme sense of negative individualism. This radiates from the whole book, where there are barely any genuine connections, every person just wants to use the other, and people barely know themselves as they don’t even have the capabilities to stop and think about this tragedy and their place in it. Even though the story isn’t the most straightforward (it reads more as a series of short stories with mostly the same protagonist), the themes are so strong that it comes together into a very strong narrative. **10/10**  \n- **House of Suns (Alastair Reynolds)**  \nHouse of Suns is a book of mostly wasted potential. It has so many interesting ideas, but almost all of them come to nothing. Let me give you an example: our protagonists are part of a group that is made up of hundreds of clones that all belong to the same guild-like society, follow the same rules, etc. Now this could be a very interesting idea to explore: how would people that are so similar behave in a group? Could they communicate without even saying a word? Would they feel an extreme sense of loyalty to one another? How would this experience differentiate them from regular humans? So imagine my disappointment when we meet a group of these clones, and they are just a bunch of guys. They could be just some people who kind of know each other. And this is just one concept that sounds genius but fails at the execution. The narrative itself is quite jagged as well, as we go from a regular sci-fi story to a murder mystery to a cross-space chase, without really concluding any of the previous story threads. However, the ideas of the books are really good, so it’s worth a read. **7/10**  \n- **Various George R. R. Martin sci-fi short stories** *incl. A Song for Lya, This Tower of Ashes, And Seven Times Never Kill Man, The Stone City, Bitterblooms, The Way of Cross and Dragon, Meathouse Man, Sandkings, Nightflyers*  \nI was really interested in GRRM’s sci-fi stories, as I’m a big fan of A Song of Ice and Fire, and I wanted to see if there was anything in his earlier writings that is just as good. Happy to report that if you didn’t read his short stories, you didn’t miss much. There are some cool ideas here and there (Song for Lya, Sandkings, both of which I’d recommend), and some honestly insane ones (looking at you, Meathouse Man), but overall they mostly miss the mark. Most of them are not bad (except for This Tower of Ashes and maybe Bitterblooms), but you definitely won’t get the same satisfaction as from ASOIAF. One thing that bugged me is that GRRM’s sci-fi universe was a typical American-naïve sci-fi world (biologically very different alien species at mostly the same technological level living in relative peace, with humanity being a relatively important part of the galactic society), and honestly I hoped for a more nuanced world-building from him.  \n- **Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep? (Philip K. Dick)**  \nThe book raises the question of where the dividing line is between artificial intelligence and humans – which is a question that is as relevant now as ever it has ever been. On a broader scale, it deals with nature vs. technology and the human desire for actual, real nature that’s contrasted with our tendency to forgo nature for the conviniance of technology. These themes are really well done, even if these topics are dealt with in more up-to-date (and so for us, more relevant) fiction like Westworld and Ex Machina. Overall, the story is quite good - even if the prose gets confusing at times -, especially the aspect of the reader not being sure who is and who isn’t an android. My biggest gripe with the book is the whole Mercerism aspect, which felt very on-the-nose and a forced way to provide a philosophical element, which I didn’t think the book needed. **8/10**   \n- **Metro (Dmitry Glukhovsky)**  \nMetro is difficult to review as a series, as the individual books are written in such a different style that even how the world functions isn’t consistent between the books. The author lampshades this in-story by having the books written by different characters with different motivations, and by the end, this unreliable narrative builds into one of the main themes of the series, which I can respect. But. This also complicates the reading experience – what can be trusted? What actually happened, and what was made up? Are the themes covered in the book the themes the author really wants to explore, or are they just the themes of the character that wrote them in-story? And I know that the author probably wants us asking these questions, but I’m not sure how I feel about having a storyline I was previously invested in made meaningless later. It feels a little bit like (but to the author’s credit, it’s not as infuriating as) the ‘it was all a dream’ trope. It also makes it hard to interpret the books – are the lazy fantasy tropes of the first book a metacommentary about the ‘Hero’s journey’ stories, or are they just lazy fantasy tropes – or did they start as such and later they are retconned into metacommentary? All these make it challenging for the reader to enjoy a story just for the story.  \nOne thing that is consistently amazing, however, is the worldbuilding – it is by far the best and most unique of all the sci-fi books I’ve read, even if the world itself is inconsistent. Other than this, (and taken at face value, not worrying about the metaness of it all), the series is pretty engaging, with mostly interesting characters, solid storylines and okay prose (although the latter is surely affected by the translation). **8/10**  \n\t*  **Metro 2033** leans heavily into the classic fantasy tropes – an orphan from a rural area of the world, whose “village” gets attacked by strange creatures, gets a quest from a mysterious stranger that motivates him to leave and go on an adventure – very, VERY basic stuff, which is to be fair, lampshaded in later books. The book also changes styles between the acts, with Act 1 being the generic fantasy story, Act 2 turning into more of a gallery and contemplation of different ideologies, and finally Act 3 being a GRRM-esque dark fantasy/horror story with cannibals, hiveminds and telepathic manipulation. This leads to an inconsistent book, in an inconsistent series, however, the worldbuilding and the characters still make up for it - mostly. **7/10**  \n\t*  **Metro 2034** is my least favorite book of the series. Glukhovsky starts getting into the whole metacommentary of stories here but is unable to provide a really meaningful thesis - yet. The characters are rather uninteresting, and we finally get our first female character of the series (Metro 2033 had literally zero named female characters), only to be explained by the author that a woman’s natural disposition is to be supportive of a man. Once again, this can be a commentary on women’s role in fantasy stories, as in-universe this text was written by an unreliable narrator with their own views, but still, this is what the reader reads. **6/10**  \n\t*  **Metro 2035** is what I think makes the series a worthwhile read. As it is written differently from previous books (once again explained by in-universe reasons), it ditches all the fantasy and mystical elements and focuses on how humanity is just the f-cking worst. And it makes some valid points while our characters wander from one horrible tragedy to another, especially since these tragedies are all based on real-life events. This helps the series focus, which leads into the author’s most concise points about stories, narratives, and how people are not interested in the truth at all – and all these themes are rounded out nicely by the end. **9/10**",

      "title": "I learned *literally* today that the 1947 movie 'Miracle on 34th Street' had an accompanying novella. It's bad.",
      "text": "Earlier today, I was researching one of my all-time favourite Christmas movies: **Miracle on 34th Street**, released in 1947. I found out that, as well as the well-known remake in 1994, there were also three television adaptations over the decades. \n\nAnd there was a novella. \n\nThe man who came up with the original story for this movie, Valentine Davies, didn't write the screenplay. He offered it to his friend, director George Seaton, who sold the idea to 20th Century Fox, and who wrote the screenplay. But Davies still had \"Story By\" credit in the movie. \n\nThe studio decided to get a book published, to coincide with the movie's release. They put Davies in touch with a friendly publisher (Harcourt Brace & Company), who worked with Davies to get it written and printed. \n\nIt's only a short novella, about 23,000 words. \n\nI bought it as an e-book today, and read it almost in a single sitting. It only took about an hour and a half. \n\nAnd, it's *awful*. \n\nValentine Davies won an Oscar for Best Original Story for the movie. He got nominated for another Oscar for another screenplay. He was the President of the Screen Writers Guild for a hot minute. \n\nBut he could *not* write good prose to save himself. The writing in this novella is simple, blunt, and unexciting. It's only a small step above \"See Dick run. Run Dick, run.\" The vocabulary is adult level, but the sentence structure comes straight out of those childhood readers. There's so much simple exposition. He tells us in plain blunt terms what the characters think and feel. There's no subtlety. He'd obviously never heard of \"Show, don't tell.\" And so on. \n\n***\n\nEDIT: For the benefit of someone who complained, here's a sample. This is the second paragraph of the novella (with the final sentence of the first paragraph, as a lead in): \n\n> [...] Not only did Kris look precisely like Santa Claus, he firmly believed he *was* that jolly old gentleman.\n\n> Dr. Pierce, the physician at Maplewood, found this delusion innocent and harmless. In fact, the old man's kindly shrewdness in all other respects had won the doctor completely. He was devoted to Kris and was his staunchest defender. He often came to visit his little room at Maplewood. It was littered with toys of all sizes and shapes, half-finished models, and catalogues. Kris spent most of his time there, smoking his pipe and whittling at his toys.\n\n> One November morning when Dr. Pierce dropped in, Kris hardly noticed him. He was reading a newspaper advertisement, and his eyes snapped with indignation as he read. \n\nOn the next page, after some dialogue (Davies' work, not Seaton's):\n\n> Kris picked up a toy and started to whittle away on it, cheerfully pulling at his pipe. But Dr. Pierce was worried. A frown settled over his pleasant face as he watched Kris working. There was something on his mind and he groped for the right words. Finally he forced himself to come right out with it. \"Kris, you'll have to leave Maplewood.\" \n\n> \"Why?\" asked Kris in astonishment. \n\nA little later:\n\n> Kris proceeded to go through the routine of a simple mental test; adding and subtracting, giving synonyms for words, and so forth. There was no doubt about it, he knew all the answers. Mr Kringle, in spite of his age, was keen, alert, and exceptionally skillful.\n\n... unlike Valentine Davies! \n\nHere endeth the edit. \n\n***\n\nThe only good parts of the novella are the lines of dialogue - which Davies didn't actually write. Davies openly acknowledges in his foreword that the novella is effectively a collaboration, because he used Seaton's writing from the screenplay as well as his own material. The contrast between Davies' sections and Seaton's material is painfully obvious. \n\nI'm very disappointed. \n\nAt least the movie is still a classic.",

      "text": "I hope i’m not too late to ride on the hype!!!\n\nThis is the first memoir I’ve ever read—mainly because it’s the only celebrity memoir Jack Edwards has rated five stars. When I first came across the book a year or two ago, I remember being shocked and taken aback by the title printed on such a pretty cover. I thought it was too vulgar. “How could anybody say that about their mom? How ungrateful,” I remember thinking. But after stumbling upon it again this July, my perspective completely changed.\n\nI deeply admire Jennette McCurdy’s bravery and unwavering honesty in sharing the painful and often disturbing moments of her childhood—hidden behind all the glamour and fame. How could a mother force her child to starve herself, belittle her desire to be a writer, and shame her so persistently that she developed eating disorders and severe mental health issues? If it were me, I don’t think I could have survived it. I admire Jennette not only for her resilience, but for choosing herself and working hard to heal from traumas she didn’t even realize she was experiencing until her treatment journey began.\n\nThere were moments when I had to pause and take a breath because of how triggering some parts were—almost as if the previous chapters hadn’t already prepared me. I found myself relating to her experiences with her parents and grandmother. Though not as extreme, their echoes bled through my own life and resurfaced memories I also hope to acknowledge and heal from.\n\nAs someone currently struggling with the direction—or lack of direction—of my life, I resonated deeply with her thoughts on “slip-ups.” Her reflection on how we shouldn’t let slips turn into slides, particularly in relation to her bulimia, helped me better understand my own self-sabotaging behaviors. It made me realize why my mind feels so uneasy when I try to break bad habits—because those patterns have become part of my identity. They’ve been my safe space. Jennette’s discussion of shame and guilt—how they are different, and how we shouldn’t let shame define us while accepting that guilt is a normal emotion—was something I truly needed to hear.\n\nThere’s still so much more I could say, but what I’ve shared are the parts that had the biggest impact on me—mainly because of their relevance to my current life. As I reached the end of the book (without even realizing it at first), I mentally applauded. Her decision to never visit her mother’s grave again, paired with The Doobie Brothers’ “What a Fool Believes” playing in the background—it felt like the perfect ending to a movie scene.\n\nI’m glad she died, too.",

      "title": "What's a book you were looking forward to reading, but were bitterly disappointed by?",
      "text": "If I have to think of a book for which I had high expectations and then instead was very disappointed, I have no doubt: Stardust by Neil Gaiman. Not because it is a bad book per se, although I am pretty sure I would not have liked it anyway, but because I saw the movie first.\n\nI saw the movie in 2017 when it was released in theaters and read the book shortly thereafter. Doing a bit of research, I found out that I was not the only one who was disappointed with the book after seeing the movie, and that Neil Gaiman has stated that the two works should be seen as alternate versions of the same story, as happens in comic books with alternate dimensions, and that he understands that some readers who came to the book after loving the movie are disappointed.\n\nI am among those readers, and while I understand that book and movie are different media and need different solutions, some of the things I liked most about the movie were precisely additions from the movie or directions the movie had taken while the book takes diametrically opposite directions.\n\nWhat is it about? We are in rural Victorian-era England, and a wall separates our world from a fairy world. One night, a shooting star plummets into the middle of the forest beyond the wall, and Tristan, the protagonist, wants to retrieve it to give it to his girlfriend in exchange for her hand. Small problem, the many despicable children of the king of the fairy kingdom are also looking for the fallen star; whoever finds it will become the new king, and they are willing to do anything! Another complication, The stars in the fairy kingdom are flesh and blood people and Tristan falls in love with them.\n\nThe story is very fairy-tale-like, and I liked the movie quite a bit, and since the book is always better than the movie, I expected great things...unfortunately, the book is even more fairy-tale-like, extremely fairy-tale-like, excessively fairy-tale-like, and it both bored and annoyed me.\n\nIn the movie, Tristan is a goofball who doesn't realize that his relationship with Victoria is super toxic and that she is leading him on in hopes that he will bring her the star but she already has Henry Cavill courting her so...we already know how it will end. In the book Tristan is a pathological recoil addict with whom it is impossible to empathize, he takes an infuriating amount of time to realize the most obvious things, I can't do it, I hated him.\n\nBut he's not the only character I had problems with, Septimus, the evil prince, has much more charisma in the movie than he does in the book, and my favorite character, the pirate captain played by Robert De Niro, who in the movie had me laughing out loud with his contradictions and the mentor-pupil relationship he develops with Tristan, in the book is only mentioned in passing in half a paragraph...\n\nI'm not saying it's a bad book, many people liked it, but it's definitely not a book for me and represents to date the only case, in my opinion, where the movie is better than the book, the exception that confirms the rule.",

      "text": "My son turned 6 this fall and this is the first really consistent year I've spent reading chapter books with him. I've looked at posts/comments from other parents about what good books are for the age group so I thought I'd look back at my Goodreads and give a review informed by a 5/6 year old's perspective.\n\n**The BFG** by Roald Dahl - The kid loved this. I found it unpleasant for reading aloud just for how many made up words there are, but it's fun.\n\n**Charlie and the Chocolate Factory** by Roald Dahl - This was probably the biggest hit. We've been chasing this high all year. As an adult, you know if you are reading a book called \"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory\" that Charlie Bucket is going to get one of those golden tickets. The joy and excitement on my kids face when he finally gets the ticket was a top 10 parenting moment. (Gene Wilder movie afterwards was also a hit.)\n\n**Fantastic Mr. Fox** by Roald Dahl - A lot shorter than I was expecting and probably my kid's least favorite Dahl.\n\n**James and the Giant Peach** by Roald Dahl - Kid liked it fine, it was my least favorite Dahl and there are a lot of voices to do if you do that.\n\n**The Wild Robot Trilogy** by Peter Brown - We finished the 3rd one about a week before the movie came out by coincidence. The first 2 are really good and my son was constantly asking if we could read just one more chapter since the chapters are short. The 3rd one is fine but it's not as connected as the first 2 are. It felt more like an afterthought.\n\n**Stuart Little** by E.B. White - I thought this was a pleasure to read as an adult. The kid enjoyed it although he was startled by the abrupt ending.\n\n**The Horse and His Boy** and **The Silver Chair** by C.S. Lewis - This concluded Narnia for us, I think. We've read everything but The Magician's Nephew and The Last Battle. I loved Narnia as a kid but it's rough for this age. There are some very talky and slow parts that my kid just didn't get. He really like The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe which we read last year but otherwise, Narnia is maybe better left for an older kid.\n\n**The Wizard of Oz** by Frank Baum - This seems like a perfect book for this age group.  It's very episodic in it's structure.  The language was a little old fashioned (which isn't surprising), but the kid really liked it.  The tornado scene was very memorable and he really liked the color coding that happens in the book.  The biggest surprise here was that the movie was likewise a huge hit.\n\nWe're currently reading **Phantom Tollbooth** by Norton Juster and while I don't dislike it,  I wish we weren't.  There is a lot of word play that is missed by reading out loud (witch vs. which, weather vs. whether).  But he seems to be enjoying it.\n\nFor this age, what is working for us is shorter chapters, not too talky, some pictures, and a touch of silliness.  I don't think we need all those ticked off for a successful \"read aloud to a 5/6 year old but it helps.  Reading a lot of older books means explaining somethings that just aren't a part of my kid's life like porcelain and corporal punishment.",

Poor people, rich people - for most it had been a lifetime avocation. And they did love reading.\n\nWhen I moved, my partner (who was a former publishing person like me) and me continued our reading adventure. \n\nBut NO ONE is our social circle reads here. Not books, not anything. Our friends don't even have books in their homes.

Definite suspicions about the science books...\n\nI get the impression that if the books were replaced with sports memorabilia, everything would appear normal to them.\n\nI have learned not to talk about my love of reading.

      "text": "To me, Wicked was originally difficult to access due to it being a Broadwday play that only performed in select Metropolitan cities, not to mention the ticket prices.  Due to curiosity, recommendation, and acclaim, I watched the Wicked movie and enjoyed it.  The plot is what it is, but the production and the music was catchy and memorable.  I then proceeded to consume the Wicked book, going into it with the understanding that it would be vastly different than the movie and musical\n\nThough there are parallels between the book and the movie, it may be odd to compare the two because they're like apples and oranges regarding direction and progression of the plot and characters.  I knew there were political and religious elements that were much more emphasized in the book, but I didn't realize that it was to a much larger, detailed, and occasionally convoluted extent.  There were so many random races and regions to keep track of, not to mention the unclear motive behind the Time Dragon religion (which focuses on hedonism, I believe?).  Frex was more passive, Melena was more selfish and promiscuous, her nanny was just present to try to make sense of the situations, and Turtleheart was kind of just thrown in there (not to mention that it later revealed that Frex was in love with him also).  Then there was a sudden time skip where she's enrolled at Shiz with her interactions with Boq, Glinda, and Fiyero.  Then after Nessarose arrives at Shiz, Madame Morrible places Nessarose, Elphaba, and Glinda under some sort of trance which provides visions and revelations of the future and their supposed roles.  Then Elphaba and Glinda go see Oz at the Emerald City, he dismisses them, and the two just part ways at the train station.  Meanwhile, their peers engage in some sort of orgy at the philosophy club.  After another time jump, Elphaba was some kind of underground resistance fighter and meets up with Fiyero but I'm guessing she does some kind of terrorist attack but fails then joins a convent where her memory is blanked and she barely talks.  Then she meets up with some elephant princess then with Fiyero's widow and their three kids.\n\nOK, I'm not going to summarize the whole story because it's so long and winding.  As a whole, the story and characterizations and motivations of most of the plot points, characters, and revelations are all very random and occasionally disjointed to say the least.  I feel like I was yanked back and forth in different directions and unsure of how the plot wound progress and why certain characters act the way they do or treat other characters a certain way.  Not to mention the small subplot of Dr. Dillamond who Elphaba was doing research with but was so unceremoniously murdered.  There were allusions that Elphaba was partly an animal rights activist, but that did not particularly get much explored.  It's like you're not sure to hate or root for certain characters.  Elphaba at times is aloof and detached; other times she's impulsive and righteous yet misguided.  She's not really wicked; she just seems confused and acts on a whim with limited emotional intelligence.  She's a sympathetic figure at times but I was wondering, who is the real Elphaba?  Is she truly selfish or evil?  Who does she REALLY care about?  Her courage and spunk just comes randomly as opposed to being gradually developed in my opinion.  Did she really bash Madame Morrible's head in, killing her, or was Madam Morrible already dead?  That was definitely a wicked act but was it truly justified?  Not to mention that her reaction afterwards was baffling as she tried to claim credit and seek validation for it.   When the Wizard of Oz characters are introduced later, is she truly jealous or only has a one track mind regarding obtaining the slippers?  What made her fall in love with Fiyero (if you can really call it that)?  Were she and Glinda even really friends?  Is Boq just around for her validation?  If Liir is her son, why didn't she show him even a bit more of an ounce of warmth, motherliness, and understanding?  Lastly, what was going through Gregory Maguire's mind when he concocted such a wild story with wild world building and lore?  Is it just very glorified yet developed fanfiction?  I don't think it's canon because the original Wizard of Oz books had their own sequels.  Did he get the blessing or approval of L. Frank Baum's estate?  Do they still hold the rights to the Wizard of Oz or sold it or is it public domain now?  What do they think of Maguire's take on these characters and world?\n\nYeah, long story short, this was just a means to relay my thoughts of the series thus far (I finished the books a few weeks ago).  It's not the best thing ever, but I'll admit it, it got me curious.  I'd watch the Wicked part 2 movie when it comes out.  If there's an opportunity, I'd watch the play.  I may not finish the entire book series, but I'd be inclined to read the sequel, Son of the Witch.\n\nWhat do you think of the Wicked movie, books, and play as a whole?",

I don’t feel curious about what will happen next and I kind of really don’t care? The initial chapter was supposed to draw me into the story I guess? It just didn’t. If anything it confused me, I’m being thrown in and out different timelines in this character’s life and I’m sort feeling annoyed with this writing style. I mean Stephen Fry is eloquent and witty I do like that but when a book acts like a movie I start getting confused? Is it just me? I have come across a couple of authors who do this is there any way to tell as I’m reading this is happening? I always find myself going back a few pages thinking I missed something just to realise it’s some sort of flashback or a different timeline altogether? \n\nWhat do you do when the book is not pulling you in? Should I cut my losses and start on something else? I honestly wouldn’t even mind someone to spoil it for me I just can’t be bothered to read it through anymore.

      "title": "The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo made me...feel things.",
      "text": "I went in knowing *nothing* about the book, other than that it had 5 stars on Goodreads, booktubers and booktok was going rabid over it, and two of my friends had read and liked it. I came out of it with such mixed feelings: there were so many technical and plot-related annoyances that I can’t say I liked it, it wasn’t bland enough for me to call it ‘meh’ either. But it didn't anger me in the same way as other books I've hated. It was just...really disappointing.\n\n  \n>!On a prose level, I feel like the writing is kind of…immature? It feels like a first book. It’s 80% tell and 20% show and, at first I thought to excuse it because the interview format is very exposition-heavy, but *then* I noticed that that ‘20% show’ would be followed up with Monique or Evelyn then telling us what that ‘show’ meant or was supposed to mean, explaining other characters’ actions and comments with a very omniscient perspective that Evelyn’s POV wouldn’t naturally afford her. As a writer myself, I found myself going into ‘editor mode’ at many points, thinking “That line/entire paragraph could have been removed and the point still would have been made.”. I remember certain metaphors sounding really weird - the “the thing that made her will be the thing to take her down” line was straight up laughable - and I could tell the author learned that the use of word/phrase repetition can increase the emotional significance of the point for the reader, but they don’t realize that forcing it all the time, and forcing it where it doesn’t apply, diminishes all returns on the effect. At one point, the repetition even leads to a contradiction! When Evelyn sees the crash that Harry was in, she spends a short paragraph talking about how stuff like that causes people to dissociate through the immediate aftermath, describing it like a film running but nobody is behind the camera (which is a description I liked!), but then the next page has her state “I remember…” for every detail of the aftermath, step-by-step, details and all. You can’t talk about how dissociation alters how memories are processed, and then immediately follow it up with a page of “I remember everything that happened.”!<\n\n>!It also bugged me to hell and back that the author would stop Evelyn telling her story every few chapters to have Evelyn go “you know the mystery of why I chose you, Monique? Ooo, I know you’re curious! Just wait until I get to the end of the story and you’ll have all your answers, but you’ll also hate me for it!” Like, please author, mysteries are a good way to keep people invested in getting through your book, but you don’t have to stop the story to REMIND us that you’re jiggling keys in front of our face to keep our attention!!<\n\n  \n>!On a character level, I thought Evelyn was interesting (at least around all the prose *telling* us that she is interesting and multi-layered). Her relationship with Harry was my favorite (although I raised an eyebrow at the idea that Evelyn is sooo irresistible that even the firmly established gay guy tells her he’s always been a little interested in sleeping with her). I thought her relationship with Celia was more fun when they were friends flirting with each other because we actually got to see them bond a bit and have moments of intimacy and banter. We could actually see them as real people getting closer and having tension. Once they admitted they loved each other though? All of that is gone and they both turn into flat romance-novel stereotypes who only express their 'love' by calling each other beautiful and breathtaking and waxing poetic about the strength of their bond and their sex is the pinnacle of how they express their love and, while their fights are bitter, their pining is eternal. !<\n\n>!Bisexuality is a big part of the story, and there’s a lot of *telling* (preaching) about how a bi person’s attraction to men and women are equal and they shouldn’t be forced to prioritize/pick just to fit a box, but the way the author actually writes Evelyn’s relationships with men and women are VERY different. The relationship with the man Evelyn loved (and the other men she marries but doesn’t exactly love) feels like they’re written to show the romantic/sexual tension and chemistry between them, Evelyn has at least one line for each husband where she describes how something they did made her feel emotionally and drew her to them, and all the sex with men is described in raw, desirous, passionate, or animalistic terms. But Celia? As soon as they’re a couple, the ‘relationship’ part is all glossed over for them parroting romantic trope lines at each other and their sex is always described sensually, and the two times they have clearly desperate/passionate sex, the scene is written in flowery language like the author is trying to make it seem more wholesome to compensate. The long stretches of time when they’re properly together (under the safety of their beards), the *perfect* time to show them thriving together as a couple, is basically glossed over and summed up as “we basically lived together” and their ‘wedding’ at the end, where they giggle over hair ties like schoolgirls at a sleepover, is the only quiet intimate moment that’s properly shown.!<\n\n>!Monique is barely a character. She only serves to allow the author to tell us why we should like Evelyn and how beautiful she is. She often says things that contradict what little character we’re shown just to give Evelyn an excuse to chastise/lecture her, which turns Evelyn into a mouthpiece for the author's own gripes. When Evelyn tells her about Celia breaking up with her over her sleeping with her ex-husband for a movie, Monique – the kind of person we’re shown has the kind of empathy to write a tactful piece on ‘right to suicide’ advocacy groups, and who is freshly experiencing the heartbreak of her own divorce – callously says “But you got an Oscar \\[for that film\\]\" like an insensitive twat, just to give the author an excuse to have Evelyn respond with the cliché line of “It wasn’t worth it.”!<\n\n>!I guessed near the beginning that Monique was chosen for the interview because Evelyn saw her ‘right to suicide’ article and I was initially happy with the idea of that being the ‘twist’ because I thought it would be the perfect culmination of the consistent theme of being ‘seen/understood’; everyone who read Monique’s piece talk about how, on a shallow level, it was well written, but Evelyn SAW that a piece like that would have to come from the kind of person who would be empathetic with her own desire. I thought it would be a beautiful connection to end on. A final expression of Evelyn’s desire to be ‘seen’, because that’s what she valued at the root of wanting a family. But no, while that idea does get a mention, the ‘real’ twist is that Evelyn knew Monique’s dad (shrinking the world in that “everyone knows/is related to everyone” way) and wanted to pass on the message that Monique’s dad truly loved her, which was wholly unnecessary because up to that point in the story, the ONLY thing we knew about her dad through her memories of him was that he cared for his family (Monique obsessing over the detail that her dad loved a *man* also shows Evelyn's stories went in one ear and out the other, even though she *tells* us that Evelyn taught her a lot) .!<\n\n>!Aside from those things, it also really felt like the author only included the diversity they did to cross a checkbox on ‘what kind of books go viral/sell these days’ instead of using those things to drive plot or characters or even have something to say. Monique is biracial, Evelyn is a Cuban-American woman in the 50s entertainment industry. Celia is a Southern lesbian. Harry is gay. But with the interesting things that could be talked about regarding the experiences or mindsets of someone with those traits and how that would affect their lives, the author just wrote at the level of ‘the one or two things a layman would know about the plights of these minority groups from cultural osmosis alone’. Biracial? Have Monique mention once or twice about not fitting in with either race. Woman in Hollywood? Lament her needing to use sex to get ahead (while the author simultaneously objectifies her in the prose at every turn). Bisexual? Have Evelyn follow up that reveal with a three paragraph lecture to Monique (as a woman from the 50s talking down to a woman who grew up in the modern era) about the harms of bi-erasure. Lesbian/gay? Their tragedy is that they can’t ‘honestly’ pass as straight. Queer discussion in general? Have the queer characters have a moment where they proudly state ‘there is nothing wrong with us!’ or cry in each others’ arms while lamenting the unfairness of the world not letting them love who they want. A bunch of ticked checkboxes.!<\n\n>!It's not like those points aren’t true, but they’re surface level and, in many cases, anachronistic. Experiences, mindsets, and language used both within and outside these groups is fluid, and has changed over the decades, but the author, despite choosing a specific time period, writes everything from a modern mentality and from a shallow mentality that just makes this feel like a story of walking stereotypes.!<\n\nGiven its popularity, and given how long it is, I really expected more meat on this bone. I didn't hate every aspect of it (using news articles to show outsider's perspectives on the aftermath of certain decisions or things that happen during timeskips was cool) but I did hate that I finished this book wishing I hadn't opened it in the first place.",

But as much as I liked the references, the book made me cringe more times than I care to count, and everything outside of the nostalgia was either bad or forgettable. Still, I decided to give Ernest Cline another shot and read *Armada*, another video game-centric novel—this time with absolutely no redeeming qualities.\n\nCline has an obsession with making his protagonists know-it-alls who are effortlessly amazing at video games, and while that was off-putting in *RPO*, I didn’t realize how bad it was until I started reading *Dungeon Crawler Carl* by Matt Dinniman. This is my first book by Dinniman, and I’m only a few chapters in, but wow—what a refreshing change. The protagonist isn’t some flawless genius, the game mechanics are well explained, and the humor actually lands. You can tell that Dinniman is genuinely funny and well-versed in modern culture, with references that feel natural rather than forced.\n\n*Dungeon Crawler Carl* feels like everything Ernest Cline *wanted* to write but completely missed the mark on—though if making millions and getting a decent movie adaptation counts as failing, I guess we should all be so lucky.",

If a character is supposed to look a certain way, provide it ASAP (though in a nice way or very briefly) or else I'm seeing what I want to see.\n\nI've read many books where I have an image of a character whether it's just a few snapshots or a full blown movie scene, and about 100 pages in there's some random mention about a trait that goes against what I was imagining or, worse, this whole breakdown of how I'm supposed to see this character. It's not the end of the world but it really takes me out more than I would like it to. I spend the rest of the book imagining what I want anyway but then the scenes feel so clunky because my brain snaps between my version and author's version. \n\nIn the book I'm reading now, a character was fully described long after I've already developed them in my head and now every other scene suddenly is very loyal to the character description so now I can't imagine it with the character I've become close with and it is throwing me off. And it sucks because everything else is so smoothly done and things are really picking up with great scenes, great pacing and I would be going through it like a movie if it wasn't for this.\n\nAnd this is common, or maybe I have bad luck.\n\nName something worse.",

It is so easy to love and hate a problematic parent. Ugh that whole chapter where she lectures Jo on controlling her anger. Go jump in an ice lake, Marmee. And when she gives them those sermon books or whatever they were for Christmas? Ughghgh.\n\nOh yes, Little Women. Well, Beth dies, so there's that to deal with. I can't remember how I knew she died, because it wasn't spelled out. Also, it was Marmee's fault, right? right??? She emotionally blackmailed the girls into constant charity visits of the poor German family, who were probably sick of her interfering, and that's where Beth got ill. How could Marmee live with herself? How could Jo let her live with herself?\n\nSometime ago I stumbled on a tweet which said Jo was trans, because she cut her hair and wrote books and liked to run around, and apparently only men should do those kind of things? I had to fetch my old eyes from the back of the room where they had had rolled out of my head, but it's nice that new generations can find ways to relate to old stories.\n\nSpeaking of new and old, I liked the Gerwig movie more than the book. Yes. Obviously as a movie it couldn't portray the rich inner creative life of the girls, but it gave less of Marmee, and more of Amy, so that's always a good thing.",

      "text": "The first of the books I read was Dracula. It was a really fun adventure with some creepy atmosphere. I really enjoyed the epistolary format. I liked the characters and wanted to see them overcome Dracula. It did drag a bit in the middle, but I expect that to some degree, even with modern books. And the repetition could be annoying, but I have heard that it was originally published a chapter at a time in an old literary magazine so some repetition is to be expected. I would absolutely recommend it to someone who has patience with books, especially if they're looking for something different than modern books tend to offer. Overall, I'm glad that I read it first. \n\nFrankenstein, however, I did not enjoy. I will admit that a large part of that feeling is that Victor Frankenstein is the worst kind of overentitled spoiled brat who refuses to own up to any mistakes. But I just felt like the whole novel was a slog in which I was mentally yelling at him to make literally any other choice.\n\nThat being said, I feel like Frankenstein is the more important novel to read. It may be the most important novel I can even remember reading. The message of taking care of the people we bring into the world is especially poignant in an age of iPad kids and robots that are (supposedly) self aware enough to end their own existence in the face of endless labor. I would recommend it to anyone who is interested in the conversation the novel poses or the history of science fiction in general.\n\nAs an aside, it's a shame that these two novels are so overshadowed by the 1930s movies that barely resemble the novels in anything but name.",

      "title": "Finally read the Hunger Games and I have so many thoughts",
      "text": "I have spent this past week devouring the hunger games books, and I have a lot of thoughts.\n\nAfter I finished Mockingjay, I was not okay for a whole day. \n\n1. The thing that I liked the most about the books is that the main character is not a one dimensional \"cool\" character, no one is, Finnick, Annie, Haymitch, Katniss etc they are all traumatised and having mental breakdowns, which is not something we see in YA books that much, the characters just go through traumatic incidents and they are fine, so it was really refreshing to see someone go through hell and be traumatised by it to the point of incapacity. They also don't play a central role in the rebellion, they are the face of it and they have their key moments but it's not a one person doing it all, saving the day type of book. I really liked that.\n\n\n2. I knew a little about the books before going in, mostly about the overall concept of the hunger games and that it has a really controversial love triangle -\n\nand I could see it in the first book, Gale was a good person and a true friend, \nand half of the second book as well but as their story moves forward and comes to an end, for about 50% of the Trilogy, I really cannot see Gale and Katniss as a pair, not just as lovers but their bond as friends is also gradually deteriorating which is so sad.\n\nIt would have been so incongruous if they had ended up together in the end,\nfor the love triangle dynamic to work there was a premise in the first book, and it continued in the second book but after that \nit was just not important, the author intended it to be this way maybe because all i could focus on was how traumatised Katniss was after the quarter quell, she was shell shocked, almost died, and Peeta was being tortured,\nand most importantly the thing that was the basis of Gale's feelings for her (imo) - their closeness and bond developed because of the shared struggle for survival in the Seam - had started to fade away, Gale did not have the opportunity to find out about this side of him in the Seam - that deprivation and fear and hopelessness is taken away after they move to district 13, because they are cared for and they have a purpose, and they are fighting back.\n\nAnd that brings out the Snow side of Gale, and to a point it's understandable because of what he has suffered and has seen others suffer in the districts but then it only gets worse and worse. So the love triangle angle was abandoned to show two sides of a rebellion, one is Peeta and Katniss (and others) who have experienced the hunger games twice and seen the good and the ugly side of the capitol and came out of it believing this system has to change, we cannot replace one tyrant with another, hunger games was a revenge tactic and this cycle should not continue, \nwhile on the other side is Gale ( and others ), who is driven by seeing the capitol people as subhuman - how else did he come up with a trap bomb that explodes twice to kill the people who come to rescue others - and the defence that he didn't know it would be used on children does not sit right with me because even in war, on the battlefield that is just so evil.\nAnd Gale was not an evil person before, he was someone who took care of people and provided for them and wanted rights and dignity, and freedom, so the novel portrays how people can get too caught up in their idea of justice that they lose empathy.\n\nShe was grieving after Prim's death and her mom bailed again, and he was not there for her, even Haymitch loved Katniss more so really i don't understand the love triangle after Catching Fire. But romance is not my favorite genre so maybe I don't get it, please share your thoughts too.\n\n3. Cinna - the most underrated character in the entire book, from the very beginning I was so drawn to him, he is kind and compassionate and he is not afraid to take a stand, and he knows the power of his art and he used that to make Katniss into the Mockingjay, his motivations are not explained, we don't have his backstory ( i don't know if it's been mentioned in some spin off book that i am unaware, please let me know if that's the case ), he is simply good for the sake being good, and he refuses to participate in the capitol's oppression in a way that ultimately leads to it's downfall. He is the central character in the creation of the rebellion, before weapons and willpower there has to be a symbol, and a sense of belonging, something to rally for, and rally to and he created that. And he was Katniss' true friend, from the very beginning.\n\n\n4. The Similarities between Gale and Snow:\n\nYesterday I read The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes, and I was really surprised by Snow, he had his prejudices from page one but towards the middle of the novel we see him think something about how if he didn’t have honor, he had nothing. No more deception. No more shady strategies. No more rationalization. From now on he’d live honestly, and if he ended up as a beggar, at least he would be a decent one. Knowing what we know about his future, that's just... who is this guy? \n\nTo be honest I feel like Snow did have some morals in his early life, but just like everything else even his inner monologue is largely motivated by how he wants to be perceived, even in his own eyes.\n\nBecause right after this he goes to the plinth house to gleam some reward, for something Gaul made him do, from Strabo if possible.\n\n( one way Gale will never be like Snow is that he took on the responsibility of Katniss' family when she went to the hunger games, she could be sure of their survival because of his words, which is something we will never see Snow do so I am not saying they are the same, such direct comparisons are unfair because Gale grew up in district 12 while Snow grew up in the capitol and he was really obsessed with his aura points for the lack of better phrase and we never get to see how Gale was doing in his \"fancy job in district 2\" as it were, if he really turned into Snow, we also never had access to his inner monologue.)\n\nA. Ignoring their conscience is something they do easily and B. They both come to see their love interest as expendeble, \ndon't kill me just yet, \ni was expecting something terrible to happen between Lucy and Snow for him to end up the way he did in the Hunger Games books but what we got instead was him slowly embracing his true nature and leave the moral qualms behind, which is something Gale also does towards the end of Mockingjay, when Katniss was literally having her skin grafted because a bomb exploded in her face ( her face was spared i know ), and her sister who she was trying to protect from everything died - by a bomb that he designed, he didn't visit her in the hospital, not even after he had recovered. And even he must have put two and two together about why Prim was in the capitol, on the frontline even though she is so young -  and he did what Snow does, try to look on the sunny side of the evil omelette, as long as it doesn't harm him.\n\nEven after Katniss confronts him about it, he just shrugs it off by saying you will always think about it and just walks away - that was honestly insane, if that's how the books end, why is the love triangle still so controversial? \nfor me the two choices were Peeta or stay alone. \n\nC. Their lack of basic human empathy, they both respond to human suffering, but Snow judges Tigris and Lucy for what they, implied, had to do to survive, Gale tries when Katniss tells him about her stylists, the ones who were kidnapped and chained in district 13, he doesn't understand or rather has a really hard time with seeing capitol people as deserving of kindness. They are not consistent with their empathy and world views and kindness, we have one book from Snow's point of view and we can see that outwardly it might appear like he feels deeply about something - his regard for Sejanus or the love he has for Lucy - but on the inside we see that it's all hollow and selfish, he sees Lucy as an extension of himself and is jealous and possessive while also being judgemental but he masks it all so well, while Gale might not be like this exactly, if his feelings for Katniss were genuine then, his seeming lack of remorse about Prim, or concern about Katniss' mental well-being in the end is just appalling.\n\n\n\n4. Finnick :(\n\n\n5. The books portrayal of oppression and classism, of the vanity with which the capitol citizens are encouraged/sometimes forced to live, and the role that technology and curated videos and statements play in this oppression and as well it's overthrow is another thing I really liked.\n\n6. The arenas, oh my god the arenas, I loved the way both the hunger games in book 1 and 2 unfolded, the action was really well-written. I could not stop reading. Maybe I will watch the movies, just to see that. I don't know.\n\n7. I really wish Prim had survived. Because she was kind and pure and that was what Katniss was fighting to preserve and a lot of people in the rebellion was fighting for that, for children to live in world free of this cruel system, and Prim symbolised that for me, so her loss was just so horrible. I wish she could have come out of it and lived a happy life.\n\n\n\nI had to talk about everything, it's all I could not stop thinking about. I don't know what I will read next it was an amazing experience, i should have read this book series sooner!!!",

      "text": "I am definitely new to this subject so very curious what the general assessment is on this. \n\nBut Darcy, to me in my late 30s, comes across as a man who is “emotionally unavailable” and whose sudden interest becomes overwhelmingly flattering because he seems so hard to get. Then the emotions run high with constant conflict during courtship stirring up a lot of sexual tension. So that by the time they actually come together there’s a lot of emotional attachment but based more on drama than actual compatibility. \n\nThe story ends there with a happily ever after, and I won’t say he and Elizabeth aren’t compatible but I do wonder if once the excitement cools, his more unpleasant qualities turn towards Elizabeth. She’s free and outspoken and he is more reserved and controlled. I could see him being a controlling partner or at least a major stuck in the mud. \n\nThat said, Elizabeth’s options of men seem to be timelessly relatable: the good guy who’s not an option, the weird jerk, the nice guy who’s actually a jerk, and the jerk with the golden heart. \n\nIs Darcy’s golden heart just a hopeful projection that fades after the chase?\n\nUPDATE: first of all, I just watched the Matthew McFadyen movie and can see why so many people have the perspectives they do about Darcy. \n\nI really love this conversation and am excited to finally be initiated into the lore. \n\nBased on just the book I do still feel like this is optimistic “diamond in the rough” fantasy like any early Disney fairytale. And I love these fantasies. But I think this book really nails the female perspective. \n\nElizabeth seems to change her perspective upon learning more about Darcy. But Darcy’s perceived changes seem directed by selfish interests. His treatment of Elizabeth and his meddling in his friend’s relationship only changes when he takes a personal interest in Elizabeth, however earnest that may be. Alas, in the book, he’s the real deal and truly seems to grow. But my point is that in reality I think these scenarios end up painful and disappointing for the “Elizabeth”. The fantasy is what makes this so enchanting for me though.",

      "title": "Our Wives Under the Sea is the worst book I have read in ages. Four and a half reasons why.",
      "text": "Full spoilers below. \n \nI enjoy weird books and surrealist plots and horror elements. I enjoy stories that mix in philosophy and existential themes. I was told to expect all of this and more from many glowing reviews for this book. Instead what I got was 5 hours of unbearable drudgery which consists almost exclusively and entirely of the two main characters narrating snapshots of their lives while one is trapped in an apartment room and the other is trapped in a submarine. If that sounds like a compelling setting, don't worry it's not. There are maybe four main problems I have with this book.  \n  \nOne is the length. Whatever it tried to do it could have easily done in half that length or less. I adore the writings of HP Lovecraft and a number of things about this book reminded me of his stories, from the flowery detached writing style to the abstract not quite explicitly shown horror elements to the setting of a research Expedition into the unknown. But one big difference is that most of HP Lovecraft stories are quite short and self-contained whereas this book just extended interminabley for no particularly good reason. \n \nSecond big problem I have is how utterly unbelievable it is that the primary narrator does not react in any significant way when, and I mentioned this would contain spoilers, her wife's body begins to turn transparent and start melting. Her eyeball melts out of her head, her body turns to jelly, and for some stupid reason the narrator never informs a doctor or tries to get her wife medical attention despite both women being scientifically minded secularists. Instead she... On a \"hunch\" fills the bathtub with salt...??? At the end of the book for some dumb reason she gets another friend to help her dispose of Leah's body and this friend also has no reaction to seeing a human being liquefy in front of her. I'm not even sure why the plot has this friend show up to help because she absolutely does nothing important to the plot. And that's my third problem...  \n  \nThree: Despite naming a handful of friends and other characters, they have next to no distinct personalities or significance to the plot or characters in any way. Literally during the last one or two pages of the book the narrator Mary mentions wanting to tell Sam and some other person and I have no idea who these people are because despite reading the book they just do not matter and have no characteristics or importance to anything. Even the other crew members on the sub barely matter. You have.... The catholic lady who... Kills herself? And the ice fisher with two missing fingers. What else do we know about them? Nothing. What else \nDo they contribute to the plot? Nothing. Because, surprise, surprise... \n \nFour: NOBODY DOES Anything. These characters have zero agency and never affect their circumstances in any meaningful way. Instead shit just happens to them. The book goes out of its way to mention several times that the crew was stranded for 4-5 months. This matters because..... Reasons. What do they do while stranded? Well, as Leah tells us in a single paragraph, they play connect the dots, do jumping Jacks, and.... Occasionally shower. For months. Because they feel a surpression to not do anything else. Why did the voyage need to be four months? It never matters. Nothing happens. They barely attempt to change or interact with their environment in any way. It doesn't  even matter that they're trapped in a sub, it could be a cardboard box for all it matters. They just barely have emotional breakdown reactions to the situation, but it happens much too far into the book and is over quickly. The whole submarine plot is only about 25% of the content anyway and nothing significant ever happens while on board.  \n  \nThe rest of the 2 Settings book takes place in the women's apartment where Mary talks about how much she loves Leah, reminisces about ways they used to be in love like going to bars together and watching movies (???) and Mary feeling sad and helpless that Leah is turning into Jelly. And also a minor plot about finding friends on discord who role play losing their husbands. \n  \n1/2: The actual mystery horror element is never successfully resolved but even if left a mystery it never provides a satisfying payoff. And when we do get a little bit of the mystery revealed it feels tropey af and doesn't help save this sinking story.  Why doesn't Leah involve the police? Or medical experts? Why does she somehow not know the name of the only other surviving crew member, and why do we never find out what happened to him? Why did the mystery dive company apparently sabotage the submarine and leave it stranded for four months so it could float next to a sea monster only to then let it resurface having done nothing, learned nothing, accomplished nothing, and the crew turn into piles of jelly? What exactly is the payoff for the reader in spending five hours in this book??? \n  \nThe ONLY redeeming thing I can say about this story is it might be something of an allegory for losing a loved one to depression or ptsd maybe?? But even if taken that way it doesn't say or do anything meaningful with this slant. Maybe the story could have worked well as a short story but nothing about it merited being so long. My interest  melted away long before the main character dissolved into goo. \n \nEdit: I do see some of value in it as a narrative exploration of grief as many comments point out. I got the feeling that was what the book was going for though it didn't quite get there for me. I anticipated The Martian in a submarine story which was not where this book went.",

I think this desire to be like characters I admired or liked very much never quite left me. It just evolved and took new forms that were perhaps felt more mature but weren't really.\n\nWhen I read The Outsiders, and later saw the movie, I put grease in my hair and wore leather jackets and just tried to act tough. I'm sure I wasn't the only one. I mean the movie had Matt Dillon, Rob Lowe, Tom Cruise, Ralph Macchio, Patrick Swayze....they defined cool and so everybody wanted to be like them.\n\nThe Count of Monte Cristo was a whole other story. I don't think I quite understood the narrative but it drove my imagination crazy. There was a girl in my class named Mercedes, and I had all these wild fantasies of finding treasure behind the school and getting my revenge. There was actually this mysterious well that remained uncovered and smelled of piss and gasoline, and my treasure was supposedly was at the bottom of it. Once I were to find it, then I would prepare to get my revenge on her boyfriend, a football player who was actually a nice guy. My only problem was me trying to change my voice and appearance. I found a wig and a fake mustache but didn't seem to really do much. So I gave up. And never did climb down that mysterious well to find my gold.\n\nI was reminded of this today when I saw a thread on The Count of Monte Cristo, so I thought why the hell not, I'll embarrass myself and hope others will share a few embarrassing stories of their own. :)",

The story had me hooked, and at times, it felt like it was written with a movie adaptation in mind—almost as if I was watching it unfold on screen.  \n\nWhen I read it at night, I was gripped with fear—this book gets *dark*. The connection between the murders and the Bible added a chilling layer to the mystery, making some parts genuinely unsettling. I know there’s a film version, but I haven’t seen it yet. Curious to hear what others thought—did you feel the same way?",

      "text": "I know a lot of people liked this book, so I'm gonna apologize in advance, but this was not good. If you don't really want to hear me rant, I'd suggest you don't read this post.\n\nAlso, lots of spoilers.\n\nI expected quite a lot more from this book, but I couldn't even bring myself to finish it.\n\nI checked a few spoiler-free reviews before, and they were all 5 stars. Not sure how that is possible.\n\nThe story promises a lot from the very beginning. The secret life of a Marilyn Monroe-like celebrity... All the sordid details and secrets of her life... A story worth 12 million dollars... But all of that amounts to a generic, boring, and poorly-paced story.\n\nThe introduction to Monique is fine, albeit cliche. Struggling writer who wants to climb to the top. Heard all of that before. Nothing really exciting there.\n\nThe mystery of Evelyn Hugo on the other hand is well introduced. Who is she? Why did she marry 7 times? Why does she want to meet Monique?\n\nAnd then she starts telling her story, and nothing she ever says is ground-breaking.\n\nHer childhood was quickly skipped. She mentions her dreams of becoming famous, making her mother proud and leaving her abusive father.\n\nAll of that is fine, but it seems that the author forgot the most important rule of story-telling: SHOW DON'T TELL.\n\nWe never see any of the bad stuff. And not just that, a few pages later, she's married and ready to leave Hell's Kitchen. WHAT??? YOU'RE GONNA SKIP YOUR CHILDHOOD JUST LIKE THAT???\n\nWhere was the struggle? Why should I care about you, Evelyn? It didn't really sound like you went through much. You're just another Mary Sue.\n\nEdit:\n\nYes, a Mary Sue. And there are several types of Mary Sue. It's not just someone who is flawless. It can be someone who is good at everything. Or someone for whom characters behave differently and reality bends to meet their needs. And that's exactly what happens throughout Evelyn's life. One day she is single and hopeless, the next day she's met a gullible guy who agrees to take her somewhere else. None of that happens so quickly in the real world. And even if it does, Evelyn finds a ways to make all of this sound plain and boring.\n\nAnd BTW, a Mary Sue doesn't necessarily have to be a bad character. The fact that she is a Mary Sue is irrelevant. Like I said, the problem is that she doesn't ever delve into details. We only get a surface level story.\n\nEnd edit.\n\nShe then starts her career as an actress in the most generic way possible. As a waitress who meets a producer at whatever place she was. And not just that, she did it again in just a few pages.\n\nAgain, WHERE WAS THE STRUGGLE YOU OVERCAME???\n\nShe quickly becomes a famous movie star with a rising career in just a few pages.\n\nWHERE WAS THE STRUGGLE???\n\nEdit:\n\nI'm not saying that there needs to be a struggle. What I mean by this is that Evelyn has given us the very condensed version of her story and she's left out anything that would make it relatable or interesting.\n\nEnd edit.\n\nShe starts dating and eventually marries Don, who turns out to be a terrible human being.\n\nThis is where it actually got good for a moment, and I finally felt like the story was gonna get interesting.\n\nThe scene of the first time he attacks her is very well done. This is what I wanted to see. You're finally SHOWING us that you did struggle. That the life of movie star is not just glamour and happiness.\n\nThe problem comes next. The book had been so completely rushed as of that point, that I felt the change in pacing 10 times more annoying than it should've been. Evelyn's previous divorce was SO fast that it felt only natural that she would divorce Don a few pages later, but the story just kept dragging on and on and on... for several hours.\n\nIt really was tedious to read about their marriage. The whole time I was thinking, why hasn't she divorced him yet? You claim to be smart and manipulative, but you're being really dumb now. The book hasn't given us any reason for which you can't divorce him other than the fact that staying with him keeps the cameras on you, which is a lame reason.\n\nAnd yes, I know she claims to be in love for the first time in her life, but none of that shows in the pages! Their relationship is as dull as can be. Dancing a little bit and eating at restaurants. REALLY EVELYN??? 12 MILLION DOLLARS FOR THIS GARBAGE???\n\nHer relationship with Celia was also rushed. They had one or two good scenes together that were good but not great. I started to like Celia a bit, but the romance felt forced because it didn't have time to grow. Like I said, ONLY 1 or 2 good sexually charged scenes together and then made them a couple? No, that's not enough!\n\nThe best chemistry between couples comes from waiting and getting to know each other. We don't even know enough about Celia to care about her character. All we know is that she is obsessed with Evelyn. AND THAT'S NOT ENOUGH!\n\nHer friendship with Harry was also boring at best (to be fair, all the characters are boring). He was there for emotional support, but it never really felt like he mattered. He offered to help many times, but he never really did anything important. He felt nothing more than like an extra in a movie.\n\nAnd then we FINALLY get to the divorce. And the story can FINALLY continue.\n\nA new problem is introduced, and as always, Evelyn solves it effortlessly and without any struggle. Her career is saved in just a few pages because she landed a role in an international film.\n\nWow. Exciting, isn't it? No. Not really.\n\nAt this point she's proven she can do anything the plot needs her to do. So why should I care if her career was momentarily ruined for 20 minutes?\n\nHer marriage to Mick was another sort of exciting point in the story, but I was so numb at that point that I didn't care much for it.\n\nAnd then I finally decided to DNF the book. I'm halfway through it, and there's no sign it will get any better. I could've finished it, but I see no point in doing that. It's only mediocre at best.\n\nI read a quick summary just to know if the promised twist would be good enough to hook me again, but it's not. It's as generic as can be.\n\nI will say though that I'm disappointed in myself for not having figured it out. I had several theories, but I wasn't able to deduce why she specifically wanted Monique to write her book.\n\nEdit: I appreciate the people who are both offering to tell me the ending of the book or doing so. But, as mentioned in the post, I already read a summary to see if it was worth revisiting. So, yes, I already know about Monique's father. Still, I don't feel it changes anything about my opinions on this book.\n\nEdit 2: Thanks for the nice comments! Only a few people say I demand too much from this book. As if demanding good writing, better characterizations, and better pacing was unreasonable. It's the minimum we should expect from any book.\n\nI will say though that I read Jennette McCurdy's I'm Glad my Mother Died last year, and it's really increased my standards in historical fiction (even though it's non-fiction). And I think it's valid to compare them because they are both, for the most part, autobiographies of famous hollywood stars.\n\nAnd let's not forget that from the very beginning, Evelyn tells Monique that she wants her to write her life story. So, the fact that Evelyn is unable to speak like a real person, provide details like a real person, or tell stories that feel real and not made up shows how little mastery in writing the author has.\n\nIf that was a 10, this is a 2. And if anyone had told me this was written by AI, I would have believed it because the story lacks depth and characterization. We only see the surface level of Evelyn's life, and it feels like the first draft of a story rather than a finished product.\n\nBut hey, if you enjoyed this book, I'm glad. Obviously, no one likes to be in the minority that dislikes something, but it sometimes happens.",

      "text": "I just finished reading Roger Zelazny's *Lord of Light* and found myself awestruck at how I've been interested in mythology-based fiction for nearly two full decades now and haven't once accidentally fallen upon a piece inspired by Hinduism until now. I've come across ancient Greek/Roman, Norse, Sumerian, Egyptian, Aztec, Mayan, and probably plenty more that I'm failing to rattle off the top of my head, but Hindu was never one that came up. Granted, I also didn't go out of my way to look for it, but that's kind of the point. I didn't really go out of my way to look for any of the others either, they just kind of fell into my lap for one reason or another.\n\n*Lord of Light* isn't explicitly an accurate representation of Hinduism (or Buddhism as is also included), but even the basic inspiration it draws from to craft its story is incredibly interesting as somebody with a general fascination with mythology as a whole. The portrayal of Hindu gods/deities (as of my now very limited exposure) seems closer to Central American mythologies than European mythologies. Again, not that they're the same, but finding similarities and differences to compare/contrast is one of the primary aspects which makes mythology-based reading so interesting to me. Reading universe origin stories, or how ancient civilizations rationalized different parts of the world's creation/development, it's so much fun to see the various paths each culture took to their respective conclusions.\n\nThis book has definitely inspired me to take a bit of time to search for more unpopular mythological texts, and even now writing this post I'm realizing that aside from Egyptian, I haven't really given much Africa-based mythology (of which I'd imagine there may literally be hundreds just based on the sheer volume of cultural variety across the continent) much attention either. \n\nNow I shouldn't really be surprised that I've failed to come across African or various \"eastern\" mythological works in a country like the US, but I'm glad I've opened my eyes a bit, and I'm excited to embark on this journey forward!",

      "text": "I remember when it first came out it was lauded and so was the movie. Everyone I knew was talking about it and raving. I was in middle school when the movie came out and that's when I read the book. Reading it then was a different experience now. Now the white savior trope feels more obvious but it's really the dialect that gets me. Each chapter is written from the perspective of one of the 3 characters. Skeeter and all the while characters speak plainly. You wouldn't guess they're from the south based ofc how they speak but Minny, Aibileen, and all the black characters speak with not only a southern dialect but the spelling and grammar reflect that. Being from the south myself I feel that the white characters could have been written similarly and the fact that they aren't is a bit distracting. Some of the poorer white characters don't speak in dialect either. When I first read the book I didn't even notice it but it's very noticable now. \n\nI don't hate the book of the movie by any means and neither does anyone in my family. As a matter of fact some of them quote it. Especially the two slices of shit scene. I still remember my mom discussing the book with her friends and comparing it to what my grandma experienced when working in a nursing home in the 60s as a Black care taker.\n\n My mother felt it did a great job of making people think about that and how so many Black women of the time had to work outside the home (so many ppl today think women didn't work then. Completely false) and take care of other people's children. More than their own. I remember her being very loved by the book and her having discussions about it with her white coworkers who had parents that grew up with help. I remember feeling moved by the book as well. All of the characters felt real to me and I felt that they had a lot of life to them. I think my mother and sister loved having a book highlight the struggle Black women have always experienced. I think they feel similarly about books/movies like The Color Purple. \n\nSo overall I think it's great that the book got people talking about this particular part of history but there are some parts of it that definitely stand out to me now and not in a good way. I'd still recommend it to other people so they could develop their own feelings about it. How did you like it?",

      "title": "My review of \"Blood Meridian\"",
      "text": "https://glasshalftrue.substack.com/p/book-review-blood-meridian-by-cormac\n\nWes Anderson, my favorite film director, often gets accused of being “style over substance”. I disagree with this criticism, because it draws a false dichotomy between style and substance. In filmmaking, the way images are presented on the screen is both the style *and* the substance: the medium is the message, as they say. His storybook visual flair and love of orderly symmetrical compositions aren’t just superficial details; they work to emphasize the whimsical, rose-colored lens through which many of his stories are told. The seeming emotional distance created by his convoluted, deadpan dialogue isn’t just a pretentious quirk; it serves to highlight the characters’ fear of emotional vulnerability, which heightens the sense of catharsis in the rare moments that their facades break down.\n\nThis is not a review of a Wes Anderson movie; this is a review of Cormac McCarthy’s violent Western epic, *Blood Meridian*. But I bring him up because, reading this book, I similarly felt a strong sense, despite their wildly different tones and philosophies, that McCarthy uses prose in the same way Anderson uses mise-en-scène— that is, to create substance through style.\n\nEvery chapter of *Blood Meridian* opens with a brief synoptic heading that summarizes the main upcoming events. As when Shakespeare reveals the tragic ending of *Romeo and Juliet* within the prologue, this lets the reader know that this is not a story where the exact plot beats are particularly important, or where suspense and the element of surprise are particularly important tools in its toolbox. This is very much a “journey rather than the destination” type of book—both figuratively and literally, given how long we spend with these characters simply traveling slowly across the vast American landscape.\n\nAnd the journey is just as mentally challenging for us as it is physically challenging for our “heroes” (in the loosest sense of the word). Out of curiosity, I wrote down every single word I had to look up in a single chapter of the book, and guess how many I had to look up? I’ll tell you: *twenty-five*. This chapter was about twenty pages long, so this meant I was looking up a little more than a word per page. In the interest of length I won’t list them all, but here are five words I had to look up during that chapter:\n\n* **lugubrious** \\- looking or sounding sad\n* **crenellated** \\- having battlements (which are parapets at the top of a wall, a.k.a. the walls with evenly-spaced gaps you see on drawing of castles)\n* **festooned** \\- adorned/decorated\n* **bivouac** \\- set up a temporary camp without cover\n* **butte** \\- an isolated hill with steep sides and a flat top\n\nAs determined I was to really pay attention and get as much as I could out of this book, I eventually got to the point where I’d attempt to just guess the meaning of an unknown word based on vibes and context clues, and only resort to consulting a dictionary if I really couldn’t figure it out (“jakes”, a pretty vital term for the final moments of the book, means outhouse, something I could only barely surmise and had to double-check to ensure I was right).\n\nAdmittedly, this got annoying at times. But I always say I’m a fan of when artists refuse to hold your hand through things, and as difficult as it was, it was absolutely the good kind of difficult that left me with an immense sense of reward and accomplishment. McCarthy’s prose absolutely lives up to the hype; it’s breathtakingly impressive the way that he’s able to repeatedly describe incredibly similar (or “selfsame”, as he’d put it) scenes and landscapes with such exquisite detail and feeling that it never feels like it’s just padding out the length. In fact, let’s just open up the book and pick out a random passage:\n\n>They rode that day through low hills barren save for the scrub evergreens. Everywhere in this high parkland deer leapt and scattered and the hunters shot several from their saddles and gutted and packed them and by evening they had acquired a retinue of half a dozen wolves of varying size and color that trotted behind them singlefile and watched over their own shoulders to see that each should follow in his place. At dusk they halted and built a fire and roasted the deer. The night was much enclosed about them and there were no stars. To the north they could see other fires that burned red and sullen along the invisible ridges. They ate and moved on, leaving the fire on the ground behind them, and as they rode up into the mountains this fire seemed to become altered of its location, now here, now there, drawing away, or shifting unaccountably along the flank of their movement. Like some ignis fatuus bleated upon the road behind them which all could see and of which none speak. For this will to deceive that is in things luminous may manifest itself likewise in retrospect and so by sleight of some fixed part of a journey already accomplished may also post men to fraudulent destinies.\n\nI swear I just opened it up and scanned a couple of pages, but it’s a pretty great example of how McCarthy writes, particularly these long, dry traveling sequences. He loves to compound sentence after sentence into a monstrous, never-ending stream of events: the deers leapt and the hunters shot at them and they gutted them and they got a pack of wolves following them and the wolves were watching each other. It’s exhausting and causes everything to blend together, which is exactly what happens when you’re on the road for days and weeks and focused on nothing except getting from Point A to Point B and ideally not dying along the way. And then, at the end of it, he pulls out some freakin’ Latin, likening their campfire to a “ignis fatuus” (i.e. will o’ wisp) whose apparent shifting nature reflects the way in which the characters’ are led astray by false shifting destinies (such as, for example, manifest destiny).\n\nAnd that paragraph is on the easier end of things, as it happens not to contain much in the way of archaic, obscure language. A huge chunk of the book is like this, and when things finally happen it’s visceral and revolting, and it passes by quickly and bluntly. Whole towns will be massacred in the span of about ten words. They pass by a tree of dead babies, and then move on, it never to be mentioned again. It’s not a book for the faint of heart, or even the normal of heart; you’ve got to be willing to stomach some pretty gruesome stuff to get through this book.\n\nEven more so than the physical violence, however, the truly disturbing thing in this book is just how utterly, hopelessly cynical it is. I realize I’ve made it more than ten paragraphs into this review and not mentioned a single character by name. To be fair, though, that isn’t hard when the protagonist doesn’t even have one. And his namelessness clues us in to the fact that he’s not so much meant to be read as an individual human being as he is an avatar for Man itself, at war with the inherent violence inside of him—represented by the terrifying, massive, hairless Judge Holden, one of literature’s greatest villains.\n\nIf you’ve heard anything about this book it’s probably about him. That was certainly the case for me, so it surprised me when I got more than halfway through the book and he still seemed to mostly stay in the background. But gradually he starts coming into focus with his grandiloquent speeches and his declarations of worldview, which can be best summed up with one of the most famous quotes from the book (emphasis mine): “Seen so, war is the truest form of divination. It is the testing of one's will and the will of another within that larger will which because it binds them is therefore forced to select. War is the ultimate game because war is at last a forcing of the unity of existence. *War is god*.”\n\nJudge Holden is the god of war. Actually, he simply is God, that divine being that grants us our existence (says Holden at one point, “whatever in creation exists without my knowledge exists without my consent”), and its meaning, and to him war is the only meaning there is. No one except our protagonist (known only as “The Kid”) is able to stand up to him, because none of them can prove him wrong. The Glanton Gang quickly goes from slaughtering hostile Apaches to slaughtering indiscriminately: they are worshippers at the church of war themselves.\n\nBut even The Kid (and later, The Man) isn’t, in the end, able to defeat The Judge. Having become a shell of a man after his experience in the gang, The Man eventually runs into The Judge again at a saloon after several decades. One of the great mysteries of this novel is what exactly The Judge does to The Man at the end, but whatever happens to The Man, we know what becomes of The Judge: he returns to the dance floor and he says, over and over again, that he never sleeps and that he will never die.\n\nSo that’s this book, and McCarthy himself, in a nutshell: war is the inherent state of man, and there is no resisting it. It’s an awful fucking conclusion, and I couldn’t stop thinking about it for days afterwards. So far as I can tell, though, he doesn’t appear to be wrong—look at what’s happening in the world right now, after all, after the so-called “end of history”.\n\nSo what’s the point, then? Is it just utter nihilism? Should we all just live like The Judge? I sure hope that’s not what McCarthy saying, and luckily I don’t think it is. The Man may not defeat the Judge, but until the very end he never succumbs to his worldview. Maybe he does eventually—a common interpretation of the ending is that he kills the missing girl that’s earlier mentioned. But it’s made ambiguous for a reason, and if you want to be optimistic, maybe you could say The Man held steadfast against The Judge. Struggling against one’s inherent violent nature may be a futile, Sisyphean task, but one must imagine Sisyphus happy.\n\nOr maybe that’s all wrong, I don’t know. There’s something both enticing and frustrating about reaching the end of a rich, dense text and realizing I’ve yet to even scratch the surface of what it has to offer. One day I’m sure I’ll find myself coming back to it, but for now, this first reading was a fantastic introduction to one of the great contemporary American authors, and a beautiful showcase of the some of the most substantive style in the English language that I’ve ever read.",

      "text": "I just finished *The Law of Love* by Laura Esquivel, the author of *Like Water for Chocolate.* Sometimes, I like to read discussions around a book after I finish and was surprised to find how little discourse there was for this book. I know it's an old book (came out almost twenty years ago) but Laura Esquivel is a well regarded author, and *The Law of Love* has a unique format (some might argue a gimmick) and an interesting premise. I guess I was just surprised to discover that she's a one hit writer in the US, where I live. *Like Water for Chocolate* has over 385 thousand ratings on goodreads and over 24 thousand on storygraph. *The Law of Love* barely has four thousand on goodreads and basically only 300 on storygraph. I know that it's normal for some readers to drop off, but for her subsequent novel to only get like 10% of the amount of ratings... that seems like a steep drop.\n\n*Like Water for Chocolate* was pretty popular in the US during the 90's. I was a kid and even I knew about it. My older sister read it in school, which is how I eventually ended up with the copy to read when I was a older. I assumed that Esquivel had continued success in the US that I was unaware of, but I guess not.\n\nI can see why some writers only have one hits. No one thought EL James had any staying power (though, technically, I guess she had three hits). And, some writers just publish one novel in their life time. But, I'm curious about the surprising one hit writers like Esquivel- talented, well received, sold a ton of copies, their novel got turned into a movie, is still loved and respected enough that people are reading their hit, but for some reason, there's very little interest in their subsequent books. \n\nWho are some of your surprising one hit writers and why do you think the general public lost interest?\n\nI do recognize that Laura Esquivel is a Mexican writer, living and writing in Mexcio. Just because she is known for one book in the US, does not make her a one hit writer globally. If you're outside the US, I would also love to know what prolific American writers are known for just one hit in your country.",

Will the villain fall into the lava? That kind of thing.\n\nBut then, as I grew up (and maybe watch too many movies), you start noticing other stuff — like how a shot is framed, how long a scene holds, how an actor delivers a line. Suddenly the plot doesn’t even matter that much anymore — you're just vibing with the craft. I could watch two people argue about soup for 90 minutes and call it art.\n\nAnyway, I’m new to reading books and I think I’m still in my “is the dog gonna make it home?” phase. I mostly care about the plot. But I keep wondering: is there a next level to this? Like, do experienced readers start noticing things that go completely over my head?\n\nStuff like language, structure, rhythm, whatever the book version of cinematography is?\n\nAnd more importantly: can a book be good even if the plot isn’t your thing? I’ve seen movies where the story bored me but the filmmaking blew my mind — does that happen with books too?\n\nCurious to hear from people who’ve been reading longer than I have.

      "text": "I finished the book a while back and I’m about to start god emperor, but in the time between the books, I found myself hating this certain choice the author made. So full spoilers for children of dune I guess. \n\nIt’s the fact that Leto is becoming/becomes a worm. I understand that the author wanted to experiment with ideas of how far humanity could be stretched before we stop considering them human and the such but I feel like dune is definitely not the series to do that with. (I guess it was done a bit with the idea of the kwisats haderach but at the end of the day, Paul is still human with abilities)\n\nI just don’t understand. Why make him a worm? I suck at describing it but like just why?\n\nI feel like dune was at its best when it was about the struggles of humanity and tyranny. But now it just feels like I’m reading poorly written body horror. Maybe if Herbert wrote something else and explored these topics it would be ok. But exploring the topic through this manner in dune just feels out of place. And useless because it’s already being explored with the gholas. \n\nAlso why a worm specifically? It has a deific aspect to the fremen, but from a writing standpoint it doesn’t make sense. Leto and his father were already deified. I don’t understand why the author would replace one deific image for another. Especially when it has no effect other than giving him temporary abilities. I wish the author had just left Leto alone in terms of his transformation. \n\nHe could have replaced the powers Leto used to destroy the qanats with anything. A rogue group of fremen that decide to follow Leto due to exteme zealotry. Leto riding a worm through the qanats. Leto making a bomb with a shield generator and a lasgun to destroy the qanats. Anything. The powers he got from the sand trout are so useless idk why they’re even in the book\n\nAlso I feel like the bene gesserit training allowing for a human to live in symbiosis with an animal is completely an ass pull. It’s literally not even mentioned a single time in the previous two books. \n\nIt felt like I was watching a movie or something where an athlete wants to become stronger and he’s training throughout the whole movie, but at the end just randomly turns into a bull with no foreshadowing or the topic being related to the movie and says “Guess I’m stronger than a human now”",

      "title": "The fifteen books that I have read in 2024 ",
      "text": "I would like to share the books I have read this year with a brief review of each, and would love to hear responses and especially opposing opinions.  The list is from most recently finished to oldest.  This is very general so as to not give away any spoilers.\n\n1: Never Let Me Go, by Kazuo Ishiguro\n\nIn my opinion this is overrated, but consistently makes it to the top of most \"Best Books of...\" lists.  I thought all the dialogue and drama between the children seemed contrived and unnatural.  There was nothing special about the prose or language, and I was rather bored for most of the book.  I did like the ending as it gave more context and I can see how it would make some people very emotional.\n\n2: A Movable Feast, by Earnest Hemmingway\n\nI love Hemmingway, but when I read this I did not realize that this was non-fiction, but I actually loved it.  Hemmingway talks about his interactions in 1920's Paris with other artists and writers, at a time in his life where he had not yet enjoyed much commercial success.\n\n3: Jane Eyre, by Charlotte Bronte\n\nMy favorite book of this year.  I absolutely love the language, prose, and the storyline.  It's about a girl that grows up in a kind of rough childhood as an orphan and a potential gentleman love interest that she meets, who could be described as unattractive.  I read this on Kindle.  I have a great vocabulary, but still had to consult the dictionary frequently (and I love this).\n\n4: Atonement, by Ian McEwan\n\nThis may be my second favorite book this year.  The events of the book span about 60 years.  It is about a young, imaginative girl that misinterprets another couple's lovemaking and there are accusations and the effects of this on the family dynamic throughout many years later, including the war.  The ending was very well done.  I love it when an author can do this.  I love when an author can tie up every loose end.  I feel praise for this book is well deserved.\n\n5: Treasure Island, by Robert Louis Stevenson\n\nMost people know the general premise of the story- pirates and treasure.  Some parts were entertaining and others didn't hold my interest.  Overall, I am glad that I read it.\n\n6:  Murder on the Leviathin, by Boris Akunin\n\nThe book is written in Russian and translated into English and is part of a series.  I did not care for Christie's *And Then There Were None*, but I thoroughly enjoyed this book.  It is a murder mystery that in my opinion is much better done than the aformentioned book.\n\n7: Baudolino, by Unberto Eco\n\nI have not read *In the Name of the Rose.*  Baudolino is originally in Italian.  Its about a peasant boy adopted by a Roman Emperor and is quite an epic story.  Some of the politics and the sacking of cities and stuff had a little trouble drudging through.  The second half of the book takes on a little more fantasy elements, which I enjoyed more.  It's a longer book, around 600 pages, and it took me two months but I was also reading others at the same time.  When I finally finished I was glad I read it.  I don't know that I'm in a rush to read his other novel that I mentioned.  I suppose you could call this historical fiction, but I don't know enough about this time in history to tell which parts are based on real events.\n\n8: The Fellowship of the Ring, by J R R Tolkien\n\nI have read the series about 4 times in my life and started again.  I plan to read The Two Towers later this year.  Always fun and an easy read (though I have heard some people say they have trouble with the language).  In my opinion this series is the marker by which all other books in this genre are measured.  Tolkien was a genius in the same way that others describe Terry Pratchett, though I have not actually read any of his books yet.\n\n9: Salem's Lot, by Stephen King\n\nThis was my first King book.  I have just started 11/22/63 which was written around 30-35 years later, and I though that the more recent one was more polished.  It's about a sleepy Maine town with a vampire problem.  I have not yet formed an opinion on King and do not want to do so prematurely.  I know he is well loved.  This is a long book over 600 pages and found it a very easy read and entertaining, though not the type of book I normally read.\n\n10: Grave Descend, by Michael Crichton\n\nThis was an Ebook which was available on Hoopla.  I have always found Crichton fun.  I don't have much to say about this.  It was short, around 120 pages if I recall.  I would describe it as unmemorable.\n\n11:  The Martian, by Andy Weir\n\nThis is an author who is well loved by many and is about an astronaut that is accidentally left behind on Mars, hence \"The Martian.\"  Many of the situations were pretty unplausible but somewhat based in science.  The book lacks character development, and has a very plain prose, and I was falling asleep by then end.  I would say I prefer the movie MUCH more.  Sometimes I wonder how a book attains as much success as it does.\n\n12:  Notes From the Underground, by Fyodor Dostoevsky\n\nHe may be my favorite author.  This is a shorter read and requires less commitment than his much longer novels.  It is about a lowly ranking public servant Petersburg, Russia, I believe in the late 19th century.  The man lives in poor conditions and is looked down upon by his peers.  I don't love this nearly as much as his more acclaimed works, but definitely worth the few hours it takes to read.\n\n13: Jurassic Park, by Michael Crichton\n\nThis is probably the novel I have read the most times in my life, this and LOTR.  The Spielberg flick with the same title is based on this.  The book is much darker than the film and the characters are different.  Spielberg took some liberties for the sake of making it more cinematic.  I love everything Crichton and liked the film equally.  The book is much more technical and science based than the movie, and in my opinion is MUCH better executed than *The Martian.*\n\n14:  Tender is the Night\n\nI read *The Great Gatsby* in high school and do not remember much.  This novel is somewhat based on Fitzgerald's life.  The novel is set in the 1920's and is about a psychiatrist who marries one of his patients and the story centers around their private life as well as their interactions in their circle of friends.  The protagonist's alcoholism complicates his life as well as his mentally ill wife.  I don't remember *Gatsby*, but some say that this one is his masterpiece.  I listened to part of this as an audiobook (and read at the same time) and though I don't remember the narrator's name, her ability to portray the different accents and speak French added much more to my experience.  After reading this I listened to several biographies of his life on YouTube and added more context.  Highly recommended.\n\n15: If on a Winter's Night a Traveler, by Italo Calvino\n\nThe premise of this book is interesting, and about the reader's experience reading a book and searching for it when it is lost.  It is a little difficult to follow with the shifting narrative/perspective.  I don't remember it well (maybe because I did not care for it much), but if you enjoy books that are \"different,\" then you may have fun with this one.\n\nSo there you have it.  I am not as prolific of a reader as some other people, but I also tend to favor longer non-fiction novels, and some days only read 10-20 pages.  I think it is hard for someone to argue that they have no time for reading.  As I said I welcome discussion.\n\nEDIT:  I also DNF'd a book-  Deathless, by Catherynne Valente.  I only got about 15 or 20% into the book.  It is about a young girl who watches her older sisters being married off.  The suiters are chicks that fall from trees and morph into young, handsome men and knock on her door.  There is of course more which I have forgotten.  It adopts fairy tale elements and they may be based off of existing stories.  I have not sold or donated the book yet, so perhaps at some time I will give it another go.  \n\nI rarely DNF a book.  I always do a little research first and read excerpts first.  In this case I only read a single sentence comparing it to some other author that I like.  This is why I prefer to not go into a book blind.  Then, when I read 30 or 40% of a book and decide I don't like it, I feel committed to reading it because of all of the time I spent.",

      "text": "I am not that slow a reader. I can finish reading a contemporary novel in about a week so this book should have taken around 2 months.\n\nBut the read was ~~tedious~~ for me. It was enjoyable, but definitely not something i could read for more than an hour a day. And I did read other books in between too. But i kept at at. It was surely an interesting book given that it was written almost 200 years ago. \n\nThe psychological aspect of the book especially during when Dantes is in prison was really well written but then it gets more into the social drama aspects of it. \n\nI didn't really dig the revenge aspect of the book. For all the rage, intensity, and means that the count comes to Paris with, the ending was a little lukewarm. \n\nThere was melodrama in places were it could have been subtle, but in the end where I was looking for some fierce eye to eye revenge, ,there was none. Maybe that was the point of the book's success and it being so relevant even today.\n\n**EDIT:**\n\nI should have put more thought into this post and should have written it better. I will try again.\n\nTedious was a wrong word, should have used *rigorous*. It was such because the intensity of the book never goes down. Thus making it difficult to grasp more a bit on single sitting for me. I mostly read at night for an hour or maximum two. But with TCoMC, I couldn't even do that much because after each dramatic element being grasped I need that much time to get to the next. \n\nThis shows the power of effective writing. I loved the psychological approach of even the simplest of thoughts and actions of the count and sometimes other characters. It was a little off-putting when Franz D'epinay became the character through which the story is told, but by that time we come to believe the quality of the story for us to doubt it. \n\nWhat I meant by not appreciating the revenge aspect of the book was that the way the revenge was exacted felt not punchy enough, or I didn't feel satisfied with it. I knew what the book was about before even starting to read.\n \nThough I didn't expect Kill Bill's roaring rampage of vengeance, I did expect it to have more power to it, and the 4 perpetrators to face the wrath of the count in a more vicious way. \n\nI understand the philosophical stance, moral ambiguity, and the psychological depth of Edmond Dantes transitioning into the count of Monte Cristo, yet I felt dissatisfied. \n\nThis was a great read. I don't regret a minute I put into reading this. I am sure sometime in the future I will read parts of it. Especially the prison sequence before the transformation of Dantes.",

      "text": "I have two that I recall: one very simple and the other so involved that it might stretch credulity but I can assure you that, at least from my perspective, it happened.\n\nThe first was with William Gibson's 'Idoru'. It was the book I brought along to read on a trip and directly after receiving my ticket I sat down in the terminal and cracked the book open to the chapter I was on and began reading. It was a cute coincidence to find that the character I was reading about was also about to go on a flight, but it certainly became a bit more uncanny when Gibson decided to -- for whatever reason -- mention the seat the character would be in for their flight: the exact same one I'd just been designated. I struggle to recall now but I think it may have been 23? 23B? Something like that. If my books weren't all stored in a box I'd go check just to see how my memory is holding up.\n\nThe second was while reading Carl Sagan's 'Contact'. Anyone who has read the book will know the relevance of transcendental numbers, most notably Pi, to the book. When I was reading the book, it just so happened to be around the time that everyone was excited for the big \"Pi Day\", 3/14/15, which was of special significance to me since my dad was born on 3/14/60. Anyone who knows the story of 'Contact', especially the movie adaptation, will know the significance of fathers to the overall plot.\n\nA few days later I was out for a walk mulling this over and I wrote a very short poem about my dad. I only had a pen, no paper handy, so I jotted it down on my palm and titled it '3.14'. I continued my walk but my course got diverted and I ended up near a group of people, one of whom had just began reciting a string of numbers out loud. Imagine my surprise to realize what he was reciting: the numbers of Pi. I asked him why in the world he was doing such a thing and he explained that he told his friend he had them memorized to \"the *n*th digit\" and was simply proving his claim out loud. I couldn't resist showing him the number I had written on my hand and explained I had jotted it on there maybe 15 minutes prior. \"Quite a coincidence!\" he agreed.\n\nAny of you have similar stories?",

I read *Kindred* years ago and that wasn't like this. *Kindred* was some Sci-Fi, never-could-happen kinda weird wacky stuff that allowed Butler to explore a sort of twinned, historical experience of black people in the U.S. which was super informative and introspective, but *Parable of the Sower* feels so real and it's scary to me that our society could be a stone's throw away from what Lauren has to go through. Even *1984* or *Brave New World*, while they have similarities, are not as detailed and as contemporary as *Parable of the Sower* which is really what gets me the most. I feel like I have to go read *News From Nowhere* to chill out and hope for a better future for our world.\n\nWhat do you do to chill out when books get too real and start to wind you up?

      "title": "I read Cormac McCarthy's \"The Road\", and it was hauntingly beautiful and powerful.",
      "text": "As much as I enjoy reading good novels, they practically never get a true visceral reaction out of me. The closest I got to that was A Farewell to Arms. However, after reading one of Cormac McCarthy's other novels, Blood Meridian (which is amongst my favorites) I really wanted to read the Road. I had watched the movie a while before and I remembered liking it, so I decided to buy the book, and I'm glad I did!\n\nThis story was so interesting to me I read the entire book (almost 300 pages) in less than 2 days. The best word I can describe this book as, is \"haunting\". It's a tragic story of a father doing his absolute best to take care of his son in a post-apocalyptic world full of starvation, violence, cannibalism. Everyone is on the fight for survival. All are trying to take care of themselves or their families. And the main character, simply known as \"the man\", is no exception. He steals and loots for the sake of his son's safety and welfare.\n\nThe two main characters are exceptionally realistic, to the point where it hurts to read. They speak to each other incredibly naturally, like a father would with his young boy to try to make him happy and take care of him. I could easily see my father in the same position as the Man and myself as the Boy, making the same decisions, saying the same things, and thinking the same thoughts. Through their hardships and adventures, they are some of the most deeply personal characters I've seen in a story. It makes sense that this book was inspired by McCarthy's own conversations with his son, since it has such a simple and beautiful genuineness to it, as if these were conversations that were already spoken.\n\nUnlike a lot of McCarthy's other works, it doesn't depict heavy amounts of extreme depravity or sadistic violence, but it mostly consists of the Man and the Boy repeating the cycle of survival. Scavenging for food, searching through abandoned homes and shelters, gathering resources, engaging in conversation with each other, and following the road to the coast. The story is mostly a repeated cycle of this, with some occasional, more intense sequences of suspense sprinkled in carefully. The rare amount of suspense and heavy use of conversations between the Man and the Boy builds up the characters to make them more relatable and understandable, which I think it succeeds exceptionally in doing. By the second half, all I wanted was just for the father and his son to escape, alive and well.\n\nAs for the ending (which I will not spoil), I've never cried to a book until I read The Road. The ending was achingly sad, but I wouldn't say it was bleak or hopeless, unlike Blood Meridian's ending. As tragic as it is, there was an element of hope, joy, and positivity. At the last few pages of the novel, the father talks to his son about \"carrying the fire\" to other people. I am not sure exactly what this means, but I interpreted the act of \"carrying the fire\" as spreading humanity's indomitable will to survive to other people, so they may get through the hardest of times (like the trials the father and son go through together). Kind of like the movie \"Grave of the Fireflies\", I thought it was tragic and heart-wrenching, but not with beauty and hope.\n\nI recommend everyone to give this book a try. It's not for everyone by any means; it may be too repetitive for some, or too depressing for others, but it's a powerful experience that you should experience at least once. I would love to hear everyone's thoughts on this novel!",

Great books, really fun, good pacing and easy to read. But nothing too heady or intellectually rigorous.  \n\nEven still, after five years or more of only reading for work or reading news articles, my attention span was shot and I had to set mini goals to keep reading. Like I wouldn’t let myself stop until I read 5 pages, or until I got to the next page break, or the end of a chapter. As a voracious reader in my twenties and early 30s (I’m 43 now) I was shocked by how much difficulty I had finishing a chapter from a simple book. I DNF’d more books than I’d care to admit before getting back in the saddle, so to speak. \n\nWhich brings me to this guy I had never heard of called Cormac McCarthy. Holy effing shit how did I live 43 years without hearing of this guy Cormac McCarthy. I picked up No Country for Old Men on a whim. I had watched the film over the summer when my wife and I went on a Coen brothers film spree. The movie was good, the book blew me away. The depiction of Anton, particularly toward the end of the novel, was one of the most chilling and engrossing things I’d ever read, and led to me significantly reorient my conception of the human experience. Wow! Blew me away. \n\nSince then I’ve read Outer Dark and All the Pretty Horses. Outer Dark was bleak as hell and not something I’d want to repeat, but All the Pretty Horses immediately became one of my favorite books of all time. The way this man could paint a picture in my brain is beyond impressive. I don’t understand at all his talent for words. I don’t know how a person can put a few sentences together in such a way that I can read them again and again and get more out of it every time. He accomplishes so much with no wasted words or thoughts. The meticulous care it must take to craft such a thing is not something I can understand, but I sure appreciate it as a reader. And the final scene… holy shit I probably read the last two pages a dozen times. \n\nI’m a few chapters into The Crossing right now and so far it’s also beautiful and highly evocative. I’m planning to finish this trilogy and then move onto The Road and Blood Meridian. I will probably read a few lighter books in amongst those, for the sake of my sanity. \n\nAnyway, just came here to say that Cormac McCarthy is a real good author and I’m glad I found his works. I know what to ask for for Christmas this year.",

I'm going to be honest and say that, while I know it's a good book and an iconic one, I thought I wouldn't really feel for it. I thought that it wouldn't be “in my league” and I expected it to be similar to Judy Blume, but very heavy on certain elements. The second I opened it and read the first line, I said “Holy shit…” out loud, and I almost never react verbally or physically to a book.\n\nLine:\n\n>\"I am writing to you because she said you listen and understand and didn’t try to sleep with that person at that party even though you could have.”\n\nI've read some first lines that go pretty hard, but there's just something about this, whether it's the wording or vibe, that just… hurts. That's the only word I can give, it just plain hurts.\n\n>“I am writing to you because she said you listen and understand and didn’t try to sleep with that person at that party even though you could have. Please don’t try to figure out who she is because then you might figure out who I am, and I really don’t want you to do that. I will call people by different names or generic names because I don’t want you to find me.”\n\nAnd it feels real, like this is actually a teenager out there and they hurt. It captures something most books don't with teenage characters, or pained characters in general. It almost feels like I shouldn't be reading this, even though it does nothing to push me away. And it actively involves me because maybe it is actually for me and maybe I am the one he was sent to, and I was simply drunk at the party and don't remember, and I'm getting this message too late. It's unlike any other diary or letter formatted book I've read, and I'm going hard for The Color Purple and We Need To Talk About Kevin right now. \n\nI don't see this opening get talked about so I really hope I'm not alone here.

      "text": "So I've been on a reading binge lately, and something I noticed was that newer books tend to have a lot less setting and character description and are more focused on dialogue and action/movements. I just finished a book where I was constantly struggling to imagine anything in the room with the characters, what the characters were wearing, and even what time of day it was. And while it seems like this was meant to make it easier to get to the meat of the story/action, in reality, it made it *much* harder to focus on the story because I couldn't see anything at all with my mind's eye. I had to keep making up the setting myself if I wanted to \"see\" the story like a movie, which actually took way more work than if the author had described it in expanded detail.\n\nAfter finally finishing that book, I switched to an older novel that was extremely descriptive, which made it longer than it would have been without those details of course, but it was actually *much* easier to focus as it felt like my brain could relax and just envision what was described instead of create it and then try to remember the details it created and then try to envision that consistently. With more description, even though the book is longer and even the language is more complex, it feels easier to read.\n\nI thought this was pretty interesting and wanted to see if others noticed a similar experience. It's almost like too short of a book with simpler language was giving me a headache because it was ultimately more work from my side of it. It kind of made me frustrated with the author even though I enjoyed the book!",

It's in 3 parts, 20 chapters each.  \nRecently, I got my wife to watch the Disney version of \"20,000 leagues under the sea\" and convinced her to watch the 1961 version of \"The Mysterious Island\" I vaguely remember as a kid. The movie has everything: Giant crabs, pretty women, a wee bit 'o sci-fi. Good stuff.   \n  \nThen I decided to read the book. Are there spoilers in a 150 year old book? I think not. But stop reading if you do.\n\nOK, no giant anything, no women, barely any Nemo, but there is a volcano and an orangutan. Just a GREAT frigging book about how important it is to be educated in practical sciences. The guys built a paradise from nearly nothing.\n\nLong read, outdated language, but a damn fine book.",

My experience differed both times- when I was young I had no relation to these emotional women, yet. When I was older I understood this film of heartbreak and tragedy.

      "title": "I read The Perks of Being a Wallflower and oh boy, I have so many things to say! ",
      "text": "During the Christmas holidays, one of my aunts gifted me a copy of \"The Perks of Being A Wallflower\". Need I to say anything more? I think that the majority of people have heard about this book. Personally, although I was familiar with it, I never had the chance or interest to read it. But now I did. And I have so much to say. Beware because this post is long! \n\n\n##**Writing style**\n\nI think that I'll start with the writing style. I absolutely _LOVE_ reading books in the diary format. As someone who has been keeping diaries throughout the years, from the age of six till sixteen, I have a special attachment with books that are written as a diary. This style allowed me to connect more with Charlie since he describes everything from his point of view. \n\nI found the writing to be quite charming. I had read some complaints on Goodreads' reviews about it, which said that Charlie spoke like a very young child instead of a 15 years old boy. Personally, I found no issue with that. Yes, I admit that at times some phrases would be repetitive but I didn't mind the wording. Trust me, when I was 15 years old, I didn't write any better on my diaries. You _don't_ want to see what I wrote, unless you want to cringe. Charlie was a 15 years old boy who wanted to find a way to express his bottled thoughts and communicate with someone. Last time I checked, a teenager wouldn't write on his diary as if he were Charles Dickens or Jane Austen. I actually related with Charlie in that aspect because when I would write on my diary, I would pretend I was writing to another person and my thoughts would be all over the place, jumping from one topic to another. The simplicity of Charlie's words didn't bother me at all. I understand why some people found it weird, especially considering that Charlie was praised for his essays by his professor but again: writing an essay for school is different than writing on a diary. Besides, there were many times when the writing became more serious and there were many quotes that hit me very hard. \n\n\n##**Characters**\n\nThe characters are definitely one of the strongest (if not the strongest) aspects in this book. They had their flaws, they had their own demons to deal with but it was still very interesting to follow their evolution. With one way or another, most of them ended up changing a little compared to how I met them at the beginning. Especially Charlie. \n\nLet me tell you something: I am 18 years old and I have just finished high school. Actually, in October I'll start going to university and study psychology, my major. As you can tell, I am not as old as Charlie. And I can't say that I related with him insome aspects because I had a good experience in my first year in high school (minus covid), I don't carry the same trauma with Charlie, I always have great times with my relatives...And yet, I felt connected with him, in some weird way. There were times in my life when I felt awkward or anxious like Charlie did. When I was younger, I remember that sometimes it would become quite difficult to socialise with other people, despite me being a sociable person most of the time. I am also good at paying attention to those around me, even when it seems like I don't. Like Charlie, I think that I can observe other people and read them (especially in school, I always did that when I noticed strange behaviors from classmates). At no point my anxiety or awkwardness matches Charlie's, but still, I kinda found myself in him. \n\nI feel like I could write a whole essay about Charlie. He is the type of character to whom I immediately feel drawn to. What can I say, characters who are trying to fit into society and navigate through their lives while trying to deal with their problems have a soft place in my heart. I was really rooting for Charlie, since the first pages. I really wanted him to find more people who would make him feel comfortable with himself and open up more. I desperately wanted him to love himself. There were times when I felt happy, when things went well. And then I felt anxious if things didn't turn so good. At some points I was even angry. But most importantly, I just wanted to reach out (metaphorically of course) and hug Charlie. Because I wanted him to know that he was loved. That it's okay to care about yourself. And that he was not alone. \n\n>I just wish that God or my parents or Sam or my sister or someone would just tell me what's wrong with me. Just tell me how to be different in a way that makes sense. To make this all go away. And disappear. I know that's wrong because it's my responsibility, and I know that things get worse before they get better because that's what my psychiatrist says, but this is a worse that feels too big.\n\nThis quote right here broke me. I was bawling my eyes out for five minutes after I read it. I truly pitied Charlie there. I really did. I can't imagine how horrible it is to feel bad about ourselves and try to find the reason why we are wrong. Especially for a teenager, this must be really tragic. Charlie felt suffocated by himself and he desperately wanted to become more normal. He wanted to fit in and find some kind of comfort. His journey was truly remarkable. He become more mature (mentally and emotionally), he strengthens the relationship with his family, he finds new friends and at the very end, he owns his trauma and decides to be a better person and not let his past define him. He moves on and he follows his own path. And for that, I felt extremely proud of him. \n\nAs I said, the rest of characters were very interesting. I think they added a lot to the story and Charlie's development. The dynamic with his family was both sad yet sweet because it was clear that his parents and siblings cared about each other. I really liked that the parents, despite their bad upbringing and toxic families, broke the cycle of abuse and raised their children with the best way they could. They were not perfect but they were not horrible either. \n\nFor the most part, I really enjoyed Charlie's friendship with Sam and Patrick. It was so nice to see that he was finally comfortable doing activities out of his comfort zone, picking new interests and feeling like he belonged to a group. Truth be said, there were times when I didn't like Sam and Patrick's antics. Them isolating Charlie after he kissed Sam instead of Mary Elizabeth didn't feel that good with me and they were pretty much irresponsible around him, like allowing him to smoke or do LSD. And the kiss between Patrick and Sam wasn't great but yeah. I totally understand that they had their own problems. They were 18 years old trying to find their own place in this world while dealing with their trauma. Yes, their actions weren't always the best but I could justify them to some extent. They still played a fundamental role in Charlie's growth and they gave him many happy memories. They cared for him, I think this is more than clear and they showed him what it feels like to belong somewhere. \n\n##**Charlie's trauma**\n\nAnd now let's talk about Charlie's trauma...Honestly, why do so many people overlook this? I have seen the book or the movie being advertised as a cheesy, coming-of-age experience but this far from the actual truth. I had no idea that sexual abuse and child molestation such important themes in the book and that Charlie himself had been sexually abused by his aunt.  It was truly heartbreaking to see him realising the hard truth. Throughout the book he has been praising his aunt, highlighting their relationship and how much of an impact her death had on him, how guilty he felt because of her death...and then boom. I found the portrayal of Charlie's PTSD very realistic and I think that this is not being brought up enough when it comes to the book/movie. Why do so many people choose to ignore this? \n\n##**Conclusion**\n\nSo, I am done. I have so much left to say but I think that'll do it. This book has been stuck on my mind and I really think that it will become one of my favourites. It has many poignant lessons and themes and I would definitely recommend it to someone. I think that it's important to keep in mind that you are not defined by your trauma only or how you grew up. What matters is how *you* choose to keep up with your life and what kind of person you'll become. It's not always easy. But it's not impossible. \n\nAlways remember: we are infinite.",

      "text": "Murakami never says things like \"He pulled out a cigarette\", \"He poured himself a soda\" or \"we drove past a few burger joints\". He always says \"He pulled out a Marlboro\", \"He poured himself a Perrier\" and \"we drove past a few McDonalds\". In Kafka on the Shore, >!mascots become real characters who drive the plot like Johnnie Walker and the KFC Colonel!<. I've heard people say that it's some kind of critique of consumerism and Japan's loss of soul but to me at least it does not feel critical, it just feels acknowledged. If anything it sometimes feels elevated in a Warholian still-life sort of way. I'm not sure why he does that myself, but the effect it has on me as a reader is that it blurs the line between the book's universe and my universe. It's rare for books or movies to dwell so much on real brands so when it does happen it really anchors the universe to our reality and our everyday experience, which makes the bizare stuff that happens in his books feel more real. I remember watching a movie called \"Escape from Tomorrow\" (2013) which was filmed guerilla-style in Disneyland and there was a scene where >!the main character is tied up on a bed inside a spooky lab and is being experimented on by an android. The scene is generally pretty goofy and stereotypical but the fact that the lab is located inside a real attraction in Disneyland and that the android and the lab machines both have a large SIEMENS logo on them makes it really bizarre for me. It really felt like I was seeing real found footage from some kind of weird corporate conspiracy!<. Murakami's books produce a similar effect. But that's just me, what do you think?",

I wonder if they would feel different about the story if they read the book. \n\nAnyways, I went looking through this sub and it seems this book is either loved or hated. I liked the story, I definitely don't hate it but my biggest issue with this story is the ending. I don't care that it's noy realistic that a child grows up alone, that she becomes a famous author and all that stuff. I don't need a book/story to be a carbon copy of life these things to me make stories more interesting.\n\nThis book felt like 2 different stories to me. A YA story of a young girl growing up on her own anda murder mystery and I personally enjoyed the murder mystery part more. Unfortunately it was rushed. Then the worst part for me is the ending. I was rooting for Kya the whole time and I won't lie I cared for her. Her story is so tragic you can't help caring for her. But then we get this \"I'm so clever\" twist from the author that it was Kya who killed Chase and she wrote a disturbing poem about it really tainted the whole story for me. This girl I cared about this whole time was a cold blooded killer and why because she almost got.. if you read it you know what happened. So the author thinks that's enough to murder someone got it. \n\nFor me personally the book would have been so much better if it had ended when she pictured her mom walking away and finally turning around and waving back goodbye. But the author was too vindictive and too clever for her own good. This is a definite a book I'll never recommend. \n\nLastly the title feels forced I don't know what if name it but it wouldn't be Where The Crawdads Sign.",

      "text": "I have always loved reading, but in recent months - and, to be honest, even years - I have had troubles spending much time with books. Part of this is for sure the ease of turning on the computer and watching/listening to videos and podcasts while knitting, but also, maybe part of it is also the books themselves I have tried to read. Maybe something there wasn't clicking for whatever reason.\n\nToday I happened to find in a second-hand bookshop Agatha Christie's And then there ere none, a book I have read in my youth and enjoyed. I bought it without hesitation and once I got home, I immediately started reading it. I didn't even plan to read it, I just intended to flip through it a bit and then place in my shelf to return to it ~later~. But it was so easy to simply read a sentence - then another one - and then lo and behold, I had read almost 100 pages in one sitting, effortless and wonderful. I'm loving it, both the book and the dearly missed experience of just diving into a story without a thought, without reading fatigue, without having to *try* to be engrossed in the book.\n\nWell, that's basically it - the point of this post was to just express my joy and relief of loving a reading experience again. If I weren't so eager to return to my book, I would love to write a longer post around the question why reading can be so difficult these days and why certain books seem to draw me out of the reading sludge - and why this book in particular managed it so easily. But I actually find myself at that happy place right now where I ACTUALLY want to put my phone down and grab the book, and I'm not going to sabotage such a good thing!\n\nHowever, I'd love to read your thoughts on this book, on why you love it or hate it, on your experience reading and rereading it. Maybe your thoughts on difficulties to get immersed in books as a fairly recent phenomenon, if that's something you experience. As I'm actively trying to limit my phone time, I probably won't necessarily reply to many comments, but I would indeed like reading your thoughts, if yoy want to share them!",

But what I've found was The Last Vampire bind up and nothing else, so I got it. I'm guessing my book is pretty old, since the series were rebranded into Thirst and my cover is orange.\n\nReading this after slowly going through Vampire Chronicles is wacky. The main character's POV is Lestat x200, but she's also a hot...teen? Between the two books, Sita (the main character's name) claims she's either stuck in eighteen or twenty, which isn't a big difference. But even in the most crucial of moments she never fails to mention how acute her hearing is and how powerful or beautiful she is. Sure, there's a couple of dudes to rival her strength, but if she's not mentioning her abilities, there's always Krishna.\n\nI might be dumb. I am not a history buff. But Aryans in India? Like, white people coming from India? The main character Sita is 5000 years old, born in India and is a white, blue-eyed, long-haied blond. She also had a husband and a daughter before she was turned into the vampire. Which also makes her to be one of the first 10 vampires ever created.\n\nThe whole love bit was hilarious. She just finds herself a teen, steals him from his girlfriend, he gets mortally wounded and then doesn't take to vampirism and sacrfices himself. And by the end of the second book, she makes another, after he told her no, while passing out. Important to mention, there's another highschooler, who is a horror writer and gets cured from AIDS, but he's also not gay, cause he was staring at Sita. He also has prophetic dreams. Smells like a self-insert, yet not the worst one.\n\nWhat also brought me to Anne Rice's vampires, was the creation. In Queen of The Damned, there's a spirit that takes over a body and that condition spreads to other people. Feel free to correct me, but I'm shortening things. In the Last Vampire, a priest calls out to a yakshini, a demon that manifested through a dead pregnant woman (Sita's best friend) and the first vampire is named Yaksha, who is the child in that womb. Vampires also cry blood, vampires are made by the exchange of blood, vampires can hypnotise. Which are simple traits, but the The Last Vampire was published in 1995, so by the time at least the first four Vampire Chronicles books were out. I do not mean to say that there's plagirism, but It was so funny to see the influence.\n\nReading the first two books (around 200 pages each) was fun. Some stuff is certainly r/menwritingwomen worthy, like men objectifying Sita, which turns into 'go get 'em girl' scene, often gory, which was quite fun. It's fun. Reading about different vampires is fun. My eye is twitching though.\n\nI gave it a three. I won't be buying the Thirst covers, because they are abhorrent, so I don't think I'll be reading further. No hater to the author. I apologize for any typos, I am indeed not a native English speaker.",

      "title": "I finished The Count Of Monte Cristo - the judgment of Mercedes is harsh",
      "text": "First, I loved the book and I read the original version. It was a great read, so don't take this as a complaint but more as an observation I want to discuss. \n\nI understand that Monte Cristo himself both has the reason to be the way he is, and also ends up affected and doubtful about the results of his actions. I don't think he is a good person in some aspects, but I can understand why he is the way he is, and it is all written very well - I will address this later. \n\n\nNow to discuss Mercedes' fate, it's important to establish that I believe this book IS a moral story. There is a 3rd party (Dumas') view present in it with an opinion about the characters and things that are happening. The story, while complex and thought provoking, also has an established inner logic where the writer in a way hands out judgment to his characters - the good gets rewarded, the bad punished. This could make a story simplistic, but this is deliberate and consistent with the story themes, so it seems fitting, plus there certainly are grey areas and exceptions, I am not suggesting it is naively written. The characters are three dimensional and don't suffer for it. \n\n\nI am saying this to explain that while in some works, the reader shouldn't see bad things happening to a good character as an issue (I often feel people approach movies and books as if they expect moral lessons), especially if the tone is that of just telling of events and life can suck and be unfair. It might be unpleasant but that's the point. This book is different though and I think it's fair for me to say that the fates of characters do reflect Dumas' own opinions of what they deserve. \n\n\nSo what does Mercedes deserve? Mercedes waited for Dantes, loved him and took care of his father to the best of his ability. The man wanted to die. she also didn't know how bad Fernand was, although one could say she was a bit deliberately naive (the whole \"he is like my brother\" insistence while knowing he's in love with her etc), but not to the point of thinking he did what he did. Mercedes, as a woman of that time, didn't have money or ways to support herself. her choices were simple - either kill herself, wait for Dantes as a beggar, or marry. Considering Fernand seemed to be the only other person she was close with, it made sense, it's not really like she had opportunities in her situation to move somewhere else and get to meet other eligible males. \n\n\nShe raised a good son who loved her, and by all accounts remained a good person. She recognized her true love Edmond at once. \n\nIn my opinion, she was blameless aside from her intense self-deprecation. \n\nIn Monte Cristo's opinion, it's more complex. I was initially unsure what his feelings and intentions towards her would be. It was only after they had that talk in the garden, where he was talking about his lost love and still pretending to be the count, that he said he expected her to wait. \n\nWhen Mercedes comes to beg for Albert's life, they get to talk a bit more, she is incredibly self-deprecating, tells him she loves him etc... while he agrees to let her son live as if it's the world's biggest sacrifice (I was disappointed with him, he was so close to Albert and I was surprised there was no feeling there until Mercedes begged), he is also very cold to her. Finally when Albert apologized to him he decides she has a noble heart, and he does feel bad and does try to help her later which she turns down, but....\n\nBut when MC wants to help someone, he insists, he absolutely emotionally pushes the person to accept. It didn't feel he tried much with her. He did kind of allow her to blame herself. Maybe this is vanity speaking, but I even found it interesting how much she trashes her own appearance, apparently aged by sorrow, and how silent he remains. He tactfully but notably does indicate there are no romantic feelings in him anymore, even as he comforts her, while she ends up alone repeating his name. \n\nIt's also interesting how just after they had their first open conversation, his \"adopted daughter/slave\" Haydee whose character is basically blind worship of him, shows some signs of sexual or romantic attraction and he realizes \"There is another Mercedes.\"\n\nFinally, even after everything, when he reflects on being in prison and hoping his father is alive and his girlfriend is there, he didn't expect \"starvation and *infidelity*.\" He still sees her as unfaithful.\n\nNow look, I understand that getting back with Mercedes could be naive. Or that he can't get over the fact that she married the man who imprisoned him. But I did expect more emotion from his side, more determination to help her. It almost read like (at least according to her) she looks old now, so even though she was supposedly the love of his life, he doesn't even mentally explore the idea of loving her romantically anymore. \n\n\nIt's also interesting how much self-deprecation and degradation came out of her character. Sure, it could be that her character is kind of a pain. But my god, it seems it was the time where characters expressed things like guilt or gratitude in very dramatic ways. While it is true that she decided to give away everything she had, she is doing it out of extreme sense of guilt, which Monte Cristo doesn't really try too hard to lift, and which reads as something Dumas agrees with. In fact, I believe she is \"redeemed\" as a character because she took that course of action, and had she cared about her life and self perseverance, she would be seen as just as bad as Madame Danglars, who got a better ending, but with a clear moral judgment. \n\n\nSo my point is, Dumas does condemn Mercedes, but allows her to redeem herself by becoming ugly, old, alone, with a son who might get killed, broke, and hopelessly longing for Dantes who is now with another woman and will never see her again, and silently accepting this fate. It's maybe among the worst fates of all. And my god does she dwell on how much she's aged and how unattractive she is now, and is completely joyless and depressed. \n\nIt seems that Dumas (and through him, Monte Cristo) believes that the only right thing for her to do was to kill herself back then, which I think is insanely harsh  - it's not like its easy to kill yourself. She went on with life always loving Edmond. It's really harsh to me that this is seen as a sin. \n\nIf Monte Cristo's love on the other hand was really that strong as he wished her was, then he wouldn't fall out of love in such an unforgiving way. It seems Haydee suits him better now as she's basically just a kid he raised who blindly worships the ground he walks on. He resents Mercedes that she didn't worship the ground he walked on so much that suicide was preferable - what kind of love prefers the loved one to die of suicide over having a normal life in your absence? \n\nI don't know I think the count is a bit of a c(o)unt...and an egomaniac.\n\nAnd I feel bad for Mercedes, I wish she had some pride left at the end.",

      "title": "Catch-22 and Slaughterhouse-Five: Comparing the Quintessential Works of American-POV War Satire",
      "text": "In January of this year I read *Slaughterhouse-Five* for the first time and immediately fell in love with Kurt Vonnegut as an author. When I came here to gush about it, one of the first comments was, \"Now you have to read *Catch-22*.\" I took the recommendation seriously and bought the book not long after, but it took a while for me to plow through my existing TBR before I could get to it. Last night I finished my first read of *Catch-22*.\n\nJoseph Heller's style is more verbose than Kurt Vonnegut's, but not unapproachably-so. Both authors use a highly direct (if not intentionally cyclical and redundant) form of prose and dialog, Kurt's just felt slightly more, well, curt. Both authors utilize a non-linear timeline which often shifts several years forward and backward in the blink of an eye. It's not uncommon to get halfway through a paragraph and realize you're several years behind the previous paragraph. This creates a hectic reading headspace which serves as its own literary device, instilling a sense of structured chaos into each chapter.\n\nWhere *Slaughterhouse-Five* largely follows the story of one single character, Billy Pilgrim, *Catch-22* is closer to the story of an entire squadron, with Yossarian as its center of gravity. For me, this made *Catch-22* a little harder to follow in the opening half of the book. But that's not to say that I wasn't enjoying myself! Quite the contrary, that confusion, in *both* books, actually added to the experience for me rather than detracted from it. This felt paradoxical for a while, but as each book came to a close, I had this inkling that it couldn't have been executed any other way.\n\nThe copious character perspective shifts in *Catch-22* gave the story something of a Saturday Night Live effect. I often felt that I was reading a Leslie Nielsen movie, which I'm sure is no accident! As the child of baby boomer parents, I get the impression that *Catch-22* was a critical source of comedic inspiration for countless movies and other media with which my parents grew up, especially my dad. And I have no doubt it inspired *Slaughterhouse-Five* as well, especially knowing that Heller and Vonnegut grew to be good friends over the years. \n\n*Slaughterhouse-Five* had me flopping between laughing my ass off and highly depressed all throughout the book, often within the same chapters. *Catch-22* (for me) felt more comedy first, depression later. There were of course parts to be depressed about sprinkled in throughout the first 2/3 of the book, but it didn't really come crashing down upon me until *that scene* with Kid Sampson and McWatt. From that point until the start of the final chapter, I was suffocated by this fever dream of panic and manic depression.\n\nIn contrast, almost ***all*** of *Slaughterhouse-Five* felt like a fever dream of manic depression, and for my own personal reading tastes, that landed with just a smidge more impact. Though I'll fully acknowledge that unleashing it in more of a whirlwind latter-stage style the way Heller did with *Catch-22* certainly left a stronger impression on me than I was expecting, and the final scene with Snowden left me positively gutted.\n\nBoth authors display an incredible understanding of the human psyche on both an individual level and a group/societal level. Despite the absurd yet hyperbolically simple characterization, I felt that I've known people just like nearly every single character encountered in both books. Both authors also showed off a sense of humor that had me absolutely rolling with laughter, something not easily accomplished through text.\n\nIn conclusion, I've not been shy about expressing my opinion that *Slaughterhouse-Five* is a 10/10 novel, and I absolutely still feel that way now. *Catch-22* still FULLY lived up to the hype, and for me ends with an incredibly strong 9.5/10. I think where *Catch-22* ended up losing points was simply the length. It felt slightly more sloggy in pacing with just a LITTLE too little plot progression, and I didn't quite find myself as magnetically-drawn to picking the book up when it wasn't in my hands the same way that I was with *Slaughterhouse-Five*. \n\nDon't get me wrong, I'm aware plot progression was not the primary goal of Heller's masterpiece. 9.5/10 is still a phenomenal score, and one of the best novels I've ever read for my money. I just preferred the length of *Slaughterhouse-Five* a touch more.\n\nTl;dr - I think if you prefer a slightly more *realistic* and down-to-earth reading experience, *Catch-22* would probably work better for you. If you tend to gravitate towards more fantastical and abstract reading experiences that still FEEL rooted in humanity, you'd probably lean more towards *Slaughterhouse-Five* like me.",

The whole “video game developers over decades” pitch didn’t sound like something I’d connect with. But what I got was a story about friendship, grief, creativity, love (not always romantic), and how people grow apart and come back together in ways that aren’t always neat or dramatic.\n\nZevin’s writing is quiet but really sharp. Some parts felt painfully real, especially the way she handles loneliness and unspoken feelings.

      "text": "A couple months ago, I made a post in r/suggestmeabook asking which of the famous (or infamous) 1000+ page novels were most worth reading. There were of course plenty of awesome suggestions, but *The Count of Monte Cristo* received more than double the upvotes of the next-highest upvoted novel, *Shogun*. I had a few books I still needed to read before cracking into Monte Cristo, but I allowed that post to decide for me that Monte Cristo would be the one I'd try first.\n\nAll I can say upon finishing it today is that it more than surpassed my expectations, and it might genuinely be the most well-crafted story I've read to date (and I say that with great excitement toward those I intend to read in the future). Now, that doesn't mean I think it was the most well-*written* story I've ever read, but the tale that Alexandre Dumas assembled with this masterpiece is nothing short of everything I wanted from it and more.\n\nI was warned by a couple of people to expect a few hundred pages of slow pacing in the middle of the book, and to be fair to those comments, there is a distinct section which requires a LOT of buildup in order to properly place each domino one by one prior to unleashing the emotional hurricane of events with the fall of that first domino. But oh my lord even those slower pages in the middle still had their ups and downs, and as somebody who loves delayed gratification in stories, I still felt that those setup pages carried plenty of their own weight.\n\nAs I thought about that large section of character mapping and acquaintance making in the middle, I realized that this story's original serialized publication *must* have had some impact on how a story this long was able to hold my attention so firmly even through its slow parts of plot development. Each installment only being a chapter or two long, I have to imagine that was an element of consideration for Dumas, in making sure that there was always something worth reading in every subsequent release.\n\nNow that's not to say that a novel of this length HAS to be serialized in order to stay interesting, I'm sure there are countless examples that stand against that. But even with that being said, I can't help but wonder how differently an author approaches a story they're writing when they know it's being released in small chunks rather than all at once.\n\nOverall, this was basically a perfect story for me. Of course, there are some things to be nitpicky about from a 21st century perspective, but you have to expect that when you're reading something over 150 years old. 9.5/10 and I will immensely look forward to rereading this again and again later down the line.",

I fell in love with this series when I first read it in March and it really brought me back into reading after a couple years of struggling to read as much as I used to pre-2020. I feel like I read this series at the perfect time to get back.\n\n* ***Onyx Storm*** by Rebecca Yarros\n\nI've read each book in the series as its come out. I've always loved dragon rider books and romantasies so getting them combined into one has been an incredible experience. I've only ever listened to the audiobooks and that's how I'll be enjoying *Onyx Storm* as well!\n\n* ***A Language of Dragon****s* by S.F. Williamson\n\nI don't think I've heard too many people talk about this book but it's essentially an alternate history if dragons roamed the Earth. I've heard it's perfect for fans of *Fourth Wing* and *Babel*. Even though I haven't read the latter yet, it's on my longlist of a TBR. The marketing tag line immediately drew me in:\n\n>Every act of translation requires sacrifice. Welcome to Bletchley Park . . . with dragons.\n\n* ***Sunrise on the Reaping*** by Suzanne Collins\n\nI've been a *Hunger Games* fan since before the first movie came out. I never thought that Suzanne Collins would write about Haymitch's games and I'm very interested to see what story she has chosen to tell. I have so many theories and ideas bouncing around in my head and I'm eagerly awaiting the release. Also I'm probably going to be booking a couple of days off of work to read this uninterrupted.\n\nWhat are your most anticipated releases and let me know why!",

      "title": "Dear crime authors: stop trying to *force* romance in your stories",
      "text": "I love reading crime novels. The thrills I get while I'm invested in a good plot, the various theories and suspicions I have, the mind games between the characters, the cat-mouse chase, the mystery aspect...I have read various crime novels throughout the years and to my own disappointment, a chunk of them will have romance which I certainly did not ask for. \n\nFirst and foremost I want to clarify that I'm not against authors who can write good romances in crime novels. Just because you are writing a specific genre, that doesn't mean you are forbidden to try something new. The problem is that most of the time, it's painfully clear that the author doesn't know how to create good chemistry between the two parts that are involved and thus, it comes of awkward and tacky. \n\nWhile most of the time, the romance doesn't overshadow the mystery aspect (THANK GOD), I still don't like reading about it. Why am I supposed to care if the author barely tries to create chemistry between the characters? Usually, in cases like this, it's always THE SAME STRUCTURE: \n\n1.Character A and character B begin as rivals/they don't have the best chemistry (bonus points if they're co-workers). \n\n2.Character A flirts and teases Character B, who doesn't seem interested AT ALL. \n\n3. They work together and we reach the last part of the book with them having little to no chemistry. \n\n4. Sometimes they might have a bonding moment in the middle of the book and that's it. No further development whatsoever. \n\n5. One of them almost dies and all of a sudden the other part goes ballistic. \n\n6. Case solved, the characters are together, everyone's happy. \n\nEven if the \"romantic\" scenes are not a lot, I dislike it when the mystery and the case solving gets interrupted by pointless flirting that contributes to nothing at all. And the worst part is when the author tries to create more scenes between the characters, in order to make the relationship more plausible, only for them to have the blandest chemistry ever. \n\nBesides that...what happened to platonic relationships, especially the ones between a man and a woman? Why do we always try to put a male and female character together? Why can't we have for example, two police officers of different gender as friends or even simple co-workers, instead of forcing them in a romantic relationship? I am not here to get jumpscared by bland romance, I'm here for the drama and thrill. \n\nThe most recent example of pointless romance subplot in a crime movel is the relationship between Thulin and Hess. They don't start in the best terms, there are some hints throughout the book about a developing crush from both of them and that's it. Like, what was the reason to hint at a romantic relationship if you're not going to develop it more? I genuinely couldn't care less about whether they'd end up together or not simply because the author did not care to elaborate any further on their feelings and relationship. Not to mention that I found Thulin to be poorly-written and that they...genuinely did not work good together as a pair. Like, even in professional terms, these two weren't the best team in my honest opinion. \n\nYou know what crime series did a good job at creating romantic chemistry between the two main leads? **Beyond Evil**, a kdrama about two policemen who want to catch a serial killer. \n\nHere are some things you need to know about them: \n\n1. We have Lee Dong-sik who is 40 years old and Han Joo-won who is 28 years old. \n\n2. Han Joo-Won suspects Dong-sik and accuses him of being the serial killer. \n\n3. The two are reluctant to work together as partners but are forced to work together. \n\n4. Dong-sik is the biggest tease you've ever seen and poor Joo-Won was constantly in the verse of breaking. \n\n5. The longer they worked together, the more they bonded and started to understand each other. \n\n6. I won't say how and why but Joo-Won was devoted to Dong-sik and was willing to sacrifice himself in order to help him. \n\n7. Did I mention that two people told them they looked like a couple? \n\nI know you're probably confused. You're probably thinking: \"Aren't these the things you complained about in your post? Aren't you forcing romance out of the characters?\". And the answer is **WRONG**. \n\n# Joowon and Dongsik puts to shame the majority of Hollywood couples, let alone crime novels ones.\n\nThe director and the actors did a fantastic job portraying the chemistry between them and although they are not 100% canon, both parts have confirmed that the relationship has romantic undertones (the director herself was inspired to write them based on a lesbian couple from the movie The Handmaiden). It wasn't just about the bickering and flirting. It's about the evolution of their relationship and the impact both of them had on each other. I obviously won't elaborate any further because I don't want to spoil anything, but if anyone decides to check the drama, they'll see what I'm talking about. \n\nNow this is a ship I can get behind. If you ever decide to watch the drama, you'll see how well-written their relationship is and how they worked together. Unlike most crime novels, the characters had a deep bond and good chemistry and therefore, the romance, even if hinted, was way more tolerable and plausible. On top of that, in this case it makes sense that the series focused on their relationship because its essential to the plot (no matter if it's interpreted romantically or not). Crime authors tend to forget that romance should serve a clear purpose in the story, instead of adding it for shits and giggles. \n\nDo crime stories _need_ romance? For me, the answer is no. You don't have to depend on a romance subplot to keep the reader's interest alive. But as I said above, there's nothing wrong with romance in crime stories, as long as it's done in a good way and as long as it's not cliche or poorly written. \n\nCrime authors should realise that just because romance sells well, that doesn't mean they need to appeal to this type of audience. It's not a crime to leave your story with no romance or two show two characters working out as simple colleagues or partners. And if you decide to put romance, at least portray it more naturally. Let the relationship evolve more. Yes, I probably won't be the biggest fan but at least, I'll be able to understand the bond between the characters better.",

      "text": "Spoilers for the series up to maybe 50% of god emperor of dune\n\nAlso remember that this is just my opinion. You are allowed to enjoy the books and there is nothing wrong with it. This is just my experience. \n\n1. dune goes through many accepting periods throughout the series. There are events that take place that make you say “why????” But you just have to accept them if you want to enjoy the story that comes next. It happens with Paul dying, with Leto fusing with the sand trout, and Leto fusing with the worm. I sometimes fall into this camp. I just wonder, “from a writing perspective, when frank herbert sat down to write the book, what made him think turning the main character into a worm is a good idea?” \n\n2. This is sort of similar to my previous point but anything after dune messiah is so unexpected that it just feels out of place. If the events that in any other story, I think most people would be fine, but because it happened in dune, it can be a little jarring. I gave a similar example in a previous post. I think it fits in terms of plot but just in the feel of it. I apologize for it being crude. Imagine you’re watching a movie about a bullfighter. The whole movie, you watch the bullfighter struggle against the bull. But he sucks at his job. Audiences are getting bored. So one day, the bullfighter decides he must undergo physical changes to fight the bull. But instead of taking steroids or something like that, he shoots bull sperm into his veins and turns into a bull human hybrid that the crowd loves. That is what it’s like essentially when jumping from dune messiah to children of dune and god emperor. \n\n3. the stakes drastically decrease. Don’t get me wrong, the larger stakes in the context of the story are huge. But the moment to moment stakes feel so redundant. It goes from “our entire family is being attacked and we are stranded on a desert planet. How will we survive?” To “our worm god is getting attacked by random thugs so the best army in the world has to kill these very unskilled fighters. Will they accomplish it?”\n\n4. Unnecessary plot threads. So many plot threads get dropped between books that you wonder why they were even included. Farad’n had no impact on the story. And him getting BG training is even more useless since he doesn’t even use it and isn’t in the next book. The whole thing with jacurutu existing. Why does this random outpost of bandits matter? What makes jacurutu specifically matter? When Leto goes through the spice trance, why is harum so important? Why is he even included if he’s only mentioned once or twice in throwaway lines but somehow has the importance of a possession? It feels irritating reading 500 pages and 200 of those are just unnecessary things you will never see again or had any impact on the story. \n\n5. The characters make dumb decisions. Wensicia really thought in children of dune that she could kill the two children of the most revered emperor in mankind’s history, who also had the power to see the future, with two tigers. And that is what half of the book revolves around. \n\n6. the dialogue just tanks in quality with each book. In book one, it was clunky at best. In messiah, it was an irritation. In children it was unintelligible. And it gets better in god emperor but it is still probably some of the stiffest dialogue out there. \n\nAlso the fact that there’s a long homophobic rant in god emperor about how if an army is composed of all men, they will turn gay then turn into rapists when they leave the military",

      "text": "I have a tendency to go into extremes sometimes, and it happens with a lot of things, like foods or movies, but books are no exception. I cannot tell if my reality is so unsatisfying and unhappy, or if there are needs that have not been met which are awakened when I read a particular book. These may be any kinds of needs, such as a need for safety, for belonging, love, and family, or things like social justice, traveling the world, wealth, fame, and so on.\n\n,So I read To Kill a Mockingbird and I became obsessed with it. It's strange in a way because that world is not so nice and comforting at all. Yet, I think there is something there I need. So maybe I have been missing a sense of having a caring parent who loves you and stands up for what is right and is a force in the community.\n\nOr I read The Count of Monte Cristo and become obsessed with it, and only later do I realize it's like because of  how much I wish I had a lot of money and could get back at people who have hurt me and victimized me over the years. The book is really an elaborate revenge fantasy. It's silly in a lot of ways and you can say this is so unlikely or how is that possible but then you don't say that because you just want to buy into that, into that possibility.\n\nAnd perhaps it's not a huge coincidence that the worse my real life becomes, the more I lose myself in books. Fiction I mean. And I actively look for immersive books with rich storytelling. They work even better than movies for me because I live inside the world of the book for a long time and use my own imagination so it feels more authentic to me.\n\nAnybody else struggle with this?\n\nI guess what you really should do, when you read a book, is go in and out and not lose contact with reality but sometimes I really do wish I could lose contact with reality for a while. To take a psychological vacation away from this life, this body and this mind, and into something new, different, and more fulfilling. To be someone else, somewhere else, think and feel differently. And stay there awhile. In fact, even if it's not so fulfilling, that vacation away from the repetitive everydayness of my life is maybe all I need at that moment.",

      "text": "What is it with Stephen King? What is the magic dust? I was a casual fan of King, like yeah, I like Pet Semetary and the Shining, but It was just kind of in the background of my interests. Then in about 2014, I had a roommate at a shared house who was REALLY into King, and it just flipped a switch for me. I realized not only had King been a way bigger influence on me than I had realized, but that I wanted to write as well. One of the first books I can remember reading front to back by my own choice was *The Mist* at 8 or 9 years old. Fast ward 30 years later, I'm on a camping trip with dog (in an rv) and reading The Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon, and it just connected, it hit the right spots in my brain. Almost every SK story I've consumed over the past 10 years or so has felt like it fit perfectly into that time in my life. Maybe that's the genius of the guy. I feel like I've mined a lot of the gold from the 90s and on, there's probably still some veins I've overlooked, but I have been reluctant to delve into the 80s, especially The Dark Tower. I've listened to a few short story comps from then, and its strikingly different. For some reason I don't feel as drawn into it. Plus its all very overshadowed and diluted by the movies. I did listen to The Talisman, and kind of liked it, but there was something kind of off about it. Supposedly Peter Straub co-wrote it but it sounded like 100% King to me. It just didn't hit like TGWLTG, or like The Outsider, when I listened it to back in the summer of 2016. Anyone else have a similar experience with the King of horror?",

      "title": "The Righteous Mind by Jonathan Heidt",
      "text": "I finished the Audiobook last week and I wanted to talk about it. I think this is definitely in my top 5 favorite non-fiction books. I've seen a lot of people fixate on the limitations of the \"rider on the elephant\" metaphor that's central to a lot of the book. That metaphor being that our rational mind, the rider, doesn't actually steer the automatic processes it's perched atop (our unconscious minds), but only ever reacts in response to it. He spends a fair bit developing this metaphor, and it is one of the central claims of the book.\n\nIt's pretty harrowing and its implications are far reaching: that none of us are pro-active moral agents, and each of us are basically born hypocrites and story-spinners, destined to gild over our own actions while we readily find fault in others. That this isn't a character flaw, but intrinsic to the psychological immune system that allows us to operate. It also explains quite a lot, and I don't think anyone who reads this book book won't come away being somewhat convinced that the morality we assign our own motivations are post-hoc constructions rather than conscious decisions.\n\nI think people are right to say that Haidt over extends this account of morality to all other kinds of moral thinking, that there are slower, considered ethical considerations that carefully weigh arguments, as well as perhaps how awareness of the underlying mechanisms that determine your moral inclinations might allow you to pull back from them (\"wait a minute, I just had a knee-jerk reaction about this person who belongs to a different identity group, maybe my tribal mind is activated right now and I should slow down and understand their point of view alongside my own\"). I also think Haidt can cherry pick tiny studies that aren't very conclusive to support his arguments (saying, for example, that our entire self-esteem is based off of the sociometer model when that's just one of many things that determine how we feel about ourselves).\n\nAll that aside: This book is about so much more than that, and I think it lead me to a kind of breakthrough that made me re-examine most of my 20's.\n\nWhat gives the Righteous Mind its magnum opus sweep is how it describes how our entire moral realities are founded and sustained. It maps how the elements of tradition and culture, which might seem arbitrary or absurd on the surface, serve as valuable mechanisms that allow the social technology of culture to bind a society together. Haidt gives us a convincing theory of everything, a high resolution diagram of how the great human machine fits together, and how it operates.\n\nHaidt's breakthrough moment was when a primatologist told him this simple sentence, \"You'll never see two chimpanzees carrying a log together.\" You might wonder what's the big deal, but Haidt takes from this the seed of all human success, a pivotal moment that allowed him to understand how human beings \"crossed the Rubicon\" from animal to something more than animal: coordinated cooperation. Haidt builds a theory of moral systems based on this, demonstrating with many converging lines of evidence, that human morality developed to optimize this cooperation -- our heroes and our villains, our rites and rituals, our prohibitions and licenses, the very fabric from which we weave the perceptual make-up of our social reality, derives from the problem posed by increasingly sophisticated society-building instinct.\n\nThis spoke to me personally because I've always been a non-conformist, defiant type of personality. I always believed that society was the problem, not the solution. That we need to throw off the shackles of our culture's constraints and disappear into the wilderness where we can become our own kings. Haidt clarifies why this is foolish naivete, that norms are an ordinary, and necessary, aspect of the human social instinct. That we actually SHOULD want interpersonal judgment, gossip, reputation, etc as the regulatory mechanism that encourages pro-sociality. I think there's a lot to be said in the nuances of this, how this can also create suffocating hypocrisy and a confusing dissonance as the cultural narrative doesn't align with the intimate reality we each experience, but it's an idea that has legs.\n\nHaidt doesn't mince words, and the truth he tells is as pragmatic as it is brutal: Human groups developed to repress the needs of the individual for the sake of the group. Your belonging is contingent and not unconditional. The inevitable ultimatum for your membership in any group is this: cooperate or be shunned. It's a hard truth, but one that I can't shake when I look out in the world. Our sense of group identity, the narratives we must share in order to retain not only our membership, but also our sanity, requires the soft coercion that we must learn to make friends with or become hermits. I hate to admit it, but I think it's true. Anything that resists the flow of the group is dragged to smithereens.\n\nFinally (and thank you for reading this if you made it this far), the other amazing aspect of this book is talking about the paradoxical human capacity for both selfishness and groupishness. That humans are both self-interested, but are uncannily good at cooperating with non-family members. I think this is my favorite part of the book, and one that actually has started to change my life. Haidt's feather in his argumentative cap is that humans were able to dominate the world because of our insanely proficient ability to extend the circle of our cooperative abilities. Our ability to abstract concepts and understand symbols gave us the capacity to create families the size of nations and of religions. I was incredibly moved by the \"Durkheimien\" section, as well as how all our higher motives are served when our \"hive switches\" are flipped. It's definitely true in my experience. To become boundless, as the flame of your own narcissism wanes, and all that's left of you is a seemless continuation into a mass of people, each knowing their place, each knowing their role. On one hand, I'm still fiercely individualistic, seeing what the madness of crowds is capable of, how it can amplify our worst instincts, or co-opt our wellmeaning moral impulse into a fool's errand for purity and clarity that can justify any cruelty. But still... Haidt made it clear to me... no man is an island, and we experience the sacred only when we can dissolve into the mass and our inner-monologues go mute. Something that he points out, which to me is so mindblowingly universal, is how often rituals involve circumambulation, that is, circling around a sacred object in unison: the muslims circle around the Kaaba in Mecca, I literally came from a Zen ceremony today that involved 20 minutes of walking slowly and mindfully before an altar, sweat lodges, pagan ceremonies around the fire, hinduism, etc. To me, this is like falling to the center of your moral universe, seeing the origin from which the entire cosmogony you reside in springs to fruition, and synchronizing your perception with your group so that your moral universe becomes real. Mircea Elidea writes about this too in my all-time favorite, *The Sacred and the Profane*, how every religion seems to involve an axis mundi, and a ritual that recapitulates then sets into motion the normative order, a theme that's also a central story archetype from antiquity to today (how many fantasy movies are out there with the plot of intervening in universe's cycle of creation and destruction?)\n\nAnyway, thank you for reading my thoughts...\n\nI really loved this book, and I think it struck to a profound and essential human truth, describing not only where our moral feelings come from and how they work, but describing how we have made the world human, and what that means. If that isn't an essential truth, then nothing is.",

      "title": "White by Bret Easton Ellis",
      "text": "I have never encountered anything—any book or movie or series—that has aged so badly and so fast as White by Bret Easton Ellis.\n\nEllis was one of my favorite writers, who frankly peaked at a very young age. There was the numbing Less Than Zero when he was a teenager, and then of course American Psycho which was absolutely brilliant and defining and somehow was written in his twenties.\n\nHe wrote some other pretty good novels and short stories as well, but his 21st century output just hasn’t been the same. Lunar Park and The Shards, which both star fictional versions of himself, are too self-centered to ever be considered classics.\n\nStill, I thought I’d be a completist and check out his controversial nonfiction book of essays. I have to say, I wish I hadn't.\n\nWhite really starts out so promising. Ellis spends a lot of time reviewing movies and music, especially from the 80s, which seems to be among his favorite topics. He says some interesting things about being queer as well, especially in the context of film and Hollywood's evolving norms. Most of all, the background on writing Less Than Zero and then American Psycho are excellent. Very much worth reading for fans. Even the backstory of the latter’s film and yes its musical adaptation are great reads. Plenty of celebrity name-dropping for good measure.\n\nBut that’s not really the point of White. The point of this book, is to complain about the kids these days.\n\nHe doesn’t use the word woke, which wasn’t quite in fashion yet, but it’s an incredibly familiar list of complaints. Couldn’t be more cliched.\n\nBasically, 2017 and the subsequent years since then were an annoying time and some people went overboard. We all know. And yet, this was written right before 2020 when shit got so much more serious. And it could not have aged more badly.\n\nHis premise more or less is that the MAGA movement isn’t that bad, people complained too much about the president which annoyed him (the greatest sin there is apparently), and just generally trying to normalize that awful administration.\n\nHe devotes thousands and thousands of words to this. Having read a few political books in my time, what's frustrating is how much Ellis talks about ‘aesthetics’ without actually caring about the policy aspects of politics whatsoever. He doesn’t have anything to say about immigration, or women’s rights, or even gay marriage or anything like that. He seems to think presidents and governments don’t do much of anything, and so all the fears the winey libs had are overblown.\n\nWow this aged badly after January 6. Like, he reveals how his boyfriend is a Millennial and acts like he deserves points for that—which is kind of problematic with the age gap actually, since when was it progressive to be 20 years older than your partner, not that I really care. He calls him a member of Generation Wuss, and has nothing to say about substantial LGBTQ+ issues of which that administration was extremely hostile.\n\nSure, he makes the perfunctory statements how he’s not right-wing and didn't vote for that. But the both side-ism doesn’t work, when he uses almost all his energies to complain about “the left.”\n\nHe keeps saying he has friends who voted Republican, how amazingly diverse his social group is, but he never says why they voted that way. There's no real argument. Politics is all an abstraction which doesn’t apparently affect anyone in real life.\n\nEllis mocks the term, but there’s really not other way to say it but this: He’s incredibly privileged.\n\nWho cares that dinner parties were awkward for him because people freaked out too much? So what? There were real human beings affected by family separations at the border, and the Muslim ban, the hurricane response in Puerto Rico, trying to overturn the ACA, etc., etc.\n\nNot to mention COVID!\n\nAnd since then, Roe vs. Wade has been overturned and Project 2025 is now a viable threat and democracy is being undermined and there's a host of other serious issues. Sorry, but it turned out that his hyperventilating friends were completely correct.\n\nRemarkably, the book ends on a note with defending Kanye West of all people. It’s nuts reading this in 2024. Like the whole “dragon energy” take Kanye had, it’s all about the vibe, and zero about how the government functions in a way would help anyone.\n\nAnd then it gets worse. He says Kanye can’t support white supremacy if he's Black, and then he defends Candace Owens and Roseanne Barr. The worst examples you could come up with. Somehow he throws James Gunn in there, without mentioning or even understanding that Gunn’s cancel moment was a right-wing smear job, and of course a lot has happened since then with the director’s resurgence because it fundamentally wasn’t the same as those other bigoted celebrities who went off the deep end and have turned out to deserve every criticism.\n\nBret Easton Ellis has always been an incredibly talented writer, but he should never have gotten into politics. Especially this kind of petty grievances-style blogging.\n\nHe’s become exactly what he used to satirize.\n\nTake this quote: “However, my socialist boyfriend, whom I often accused of liberal fascism, now believed that my obsession with aesthetics had become, by the summer of 2018, essentially fascist as well.”\n\nSo if you follow that, it’s so bad that his boyfriend believed Ellis essentially a fascist. Even though he accuses his boyfriend of being a liberal fascist in the same sentence.\n\nWhich is it? Is it lame overreacting to call anyone fascists, or is it that the libs are the real fascists and that makes it okay to call them fascists?\n\nIf you haven’t noticed, this writing actually isn’t any good at all…\n\nLastly, there’s this term ‘Empire’ and ‘Post-Empire’ that Ellis is fond of. I simply don’t get what the point is ultimately, what's supposed to be so great about post-Empire. What he’s really talking about is being anti-establishment, but where’s the value of being contrarian for its own sake? He never explains. All these essays and he has nothing actually political to say in the sense that politics is about policies that effect the lives of millions. And the only thing that’s a big deal, in the end, is people on Twitter vaguely making him uncomfortable sometimes.\n\nFor Bret Easton Ellis, what really matters is but the surface-level, with nothing fundamentally there, an empty tirade all focused on only… the aesthetics.",

I’ve never seen the Phantom of the Opera musical, and if there’s a movie, I havent seen it either. \n\nBut I recently finished the book and I’ve got to say, I was kind of disappointed. I like Raul, but I found Christine to be a pretty weak character/protagonist, as she is extremely naive and that doesn’t really change much throughout the book. Also, the drama / arguing between Raul and Christine gets kind of repetitive. Also, the Persian seems is this random character that just appears at the end of the book. Also (I understand it’s an old book, not trying to judge people of the 1910s by today’s standards), but the Persian does seem to be sort of a racist caricature. \n\nIs the musical somehow more focused and present the main characters in a way that is more likable? Just trying to understand the popularity of the musical, given that I feel there was a lot more potential that could have been done (meaning that the setting of the Paris Opera Hose and the interactions with the ghost that haunts it are really cool foundations for a novel and I think Leroux could have done more of it). \n\nNot saying I hate the book, just didn’t live up to the hype, given the musical’s popularity.",

      "title": "This continued discourse around trigger warnings is strange to me.",
      "text": "I don’t know if this is true for other social platforms, but on spaces like X, Instagram, and Threads, there seems to be a cyclical discourse on the use of trigger warnings in books. For whatever reason, this topic tends to get people really heated, and some people feel like the request of trigger warnings is a major affront to the author and to the very concept of literature itself. I’ve also seen people state that they refuse to read books where authors have included them, and I just…don’t understand that stance?\n\nI’m currently a senior medical student in the U.S., and I’m interested in specializing in neuropsychiatry. I’ve gotten some good exposure to mood disorders in my training thus, so I feel like I’ve developed a decent understanding on the nature of PTSD and how difficult it can be for some patients to manage (and there’s always more for me to learn, of course. Our faculty members don't call us lifelong-learners for nothing!). Because I currently hope to work in such an emotionally sensitive field, I’m really big on meeting people where they're at, approaching their needs with a sense of compassion, and trying to take time to understand why they have certain needs and how best those needs can be addressed.\n\nNow, what does all that have to do with trigger warnings? Well, the primary purpose of trigger warnings is to inform readers of certain subject matter that will make an appearance in the book, so taht readers can make an informed decision about whether the story is appropriate for them to read. This is particularly important for folks with PTSD, because they can’t always predict what kind of physiological and/psychological reactions they have to certain topics, so they’d rather just stay safe and avoid topics that will lead to panic attacks, anxiety attacks, and other disproportionate reactions.\n\nA less extreme example is myself: I can’t psychologically tolerate horror stories. Whenever I consume horror stories, I have increased difficulty with falling asleep (lasting at least a week or more). This is bad news for me, because I already struggle with insomnia at baseline and use several sleep aids. So…I just don’t read horror stories. \n\nNow, am I probably missing out on some great horror books? Yeah, totally. \n\nBut I don’t consider the expectation for me to consume every great story out there more important than my need for a good night’s rest. Any doctor you know will tell you that medical school can be very energy-draining, and my body every minute of sleep it can get, so I’m more than happy to eliminate anything that interferes with my sleep/my ability to fall asleep, even at the cost of missing out on a good book. I wish this wasn’t the case, but I’m not going to suffer through sleepless nights just so I can have some kind of street cred in saying that I read horror books. I'm a big proponent of self-care, and I don't want to spend every day of my life feeling sleep-deprived, so I do what I gotta do. Sue me, I guess.\n\nNow, for some rebuttals to common arguments against trigger warnings:\n\n* ***“Trigger warnings spoil the story!”***\n\nThey really don’t. They're just vague warning about the broad subject matter, not a detailed description of the exact way that the topics manifest in the story and which characters they affect. They can be styled it like the viewer discretion messages at the beginning of visual media, which, to the best of my knowledge, no one has ever had an issue over spoilers with.\n\n* ***“You can’t predict everything that will trigger someone!”***\n\nAnd you're absolutely right. Good thing the only expectation surrounding trigger warnings is to include obvious/major/common-sense ones (eg. rape, suicide, domestic violence) and not necessarily everything under the sun. \n\nNow, will there be some people with some really niche triggers? Absolutely. Will there be unreasonable people who get mad at the author for not being aware of their specific existence, and not having intimate knowledge of a stranger's niche trigger? sure. But just because *some* people will have unreasonable reactions to this topic doesn't necessarily mean that we should forego the idea all together. \n\n* ***“Trigger warnings dissuade people from engaging with topics that challenge them!”***\n\nThe people for whom trigger warnings are important are typically not using them because they have something against literature that challenges them. They’re usually doing it because certain topics can trigger disproportionate physiological/psychological reactions that are hard to predict and difficult to control, so they’re avoiding these topics as part of the management of their mental well-being. There’s nothing wrong or shameful about prioritizing your psychological health over a theoretical need to ‘challenge yourself’, and there are plenty of books that readers can use to ‘challenge’ their ethics/philosophies/critical thinking without needlessly forcing themselves to endure additional mental trauma. A challenge doesn't need to be traumatizing in order to be a challenge. \n\n* ***“I write books for adults. Adults should be able to handle any topic no problem!”***\n\nAdults are not a monolith, and the cognition and psychology of every adult differs. Not all of them have the emotional/mental capacity to handle certain topics and still feel well afterwards, and their decision to not engage with these topics doesn’t make them any less adult. In fact, I consider it quite mature to have the self-awareness needed to recognize that you have psychological limitations regarding certain subject matter. I suspect that the world would be a much better place if more adults were willing and/or able to self-reflect on their psyche. \n\nAdditionally, informed decision-making is a professional standard for many fields, and I view trigger warnings as being akin to that: you’re giving adult readers the info they need to make informed decisions about the stories they consume, and whatever decision they ultimately come to is their business. If you genuinely feel like they are going to suffer consequences from avoiding their triggers, then those consequences are also their business. You can't claim that trigger warnings is 'babying readers' and then simultaneously baby readers from whatever outcomes result from their decision to not engage with a certain story. I'm also yet to see any proof that avoiding serious psychological triggers leads to significant decline in literacy and other negative outcomes, but I'm open-minded, so if you've got any sources for me to check out, I am all ears. \n\n* ***“The only way to overcome your fears is by confronting them. Avoiding them gives them more power/makes you weak, etc.”***\n\nThis particular argument is extremely arrogant. It's really not your place to force certain types of fear-management methods onto others. Not only can every fear *not* be effectively managed with repeat exposure, but even when exposure therapy is done for things like phobias and some manifestations of PTSD, the therapy is typically done in a structured and controlled environment in the presence of qualified professionals. Why? Because said professionals understand that the triggering of certain traumas can sometimes be severe and require elevated management. Therefore, I think it’s inappropriate and a little callous to just casually tell people to ‘fix’ their PTSD with repeat exposure, as if that treatment is just a cute little magic trick that can fix anything. For casual phobias, this might not be that big of a deal, but for people with PTSD and other trauma-based disorders, it can become serious. Therefore, I think that people should be a little more mindful of just casually suggesting exposure therapy to everyone like it's no big deal.\n\n* ***“If people avoid certain books because of trigger warnings, they’ll miss out on great books!”***\n\nPlease. I’ve seen people avoid books for far less: unappealing covers, specific tropes that they don't like, seeing the genre as being inherently inferior (eg. adult fantasy readers turning their nose up at YA fantasy, people turning their nose up at Romance/romantasy), the author being a woman/a person of color/part of the LGBTQ+ community/having a specific political alignment/etc., using certain details about the book to come to the premature conclusion that the story is 'woke trash', etc. \n\nNot to mention how subjective the word ‘good’ is. What are the chances that the ‘good’ books you swear that everyone needs to read are universally considered to be good? Even the classics and the ‘great authors’ of our current generation have people who think that they're a waste of time, so it’s very possible that even if a reader were to ignore the trigger warning, the book would still not have been worth reading. \n\nIt’s also worth noting that not every assessment of a trigger warning results in a decision to not read the book. Sometimes, the trigger warnings are used as a chance for the reader to mentally prepare themselves to consume that kind of story. They’ll still read the book anyway, but when the difficult subject matter comes up, they’ll be prepared to handle it. \n\n* ***“I hate trigger warnings so much, and I avoid books that contain them!”***\n\nIf you complain that people who avoid books because of triggers are missing out on good books, but then you also say that you refuse to read certain books just for having the warnings, then ‘hypocritical’ is the only appropriate term to use here.\n\nI also cannot emphasize enough how much you don’t need to read the trigger warnings if *you* personally don’t want to.  Getting angry at the trigger warning just for merely being there seems a little silly to me, and looking down on authors for being courteous enough to include them seems even sillier. Trigger warnings are there for the people who need them. If you don’t need them, great! Just flip the page and start reading the book. It doesn’t need to be this complicated. After all, you also don’t need every allergy warning that’s on a food box or every epilepsy warning in a music performance video, but you accept their presence there because you have the discernment needed to understand that some people *do* need them, and that their presence yields a net benefit with very minimal harm (if any).\n\nTL;DR - Mental health continues to be stigmatized/not taken seriously. Trigger warnings are here to help readers make informed decisions about the content they consume. The visceral anger towards the concept of trigger warnings feels inappropriate for that their intended purpose is.\n\nI have a feeling that the comments under this post might turn into a shit show, so forgive me in advance if I’m not able to reply to everyone. And to the user who's inevitably going to make a wisecrack about \"what if I personally get triggered by trigger warnings? 😏😏😏\"......allow me to inform you in advance that this joke is not nearly as clever as you think it is.",

      "title": "Finished Sunrise on the Reaping. SPOILERS!",
      "text": "**SPOILERS BELOW! IF YOU DON'T WANT TO BE SPOILED, CLICK AWAY NOW.**\n\nI picked up *Sunrise on the Reaping* yesterday, and finished it in one day. Wow, just wow. To start, it's mandatory to read the *Hunger Games* trilogy and *A Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes* before *Sunrise on the Reaping*. There are so many Easter eggs that are must-not-miss!\n\nSome examples I enjoyed:\n\n* Haymitch's mentors! Wiress, Mags, and Beetee! Wiress was the winner of the 49th Games. Mags was so gentle. I'm glad to see her characterisation remains steadfast, even persisting into Katniss' era. The reveal that Beetee has children with one of them being Ampert was devastating. A Victor father having to watch his own son be reaped is a special kind of cruel. \n* The reveal that Mags, Wiress, Beetee, and Plutarch were all rebels long before Haymitch's time. My heart broke when they were punished after the Games.\n* Snow's obsession with the Covey continues long after Lucy Gray's disappearance. How he suppresses the 10th Hunger Games, including the winner, that it's been forgotten by Haymitch's time. Propaganda worked so well that the first \"mockingjay\", who forever changed the Games, doesn't get to tell her story. \n* Lucy Gray's music lives on in District 12, even after she's been erased.\n* Effie Trinket! \n* The names of Katniss' parents - Asterid March and Burdock Everdeen. \n* The mockingjay pin came from Maysilee Donner.\n* Lenore Dove... Edgar Allan Poe's *The Raven*. I knew how her story would end to be from the first page, but it still hit me like a freight train.\n* Reaping day is on the 4th of July. It's incredibly telling that Suzanne Collins intentionally named Reaping Day as the 4th of July. All her books are a political commentary on the USA - and the USA is a land full of \"Capitols\". \n\nBut more than the references, *Sunrise on the Reaping* comes out in a important political time. The rebellion didn't start with Katniss. We followed the 50th Hunger Games through Haymitch's eyes; we rooted for him, and our hearts broke when Louella, Ampert, Maysilee, and Wellie died, and we saw the consequences of how the Capitol will intentionally rewrite the narrative to make it fit their agenda. Everything Haymitch did went unseen. The propaganda machine and President Snow saw to that. \n\nIn *A Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes* and *Sunrise on the Reaping*, Suzanne makes a point to name every single Tribute. They aren't just random faces - they are people selected to die in service of the Capitol's entertainment. By Katniss' time, the Districts are so alienated from each other that we - the readers, and Katniss - don't care to know their names. The Capitol made sure to strip the Tributes of their humanity and freedom of speech as much as they could. The propaganda worked so well that by the time we read *The Hunger Games*, we're fooled. \n\nI'm positive there's more I'm missing, but again, wow. She couldn't have published it at a better time. \"Freedom of speech, but only when it helps Big Brother.\"",

      "title": "So the Scarlet Letter is actually good??",
      "text": "I personally, like millions of other high schoolers, was forced to read the Scarlet Letter for my 11th grade AP lang class. Suffice to say, I hated that book with a passion. I hated the plot, I hated the blatant symbolism. But, I think most of all, I hated the circuitous style. \n\nThe style was especially offensive to me in light of my teacher’s emphasis on exigency above all else when grading our essays. We had it beat into us that an effective piece of writing utilized a total economy of words. Repetition was anathema. Things had to develop in an organized, predictable way. \n\nThen there was Nathaniel Hawthorne who—despite writing paragraph long sentences, using the word “ignominious” approximately 100 million times, and randomly jumping between chapter long character studies and pages in which years passed—was held up as the “great American author” by my teacher. As a 16 year old kid, I naturally resented the implication that we couldn’t write like that but Hawthorne just could because he was great, and the greats don’t have to follow the rules. \n\nI think I now have a greater appreciation for the fact that in order to break the rules, you have to master them first. Consequently, I harbor less personal animus towards Hawthorne and see a lot of subtle lessons in his writing I missed as a teenager. \n\nFor example, the fact that Dimmesdale becomes a better preacher as guilt gnaws at him and therefore relates better to his sinful congregation, saving more souls, is used as a basis for why he can’t confess the actual mistake he made. If he were to confess, he would go from a fully formed human being to a walking lesson of what not to do like Hester, and people would no longer take him seriously and be saved. It is an irony that the product of sin, Dimmesdale’s self abasement, is the means by which he becomes human and relatable to his parishioners, yet to acknowledge the specific sin itself would dehumanize him. \n\nAdditionally, there is this warped Mary/Jesus and Hester/Pearl symbolism. Hester is specifically compared to the Madonna on the scaffold in the beginning of the book and when questioned as to the identity of Pearl’s father asserts she “must seek a Heavenly Father” not an earthly one. That line ties Pearl, an uncontrollable, disorderly product of sin, to Jesus, who within Puritanism is seen as best served by maintaining strict law and order. Later, the redemptive power of the suffering effectuated by the scarlet A is compared to that of the cross. By drawing these parallels, Hawthorne is less anti-religious than he anti-Puritan. God exists in Hawthorne’s worldview, but He’s the rose in the prison yard, not the prison itself. \n\nI get this deeper understanding of the book, which is actually a lot more transgressive than I gave it credit for in high school, because I can now read it on my own terms and am not being told what to get out of it. I’d really recommend everyone go back and reread some of those old assigned books.",

      "text": "Hi! New to this subreddit though have lurked before. Hope this post is allowed.\n\nI don't read dozens and dozens of books every year - usually somewhere between 10-20.\n\nI was looking at my list and thought I'd share some of my favorites over the last five years! And I also just added some in that I really enjoyed in the past.\n\nYou'll probably recognize most of the titles. I'm not too obscure! But I wanted to share with some fellow book people.\n\n**Horror/Thriller**\n\n**Bird Box** \\- this one ACTUALLY scared me! Like disrupting my sleep. But I loved it!\n\n**The Fireman** \\- My introduction to Joe Hill. Might be one of my favorite books ever. Definitely my favorite author. Since then I've read everything he's done and they are all on my top list, including his short story collections. If you are into horror/thriller/and just plain weird, you may like Joe. (Also, his dad is pretty famous so he uses a different pen name).\n\n**Dark Matter** \\- My introduction to Blake Crouch. I love original science-y ideas. His concepts don't necessarily make any scientific sense, but they are fun! **Recursion** was awesome too!\n\n**Non-Fiction**\n\n**Born a Crime** by Trevor Noah, I've read this twice. Second time I picked up just because I was bored and read it through one more time. Highly recommend. Will give you insights into Apartheid South Africa but from the viewpoint of a comedian. And we are the same age and despite being in completely different parts of the world (and struggles), I could relate to his teenage life when it came to music and wasting time.\n\nAnything Mary Roach, especially **Stiff** and **Packing for Mars**. Science writer with a sense of humor. Does a lot of research and travels and talks to people in the field. My husband got my copy of **Fuzz** signed for my birthday a few years ago!\n\n**Porcelain** by Moby. - I went to high school with his cousin and he used to come to our parties so I enjoyed reading with some familiarity. But also he has an interesting background and experience living penniless in NYC.\n\n**The Storyteller** by Dave Grohl, just a cool dude with a cool history!\n\n**The Feather Thief** \\- Incredible true story about a kid obsessed with fly fishing feathers and how he robs the British Natural History Museum and sells them on the black market. Written by an investigative journalist who involves himself in the hunt for answers.\n\n**A Stranger in the Woods** \\- True story about a dude who walks away from his life and lives in a tent in the woods for almost two decades and robs people's houses for food and supplies to stay alive but no one can track him down. Not trying to be a criminal. Just trying to survive.\n\n**Mindhunter** \\- Yep, what the Netflix show is based off of. If you're into true crime. Dude just tells story after story.\n\n**A Short History of Nearly Everything** \\- Bill Bryson is a national treasure. I'm sure you've all read A Walk in the Woods.\n\n**Breath** \\- Dude writes a book on breathing and gets involved by traveling the world talking to doctors, gurus, and even tapes his nose shut for a month with a buddy to see what it's like to only mouth-breathe.\n\n**Stolen Focus** \\- Why we can't pay attention. Relevant!\n\n**Into Thin Air** \\- Story of a trip up Mt. Everest. Riveting!\n\n**Fiction**\n\n**Where the Crawdads Sing** \\- Yes, mainstream but I really liked it. I was on a plane a few years ago and this woman across the aisle was reading this and I leaned over and said \"I read that\", she asked me if I liked it and I said yes. She gave me a weird look and said she didn't get it. Ha! It's all good.\n\n**The Invisible Life of Addie Larue** \\- Sucked me in. Really enjoyed the journey. A woman who can never dies lives over the course of centuries. Navigates love and relationships, countries. Jumps between hundreds of years ago to modern times.\n\n**Project Hail Mary** \\- Liked this more than the Martian. The Martian was cool but way to over my head with the science.\n\n**The Midnight Library** \\- If you could choose a different path, what would you choose? Try them out and see how it goes!\n\n**The House in the Cerulean Sea** \\- My introduction to TJ Klune and I've read all his books since. **Somewhere beyond the Sea** (the sequel) and In **The Lives of Puppets** were my runner ups.\n\n**Remarkably Bright Creatures** \\- An octopus helps solve a mystery.\n\n**Lessons in Chemistry** \\- Smart scientist girl in the 50's puts men in their place.\n\n**Eleanor Oliphant is Completely Fine** \\- quirky and cute\n\nI'm sure there's more but that's what I got right now!",

      "title": "Carrie Underwood reference in Demon Copperhead doesn’t seem to fit. ",
      "text": "I’m reading Demon Copperhead and think it’s great. I’m on page 184 so no spoilers please.\n\nHowever…everything else in this books seems to point that it’s set in the 90s. The cartoons on tv, the other music references, no popular use of cell phones, Texas Ranger on the tv, etc.  \n\nYet when he’s listing all the people who live on Nashville, he says “Garth Brooks, Dolly Parton, Carrie Underwood.” \n\nNow I don’t remember ever hearing about Carrie Underwood until about 2005 with her two first hits. I looked it up and her first hits came out that year plus she apparently was on American Idol that year as well. She didn’t graduate highschool until 2001.\n\nSo maybe I have the timeframe wrong but otherwise it’s kind of a “gotcha!” moment. \n\nBut I do guess he kinda goes up to more “future” times sometimes in the narration…so is he telling it all from the “future” and just using a present tense???\n\nI don’t know. He doesn’t mention other more current things or pop culture so I’m leaning towards Kingsolver just throwing in a country star’s name without actually knowing when her music started being popular. \n\nIt’s easy for me to remember because I’m good with placing hits to the year. I remember Before He Cheats and Jesus Take the Wheel played nonstop on the radio when I was a sophomore in high school so I can place the year that way. Plus I remember the hit country songs from 90s radio as well and she was obv not included. \n\n\nEDIT:\n\nI found another post in here which mentions the same discrepancy and also points out he mentions 9/11 happening when he was in highschool…which is after where I’m at now in the book. So please stop downvoting me and talking to me like I’m an idiot for thinking the book was set in the 90s when it has been up to where I’ve read so far. Thanks and goodnight everyone who was sincerely trying to help! \n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/books/s/8mBEG5gpDX",

      "title": "Maybe the lack of nuance is intentional",
      "text": "In the foreward for the complete version of *A Clockwork Orange* for the American audience (when first released in the US, the last chapter was removed) the author, Anthony Burgess, writes a very interesting foreward where he's basically like- Ugh, this book is *so* cringe guys, I can't believe you're making this preachy trash my legacy. In the foreward, he writes, \"It is not the novelist's job to preach; it is his duty to show.\"\n\nIt's a sentiment popular on this sub, especially when discussing books like *James* (by Percival Everett and *Babel* (by RF Kuang). There's been discussion, either through dedicated posts or in comments, about how books are becoming too black and white preachy now days and that's a sign of declining media literacy, virtue signaling by the authors and publishers, and how people have become too afraid to consume media that doesn't pass the morality sniff test with flying colors.\n\nAnd, some of that is true, but maybe nuance was never the intention with these books.\n\nI don't think these writers are being blunt because we've become so media illiterate that they have to hit us on the head with it. Bluntness is not a trend. A lot of beloved political books are very blunt. Where is the subtlety in *A Brave New World*? *1984*? *Animal Farm*? *The Jungle*? Kurt Vonnegut will just come right out and say in his books that war is stupid and human are stupid. And we love him for it!\n\nInstead, I think that marginalized writers are finally getting their voices out and they want to scream, \"XYZ is bad!\" because it feels good to shout it out when you're constantly told you're over reacting... it's not that serious... why do you people have to always make it about xyz... maybe it's you, not them... you're the only person that feels that way... watch your tone... don't be so aggressive about it... it's just a joke... omg, why are we *still* talking about this... etc. And, if you're the right audience, damn it feels validating to hear someone else recognize it. When you're constantly being told that you have to start a dialog, extend a hand, show empathy, etc- like you have to tirelessly logic the other side into respecting you- it feels cathartic to read a middle finger, FAFO scene.\n\nThere are authors who are writing, not to teach, to preach, to show, or ask for empathy, but to validate their marginalized audience and create a safe space. Sometimes when we criticize authors for lacking nuance and being too preachy I think we're missing the point, the point being, this book wasn't for us. We're not the audience. Like we can come, but the party wasn't planned around us, so if we don't like the food or the music, we should just leave instead of complaining. Because no, not all good works of literature have to be universal. Emotions are universal, experience and privilege (or lack of) are not. \n\nAnd to be clear, I'm not stating, or suggesting that readers should self-flagellate themselves by being lectured at by these books. You're not obligated to appreciate them or recognize any literary merit in them. There are so many great authors who do an amazing job of showing vs telling. The **TL:DR** is that with some books, the lack of nuance is not to preach, but to validate. It's not a flaw, but the design.\n\nEdited for spelling.",

Doesn't matter the genre or anything, just a book that you enjoyed. But at the end of the book or story there's a statement that the entire story was written by an AI. Would that affect your enjoyment? Would it be positive or negative? \n\nFor me, I'm a bit torn. I think that part of what makes art (whether it be books, music, film, etc) beautiful and relatable is the human touch. The connection. It's the culture that we all share and it's tough to imagine an AI being able to fully replicate that. However, if it did and I really enjoyed the story, it would be difficult to dismiss the entire work as less because it wasn't written by a human if I was able to connect with it if that makes sense. \n\nWhat do you all think?",

      "title": "Has anyone here read Red Rising? I fear im a few years late, but i just finished it and I would love to talk about it. (Spoilers for book 1)",
      "text": "{Everything below is from the perspective of someone whose has not read the entire series. I've only read book one with no spoilers so far. I dont mind spoilers of saying the name of a character who appears later and basic info etc, But please don't spoiler any plot points.} \n\n\nI just finished Red Rising via the Graphic Audio edition{don't hate me but I liked  more than the og Audiobook. I was going back and fourth for a bit.} And *bloodydamn* I am in love. It’s been ages since a story grabbed me like this. The Graphic Audio format made it even more immersive; it felt like a movie playing in my ears with all the voice actors, sound effects, and music. I found myself holding my breath during the intense scenes and even tearing up at the emotional ones. Darrow’s journey had me hooked from the start, and I rode the full rollercoaster of emotions--joy, anger, heartbreak, hope--sometimes all at once.\n\nWhat really hit me was the emotional weight of Darrow’s story. \n\nPierce Brown’s worldbuilding sucks you right into the tunnels of Mars, where an the coolest red people in the galaxy live in oppression and lies. As a reader, you feel the claustrophobia and injustice that Darrow and his family endure. Darrow’s life as a lowRed--slaving away in the mines believing he’s helping build a better future for Mars--felt so real and unjust that I was burning with anger on his behalf. When his wife Eo sings that forbidden song of freedom and is executed for it, I literally had to pause the audio because I was nearly sobbing. That scene broke me. Eo’s dream of a life where their children can be free absolutely shattered Darrow--and me too. As a Black reader, the oppression of the Reds struck a deep chord. Their pain, the way they’re kept ignorant and exploited, the way hope is a dangerous act--it all felt deeply relatable and familiar in a gutwrenching way. Darrow’s grief an fury after Eo’s death, and his resolve to rise for his people, gave me chills. I felt like I was right there cheering {and crying} for him.\n\nDarrow’s transformation from a humble, broken Helldiver of lykos into a determined rebel infiltrating high society--it’s inspiring and harrowing. The Institute trials, the friendships and betrayals, the moments where Darrow’s Red heart shines through his Gold exterior! it was such a wild ride. This story made me think hard about freedom, sacrifice, and what it means to break the chains of an unjust system.\n\nNow, here’s where my brain started poking at something. \n\nRed Rising portrays a future society that’s supposedly post racial--the old Earth concepts of race and ethnicity have faded, replaced by this Color caste system. Pierce Brown has mentioned that he didn’t want to focus on race as we know it; the Society isn’t divided by Black/white/Asian/Latino, but by Colors {Gold, Red, etc.} that were genetically engineered for specific roles. In theory, that sounds awesome--a future where skin color isn’t a source of division. But {and this is a big “but” for me}if this world is truly beyond race, why do so many characters look so...European? Wouodnt people be mixed to the point racial features and phenotypical differences should be moot? Everyone some shade of brown or or something. \n\nReading Red Rising, I couldn’t help noticing that virtually every character we get described has features that read as white coded. Darrow himself, as a Red, is described as having pale skin, red hair, and even an Irish accent (the audiobook nailed this). His fellow Reds in Lykos are mostly the same. Then he gets carved into a Gold, and lo and behold, he ends up with golden/blonde hair, tan skin, and dazzling amber eyes. Basically, he goes from looking like one kind of white guy to another kind of white guy {just taller and buffer}. Most Golds we meet have light or golden hair, light eyes, and are often described with words like “pale,” “ivory,” or “fair.” Cassius, the Bellonas, tidus, the reds at large etc…I pictured them all as white because the author basically role me so. They are gold but if there's one movie white actors would be cast. \n\nIf I fan casted Lovie Simone as Mustang, people would look at me crazy. I actually think Mustang was one of the characters who brown didnt explictly describe as pale, I distinctly remember him saying she had a heart shaped face like lovie. But every other desfription was just describing a white woman, you know? So it's like, I thought that her heart-shaped face, you know what I'm saying, would be just like Lovey Simone. But I would look crazy if I tried to fan cast Lovie Simone as Mustang, you know? Folks would get mad And Lovie Simone wouldn't even get the audition to play Mustang. Because in our world, these gold people are largely described as being of some type of European, maybe Mediterranean descent. And if there are these Caucasian looking peope all around therefore should be golds who are black, asian, Hispanic. Crazy the golds didnt invent a new gold language I guess a vaguely posh English accent was good enough for the superior golds. Anyway I'm gettgn side tracked.  There were no Golds {or Reds} I encountered in Book 1 that had clearly dark brown skin or Afro-textured hair or broad noses or full lips--none of the features that look like me or many other people of color in our world. You can name 30 named characters In book one who are red or gold or whatever but through out the whole zeroes can you name ten black people? 6 Black golds? 4 asian reds? \n\nAnd that started to nag at me. In a world that’s supposedly beyond color *heh*, it felt like everyone was still basically European-coded in appearance. Why are there no obviously Black-coded characters among the main cast? Where are the people with kinky/coily hair or deep brown skin? It’s like the Society said “we don’t see race,” but instead of a vibrant mix of physical traits, we got a pretty homogenous {and Eurocentric} image of humanity. I want to clarify, I’m not saying Pierce Brown had to include a character with dark skin just to tick a box. But when every major character’s description could basically fit a white European person, it stands out--especially to a Black reader like me who was scanning eagerly for someone that even remotely resembled my people. Especially since I deeply reasoned with the themes of This story. \n\nIt reminds me of how some fantasy/sci-fi fans react when a Black character shows up in a story--like casting a Black elf or a Black Stormtrooper, and certain folks lose their minds claiming “but this world is supposed to be colorblind” or “it breaks my immersion.” The irony here is that Red Rising actually had the chance to show a truly colorblind future, yet it defaulted to what feels like white as the norm. A “post-racial” future that visually reads as almost all-white isn’t really beyond race at all--it’s just erasing part of humanity. It’s as if the book quietly said “Race doesn’t matter…as long as everyone looks kind of white.” That makes me uncomfortable, because it ends up reinforcing the idea that white is the default or “neutral” state of being. As a reader, I can only imagine characters based on the descriptors the author gives me. And when those descriptors overwhelmingly point to white or light-skinned people, it does jar me out of the story, despite how much I love it. I found myself asking, In this massive Society spanning all of humanity, why don’t any of the heroes or villains noticeably reflect non-European ancestry in their appearance or culture? \n\nPierce Brown clearly drew on a lot of historical and cultural influences for the Society--especially Greco-Roman and European ones. The Golds have a conquering Roman vibe {their houses are named after Roman gods, their mottoes and titles sound straight out of a Latin class}. The accents and languages we encounter {at least in the audiobook} are primarily Irish for lowReds and a more semi posh English for Golds. We hear about Golds quoting Roman philosophy, singing old war songs, using call-signs like “Reaper,” and so on--but we don’t hear much {or anything} drawing from African, Indigenous, Middle Eastern, or Asian cultures in the main story. It stood out to me that even though this is the future, the Society’s aesthetic and “feel” is very much old-school European. The dominance of European history and culture is still there, just repackaged into space. So it’s hard for me to feel like this world truly left racial and ethnic classes behind, when effectively the ruling class and even the underclass {in Darrow’s colony} look and sound like various shades of Europeans. \n\nWhile the characters looks didn’t reflect much Black presence, the story itself deeply resonated with Black history and experiences and the expriences of various opressed peoples too the irish, indigenous folks etc. I don’t know if Pierce intended it this way, but as a Black reader I picked up on so many parallels between the plight of the Reds and the specific history of Black Americans {and other oppressed peoples}. Honestly, it’s one of the reasons the story hit me so hard emotionally. \n\nA few examples that really struck me are like how The lowReds live essentially as slaves. They’re trapped in dangerous mining jobs for the profit of others, kept in line with brutal punishments. They toil from childhood to death, believing falsely that their labor is noble and necessary. This reminded me of the justifications slaveholders used--telling slaves that hard work and obedience were their lot in life, sometimes even that it was for a greater good. The way the Reds are used up and thrown away by the Society is painfully similar to how enslaved Black people were exploited for labor.\n\nThe Reds are deliberately kept ignorant of the truth. Darrow and his people don’t even know that Mars has cities and a sky; they think they’re alone working to make Mars liveable for future generations, when in truth Mars is already thriving for the elites. This is a huge lie to keep them docile. That immediately made me think of how slave owners in America forbade slaves from learning to read or getting any education, to prevent them from gaining knowledge that could lead to rebellion. Keeping an oppressed class in the dark is a classic tool of oppression--and it’s on full display in Red Rising. As a Black reader, that aspect gave me chills. It’s like a sci-fi take on the same cruelty my ancestors faced.\n\nEo’s execution scene haunts me. She is whipped and hanged for singing a song – essentially lynched for an act of defiance and hope. This parallel was like a punch to the gut. In Black American history, we know countless Black men and women were lynched or violently punished for even perceived slights or acts of resistance against an unjust system. Eo’s only “crime” was hoping for freedom and daring to voice it. That image of her singing as the noose tightens...it’s something I can’t get out of my head, because it mirrors the horrific punishments used on Black people who dared to dream of a better life. It underscored the sheer evil of the Society in a way that felt very historically real to me.\n\nThe fact that Eo’s song is what sparks Darrow’s entire revolution is so meaningful. In the face of oppression, music has often been a subtle form of rebellion and hope. Slave hymns were so imortant and spoke to the resilience of Enslaved African Americans. They used spirituals and songs to express sorrow, hope, and coded resistance. Eo’s song, carries that same power--it’s  deadass a vessel for her people’s pain and their longing for liberty. It was a beautiful nod intentional or not to how the oppressed have always used art and music to keep their hope alive. I felt that connection strongly, especially listening to the audiobook where the song is actually performed--it gave me goosebumps.\n\nwe primarily see Reds in the mines, but the Society has others the high reds. It was giving house slaves vs field slaves. They cook, they clean, and--for the more progressive Gold familes--raise their children as nannies and housekeepers.\n That scenario immediately reminded me of how Black women {during slavery and well into the 20th century} were forced into roles like mammies, nannies, and housemaids for white families--caring for the children of the very people who oppressed them. It’s a subtle parallel, but it hit home. The Society’s elite literally rely on the labor of lower classes to raise their kids and run their households, just like how American society was built on the backs of Black and brown domestics and caregivers for generations.\n\nEven after slavery, many Black Americans became sharecroppers, locked in a cycle of labor with the promise of “one day you’ll earn your own plot”, a promise that was often a manipulative lie. In the same way, the Reds in Red Rising work with the promise that they’re making a better world for their children. Darrow genuinely believes if he works hard enough, his kids or grandkids will walk on the surface of Mars. It’s a cruel lie, just like many sharecroppers were never meant to truly rise out of their situation. That parallel hurt, because you see how hope is used as a tool to keep the Reds in line, much like false hope was used to placate oppressed people in our world.\n\nPerhaps the most striking parallel for me is Darrow’s entire arc of \"passing\" as a Gold. He undergoes extreme genetic carving to physically become one of the ruling class--a literal impersonation of the oppressor to subvert the system from within. As fantastical as that is, it resonates with the real concept of codeswitching {and even racial “passing” in history}. Black people have long had to “code switch”  aka modify our speech, behavior, even appearance, to survive or succeed in predominantly white spaces. Whether it’s using a different accent/dialect at work, or {n history} some lighter skinned Black individuals passing as white to escape discrimination, it’s a survival tactic. Darrow lives this to the max to the extreme he must hide every part of his Red identity and perform Goldness convincingly, or he’ll be killed. When I listened to him learning how to dress, speak, and carry himself like a Gold, it clicked for me – this is sci fi code switching under life or death stakes. The tension of him hiding his true self is something marginalized people can relate to, even if our stakes aren’t literally execution like his.\n\n It’s one of the most powerful themes in the book to me.\n\nAll these parallels made Red Rising feel personal to me, beyond just a cool scifi story. It’s why I say I loved the book--it moved me and made me feel seen in an unexpected way. The struggle against an unjust society, the pain and the hope, the idea of rising up--those are themes that truly resonate with the Black experience {and many other fights for justice too}. I have to give Pierce Brown credit for capturing those universal oppression themes so well. The Reds’ suffering and defiance rang true and earned my heart.\n\nThat’s why it’s a bit frustrating that, for all these clear thematic connections to Black history, I didn’t actually see any Black characters represented in the world’s visual landscape. The Graphic Audio production even doubled down on certain coding, the lowReds all speak with Irish accents in the audio which, to be fair, matches Darrow’s canon accent per the books I believe. It gave a real “oppressed Irish miners” vibe to the Lykos clan. I loved the performances, but I couldn’t help noticing what was missing--we didn’t hear any characters with, say, African or Caribbean accents, or African American Vernacular English, or really any non-European accent or dialect anywhere. The cast of voices and cultures on display were distinctly Euro-centric. That creative choice made the absence of other ethnic influences even more obvious. It’s like the story borrowed a lot from the Irish struggle (for the Reds) and the Roman Empire/British aristocracy (for the Golds), but glossed over how, in a future society of billions, we’d realistically have influences from all peoples. As a Black fan, I kept waiting for even a minor character who talks or looks like they might descend from my part of humanity, so far, I haven’t really found that. \n\nI want to be clear, I’m not writing this post to attack Pierce Brown or imply Red Rising is a bad book. Not at all. If anything, I’m this passionate because I adore the story so much. Consider this post a kind of love letter and a critique rolled into one. I love this book to death--it made me feel seen in some ways, and in other ways it made me notice what was missing. I genuinely believe Pierce Brown had good intentions by envisioning a future without racism {in the traditional sense}. The goal of a colorblind society is noble in theory. But it’s also a tricky thing to execute in fiction, because if you don’t actively portray diversity, “colorblind” can easily slide into “everyone just defaults to white.” I think that’s what happened here, perhaps unintentionally. It doesn’t make Red Rising a terrible book at all--but it’s something I, as a black reader, have to wrestle with. It’s that feeling of loving a story while wishing it had done one thing a bit differently.\n\nI’m curious if anyone else noticed this dichotomy. Did any of you feel the same way about the physical descriptions in Red Rising? Especially my fellow Black readers how did you imagine the characters? Did it bother you that the book doesn’t explicitly include Black or brown-skinned protagonists, or did you interpret the vague descriptions differently? I know some fans say, “Well, race doesn’t exist in this world, so who cares what skin color they are.” I get that viewpoint, but as I explained, it does matter to me what imagery is being conjured, because I can’t help but see the patterns from our own world. Like If race as we know it is not important in this world anymore, why isn't there a more diverse spread? Like if you're telling you race is not important but everyone still is vaguely European, some kind of way, like I'm just not understanding, it takes me out of the story. I’d love to hear how others read it. Maybe I missed a description and some characters was actually meant to be of african descent. \n\nAt the end of the day, I had an amazing time with Red Rising. It’s the kind of story that sticks in your bones and makes you think for days. The very fact I’m here writing this long post shows how much it made me feel. I’m excited to continue the saga--I’ve got Golden Son ready to go--and I’m crossing my fingers that as the world expands, we’ll maybe encounter a wider array of cultures  represented  or referenced at least physical appearances in the Society. Regardless, I’m invested in Darrow’s fight and I can’t wait to see what happens next for him and all the characters I’ve come to care about {Sevro, Mustang, even Cassius, I have feelings about that whole situation!}.\n\nThank you for reading this massive wall of text. I know it was a lot, but I had a lot of emotions to pour out. This book gave me so much joy and also sparked this critical discussion in my mind--and I needed to get it all out in writing. If you’ve felt similarly conflicted or have thoughts, I genuinely want to chat! This fandom seems really passionate and thoughtful from what I’ve seen, so I’m hopeful we can have a great discussion about these themes.\n\n**Tldr;** Red Rising = AMAZING book that stole my heart; it also left me with some big questions about representation in a “post-racial” future. I’m a loving fan with some critiques, and I hope that’s okay.  I haven’t been this emotionally moved by sci-fi in a long time. So yeah, I’m a newly minted Howler!!! and I’m absolutely itching to dive into the next books. Red Rising reminded me why I love reading, it transported me, shook me, and gave me characters I care so much about. Thank you, Pierce Brown, for that.\n\nCan’t wait to hear your perspectives.\n\nAlright, Howlers, stay bloodydamn fantastic and Hail Reaper! On to Golden Son I go!",

      "title": "Thoughts on Yann Martel's Life of Pi",
      "text": "**THE STORY**\n\nSeveral descriptions of Yann Martel's book \"Life is Pi\" said that is \"a fantasy adventure novel\".  So I came in expecting some kind of fantasy story, and those familiar with the book will understand why I found myself extremely puzzled when I began reading it.  The book is divided into three main parts, and Part 1 (which takes up about a quarter of the book) feels more like a primer on running a zoo and on the psychology of zoo animals, mixed in with a philosophical and theological consideration of comparative religions.  The main character who tells the story is a young boy named Pi Patel, whose father runs a zoo, so he has lots to say about that.  He also explores several religions, and ends up becoming a practicing Hindu, Christian, and Muslim all at once.  Definitely no fantasy yet.\n\nJust when I was feeling comfortable with this unexpected content and style, I arrived at Part 2 of the novel, which takes up over half the book.  Suddenly the story switches gears, and it feels like we're in a completely different genre, as the book unexpectedly transitions into an epic and gripping survival story.  The ship that Pi and his family are on sinks, and he becomes a lone castaway in the Pacific on a lifeboat, the sole survivor together with four animals: a zebra, an orang-utang, a hyena, and a Bengal tiger named Richard Parker.  At that point the novel felt like it didn't know what it wanted to be.  After a deeply philosophical and theological beginning, it inexplicably abandons that entirely, and becomes an adventure story instead, albeit a good one.  It's like someone playing a thoughtful classical piece on solo violin, and then without notice switching to playing heavy metal on an electric guitar.  Both are legitimate forms of music, but not right after each other as part of the same concert, surely?\n\nAnd where are the dwarves, elves, and orcs?  But wait, this is not THAT type of fantasy story. The \"fantasy\" element starts to make some sense when our shipwrecked castaway ends up on a strange meerkat-filled island with mysterious carnivorous plants that kill animals with acid by night, and even consume humans except for their teeth.  Now I was even more perplexed, especially after the gritty survival story I'd been captivated with until that point.  It was conveyed with very vivid and real descriptions of sights, sounds, smells, tastes, and feelings, and felt thoroughly authentic.  But this new development of a carnivorous island felt so fantastic and unbelievable, that it seemed to take away from the survival story that felt so real until then.  I'd been able to suspend my sense of disbelief up until that moment, but what now?\n\nThings finally started to make sense when I began Part 3, which is the shortest of the three parts, and which closes out the book.  It describes what happens when Pi is rescued after 227 days, and is interviewed by Japanese investigators from the insurance company.  When Pi tells them what has happened to him at sea, they find it too fantastic to believe.  So he tells them an alternate and much shorter story, one in which there are initially four castaways on the lifeboat instead of four animals.  Far more atrocities happen in this story, including murder and cannibalism, but it's a more plausible story, and it has the same ending: a lone survivor.  After hearing this, the investigators choose to believe the story with animals after all.\n\n**THE GENIUS**\n\nIt's exactly this conclusion that the author has been setting us up for all along.  Yann Martel has stated in an interview that he made the main story deliberately far-fetched \"*in order to raise certain important questions*.\"  He wants us to think about believability and about truth.  As Pi says towards the end, \"*God is hard to believe, ask any believer*.\"  But does that make him untrue?  The third part of the book makes us return to all the questions raised about religion in the first part.  The key point is: how can you know if a story is true or not?  Is something that seems unbelievable necessarily false, just because you haven't seen it?  Questions like these have epistemological and theological importance, and that's what the survival story is really all about.  It's designed to make us ask the same stories about the stories of different religions: are they true or not, and what should we believe?\n\nThat this is the author's intent is supported by a couple of key statements voiced by Pi in the first and in the final part of the book.  At the beginning Pi says that this is a story that \"*will make you believe in God*\".  And at the end, when the investigators make the choice to believe the story with animals, he says, \"*And so it is with God*.\"  The point is that a life in which you believe in God is a better story.  Martel himself said in an interview that his book can be summarized in three statements: \"*Life is a story*\"; \"*You can choose your story*\"; \"*A story with God is the better story*.\"\n\nThe question that Pi's second story leaves us with is: Which story is true?  Like the investigators note, the two stories have important similarities, except that the animals are replaced with people.  In light of this, some readers argue that the second and more horrifying story must be what really happened, while the story with the animals was just Pi's coping mechanism for dealing with the horror and extreme trauma he experienced.  I have not seen the film corresponding to the book, but I gather that it leans more to this interpretation.  But one could equally argue that the story with the animals is the true story, because don't the meerkat bones in the lifeboat and tiger tracks on the beach prove it?  Both stories seem to have evidence pointing towards them being possible.\n\nMartel's point, however, is that we can't tell which one is true. When asked in an interview \"*Which is the real story? Was Richard Parker in fact Pi all along? His evil side (or real side)?*\" Martel answered: \"*You decide which is the real story*.\"  The ending is deliberately geared to be ambiguous. We get to choose which story we think is true.  And that's why Pi says at the beginning: \"*This book will make you believe in God*.\"  Because most of us will prefer the story with the animals to the more horrific story without the animals, even if it's the latter is more plausible and seems more rational.  \"*And so it is with God*,\" says Pi.  In other words, we might even choose to believe the story that is more fantastic, because it is a better story.  The twist, then, is not that the story with the animals wasn't the truth, but that we don't know what the truth is.  Martel would say the same about religion: we can't really know what is true, but in his view, this doesn't matter.  Pick the story that is the better story.  He would say: A life lived where you believe in God is a better than a life lived where you don't believe in God. Because religion will serve as a blanket that comforts you in hard times, and you'll cope with life better.\n\nThat this is Yann Martel's goal is confirmed by what he wrote in an interview about whether Life of Pi reflects his own spiritual quest.  In answering that, he observed that he had an agnostic upbringing, but began considering religion when he realized a spiritual perspective was missing from his life.  He stated that in all religions there are limits to what you can do rationally, and eventually you have to make a leap of faith to believe.  And that's what \"Life of Pi\" is really about: encouraging us to make the leap of faith, and view life through the lens of religion, believing that God exists.   In Martel's words: \"*Pi is something of a mystery in itself in that it represents the ratio of a circle's circumference to its diameter - 3.1415926... etc - but it seems impossible to take it through to the last number after the point.  Like \\`pi', life is not finite.  And so I didn’t make the title The Life of Pi: I deliberately left out the definite article. That would have denoted a single life.  This book is not escapist fiction.  It's to do with discovering life through a religious perspective. Religion doesn't deny reality, it explains it.*\"\n\nIn another interview, he said \"*I work really hard on my novels and everything has a meaning. Pi is what’s called an irrational number, so the nickname “Pi” is irrational. I just thought it was intriguing that this irrational number is used to come to a rational understanding of things. And to my mind religion ― and after all Life of Pi is ultimately a religious novel ― to me religion is the same thing. Religion is something slightly irrational, non-reasonable, beyond the reasonable, that helps us make sense of things*.\"\n\nIn yet another interview, Martel defended the idea that stories of imagination and fantasy - including religion - are a kind of reality: \"*Reality is how we interpret it.  Imagination and volition play a part in that interpretation.  Which means that all reality is to some extent a fiction.  This is what I explore in the novel.*\"  In other words, even if it exists just in your mind, if it helps make life better for you, it's a reality, and that's okay.  Pi's first story was to some extent a fiction too, and the religions that tell about God are the same.  But Martel thinks that's okay.  When talking about religion, Martel stated: \"*Why not believe in whatever?  You know, whatever?  Jesus, Buddha, any one of these? ... Why not?*\"  Yes, why not believe in God, if it makes life become a better story?\n\nThis is all very clever, because it sheds a whole new light on the book and how it should be read.  As someone who enjoys literature, I can appreciate how brilliant Yann Martel is in making us ask questions about reality and faith, and how brilliant he is in coming up with a story that allegorizes this.\n\n**THE FLAW?**\n\nAt the same time I find the point that Martel is making a troubling one.  Effectively he is saying we can't know what the truth about life and God really is, and that this doesn't matter.  Whether something is reality or fantasy doesn't matter to him - just go with the more interesting story and accept that, even if it defies logic, science, reason, and reality.\n\nIn other words: Life can be horrific and traumatic - just as it was for Pi on his lifeboat - but it's fine for us to make up religious stories about God if that helps life become more bearable and worth living.  Faith - regardless of the religion you choose - is really about choosing to believe things that will make our human experience better, and that's what Martel presents as a reason for choosing to believe in God.  But with this approach to life, truth doesn't really matter.  Religion is really just a coping mechanism to a traumatic event, and it's the result of making a leap of faith just because that helps make things better for you, even though it may mean you're believing things that aren't true.  With this thinking, faith is really just a personal choice to believe a fantasy in order to help you deal with suffering and pain.\n\nThis is post-modernism and relativism, which says: \"If it's true for you, power to ya!\"  Through Pi, Martel is asking us to say about religion \"Which story do you prefer?\"  It doesn't matter whether the story you believe is true; all that matters is that you prefer what you believe.  But suppose someone actually did believe an invented reality as a coping mechanism to a real trauma they experienced.  We wouldn't encourage them to keep believing the fairy-tale.  We'd send them to therapy to help come to terms with the reality they experienced.  Believing something just because it's a better story or makes your life feel better, will in the end not be helpful if it's not true.  Is it really a good idea to create your own reality, and cover yourself in a blanket of fiction if that makes you feel warm and cozy?  That's escapism, and while it's fine to do for a couple of hours when you're relaxing on a Friday night, it's a very poor way to deal with real life the rest of the week when you're supposed to be at work.  Just because religions make us feel better is hardly a reason to follow them, because choosing self-delusion instead of reality is always a mistake.  Don't misunderstand me: I'm not making an argument against religion.  I'm making an argument against Martel's argument for religion.\n\nSo while Life of Pi is brilliant as a novel and as a piece of literature in defending the virtues of making a leap of religious faith, I personally think it is flawed in encouraging us to choose to make this leap independent of whether what we believe is true or not.  But that's more of an issue I have with post-modernism than I have with the book itself.  For me, the truth does matter, also for religion, and faith needs to be grounded in some objective truth.  So I'd grant that calling this a \"flaw\" is mostly a reflection of my personal worldview being different than Martel's.  I don't see that all religions are valid paths to God, because if one religion is literally and historically true, then surely everyone should believe it.  And for me faith and believing God isn't a matter of wishful thinking, or believing something because I think it's a better story, or because that belief is a good coping mechanism, but somehow it needs to correspond to truth.  But as mentioned, this is more about how my personal convictions are different than Martel's, than it is a criticism of his book as a work of literature, and I recognize that many readers are perfectly okay with a post-modern approach to life.\n\n**OTHER NEGATIVES**\n\nReaders should also be forewarned about a few other things. This is not a children's story.  It's very gory at times, and the narrative of Part 2 includes detailed and bloody descriptions of a hyena eating the innards of a zebra while it's still alive; a tiger mauling a castaway; and attempts to eat animal feces.  And if that sounds bad, it gets even worse in Part 3: there's the brutal killing of a woman; the primitive amputation of a human leg with a knife; eating strips of human flesh; and other savage descriptions of butchery and cannibalism.\n\nI was also puzzled by the lack of consistency between chapters.  The overall structure into three main parts makes sense in the end.  And the author says it was important to tell his tale in exactly 100 chapters.  But some of these chapters are unnaturally short; one even consists of just a single sentence.  But why?  The chapter division often feels completely arbitrary as a result, and even hinders the story.\n\nDespite the authentic feel of the survival story, there are also elements that seem implausible about it.  How is it possible for the main character not even to have a thought about eating or drinking for three entire days?  \"*I thought of sustenance for the first time.  I'd not had anything to eat or drink for three days.*\"  Surely the impact of hunger, thirst, and exposure after three days would be enormous.  And why does Pi not ask for help from God during this time?  We're led to believe from Part 1 of the story that he is intensely religious, and yet all mention of religion just vanishes for several days after the initial disaster.  Pi doesn't even call on God for assistance until much later, and his religious faith doesn't really play any role in how he copes with the awful situation he finds himself in.  This undermines any credibility of his earlier religiosity.\n\n**OTHER POSITIVES**\n\nOn the positive side, besides the literary genius of the novel in its construction and the way it communicates its message, there's no doubt that Yann Martel is a skilled writer.  His prose is excellent, and he often uses very creative images to describe things, with imaginative similes and metaphors that are a real pleasure to read.  Many parts of the book are beautifully written, and a real delight to the senses.  It's not surprising that this book won the 2002 Booker Prize.\n\nSeveral parts of the story were highlights for me, even in the initial section which goes into detail about zoology.  I loved Martel debunks as a myth the common notion that animals in wild are happy and free, and I enjoyed reading the argument made for how animals in captivity can actually be happy.  I also loved the early meeting of \"the three wise men\" after Pi becomes a practicing Hindu, Christian, and Muslim simultaneously, and where his religious teachers all try to convince each other that he's exclusively dedicated to their chosen religion.  I also particularly enjoyed the humorous elements of two extended discussions later in the book: the one Pi has with a fellow castaway (the French cook) about food, and the one with the Japanese investigators in the final part of the book, where they are presented as insensitive and incompetent.\n\nThe audio version of this book from Audible is read by Sanjeev Bhaskar, who does a brilliant job.  If there is a weakness of listening to the audio version rather than reading the printed text, it's that the unusual structure of the novel does hamper the listening experience slightly on occasion.  At times it's not obvious that it is the narrator speaking rather than the protagonist, whereas in the physical book this is clearly indicated by italic text.  But aside from that, it's very well read, and listening to this top-class reading helps one really soak and enjoy Martel's imagery and absorb every detail.  Bhaskar does an excellent job in pacing and tone, and even adds appropriate accents where necessary, which all add to the authenticity and feel.\n\n**FINAL THOUGHTS**\n\nSo how do I feel about novel after all this?  My feelings about Life of Pi have changed several times, and my reading experience parallels a lifeboat going up and down on the peaks and troughs of waves.  Initially, especially with the wrong expectations about a traditional style fantasy (which was my own fault!), I was disappointed.  Because instead of spending time with dwarves and elves in a fantasy world, I found myself listening to zoology and theology.  But that grew on me, and I became more positive about things.  But just when I adjusted to that new normal, I was cast adrift and thrown into a completely different story, one of survival.  At first I was perplexed about the radical incongruity, but eventually that grew on me too, because as far as survival stories go, it was compelling.  But just when I was thinking that perhaps I liked the book after all, things took yet another unexpected turn, first when Pi ends up on an adversarial island that seems rather too incredible; and then at the end when he basically says \"Do you think that my story isn't true?  Try this one instead.\"  It was simultaneously frustrating and yet brilliant.\n\nBut the more I thought about this and the more I read about it, the more I realized that it was actually all quite clever in the end.  In fact, it's worthy of five stars from a literary point of view.  Although for me personally I find it unfortunate that Martel has used this literary genius to communicate an idea that I think is fantasy: post-modern relativism, and a philosophy where God exists only because the fantasy of believing him is better than a reality where he doesn't exist.  After deducting points for that, it brings my rating to 3.1415926.  In other words: Pi.  But this book deserves to be rounded up.  So: 4 stars.",

      "title": "Reading On the Road by Jack Kerouac made very nostalgic for a time I never lived in ",
      "text": "Disclaimer: I know, like most books in its vein, On the Road was sensationalized to a degree. I also understand that the Beat Generation was countercultural and Kerouac’s writings do not represent the general views of people of the 1950s. \n\nThat being said, as a Gen-Z guy who recently finished this book, I was really struck by how unusual so many of the formative, chaotic experiences portrayed in this story would be in the America of today. On an obvious level, hitchhiking and carpooling with random people cross country are largely a thing of the past. I also found the characters rolling into random towns and instantly getting informal work as unrealistic. I mean, these days you have to submit an online resume for Walmart, and they’re also gonna run a background check, which would have severely hampered Dean’s employment opportunities. People also just take fewer chances now. Statistically, our generation uses way less drugs, has way less sex, and is a lot more cynical than the On the Road crew. \n\nBut also on a deeper level, it feels like there’s a huge difference between what “finding yourself” involves now and what it involved then. Maybe more than in the late 40s and early 50s, people are expected to take their 20s to find themselves today. But you don’t really get lost anymore. People usually study abroad or see Europe through a tour company. If they go to Africa, it’s through a safari; Mexico is through a resort package. Even Mount Everest has somehow been commodified. And of course, for all of those trips you’ll be in constant contact with the outside world, have directions to everything on your smartphone, and be cataloguing the whole thing on social media. How many people are camping in the middle of the Mexican jungle on the roof of their car, as Dean and Sal did? Moreover, in contrast to the live  jazz clubs where Dean acted like an absolute madman, you’ll be paying $20+ covers to get in today’s clubs for the opportunity to stand around and take pictures of the light show while listening to remixes of 20 year old music. It’s like when the majority of people start to see young adulthood as a time of impulsive hedonism and self discovery, a framework for how that hedonism and self discovery is supposed to be done starts to emerge, and the whole thing feels a lot less adventurous. It becomes scheduled, ordered, and expensive—sometimes done more for others than yourself. Maybe adventure is still there, but it’s certainly way less messy. \n\nAnd I guess in more concrete terms, that’s what On the Road makes me nostalgic for: a time before we’d set out to remove all the messiness from life. In Kerouac’s day you could bounce around the West for a few years without having to worry so much about how the gap on your resume would look to employers. You could earn fine money living in the Dakotas and hitching rides to work on the harvests. People weren’t always connected; they couldn’t just Google how places looked, and when they went out on an adventure, it felt like they were really going into the unknown. Paradoxically, it feels like in a time that is seen as much more socially restrained, life could be much freer. \n\nThe message I took out of On the Road was that, ultimately, the chaos of youth gives way to adult responsibilities. But, that doesn’t make the chaos pointless, unfulfilling, or wrong. It’s really a necessary step in development that challenges your preconceptions, puts your life in perspective, and gives you a concept of something beyond yourself before you do surrender to responsibility. I see the diminishment of this developmental phase and the commodification of chaos and adventure today as being a very unfortunate thing. Of course, Dean’s philosophy had major drawbacks (his general sexism and willingness to abandon women read pretty badly today), but I think the general point stands: adventure isn’t the same now as it was then. \n\nI would be interested in how others read the “beat” writers today, or, if any of you are of that generation, if you see this analysis as true. I think overall, while this book was definitely a product of its time, I found it to be very thought provoking and enjoyable, largely because of how well it captured spontaneous youthful exuberance and the atmosphere of the era.",

      "text": "I'm reading a book right now and just got to a part where the MC, who is in a bit of a pickle, calls up her friend and basically asks, \"Can I trust you?\" and her friend is like, \"Yeah, I got you, don't worry,\" and it seems kind of obvious that she's going to betray her. The plot seems pretty predictable at this point and I'm not sure I want to finish the book anymore. I don't mind reading a spoiled book for the craft, but the writing is just okay. Just skimmed the next few chapters and yup, she betrays her.\n\nThat got me thinking about books with good unexpected betrayal scenes. My most memorable betrayal can't even be considered a betrayal, but it really felt like it at the time, and it's in *Little Women* when >!Jo turns down Lauire's proposal!<. As an adult, it totally makes sense why she would, and it was absolutely the correct decision for both of them. 11 year old me when I read it? I felt *so* betrayed on behalf of >!Laurie!<. Grown up me knows that she never owed him anything >!beyond friendship!<, child me felt so wronged.\n\nThe most recent one I read was *Ace of Spades* by Farida Abike-Iyimide. I was listening to it while on a walk and the >!music teacher scene!< had me stop and go, \"Oh shit\". Abike-Iyimide did a good job of setting up the betrayer as enough of an ally that it felt like a real betrayal, but not so up the MC's butt that it felt like a set up for a betrayal.\n\nDo you have a favorite betrayal scene? A favorite betrayer?",

      "title": "Circe: An unexpected favorite",
      "text": "I'm writing this a few hours after I finished the book, and this is my first time writing a post here of what I think after reading a book so bear with me if you please, and let me just say that this one is definitely gonna stick with me for a long, long time.\n\nInitially, I avoided books like Circe because of how it was being advertised especially on tiktok. Despite being a woman, I'm not keen in reading books or even movies or series constantly advertised as being \"feminist\" because I often end up disappointed at how they portray those said feminist ideas (it usually ends up turning out kinda like what She Hulk did). But with Circe, all that stuff wasn't even in my mind while I was reading it, it just felt like I was reading another story with a main character who just could never seem to catch a break (and I mean this in a good way because god was I cheering for Circe when she finally stood up for herself).\n\nIt also helps (or not, idk) that I only have the barest of knowledge when it comes to greek mythology, I know that a lot of its stories were fucked up like the Minotaur, but I didn't know it was Pasaphaes whats her name, among other things, so that only made my reading a lot more addicting as I was eager to see what comes next for Circe. For the most part, I was always asking aloud: Good lord, why is everyone so mean to her? And when she and Hermes first met, I actually \"OooOoohed\" out loud lmao like it was my first romance book (and now that I think about it, it kinda is). I've seen other reviews describing the book that it was a little predictable and bland, but again, as someone with not that much idea about greek mythology, I was in for one hell of a ride.\n\nHowever, what I did know about at least was the Odyssey. I stumbled a book about it when I was a kid, one of those disney hyperion ones that make otherwise violent myths to a little more kid-friendly, and I loved it. Eventually my greek mythology hyperfixation ended before I could dive deeper into the much more gritty tales and their specifics. Before reading the book, I had also been obsessed with Epic the Musical and while I know that the creator has repeatedly said that he'd taken a lot of creative liberties with his songs (not that it's a bad thing, I still listen to the album nearly everyday), I was still somewhat surprised with the realization that Odysseus was definitely NOT okay after the war. And I don't mean just PTSD-not okay, but the kind that would make him call his son a coward, turn away from him, kill innocents who only had the misfortune of being assosciated with the suitors out of paranoia, and the way he dealt with the parents of those suitors and the soldiers too. How it never crossed my mind that they would be rightfully angry why their sons never came home is something I don't know. Perhaps it was because I just wanted to imagine a happy ending for Odysseus, but Circe's version of him was, and I'm not sure if this is the right word, \"sobering\". Like I had woken up from fantasizing and realized that yes, this could very well be a possibility of what happened to Ody after the war. Worsen his traumas with Athena whispering in his ear, and...  well... I think I'll stick with Epic Athena thank you very much.\n\nAlso.\n\nCirce and Telemachus.\n\nSo, uh... before that, I was giddy when I realized that they were all bonding like a family, like being a mother to the other's son and vice versa, and nope, I was dead wrong. And when I looked it up to see if it was true, not only Telemachus and Circe married, but Telegonus and Penelope too and I just noped the fuck out. Thankfully, it was only the former in the book, and even then, I had already realized that these gods were simply just very strange creatures who don't really think about bloodlines as much as we do, heck who don't think about stuff the same way that we do. After Telegonus left, that sweet adorable little shit, I just ached for her all ovet again, so when she confronted Helios, spat in his face to leave her out of his infinite list of children, and began a life with Telemachus, I realized that you know what? Just be happy. Live and be happy.\n\nIn summary, I adored the book and I think it restarted my greek mythology hyperfixation.\n\nMadeline Miller, I will always praise her seamlessly weaving all these stories together and actually make it not only coherent but also a tale that you would remember for a long, long time. She writes very beautifully, so much so, that I actually brought out a pencil and started underlining tons of the book's quotes after never doing something like that before, like me writing my thoughts and posting it on the internet. It was just such a lovely book, I'm still scared to look up if Telemachus and Circe had a peaceful life together cuz you know how greek myths fuck people's lives over, but even if it wasn't, I'll be content with the ending and the things Circe imagined for the future. Also, there's fanfiction so *shrugs*\n\nAll in all, a 10/10 book for me. Flaws and all. I'll look forward to reading the Song of Achilles and rip my heart into shreds all over again.\n\nedited: grammar and missing words because i had been drinking fast juice (coffee)",

      "title": "Are idea-centric/philosophical books with representative characters similar to children’s literature?",
      "text": "I don’t mean this in anyway to lessen any book or those who enjoy them. Some are considered masterpieces of literature.\n\nI was watching a YouTube video on one-star reviews of classic literature, where the person was giving their thoughts on the reviews. One book was The Brothers Karamazov, which I admittedly haven’t gotten around to reading. One review mentioned that the characters didn’t act/feel like people, and the YouTuber responded that Dostoyevsky had each brother represent a specific worldview and used them to present specific philosophical ideas.\n\nHard sci-fi, a current example being The Three-body Problem, similarly has been noted as having/using/viewing characters as ways of presenting certain ideas and making them more archetypical because the “point” of the story is the ideas.\n\nOver the past decade or so I’ve been increasingly disinterested in more overt examples of this, **which is 100% personal preference and not any objective criticism of the works**. I would imagine all great stories have some form of these, but the more overt, blatant examples of this is what I’m not a fan of.\n\nThis made me draw the connection to children’s literature (or media in general?) where certain themes and morals are more blatant because of the target audience. Like if Guy Goodhero is more or less an ideal person and he needs to defeat the pure evil Villain McBaddie at his Fortress of Evil to get the Sword of Goodness and eventually marries Faith Pureheart…I think that’s a little on the nose, but it’s a children’s book trying to get certain themes and ideas across.\n\nThat’s obviously an exaggerated example, but it seems like with more “big idea” works, the presentation and treatment of characters is fundamentally the same. When characters represent a specific idea/message/etc, **and that’s their purpose and single identifying trait**, it makes me wonder why the author is bothering with characters in the first place. \n\nThis may be my bias towards characters, but I feel like if someone is writing a (adult) philosophical, idea-centric work, writing non-fiction would be the more appropriate method. In non-fiction, they can directly present their idea/message, which seemingly would be the goal, but by going the fiction route, they’re spending time on superfluous things like characters and narrative.\n\nI liken it to a musician whose primary goal/focus is the lyrics and treats the musical aspects of the songs as serving the lyrics. In that case, I wonder why not just write poetry if the actual “music” in their music is subservient to the words themselves. Of course they can do whatever they like in whatever form/medium/etc they want, but it seems like if there’s something of a mismatch. As music can exist without lyrics, the purpose/reasoning/etc for music would be the music itself. As “big ideas” can be presented without characters and narrative, and “characters” only(?) exist within a narrative, it seems like to me that when you have characters and narrative, that those should be the primary focus rather than the underlying message. When the idea/message makes the characters subservient, it begins to head in the Guy Goodhero vs Villain McBaddie direction.\n\nThoughts?\n\nThank you.",

      "text": "From what I understood Candence got carried away with her feeling of rebelling and being a revolutionary and perhaps the music she was listening to also put her in the zone ( the dangers of being carried away by music) and put the ground floor of the house on fire when her cousins were on the first floor.\n\nIt is heartbreaking because she was so close to her cousins and to live with the memory that she accidentally put them on fire- i can't even imagine but actually i can because it is relatable to have a plan not go according to plan. But the ending is a bit hopeful because it seems she decides to live on and to try and forgive herself. In a way it reminds me of how Harry Potter accidentally put his god father Sirius Black in danger because he wasn't able to stop Vodermort from entering in to his mind and luring him in to a trap. The anguish poor Harry feels is akin to what Cadence would feel except for Cadence its 3 loved ones she lost.\n\nIn some books when a character dies, its often in a heroic sense, they died saving someone, they died for a cause , or in a terminal romance genre like the fault in our stars one of the love birds succumbs to the illness. But in we were liars it was Cadence and the liars not planning the fire properly such that they d all be safe and Candance in a moment of being swept away by the exciting feeling of rebellion forgetting to make sure they were all downstairs near the exit.\n\nIts also interesting because the book portrays the parents and grand parents as kind of the money hungry villains and as the children who see through the nonsense but in the end its more nuanced than that as the children also chose a dangerous way to prove a point that resulted in 3 of them dead. So in that sense i like how the author brought nuance and it wasn't just a story of one group winning or losing over the other.",

      "title": "The Midnight Library was not the best...but it wasn't the worst either",
      "text": "When I was younger (say 12-13 years old) I had read \"A Boy called Christmas\" by Matt Haig. Since then it has become one of my most beloved books and I have read it many times. One year ago I noticed that another book by the same author was gaining more popularity and that was none other than The Midnight Library. I was intrigued by the plot and the mixed reviews and I decided to keep an eye on it for the future. Last Christmas my sister gifted it to me but due to high school exams, I wasn't able to read it - until now.\n\nI'll start by saying that although the book did not meet all of my expectations, I was not disappointed. Truth be said, I expected to like it more than I did but it didn't leave a bad taste on me once I was done reading it. Is it overhyped. Most likely yes? Did I enjoy it? Also yes. I think that it's good that I read it now, because had I read it sooner, when my excitement over it was higher, I would be more disappointed.\n\nFrom the very first pages, I was hooked by the plot. We get to see Nora's life, how miserable she feels and how she has given up on life. Once Nora enters the midnight library after she attempts to kill herself, we witness her journey to find the perfect life for her. She is not alone. In the library she finds Mrs Elm, the old librarian from her old school. With her help she tries to navigate through the millions possible lives she could live in. But what is the best way to live?\n\nI found the concept of the book very imaginative. I haven't read any books like this before and the system was very unique too. Just imagine how interesting it would be if we had the opportunity to travel to all of the different lives we might have lived! How different our path would be if we did even the smallest change in our life. Matt Haig did a good job crafting this magic system and for the most part, I enjoyed following Nora in her different paths.\n\nThe book did a good job exploring Nora's regrets and sadness. At the beginning it's clear that Nora is suffocated by her guilt and desperation. She regrets the things she did and the things she didn't do. She feels like she has wasted her life and isolated by almost everyone, she doesn't find a reason to live anymore. Her past haunts her continuously and in the library, she finds the chance to undo her mistakes and live her life differently. However, she quickly realises that what sounded so wonderful in her head was not what she made it out to be. Most of her biggest regrets were because she didn't get to fullfil other people's wishes. Her father's dream to see her become a great competitive swimmer. Her ex-fiance's dream to open a pub in the country. Her brother's dream to become a famous musician. And the list goes on.\n\nThroughout her life, Nora was focused on trying to please the people around her. The dreams she didn't get to fullfil were never her own. Of course she found enjoyment in some things, like studying philosophy, playing music or swimming. But most of her goals were guided by others' desires. She never got to have her own ambitions. Instead of following her own path, she tries to live up to the expectations of others - and ultimately fail. But that changes as she travels in her other lives. She accepts that she can't undo her past. She accepts her own regrets. And she finally finds enjoyment in living. She doesn't seek death and she wants to live instead. But there is one question: what could her best possible live be?\n\nFor the most part, I enjoyed reading about the different lives of Nora. It was interesting to see how different the outcome would be had she made different decisions. Although I didn't fully connect with Nora, I felt sympathy for her, especially at the beginning. I could understand her frustation and worries and I really wanted her to find the best life. I also enjoyed seeing her growth and how she came to appreciate herself and value.\n\nThe writing was good. It was simple and at times, it was quite lyrical. Some parts made me laugh, some made me angry and some others made me sad. There were many quotes that resonated with me and made me pause and rethink about my choices and life. In some parts, the book felt bittersweet and overall, it brought me comfort while reading it. It was cheesy, I know. But I still enjoyed it.\n\nI appreciated the theme around the \"meaning\" of life and how we define success. By pursuing success and by being driven by egoistical motives, we start to lose ourselves. We are trying to give a meaning to our lives, to find our purpose in this world and by doing so, we're starting to stop appreciating life for what it is. We are not able to see the forest for the trees and we underestimate the importance of the little things that are making as feel happy and content. And as the book says:\n\n>*Never underestimate the importance of small things.*\n\nThere have been times in my life when I too have felt remorse for some of the things I have or haven't done. I have felt remorse for getting a bad grade when I knew I could study more and do better. I have felt remorse for fighting with my sister over something insignificant. I have felt remorse for saying bad things to my mom during a heated argument. True, compared to Nora or other people's regrets, mine may seem unimportant. But at the time, they still made me feel bad and I wished I could change them. However, as time went on, I have come to accept that I can't change the past. What I should do instead is try to develop more as a person and live my life in the fullest. It sounds cliche. I know. But it's something which is worth to remember. It's pointless to try and change our past decisions, no matter how we feel about them. What we can do is learn from our mistakes and try to fix them. Yes life can be bleak. And it's not going to be easy to just get over our hardships. But there is a possibility of a better future, if we manage to take matters in our own hands. To seize our own day.\n\nAs much as I enjoyed reading the book, as I already mentioned above, it wasn't exactly what I expected. This is one of the cases when the author has a good idea but the execution is lackluster. The concept of the book was very good and unique. It could be better, though. At one point, the plot became quite repetitive. Nora's lives followed the same structure and during the middle of the novel, they became quite predictable and monotonous. I still had fun while reading them but I was quite close at skimming some parts. I think that it would have been nice if we had more chapters like the first ones, before Nora entered the library. There was much telling and not showing when it came to her past and the relationship with her family and while that was not necessarily bad, it would have been more effective if they were presented in a different way. \n\nThe plot would have definitely benefitted from more action, especially during the middle. Although the book was fast-paced, at one point I stopped caring a little because I knew that nothing remarkable would happen. The plot twists in Nora's lives lost their charm and the story was going around in circles. I would have prefered it if the book had focused in fewer lives and if some themes had been explored more.\n\nThe characterisation in this book was quite bland. The only character I got to know better was of course Nora but even she wasn't that fleshed out. Of course the book describes her worries, her struggles with her mental health, her developement. I sympathised with her, I felt proud of her developement but overall, I didn't have strong feelings about her as a person. She was read like a shell of a person at times. She would live a different life, realize that she didn't like it, have a short conversation with Mrs Elm and conclude that she had been wrong about what would be the best for her. Her journey to self reflection could have been handled better and she could have. As for the rest of the characters...well, they were kinda forgettable. Mrs. Elm was the typical type of character who is there to give advices to the main characters and be a mentor to them. And I couldn't bring myself to care for the rest of the others.\n\nWhen it came to the writing, although it was good, it became kinda corny with all of these deep and intellectual quotes. I understand what Haig's goal was and as I already said, many of them made me think a lot. But they could have been toned out. At one point, I felt like I was reading the same thing over and over again and despite the warm feelings it caused me, it was quite boring and surface-level. \n\nDespite my criticism of the novel, I still found it enjoyable and thought-provoking. The ending made me cry a little and I finished the book with a smile on my face. Granted, it was not the best book I've ever read but it was okay and I by no means regret reading it. It was a very cozy autumn read and I could see myself revisiting it in the future if I wanted to read something light-hearted and easy-going. I wouldn't recommend it as a life-changing read but I wouldn't discourage anyone from reading it. After all, books are unpredictable. You don't know what you will like unless you'll try it. Just like most of the things we're doing in our life.\n\nSo, The Midnight Library didn't change my mindset. But it made me re-value my life and it encouraged me to continue to live in the best way I can. I might not now what is going to happen tomorrow, in one week or in a few years. But one thing is certain:\n\nI'm going to try and live every minute of it.",

      "text": "I was a member of another online forum and found it very frustrating that people were using what they read as a way to create or strengthen divisions. Like between people who liked genre fiction vs. those who read the classics. Or one type of genre fiction vs. another. Or rejecting someone just because they read a book by a disliked author or on a taboo subject or whatever. Felt like high school when you could get rejected if you said you liked, say, a new age musician (as opposed to rock music or something).\n\nI still feel quite wary about mentioning the books I have enjoyed reading, always worrying someone is gonna come out and judge me harshly and say, \"How the hell can you like that garbage? I mean you are entitled to your opinion...but damn!\"\n\nI think a better question to ask, when someone talks about liking a book that you did not or the kind of book you would not read, is, \"What did you like about it the most?\"\n\nOften the reason for liking a book has to do with more than intellect, it's something that speaks to the person's heart, validates their experiences or desires, and is true or enlightening in some personal way. You could of course say, \"to each their own,\" and let that be the end of it, but I think by asking open-ended and nonjudgmental questions, reading can be used as a way to bridge gaps and brings us together, not push us further apart.",

      "text": "I just wanted to read this book. That's all.  \n\nIn the story, Raoul meets his beloved Kristina, whom he has not seen for several years, at the opera house and wants to meet her, but he finds out that she is talking to some kind of \"Angel\", or is it the Phantom of the Opera, who terrorizes the theater?  \n\nIf you've watched the musical, then you know that it pays a lot of attention to the relationship between Kristina and the Phantom. But the book is a thriller in which the Phantom of the Opera himself is a mystery figure to the reader as well. The author holds the tension quite well. But a couple of questions remain. >!Why did the usher know the Ghost, and why does he have mystical powers?!<\n\nOf the characters, I would like to discuss the Phantom of the Opera himself. >!I hate him. The author tries to make us feel sorry for him at the end, but he was nasty throughout the book. He manipulated Kristina's feelings by pretending to be an \"Angel\", killed people, tried to make Kristina his wife by force, threatening Raul with death in the end, and when Kristina took off his mask, he yelled at her and pulled her hair out of anger. I know that looks are a sore subject for him, but damn. He also created a torture machine. His positive traits are that he loved Kristina sincerely and that he sings like an angel. Otherwise, he's a freak on the outside and on the inside. I understand that Raoul is not God's dandelion, but he is better than a Phantom in any case.!<\n\nThe writing style is interesting. The book is written in the style of a documentary, like it's all already happened and author reconstructing history for us. I liked the moment where the author of two pages described how an opera female singer accidentally croaked and then wrote something like: \"Yes, I'm describing a two-page millisecond action, but it was such a shock...!\" But what I didn't like was the too frequent use of \"!\" signs. Maybe it's a distinctive feature of French literature, but I didn't like that everyone was yelling.\n\nIn general, I liked the book. It was quite intense, and the documentary style was interesting.",

      "text": "I couldn't understand why the epilogue was exceptionally mean-spirited towards Clara. It felt like it came out of nowhere. \n\nZafón seems to depict Clara a lot more respectfully earlier in the story, which is why it seemed so weird to me that he ends the epilogue by going into specific detail about how she feels her beauty failing and her becoming more bitter and withdrawn because of it. Her marriage has failed in less than a year and her list of suitors is dwindling. Daniel makes a point of saying how lonely she is and how he pities her now.\n\nIt doesn’t feel like this shift in tone is meant to be tragic – it seems almost hateful, which feels like a huge shift in tone from how Clara was depicted before. It feels even more strange since it is coming from Daniel, who seemed to treat Clara with reverence even when he was dealing with his unrequited love and distancing himself to protect his broken heart. \n\nIn the beginning, Daniel adores Clara and seems to take personal responsibility when he realizes she doesn’t hold the same romantic love for him. When the two cross paths again in the middle of the story, Daniel doesn’t seem bitter about how their friendship had ended. However, in the epilogue Daniel (really Zafón) seems to go out of his way to describe how Clara’s life has fallen apart. Her “post-credits scene” seems closer aligned to Fumero’s demise rather than any of the other characters.  \n\n\nI’ve seen a lot of people criticize Zafón’s portrayal of women throughout the whole book, but this seems a shade different than that.",

I know he had his moments of hapiness, especially towards the end of the story, but oh my goodness did this guy lead a hard life. I'm happy he got the recognition he deserved (again, towards the end of the book) and that his music was being sung throughout Europe. It felt like the hardships he endured weren't for nothing.

For me this former realism really anchors the fantasy elements to reality. It doesn't feel like I'm escaping to a fantasy realm. It feels like I'm learning things about the strange world that I inhabit. This particular book also had some amazing tech-noir elements with the protagonist being a cryptographer and semiotecs trying to steal the secrets of the System. It reminded me a lot of Yoshitoshi Abe's works too like Technolyze and Serial Experiments Lain. I subconsciously visualized the town from the End of the World as the town from Haibane Renmei (with the wall and everything).\n\n\nAlso I had to get to the end of the book to notice that none of the characters were given names (the \"chubby girl in pink\" is referred to as the chubby girl in pink until the end basically). \n\n\nNow that I finished it I'll definitely pick up the Wind-up Bird Chronicle",

By the beginning of the book he is visiting America after years of studying abroad, we don't know if he stayed with Grand Laurence for a bit after he became an orphan and then was shipped out to begin his studies, or if he was shipped directly to boarding school after the death of his parents, or if he stayed in Italy.\n\nMost people seen to assume he was directly send to a boarding school. Outside of a vague past with little details, everything checks out. We learn later though that Grand Laurence lost a Granddaughter, a shy Girl who loved music and played the piano. We don't know much about who this Girl was or even who her parents are.\n\nShe could be the daughter of another child Grand Laurence had, but if so where are her parents? did all of Grand Laurence's Children die and their spouses too? was there a curse involved? maybe medicine was that atrocious back then.\n\nThe way I see it there is a good chance that Grand Laurence granddaughter is actually Laurie sister, maybe Dad Laurence died first and then Laurie's Mom Died in Childbirth. Eventually Laurie was sent to boarding school and his sister stayed with Grand Laurence.\n\nWhat do you Guys think any other theories about who this Girl was and who her parents could be?",

      "text": "Note: I originally tagged this as spoiler, but that's not the whole post. I spoiler-fonted just the applicable sections.  \n  \nThis is one of Collins's first suspense novels, and one of many Collins works to examine issues of marriage and legality. The eponymous narrator is second son in a wealthy upper-class family; his older brother Ralph, as the story opens, has just returned to England after becoming dissipated on the Continent; and their sister Clara stays at home being a pure, tender light to her family. Their father is remote, cold, and overwhelmingly concerned with Family Honor. \n\nThat being the case, Basil has no choice but to fall in love at first sight with Margaret, the entirely unsuitable, smoking-hot daughter of a linen-draper. The girl's greedy father, pleading her youth, wrings from Basil an agreement not just to a secret marriage, but to leave the marriage unconsummated for a full year. During this whole time he may visit his lawfully wedded wife at her parents' house, so long as they are always chaperoned by a third person, usually her mother. Meanwhile, the father's confidential assistant, Mr. Mannion, hangs about, outwardly respectful but secretly plotting the frustration of Basil's hopes. >!Sexual humiliation—family ties cut—brain fever—typhus—revenge—remorseful man pursued by grim-visaged Fury of his own making—tears of a faithful sister—reformed elder brother manfully assists—the Imperishable Throne—angel choirs. !<\n\nThis book offers much fodder for psychoanalysis. The name of the guy that's figuratively castrating Basil, while also doubling him, is Mr. Mannion--more of a MAN than Basil is. There's another double, or another shadow, in the opposition between Clara (the pure, innocent Madonna) and Margaret (the dark, selfish, sexy whore). Early on, they appear as two opposed figures in a dream of Basil's--one a woman robed in light, the other in mist. He ignores the one that's pure and shining: \n\n>I was drawn along in the arms of the dark woman, with my blood burning and my breath failing me, until we entered the secret recesses that lay amid the unfathomable depths of trees. There, she encircled me in the folds of her dusky robe, and laid her cheek close to mine, and murmured a mysterious music in my ear, amid the midnight silence and darkness of all around us. And I had no thought of returning to the plain again; for I had forgotten the woman from the fair hills, and had given myself up, heart, and soul, and body, to the woman from the dark woods.\n\nSecret recesses and dusky folds, indeed! The hero is erotically fixated, and completely ignores his beloved's dim cupidity, preferring to believe in his vision than in reality. The novel never really notices or examines the fact that of the hero's two love objects, one is his own sister. \n\nWhen Basil's brother Ralph appears on the scene, he's a breath of fresh air. He winningly refers to his mistress as Mrs. Ralph, for instance. He doesn't subscribe to the rest of his family's overwrought emotions and instead gets straight to the point, bringing some welcome common sense and energy to the story: \n\n>>!\"Just listen to me, now. In the first place, remember that what my father said to you, he said in a moment of violent exasperation. You had been trampling the pride of his life in the mud: no man likes that—my father least of any. And, as for the offer of your poor little morsel of an income to stop these people's greedy mouths, it isn't a quarter enough for them. . . . Nothing but money will do; money cunningly doled out, under the strongest possible stipulations. Now, I'm just the man to do that. . . . Write me the fellow's name and address; there's no time to be lost—I'm off to see him at once!\"!<\n\n>!Of course, nothing gets resolved quite that easily, and Basil seems to like it that way, preferring the torture of high emotions to Ralph's easygoing sense. In the end, virtue prevails, but !<I found myself wishing I could read more about Ralph and Mrs. Ralph; better company by far, I'm sure, than Basil and his pure sexless sister.",

I wasn’t expecting the full story of her life but it’s also depressing something that obvious was just completely glossed over.",

      "title": "Potentially hot take: Jazz is my favorite work by Toni Morrison ",
      "text": "Up until recently finishing Jazz, I would have said the objectively best Toni Morrison was Beloved and my personal favorite was Song of Solomon. Now I think Jazz may take both of those categories. Here’s why:\n\n1. This is the most innovative work by Morrison formally. The obvious formal parallel is jazz music, as the writing is meant to reflect the newly found freedom and raw emotion of the jazz age. But I would also draw a huge parallel to Faulkner, especially Light in August. The very disjointed, almost jarring switches in narrative, the intensely lyrical interludes, and the use of incredibly heavy recurring symbolism felt very reminiscent of the way that book was structured. \n2. The number of complex, nuanced racial themes touched upon within ~225 pages is staggering. You have the legacy of slavery (obviously) but also more subtle discussions of colorism and interracial identity along with the overarching theme of the opportunity and alienation that resulted from the very rapid shift from countryside to city in the African American community of that time. The ideal of breaking with slavery’s legacy and achieving unprecedented independence in the city is balanced with the breakdown in traditional values and the overall sense of alienation that came with urban life. Moreover, the urban transplants (Joe and Violet) can’t escape their upbringings through moving, and the traumas of rural southern life are still there; they just manifest differently in the urban landscape.\n3. The ending (I don’t want to put spoilers so just trust me on that) \n4. The characters are highly complex, the narrators can be both highly sympathetic and highly unreliable, and every character is somehow tied together. One of the biggest criticisms I see about this book is how disjointed it is, but I found it remarkable how basically all of the Virginia characters and Harlem characters related. It was actually a pretty meticulously developed plot that just developed nonlinearly. The recurring symbols also gave it a sort of grounding/unity.\n\nOf course, this is all just my opinion. I really think all Morrison books are great and would be curious if anyone else agrees/disagrees.",

      "title": "The Tale of Genji - by Murasaki Shikibu",
      "text": "I finished this book just before Christmas, but it was such a massive book that I'm still not sure that I have wrapped my head around it, so I might make another post a couple months down the line. But I will try to write something now and hopefully I can encourage you to read this book!\n\nThe Tale of Genji, written by court lady Murasaki Shikibu around 1000 AD in Japan. This was the Heian period, a time of peace and internal stability, and thus excessive wealth, court intrigues, beautiful clothing, and incredibly complex social and cultural laws to be followed. Women are not allowed to be viewed standing, and ideally when they turn from child to woman, around the age 12-14 or so, their face should only be viewed by three men: their fathers, their brothers, and their husbands. When meeting other men, and sometimes even these men, they do so behind screens or curtains. Men, at least the handsome ones, are allowed (i.e. socially, according to society) to marry several women and also, at the same time, \"spend the night\" with attractive women and force themselves upon women if the women resist. Our author Murasaki tells us then the women feel horror in the moment, but afterwards they seem to have enjoyed it, or at least the experience of being with a handsome man like Genji, especially if he left them a note with a poem written in beautiful calligraphy. \n\nIt is a world which is in many ways extremely foreign, and yet so extremely similar to our own. It really shows the difference between being human, and sharing the same cultural values. On occasion, I will read: \"Young people dabble at music an dpick up mannerisms, and what passes for music is very shallow stuff indeed,\" or \"This was Ukifune's first separation from her mother, and she was of course sad; and yet the prospect of living with her sister for a time in abright, fashionable house was not unpleasing.\" and boom, could have been written today, and at other times the incessent attention to the most minute detail in clothing and calligraphy seems both tedious and pointless. \n\nI read the entire book á 1200 pages and I'm still not sure I got down the cultural values to a tee, but on the whole it is clear that it is a coherent truth system: they have their ways, they are thought out, they answer every question and they work for the characters in the story. It works, you just have to accept that they have a diffrerent world view and let them do their things, and you will find gem upon gem among the pages. \n\nSome random notes:\n\n**Poetry**: so, so, so much poetry. Some of it just doesn't translate well (I would guess, because it just doesn't sound good), but some are extraordinarily beautiful:\n\nOne of our heroes, Kaoru, is talking to the personal guard of a prince who has died \\[of old age\\]. The guard, who now has no master, and has thus lost both a friend and a job, says: \"I had the honor of his \\[the prince's\\] protection for more than thirty years and now I have nowhere to go. I could wander off into the mountains, I suppose, but '*the trees denies the fugitive its shelter*.\" \n\nThis is a reference \\[according to my footnotes\\] to the poem:\n\n*The tree denies the fugititve its shelter.* \n\n*It sheds its scarlet leaves, and so rebuffs him*.\n\nAs you can see, even the most straightforward quotation of a poem is still at least a little bit cryptic as to its exact meaning, but no doubt the poem itself (99% of poems cited, at least in my translation/footnotes, are two lines only) is beautiful. \n\n**\"The moon is beautiful\"**. There is this old myth that when the Japanese were translating Shakespeare (or whatever it was), they came upon a line which read: \"I love you\", which they thought was too direct and so they translated it to \"the moon is beautiful\" instead. Apparently that has been debunked, but having read *Genji* I can guarantee that I found where the initial idea came from, and it does indeed show exactly the type of beautiful, indirect speech, and also at the same time how perfectly Murasaki is able to play out a scene between two real people where you have the exact push and pull of two people who are clearly in love, but nervous and don't know how exactly to proceed. This is the scene where Kaoru professes his love for Oigimi on her veranda:\n\n\"'Do you know what I \\[Kaoru\\] would like? To be as we are now. To look out at the flowers and the moon, and be with you. To spend our days together, talking of things that do not matter.'\n\nHis manner was so unassertive that her fears had finally left her.\n\n'And do you know what I would like? A little privacy. Here I am quite exposed, and a screen might bring us closer.'\n\nThe sky was red, there was a whirring of wings close by as flocks of birds left their roosts. As if from deep in the night, the matin bells came to the faintly.\"\n\n**Quips from the nobility** will always remain funny to me. Thus the Crown Prince advices the Emperor \\[not son/father iirc\\] who wishes to marry the Third Princess to Genji:\n\n\"You must delibrate on every facet of the case. However excellent a man may be \\[like Genji\\], a commoner is still a commoner. But if Genji s sto be your choice \\[to marry your daughter to\\], then I think he should be asked to look after her as a father looks after a daughter.\"\n\nAt the same time, Murasaki will sometimes (maybe once every 100 pages) talk directly to us readers, and often poke fun at this mentality herself:\n\n\"Again there were screens for the four seasons. The polychrome paintings, on figured Chinese silk of a delicate lavender, were very fine, of course, but the superscriptions, by the Emperor himself, were superb. (Or did they so dazzle because one knew from whose hadn they had come?)\"\n\n**Character arcs through the thoughts of the characters**. This is really where the book shines the most, Murasaki's ability to convey *everything* simply through characters speaking and thinking, almost never telling us the changes that characters are going through, but still giving clear evidence for it. The following is all from the same page, and I'm only cutting out some excessive wording. The background is that Yugiri, Genji's son, has brought in a second wife into his house (I think he marries her later? Or had he already married her? I can't remember).\n\n\"So I \\[Yugiri\\] have made such arrangements as I have made. When you \\[one of Genji's many wives, not Yugiris mother\\] next see Father you might try to explain all of this to him. I have managed to keep his respec over the years, I think, and I woudl hate to lose it now.' He lowered his voice. 'It is curious how irrelevant all the advice and all the promptings fo yoru own conscience can sometimes seem.'\n\n/.../\n\n'One things does strike me \\[the aforementioned one of Genji's many wives\\] as odd: your good father seems to think that no one has the smallest suspicion of his own delinquencies, and that yours give him a right to lecture when you are here and criticize when you are not. We have heard of sages whose wisdom does not include themselves.'\n\n/.../\n\n\\[Yugiri\\] went to Genji's rooms. Genji too had heard of these new developments, but he saw no point in saying so. Waiting for Yugiri to speak, he did not see how anyone could reprove such a handsome young man, at the very best time of his life, for occasionally misbehaving. Surely the most intolerant of the powers above must feel constrained to forgive him. And he was not a child. His younger years had been blameless, and, yes, he coudl be forgive these little affairs. The remarkable thing, if Genji did say so about his own son, was that the image he saw in the mirror did not give him the urge to go out and make conquest after conquest.'\"\n\n**So many people**. I am just gonna drop this here. There are so many people. And, according to the culture of Murasaki's time, it was considered impolite to refer to someone by name, so the entire writing style is such that a character's name is basically only used once per scene, and then it's just \"he said\" \"she said\" again and again, never \"he said\" followed by \"and then Genji paused and spoke\" to remind us that, yes, it is Genji who is speaking. It definitely gave me a headache until I got used to it. \n\n\\--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nReading through my post I'm not sure it makes much sense. Writing this I am realizing that I still haven't fully digested and internalized the book. It is massive. And so, so, so much happens, and at the same time, so little happens and the book can at times be extremely tedious in the amount of people and relations and complex relationships. My strong advice if you balk at the prospect of 1200 pages of a 1000 AD Japanese fashion show is to start at chapter 45 - The Lady at the Bridge. I will not spoil too too much, but that is when the Eight Prince, and more importantly, his two daughters are introduced. \n\nIf 400 pages are too much, I can compromise to the extent that I'll recommend starting at chapter 50 - The Eastern Cottage, the last \\~200 pages. Reading through my notes that I scribbled down as I was reading, 19 pages into chapter 50 I wrote: \"Just a comment that ever since \\[chapter 50\\] has basically been the best part of the entire book so far. I felt it for like 10-20 pages.\" And, having finished the book, chapter 50 onwards is really, really, really good. It is still the same style of Murasaki, it's just that instead of having like 5 minor stories of relationships and feelings with unconnected people, she really narrows it down to one major storyline, and it becomes so much more digestable and, yeah, I mean, read any part of the book and you can tell that she's an amazing author, and when you actually remember every character in the plot line it becomes even better.",

      "title": "Review of Luda by Grant Morrison, a genderqueer diatribe by a brilliant comic writer. Powerfully written... but barely decipherable",
      "text": "Firstly, a disclaimer. I am very much a fan of Grant Morrison who is pretty much my favorite comic book writer. I have always loved their chaotic punk sentiment, since the 80s proto-Vertigo era of *Animal Man* and *Doom Patrol* that deconstructed superheroes in fresh and interesting ways post-Watchmen/Dark Knight Returns (that is, without the lazy grimness of so many contemporaries), all the way to *JLA* and *New X-Men* and the high-concept mainstream work of the 2000s written with depth and enthusiasm for the genre, while also experimenting with more literary explorations of the medium published by the aforementioned Vertigo and later Image.\n\nSo, suffice to say, I was very intrigued when it was announced that Grant Morrison would be publishing their first prose novel, *Luda.* And, that does mean I would be reading this with certain preconceived notions and expectations. Perhaps this is unfair, like I should be trying harder to simply read a novel fresh and without any baggage, and that’s enough, but like it or not that’s the context. For me.\n\nThe point is, *Luda* is not a psychedelic science fiction story. Of course I wouldn’t have expected the superhero genre specifically, but even something adjacent along the lines of space opera, or time travel, or spy adventures—no it’s none of that. Rather, *Luda* is an ambitious novel indeed but somewhat more grounded in a somewhat real-world setting, in the city of Gasglow (get it?), focused on the drag queen scene and the world of musical theatre showbiz.\n\nThat’s fair. In fact, Grant Morrison came out as nonbinary in recent years and certainly that makes for a valid inspiration to study such themes, especially for such a cerebral writer. And I have enjoyed reading the occasional queer memoir very much, don’t get me wrong. It’s just, after years and years of reading exciting Grant Morrison graphic novels, it is a bit jarring how different is the novel *Luda.*\n\nOne more thing worth nothing, in the Scots author’s 90s conspiracy fiction opus of *The* *Invisibles* there was a trans character called Lord Fanny, a shamanic and anarchic witch who flipped gender roles upside down. This was indeed very ahead of its time. Comparisons for those who are familiar with this work are therefore are unavoidable.\n\nAnyway, with that necessary preamble out of the way, now on to the specifics: *Luda* is a mentor-protégé story from the point of view of the mentor—drag queen superstar Luci who is the incredibly witty and snarkily vulgar narrator. Luci is an outright celebrity but now in middle age and somewhat over the hill, and the bulk of the “plot” is about the production of a comedic and outrageous pantomime play based on Aladdin. Throughout the novel, the play is rehearsed and the reader gets to see that story unfold. Then, the eponymous and impossibly beautiful Luda shows up and steals the show.\n\nLuci takes this mysterious new superstar under her wing, and they get into some outrageous adventures together involving a grand and haunting sex party, as Luci explains it all. There are endless occult references, referred to as the “Glamour,” with the narration going on and on jumping around from irreverent pop culture to extremely dense treatises on literature and identity and the magickal tradition.\n\nThis is all profoundly well written. Too well written. With a modicum of dialogue, the novel is much more about the author’s playing with language than it is about plot or even character. There are so many killer lines, brilliantly clever works of prose in paragraph after paragraph. And it is too much, copious amounts of showing not telling which is unfortunate for a scriptwriter. With every page shouting at you with the most badass turns of phrases you’ve ever come across, in very lengthy paragraphs mind you, there’s no room to breathe and it’s a struggle to maintain that energy.\n\nCheck this out, I will open the book to a random spot and there will surely be a perfect example. Let’s try page 136…\n\n*The mood was mock-Arthurian. The Questing Best. The Unicorn. The White Hart. Sacred and heraldic beasts cantering through a profane Cumalot. We both knew we were honour-bound to follow the lowing cry all the way to the shadiest of Hades if need be.*\n\nSee what I mean? I can do this again, totally randomly here’s page 233—\n\n*I applied the finishing touches to Luda’s latest makeover, an airbrushed mist of glitter on the perfectly-emphasized letter-opener blade of her left cheekbone. Where previously I’d applied the pink-frosted, lip-glossed doll-sheen of a wide-eyed* ingénue *on the Bad Ship Lollipop, this time I was serving the seductive, experienced mask of a bloodsucking, eternally young vampire countess with succulent midnight-blue lips. A three-hundred-year-old teenage black widow blinking in stripped-back starlight as I pinned her Louise Brooks copper bob in place.*\n\nOr page 292,\n\n*When Luda wasn’t here, she might as well be nowhere. Her whole life could be subtracted into a single bag of clothes and shoes, cosmetics and condoms. It was why she borrowed my heels, however reluctantly. She owned nothing.*\n\n*Like I said, Luda was a quantum event, existing only when she was observed.*\n\nIt’s a lot. Frankly, there are too many ideas and it overwhelms. How can any one scene stand out, when it’s all trying so hard to stand out?\n\nAnyway, after 400 pages of this with several violent scenes strewn in, I was able to decipher some kind of disturbing mystery surrounding Luda’s origins, and then there’s the shock ending. Although the novel defies classification, the narrative mostly turns out to be a kind of horror. But by that point, after the various revelations and attempts at topping itself which is a feat when everything is gauged at 11, most readers are going to be exhausted.\n\nThe nature of this novel, however frantically written, requires a slow reading. Repeat viewings. Like Jocyean studies, with deep dives into the poetic rhythm of the words. There’s tremendous artistry and craft, and for the diligent reader I’m sure it’s very rewarding. I am glad I made it to the end, not just because I’m a Morrison completist but because I got to experience a book unlike anything else I’ve ever read. Yet, I still have to admit it, this was quite a challenge and therefore just not as fun.",

      "title": "Recently finished Rob Halford's Confess",
      "text": "I read this book about a month ago. Not everything is fresh in my mind, but I'll do my best. It was, BTW, more or less what I would've expected. Lots of sex, drugs, and Heavy Metal.\n\nI'll preface this by saying that I'm not much of a Heavy Metal or even a Rock fan. My brother is, particularly when I was younger and sharing a room with him.\n\nSo, on occasion, I listen to some metal songs he would listen back in the day simply because I liked them. That includes Iron Maiden, ACDC, Led Zeppelin, Megadeath, Metallica, Aerosmith, Pantera, Disturbed, Linkin Park, Judas Priest, System of a Down, and lots more.\n\nI, however, have never been to a concert. Any concert. Nor have I got plans to go to one. But, I'm a sucker for biographies. So when I saw that the lead singer of Judas Priest had a book, I decided to give it a try.\n\nAnd, if you don't know, he is very British and very gay. And like Jennette McCurdy in her amazing memoir, I'm Glad My Mother Died, he leaves very little to the imagination. So, if it's not your kind of book, you're already warned.\n\nRob Halford grew up in the black country (a zone in England known for its coal). He developed an interest in acting from very young, but eventually transferred his passion to singing.\n\nHe was apparently very good at it, and I don't doubt it. He is an excellent singer. If you've ever heard The Painkiller, you know. In fact, his proficiency as a singer eventually earned him the nickname Metal God.\n\nThere's a lot of sexual abuse, bullying, drug addiction, failed relationships, depression, and concerts in his memoir.\n\nOccasionally, there's also brushes with the law, but they usually have to do with substance abuse or public indecency. He, in general, is not a confrontational person.\n\nA very fun anecdote was meeting lots of fans in jail (I think?), particularly a cop. That's just funny.\n\nAnother highlight in his memoir was his time away from Judas Priest. He decided he wanted to start a side project that turned into a misundertanding that had him leave JP. That's just poor communication skills or maybe the everyday life of an introvert.\n\nIt's a bit weird to hear him say he feared conflict so much that he didn't even bother to explain to his former band members that he didn't want to quit JP, but I'm very glad they took him back with open arms.\n\nIt's also interesting to see how difficult it was for him to start again. JP had an established fandom. His new band had nothing from the beginning again. I don't know why anyone would start from scratch when one is already at the top, especially in the music industry. That sounds like a lot of work.\n\nHe eventually gave up drinking and exercised more. It happened in the midst of a very toxic relationship. And yeah, that was a tough part. Lots of violence and substance abuse. Not a very good combination.\n\nA former partner of his commited suicide right after getting a woman pregnant. I was very confused there. Why? Is that really such a bad thing? I don't get it. I had to make use of mental gymnastics to understand the motivations there. Maybe he thought Rob wouldn't finance his lifestyle anymore on hearing the news of the pregnancy? That's my theory.\n\nAs Rob grew older, more and more things happened. I think he didn't officially get married, but unofficially he did. Also, one of the members of JP developed Alzheimer's (or was it Parkinson's?). That's just awful. Not being able to play anymore is just too cruel.\n\nAnd, Rob eventually got diagnosed with Cancer. If I remember correctly, his mother had died of Cancer too, but it was of a different kind. It makes one think of all the things we give for granted. He did beat Cancer in the end, though.\n\nAll in all, an interesting read. But, very graphic. That said, I'm more than happy when authors don't fear sharing their most vulnerable moments. If there's something I dislike is superfluous and shallow writing. And this isn't that. You pretty much get the full story.",

      "title": "The Seven Moons of Maali Almeida by Shehan Karunatilaka (Book Review)",
      "text": "The Seven Moons of Maali Almeida by Shehan Karunatilaka is such an excellently written piece of fiction which is frankly incomprehensible for me to convey the jarring intensity. Wow, I am at a loss for words in describing this heart wrenching and insightful tale that captures the rawness of the human emotion and displays how corruption and the greed for more, lust and power can twist ones perception of righteousness and lead ones soul to be bounded and chained by them. This is an excellent satire that comments on the corrupted and the crooked nature of the authoritative regime and puts mockery on the concept war itself and how you can achieve nothing with war, only torment, grief, agony and sorrow. Blinded by the ones you trusted.\n\nHow the ones higher up in the power can dictate and rule out the lives of innocent and normal civilians and how greed feeds upon souls that choses to obey the lust for power. In this novel, we follow a war photographer, Maali Almeida after he died in an \"afterlife\", where he has 7 moons (7 days) to decide whether to ascend or to stay in between life and death. I'm sorry for being so vague, I don't want to spoil too much about the story so yeah.\n\nAs we see through his journey to serve righteousness and justice even in afterlife, caring for the ones closest to him and sacrificing himself for the sake of them, we get to see the unwanted and disturbing faces of the authority, the tyranny that is continued after generations and generations in Sri Lanka (and similar countries in South Asia) and how discrimination and prejudice builds up a nest in ones living soul, twisting and turning the courses of their life. How bigoted views of homosexuality and discrimination against other races can map out the evil side of humans. Here, we deal with alot of racism and homophobic views and how the lives of people in a country build upon discrimination is being affected by such stigmas. The authors portrayal of heartbreak, love agony and the horrors and the beastial brutal nature of war and the sufferings of the victims were masterfully conveyed. So meticulously and elegantly crafted that it will make your heart ache. At moments it will give you the utmost thrill of suspense and thoughts to ponder upon while you try to dwell in your slumber.\n\nThe significance of love and friendship, while not being the primary subject of the story, was excellently executed with humorous and playful comedic traits. There were moments in the story where I just straight up bursted laughing, parts are really funny. And were moments where I didn't wanted to progress and felt my soul visibly crumble upon myself. Life after death, being a completely fantastical story while portraying the horrors and the petrifying realities of war and authoritative regime on power while also displaying the degrees of torment and inhumane things inflicted upon innocent souls, incomprehensible and nightmarish fates.\n\nThe story is meticulously crafted that displays inhumanity and humanity in realistic lens and portrays the horrors of wrath and greed while signifying the acts of love and sacrifice. A highly political novel that takes on many lenses but never fades on any. I don't know why but I cant seem to say anything more, perhaps its cuz now is 4AM and my eyes are bloodshot and its been a few moments after I've finished the book. I've received alot of great quotes from this book and would like to share.\n\n***\"History is people with ships and weapons wiping out those who forgot to invent them. Every civilization begins with a genocide. It is the rule of the universe. The immutable laws of the jungle; even this one made of concrete. You can see it in the movement of the stars, and in the dance of every atom. The rich will enslave the penniless. The strong will crush the weak.\"***\n\n***\"All stories are recycled and all stories are unfair. Many get luck, many get misery. Many are born to homes with books, many grow up in swamps of war. In the end, all becomes dust. All stories conclude with a fade to black.\"***\n\n***\"They say laughter is music, but that is just one of the thousand untruths that we suckle ourselves with. Some laughs are piquant, some are hideous, some can curdle the blood.\"***\n\n***\"Evil is not what we should fear. Creatures with power acting in their own interest: that is what should make us shudder\"***\n\n***\"There are good reasons humans can't converse with animals, except after death. Because animals wouldn't stop complaining. And that would make them harder to slaughter. The same maybe said for dissidents and insurgents and separatists and photographers of wars. The less they are heard, the easier they are forgotten.\"***\n\n***\"Because, on reflection, once you have seen your own face and recognized the colour of your own eyes, tasted the air and smelt the soil, drunk from the purest fountains and the dirtiest wells, that is the kindest thing you can say about life. It's not nothing.\"***\n\nThis is something I would regard as an masterpiece. An excellent piece of literature that dwells into the deepest of the darkest sides of human mind, layered with magical realism and mockery of human actions; while being humorous and striking enough, displaying the raw and bitterness of it all. A story, a book, a fragmented layer of thoughts that will stay with you and your soul long after you've turned the last page.",

I'm just not feeling it and I'd love for someone to share their passion for it in hopes that I can be encouraged to continue reading it.\n\nI (literally really) never DNF books, but I’ve finished the first volume of four (*Justine*) of Durrell’s *Alexandria Quartet*, and while it was really **just** okay, I’d have been more positive about it were there not three more volumes to follow that apparently center around or retell the same happenings from a different perspective. \n\nIt reminds me a bit of Powell’s *Dance to the Music of Time*, which I devoured in just a few months. The 12 novels were humorous, heartfelt, and although at times a bit slow, overall endearing and enjoyable. This was largely due, I felt, to them not overselling themselves: they felt somewhat lighthearted and easy reading, but for *AQ*, it’s falling a little bit flat for how epic or deep (or something) I expected it to be (and others talked about it being). I guess I just don’t find it very compelling, in a word. \n\nUsually there’s at least *something* about a book, even if I don’t care for it much, that redeems it: lovable or interesting characters, aphorisms, beautiful writing, something, and while I find the writing beautiful in some places, overall I’m just not into it and find the thought of reading the next 600+ pages just not very appealing. \n\nThis book has high ratings on Goodreads and StoryGraph (also a plug to StoryGraph if you don’t know about it!), but I’m just not into it. I would love to hear anyone’s input or perspective about loving this book and why, because it might help me reframe it, or know what to look for, or something. I’d love for someone’s enthusiasm for this book to be contagious and help me find some interest in finishing it. \n\n(Additionally, I’m reading this because I’m working through [Modern Library’s Top 100 List](https://sites.prh.com/modern-library-top-100), and it’s no. 70 on the list. A high school lit teacher passed that list out to us and over the past 20+ years, I’ve been working on 100%-ing it, and i’m at about 70 now. Some outstanding reads there, some less so.)",

      "text": "Finally read some of Grady Hendrix's fiction! A long while back I talked about his non fiction book \"Paperbacks From Hell\", which was a very interesting read for me. And now I've finally got to read one of his novels, \"My Best Friend's Exorcism\"!\n\nIt's about Abby and Gretchen, two high school sophomores, who have been best friends since the fourth grade. Things go completely wrong after a skinny dip in the evening, Gretchen begins to act strangely. She becomes irritable and strange incidents constantly happen whenever she's around.\n\nAbby embarks on an investigation that would lead to some shocking discoveries, and by the end of it their fate shall be determined by one simple question: is their own friendship strong enough to beat the devil?\n\nThis book is oddly charming at times, while also being very intense and terrifying. There is also a lot of 80s nostalgia going in this book. There are chapters with song titles from some of the top music acts from the era, among other references. I kinda feel like I'm reading something that would've made for a possibly great 80s horror movie (there's a credits page that's fashioned into  something that you would see in the end credits of a movie). And I loved every single minute of it!\n\nI also love the cover of the paperback edition I have. It's made to look like the video tape cases that you would see in video stores and such(and I used to remember those), complete with wears and stickers. And it works pretty well since it is a B format paperback (the format that is a standard for paperbacks nowadays). Really loved this, and now I wonder which other Grady Hendrix novel I will pick up next?",

I just finished Chapters 55 and 56 and, honestly, I had to put the book down for a bit because I was overwhelmed. \n\nI can’t even pinpoint exactly what it was that got to me. Maybe it’s the way Rothfuss writes these intimate, quiet moments that feel so raw and human. Or how Kvothe’s struggles, especially in these chapters, feel both deeply personal and universally relatable at the same time. It’s like he’s dealing with something so simple, yet the weight of it is enormous.\n\nThose chapters feel like a gut-punch without being overly dramatic, you know? There’s something about them that quietly digs under your skin and makes you reflect on your own life in ways you didn’t see coming. Maybe it’s just me, but there was a vulnerability in Kvothe’s character during these scenes that really tore me apart. \n\nHas anyone else had a moment like this with a book? Like, you’re reading and suddenly it’s too much, but in the best way possible?",

      "text": "I'm conflicted about this book. I heard great things about it, i got it and yeah I liked it, it was fun. The more i think about it, though, the less I think it's a well written book. The things I want to discuss will be listed by number, so I'd like to hear your thoughts on my thoughts. you can reference the number to make it easy.\n\n1 - It's not a horror book, it's a love story tyring to be edgy.  Yeah, there's some murder, but, to me, it didn't have \"horror.\"  Detailing over the top murder doesn't make it horror. Setting it during Halloween doesn't make it horror either. \n\n2 - When asked what she did, she replies \"murders and executions.\"  I thought \"oh, nice reference/nod to American Psycho.  Later, Gideon uses the same reply.  Then, she brings it home with \"hello Mr. Bateman.\"   So, at first i thought this was a cool subtle refernce, then it became kind of heavy handed, and then, in case you didn't get it, let me hit you upside the head with it.  We get it, you read American Psycho. \n\n3 - The mysterious girl...is it supposed to be her? Is she delusional, or was it something?  This and a few other things seemed like she was trying to leave things purposely vauge to make it more interesting and creepy, but it came off to me as badly done and a bit pretentious.  Did i miss something?\n\n3.5 - Did she actually fuck Johnny Depp? The whole tiki bar thing seemed like a bad ripoff of Richard Kadrey's Sandman Slim series (i LOVE that series and would recommend). \n\n4 - The ending seemed kinda obvious, not a suprise, I wasn't all \"oh, I didn't see that coming,\"  I saw it coming about midway through the book. Not that i need a surprise twist, it just seemed...yeah, no shit. \n\n5 - I liked the references to music.  This (to me) was her nod to Stephen King, and some Richard Kadrey. Sometimes it felt like padding, i need words, so i'll write the brief history/background of the song.  It was like adding too much spice to a dish.  \n\n6 - Maeve is 27.  The whole time it felt like I was reading about a 16 year old.  SOOOOO emo. \n\nThe book is fun, it's bubblegum for the eyes, a quick easy read. It seems like it's trying too hard, and it seems like she is badly ripping off her literary influences.  I know i just crapped all over the book, i really did enjoy it, i just don't think it was as good as it could have been and i'm confused about how to feel about it.  \n\nWhat are your thoughts?",

So I was excited to take a peek at Mood Machine to really understand what was happening to the music industry due to the Spotify streaming model.\n\nI'm happy to report that, so far, it's been a blast! The interviews are interesting, the history is pretty well presented and it's clear from the jump that Daniel Ek and the rest of the music executives essentially sought to destroy the intellectual value of modern music. I'm not super far into it so there's definitely time for it to fall apart, but so far, it's a much better read for anyone seeking to understand the corrosive effect of the streaming industry on music as an artform.\n\nCan't recommend it enough.",

      "text": "Fahrenheit 451 is one of my favorite books. Different people have different thoughts on what it's about. Is it about censorship? Is it a critique of Television? What makes it great is how versatile it is.  \n\n\n\nOne of the things that I think gets missed sometimes is what it can tell us about the nature of authoritarianism. First, however, I want to talk about some key scenes.  \n\n\n\nOn the second page of the story, Montag is heading home and we're told that he \"let the escalator waft him into the still night air.\" Later, Mildred is listening to music through her \"tamped-shut ears, and her eye all glass, and breath going in and out, softly, faintly, in and out her nostrils, and her not caring whether it came or went, went or came.\"  \n\n\nIn each of these early scenes, air plays an important role in characterizing both Montag and Mildred. In Montag's case, him being wafted up the escalator shows his lack of agency. Later we learn he only even became a fireman because someone suggested he should be one. He didn't actually choose for himself. This is where he is at the beginning of the story, a man who isn't even aware of his lack of agency. I think many of us living in the world as it is feel similarly. It's easy to say, what can *I* do to make a difference? Why even bother trying? The more we think like this, the less we assert our agency, the less we're able to utilize our free will.  \n \n\nIn Mildred's case, this air imagery conveys her apathy. She can't be bothered to breathe because she is so bored and discontent. She knows something is wrong but can't put her finger on it, and that's why she takes too many sleeping pills and has to have her stomach pumped.  \n\n\nBoth of these scenes serve to show the impact living in an authoritarian, dystopian hellscape can have on people. It hollows you out and leaves you stuck, unable to pinpoint what's wrong and even less able to do something about it if you could.  \n\n\n\nHere's where it ties into authoritarianism and tyranny. Fire is the symbol of authoritarian power in this world/story. The firemen are the enforcers, they're meant to be feared and respected. When the power of authoritarian rule makes itself felt on any citizen deemed problematic, that power is manifested through fire.  \n \n\nSo what Bradbury is saying is that the flame of authoritarianism/tyranny is sustained on the air of apathy and lack of agency.  \n \n\nI think in light of how the people of South Korea stood together and said \"fuck this shit,\" and how quickly they organized and how immediate their success was, it's worth pointing out this subtle, easily missed, nugget of wisdom from Bradbury. We need to remember that people who strive to erect an authoritarian, tyrannical government designed for their own benefit depend on the indifference of the masses.",

      "title": "The Brilliant Disaster by Jim Rasenberger (2011)",
      "text": "The Brilliant Disaster by Jim Rasenberger (2011) ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️  \n  \nI have a lot of thoughts about the contents of this book, and I hope I will be forgiven if I ramble and meander a bit in this review.  \n  \nMan, what even was the 1960's? What a decade of madness and paranoia. Reading Jim Rasenberger's retelling of the Bay of Pigs event was both thrilling and intriguing. This narrative even moreso shaped how I view the communications, scheming, ideologies and clashes of agendas that exist within our government, especially around regime changes. Combine this with the aura of suspicion and secrecy that the Cold War shrouded the world in, and it makes for some incredible events. Here, Rasenberger centers his concentration around the catastrophe which was the Bay of Pigs.  \n  \nThe main characters in this story consists of some of the heaviest hitters in 20th century history. We have the charmed John F. Kennedy, his brother Robert, and his wife Jaqueline. We have Eisenhower and Nixon. Across the pond we get Fidel Castro and Che Guevara, two boogeymen to 20th century U.S. Presidents. And the terrifying Nikita Khrushchev, head of a Soviet Union locked in a bitter nuclear staring contest with the United States. A clash of ideologies make for Soviet Invasions in Hungary, Czechoslavakia, and later Afghanistan. The contagion of Communism sparks proxy wars in the Koreas, Laos, Vietnam, to name a few. Not to mention a tug of war over Berlin in Germany, and a fevered race to space. The decision-making that goes into these events are blistered with tension, confusion, projection and covert wackiness that makes for an intensely entertaining time period.  \n  \nThen there is Cuba. To summarize Rathenberger's version of events: a militaristic Fidel Castro overthrows a corrupt Prime Minister in Cuba by the name of Fulgencio Batista, in the late 1950's. While corrupt, Batista had good relationship with then U.S. President Dwight D. Eisenhower, a fact that causes the U.S. government to sour on Castro from the beginning. The young Castro tries to make a good first impression with the U.S, even traveling to NY to meet government leaders and tour the city. Eisenhower snubs meeting Castro to play golf, and instead send his VP Richard Nixon to entertain the revolutionary. Castro suspects his unpopularity with the U.S. government, though New Yorkers flock to him everywhere he goes. He finally gets fed up with Nixon and other government members when they repeatedly press him about his opinion on Communism. Fidel leaves America with a bad taste about its leaders.   \n  \nFast forward to early 1960 where Castro begins relations with the Soviet Union. Soviet Prime Minister Nikita Khrushchev suspects that Cuba and America are in troubled diplomatic waters, and decides to taunt the U.S. by showing friendliness towards Castro and his lieutenants, including the popular Ernesto 'Che' Guevara. This newfound relationship irks Eisenhower, and he begins plans on how to remove Castro from power covertly. Plans that at points even include the Mafia. Eisenhower in conduct with the C.I.A, formulate a plan to raise an organic Cuban expeditionary force made up of anti-Castro rebels, train them in Central America with American special ops, equip them with American weapons and aircraft, and help them launch an Invasion on Cuba. The problem here is that in 1960, Eisenhower was in his last year in office, and his Vice President Nixon was locked in a tight race with a young, popular, upstart Democratic Nominee in John F. Kennedy. For a smooth transition of this plan to work, Nixon would need to win the Presidency in 1961. He does not.  \n  \nThe crux of the problems of the Bay of Pigs Invasion occur at the start when Kennedy inherits this operation from Eisenhower, an operation scheduled to go down in April merely 3 months into Kennedy's Presidency. As CIA directors, and Pentagon officials scramble to catch Kennedy up to speed, I don't believe Kennedy himself, or his cabinet members, really ever understand the parameters of the operation. The CIA under Eisenhower had planned a daytime operation meant to land the Cuban rebels on the beaches with a show of force consisting of disguised American airpower, surprising and shocking Castro's forces, and stirring up the Cubans to rise up and rebel against Castro's administration. Kennedy never really seems to grasp the intent of this operation, and begins changing the plans to fit his view. He wants a covert nighttime infiltration, with limited airpower, to secretly grow the uprising from within. From the start he, and the CIA he inherited become locked in a power struggle over how the operation is to unfold. And there isn't really enough time to iron it all out.  \n  \nQuestions arise out of reading this book that I find baffling, and why this era is so interesting. Why was the CIA and Eisenhower so sure that the Cubans would rise up against Castro, a notion Castro had nipped in the bud anyway by jailing possible dissenters? Why didn't Kennedy just cancel the operation altogether, a plan he never truly felt good about? Why didn't the U.S. see that every time they snubbed Castro, they pushed him closer to the Soviet Union and to Communism? A fear that would eventually manifest itself due to U.S. paranoia.   \n  \nThe Brilliant Disaster is an intense day-by-day, play-by-play narrative that will leave you wanting to learn more about the Cold War. Jim Rasenberger is a fantastic storyteller, and presents an easy to read page turner on an amazing era of politics and ideology. Pair this with Steve Coll's Ghost Wars, and treat yourself to an intense ride on a political landscape that still mystifies us even today.",

      "text": "While long series build a following over time and can run for decades,  and stand alones may achieve great fame, some of the best mysteries out there are in short series, which often get lost in the shuffle. A few of my favorites:\n\nSarah Caudwell's  four-book Hilary Tamar series: The gender indeterminate narrator of these four classics-tinged mysteries is a law don often called in by a group of ex-students who are now young barristers to help sort out tangled crime cases in which they have become personally involved.  Thus Was Adonis Murdered, The Shortest Way to Heads, The Sirens Sang of Murder and The Sibyl in Her Grave are witty and delightful romps that also provide nice clues, twists and turns. The young barristers themselves are also great and original characters with their own complex relationships.\n\nMichael Malone's three book Savile and Magnum series is set in North Carolina and features two police detectives who are close friends from opposite ends of the social scale. In Incivil Seasons, Time's Witness, and The First Lady, founding family scion Justin Savile and working class Cuddy Magnum use their range of connections and mutual trust to navigate the tricky local politics that surrounds the dark doings they uncover.  This books offer suspense and action along with wit and humor. You will wish there were more. Time's Witness especially ranks high on my list of best mystery novels.\n\nKae Ross's four-book Julian Kestrel series, are historical mysteries set in the early 19th century regency period. Kestrel is a young dandy with a resourceful valet, and he finds himself offering to help out friends trouble-trouble that tends to get worse before it gets n better. The series has been lauded for accurate historical detail well plotted mysteries, well-drawn characters and perhaps especially writing that feels convincing rather than contrived. Cut to the Quick, A Broken Vessel, Whom the GOds Love, and The Devil in Music.",

Besides the question of why anyone would ever write this and who could read it without getting an aneurysm, the question I ask myself most often during this is how you guys manage to DNF a book without feeling super bad for several weeks after? Logically, I know I'm wasting my time and getting no enjoyment out of this, but I'm halfway through and do kinda want to know how it ends, but I couldn't have DNF'ed it even at page 50. I can't even think of one fiction book I actually stopped reading because I didn't enjoy it (for nonfiction, well, I can't even finish the books I AM interested in).

      "text": "When I was younger I thought listening to audiobooks rather than reading a physical book was a cheat. I also disliked them because they were so much slower than I could read on my own, and because I thought you didn’t get the same experience from a book when listening to it rather than reading it. Now I realize that audiobooks are just a modern continuation of age-old oral storytelling techniques and are equally capable of inspiring vast mental landscapes and vistas.\n\nI began using audiobooks about 20 years ago when I began knitting. I hated giving up my reading time for knitting/crochet, but I love needlework AS MUCH as I love reading and so had to find a way to use the time I have for both. And now, today, I am severely disabled and physically holding a book is painful for me, so I rely mostly on audiobooks.\n\nI have not been an audiobook snob in many, many years, but I was SUCH a snob about it when I was younger that I wanted to put this out there. The important thing is THAT you are reading, not the format you use to do it. Mea culpa.\n\n~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ \n\n**edit:** Okay, people are REALLY getting into whether audiobooks should count as reading, which is ironic because it’s the exact sort of snobbery I was apologizing for. So, I’m going to put my thoughts out there on whether or not audiobooks should count as having “read” a book.\n\nSome of you are speaking strictly of, and arguing about, sight reading - as in the act of scanning one’s eyes across text and translating those symbols into words - while most of us are using “reading” to describe the complex art of comprehension, visualization and analysis that is the focus of most high school and college level Lit courses.\n\nIf someone is asking if you’ve read a book, they want to have a discussion about that book. In which case what matters is your comprehension, understanding and analysis of the book’s subject matter. When you can break down, critique or analyze passages as well as each other, or quote different lines/sections back and forth in a discussion, does it matter which of you memorized the quotes from the written page versus which of you memorized them after hearing them?\n\nAudiobooks are not “cheating.” If you can have a discussion about the book when you’re finished then you’ve digested the book, whatever manner you used to consume it.\n\nFor those saying that the manner of consumption does different things within the brain, yes and no. Traditional reading may give a reader an edge to their spelling and grammar, and audiobooks may give a boost to a person’s active listening skills, but based on [a study](https://www.jneurosci.org/content/39/39/7722) posted by other commenters, that’s about it. The brain doesn’t care how we consume the story, it digests it the same.\n\n[Audiobooks or Reading? To Our Brains, It Doesn’t Matter](https://www.discovermagazine.com/mind/audiobooks-or-reading-to-our-brains-it-doesnt-matter)\n\n>If you don’t have time to sit and read a physical book, is listening to the audio version considered cheating? To some hardcore book nerds, it could be. But new evidence suggests that, to our brains, reading and hearing a story might not be so different.\n\n>…\n\n>It was a finding that surprised Fatma Deniz, a postdoctoral researcher at the Gallant Lab and lead author of the study. The subject’s brains were creating meaning from the words in the same way, regardless if they were listening or reading. In fact, the brain maps for both auditory and visual input they created from the data looked nearly identical.\n\nIt’s time to move past your personal biases.

      "text": "I finished *Snow Crash* last night and I'm honestly still reeling. The level of detail used to describe the internet, and the associated VR/AR technology used in the story, this work could have been written today and still been fully believable/technologically sound. Of course, it's still sci-fi and there's plenty of other technology which is not (or at least not yet) applicable to the modern world, but still.\n\nThe prose also holds up exceptionally well. Language evolves a lot over 30+ years, but the characters all speak in a way that still feels authentic today, and in my opinion the same can be said for the narrative bits. Usually the older works of sci-fi that I've read thus far which hold up the best on a modern level are those which take place in an intangible setting, *Dune* comes to mind. Published in the 60s, but due to its setting being an entirely different planet and also incorporating a level of magic/supernatural elements like the Bene Gesserit, it's less susceptible to becoming outdated than something taking place entirely on Earth with familiar elements. *Snow Crash* manages to accomplish that feat while taking place in a (reasonably) realistic Earth setting which doesn't necessarily rely on anything supernatural to establish long-lasting authenticity.\n\nIn addition to that, it's simply one of the funniest works of fiction I've ever read. I bought the book on a total whim with no frame of reference for it as a novel, nor Stephenson as a writer. The cover art just caught my eye on the shelf, but the part that cemented my desire to buy it came from the blurb on the back. I laughed out loud when I read that the main character's name was Hiro Protagonist, and committed to it then and there. I knew in that moment that I was either in for an incredible treat or a total disaster. I'm happy to report the end result was an incredible treat! Like the blurb on the back, I found myself laughing out loud throughout the entire book.\n\nIf you're looking for a witty, fun, hilarious, action-packed, and highly original (as far as I've read) standalone sci-fi work, I couldn't recommend *Snow Crash* enough. 4.75/5.00 as far as I'm concerned. I'd have liked a slightly more complete ending, but I understand that's pretty typical of Stephenson as a writer. I'm still quite content with imagining for myself where a few of the windows he technically left open could be sealed.",

      "text": "I know this constant discussion about separating the art from the artist has become something like flogging a dead horse, but I want to throw my two cents into it.\n\nI'm sure people have heard news about Neil Gaiman and the late Cormac McCarthy, and yes, it's completely unpleasant. I like the works of Gaiman and I like \"The Road\" by McCarthy, but is it even justified to stop reading them if they may have done something that's completely wrong? No.\n\nEven if they've done something that may, or may be, sketchy as all get out, I will still like the work they did, but not like the person they may actually be. If a person doesn't like a writer because of something they did and don't want to read their work, that's prerogative. If you don't like it, because of one reason or another, then don't read it!\n\nI think there are people who hold authors in way too high a standard, people who see them as being perfect in some way. But the problem is that people, especially if their writers, are never perfect to begin with, and when that particular writer does something wrong, people get angry, the illusion shattered.\n\nI don't hold such high standards, especially if they're unreasonably high, nor do I hold even remotely low ones. Look, I know Gaiman has been accused of horrible things and should be looked into, but that doesn't mean that his work is bad because of it. Author's (or any other artist for that matter) don't go out of their way to pouring their entire personality into their work. People always forget that art is subjective and not objective. If writing were based on objectivity alone, then that work would be boring as hell, or even worse.\n\nThe only time when a piece of art can't be separated from the artist, is when the artist him/herself is actively promoting sketchy and even dangerous stuff in their art. That would be the thing that would certainly turn me off completely.\n\nAnd don't get me started on psychoanalyzing an author's work, honestly I don't even know how (or much less understand) one can glean anything from that in order to justify why the work, especially if it's something particularly good, is bad, just because the author did something bad. And that's about it, just simply had to get this off my chest.",

I've been doing a lot of hunting at used book shops lately, but recently I ended up with a Barnes & Noble gift card and went browsing in there for the first time in a long time. What I discovered is that everything is about $20. Today I picked up a stack of seven used books for $17 total, which is less than it would have been to buy one of them new - not to mention the old copies always have much better cover art.

Cyrus is a drunk, an addict, and a poet, whose obsession with martyrs leads him to examine the mysteries of his past—toward an uncle who rode through Iranian battlefields dressed as the Angel of death to inspire and comfort the dying, and toward his mother, through a painting discovered in a Brooklyn art gallery that suggests she may not have been who or what she seemed.|/u/thnkurluckystars\n**1st Runner-Up**|*Annie Bot*|Sierra Greer|Annie Bot was created to be the perfect girlfriend for her human owner, Doug. Designed to satisfy his emotional and physical needs, she has dinner ready for him every night, wears the cute outfits he orders for her, and adjusts her libido to suit his moods. True, she’s not the greatest at keeping Doug’s place spotless, but she’s trying to please him. She’s trying hard. She’s learning, too. Doug says he loves that Annie’s artificial intelligence makes her seem more like a real woman, but the more human Annie becomes, the less perfectly she behaves. As Annie's relationship with Doug grows more intricate and difficult, she starts to wonder whether Doug truly desires what he says he does. In such an impossible paradox, what does Annie owe herself?|/u/ehchvee\n**2nd Runner-Up**|*The Husbands*|Holly Gramazio|When Lauren returns home to her flat in London late one night, she is greeted at the door by her husband, Michael.

As Lauren tries to puzzle out how she could be married to someone she can’t remember meeting, Michael goes to the attic to change a lightbulb and abruptly disappears. In his place, a new man emerges, and a new, slightly altered life re-forms around her. Realizing that her attic is creating an infinite supply of husbands, Lauren confronts the question: If swapping lives is as easy as changing a lightbulb, how do you know you’ve taken the right path?

Cyrus, the mercurial ruler of Tulan, has offered her his kingdom in a twisted exchange: one that would begin with their marriage and end with his murder. Cyrus’s dark reputation precedes him; all the world knows of his blood-soaked past. Killing him should be easy—and accepting his offer might be the only way to fulfill her destiny and save her people. But the more Alizeh learns of him, the more she questions whether the terrible stories about him are true. Ensnared by secrets, Cyrus has ached for Alizeh since she first appeared in his dreams many months ago. Now that he knows those visions were planted by the devil, he can hardly bear to look at her—much less endure her company. But despite their best efforts to despise each other, Alizeh and Cyrus are drawn together over and over with an all-consuming thirst that threatens to destroy them both. Meanwhile, Prince Kamran has arrived in Tulan, ready to exact revenge. . . .|/u/DagNabDragon\n**2nd Runner-Up**|*Compound Fracture*|Andrew Joseph White|On the night Miles Abernathy—sixteen-year-old socialist and proud West Virginian—comes out as trans to his parents, he sneaks off to a party, carrying evidence that may finally turn the tide of the blood feud plaguing Twist Creek: Photos that prove the county’s Sheriff Davies was responsible for the so-called “accident” that injured his dad, killed others, and crushed their grassroots efforts to unseat him. The feud began a hundred years ago when Miles’s great-great-grandfather, Saint Abernathy, incited a miners’ rebellion that ended with a public execution at the hands of law enforcement. Now, Miles becomes the feud’s latest victim as the sheriff’s son and his friends sniff out the evidence, follow him through the woods, and beat him nearly to death. In the hospital, the ghost of a soot-covered man hovers over Miles’s bedside while Sheriff Davies threatens Miles into silence. But when Miles accidentally kills one of the boys who hurt him, he learns of other folks in Twist Creek who want out from under the sheriff’s heel. To free their families from this cycle of cruelty, they’re willing to put everything on the line—is Miles?|/u/Clairvoyant_Coochie\n\n# [Best Romance of 2024](https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1he2dnm/best_romance_of_2024_voting_thread/)\n\nPlace|Title|Author|Description|Nominated\n-|-|-|-------|-\n**Winner**|*Funny Story*|Emily Henry|Daphne always loved the way her fiancé, Peter, told their story. How they met (on a blustery day), fell in love (over an errant hat), and moved back to his lakeside hometown to begin their life together. He really was good at telling it... right up until the moment he realized he was actually in love with his childhood best friend Petra. Which is how Daphne begins her new story: stranded in beautiful Waning Bay, Michigan, without friends or family but with a dream job as a children’s librarian (that barely pays the bills), and proposing to be roommates with the only person who could possibly understand her predicament: Petra’s ex, Miles Nowak. Scruffy and chaotic—with a penchant for taking solace in the sounds of heart break love ballads—Miles is exactly the opposite of practical, buttoned-up Daphne, whose coworkers know so little about her they have a running bet that she’s either FBI or in witness protection. The roommates mainly avoid one another, until one day, while drowning their sorrows, they form a tenuous friendship and a plan. If said plan also involves posting deliberately misleading photos of their summer adventures together, well, who could blame them?|/u/vanastalem\n**1st Runner-Up**|*Just for the Summer*|Abby Jimenez|Justin has a curse, and thanks to a Reddit thread, it's now all over the internet. Every woman he dates goes on to find their soul mate the second they break up. When a woman slides into his DMs with the same problem, they come up with a plan: They'll date each other and break up. Their curses will cancel each other’s out, and they’ll both go on to find the love of their lives. It’s a bonkers idea… and it just might work. Emma hadn't planned that her next assignment as a traveling nurse would be in Minnesota, but she and her best friend agree that dating Justin is too good of an opportunity to pass up, especially when they get to rent an adorable cottage on a private island on Lake Minnetonka. It's supposed to be a quick fling, just for the summer. But when Emma's toxic mother shows up and Justin has to assume guardianship of his three siblings, they're suddenly navigating a lot more than they expected–including catching real feelings for each other. What if this time Fate has actually brought the perfect pair together?|/u/No_Pen_6114\n**2nd Runner-Up**|*The Wedding People*|Alison Espach|It’s a beautiful day in Newport, Rhode Island, when Phoebe Stone arrives at the grand Cornwall Inn wearing a green dress and gold heels, not a bag in sight, alone. She's immediately mistaken by everyone in the lobby for one of the wedding people, but she’s actually the only guest at the Cornwall who isn’t here for the big event. Phoebe is here because she’s dreamed of coming for years—she hoped to shuck oysters and take sunset sails with her husband, only now she’s here without him, at rock bottom, and determined to have one last decadent splurge on herself. Meanwhile, the bride has accounted for every detail and every possible disaster the weekend might yield except for, well, Phoebe and Phoebe's plan—which makes it that much more surprising when the two women can’t stop confiding in each other.|/u/SweetAd5242\n\n# [Best Horror of 2024](https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1he2dnv/best_horror_of_2024_voting_thread/)\n\nPlace|Title|Author|Description|Nominated\n-|-|-|-------|-\n**Winner**|*Bury Your Gays*|Chuck Tingle|Misha is a jaded scriptwriter who has been working in Hollywood for years, and has just been nominated for his first Oscar.

Her mother, distraught. Her younger sister, hurt and confused. Her college freshman grades, failing. Her dreams, horrifying… yet enticing. In them, Ji-won walks through bloody rooms full of eyes. Succulent blue eyes. Salivatingly blue eyes. Eyes the same shape and shade as George’s, who is Umma’s obnoxious new boyfriend. George has already overstayed his welcome in her family’s claustrophobic apartment. He brags about his puffed-up consulting job, ogles Asian waitresses while dining out, and acts condescending toward Ji-won and her sister as if he deserves all of Umma’s fawning adoration.

Written at a dramatic moment in American and global life, this work from one of the country’s most important writers is about the urgent need to untangle ourselves from the destructive nationalist myths that shape our world—and our own souls—and embrace the liberating power of even the most difficult truths.|/u/marmeemarmee\n**1st Runner-Up**|*Challenger: A True Story of Heroism and Disaster on the Edge of Space*|Adam Higginbotham|On January 28, 1986, just seventy-three seconds into flight, the space shuttle Challenger broke apart over the Atlantic Ocean, killing all seven people on board. Millions of Americans witnessed the tragic deaths of a crew including New Hampshire schoolteacher Christa McAuliffe. Like 9/11 or JFK’s assassination, the Challenger disaster is a defining moment in 20th-century history—yet the details of what took place that day, and why, have largely been forgotten. Until now. Based on extensive archival records and meticulous, original reporting, Challenger follows a handful of central protagonists—including each of the seven members of the doomed crew—through the years leading up to the accident, a detailed account of the tragedy itself, and into the investigation that followed. It’s a tale of optimism and promise undermined by political cynicism and cost-cutting in the interests of burnishing national prestige; of hubris and heroism; and of an investigation driven by leakers and whistleblowers determined to bring the truth to light. Throughout, there are the ominous warning signs of a tragedy to come, recognized but then ignored, and ultimately kept from the public.|/u/caughtinfire\n**2nd Runner-Up**|*Nuclear War: A Scenario*|Annie Jacobsen|Every generation, a journalist has looked deep into the heart of the nuclear military establishment: the technologies, the safeguards, the plans, and the risks. These investigations are vital to how we understand the world we really live in—where one nuclear missile will beget one in return, and where the choreography of the world’s end requires massive decisions made on seconds’ notice with information that is only as good as the intelligence we have. Pulitzer Prize finalist Annie Jacobsen’s Nuclear War: A Scenario explores this ticking-clock scenario, based on dozens of exclusive new interviews with military and civilian experts who have built the weapons, have been privy to the response plans, and have been responsible for those decisions should they have needed to be made. Nuclear War: A Scenario examines the handful of minutes after a nuclear missile launch. It is essential reading, and unlike any other book in its depth and urgency.|/u/MartagonofAmazonLily\n\n# [Best Translated Novel of 2024](https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1herrwn/best_translated_novel_of_2024_voting_thread/)\n\nPlace|Title|Author|Translator|Description|Nominated\n-|-|-|-|------|-\n**Winner**|*The Empusium: A Health Resort Horror Story*|Olga Tokarczuk|Antonia Lloyd-Jones|In September 1913, Mieczysław, a student suffering from tuberculosis, arrives at Wilhelm Opitz's Guesthouse for Gentlemen, a health resort in Görbersdorf, what is now western Poland. Every day, its residents gather in the dining room to imbibe the hallucinogenic local liqueur, to obsess over money and status, and to discuss the great issues of the day: Will there be war? Monarchy or democracy? Do devils exist? Are women inherently inferior? Meanwhile, disturbing things are beginning to happen in the guesthouse and its surroundings. As stories of shocking events in the surrounding highlands reach the men, a sense of dread builds. Someone—or something—seems to be watching them and attempting to infiltrate their world.

Cortés was accompanied by his nine captains, his troops, and his two translators: Friar Aguilar, a taciturn, former slave, and Malinalli, a strategic, former princess. Greeted at a ceremonial welcome meal by the steely princess Atotoxli, sister and wife of Moctezuma, the Spanish nearly bungle their entrance to the city. As they await their meeting with Moctezuma – who is at a political, spiritual, and physical crossroads, and relies on hallucinogens to get himself through the day and in quest for any kind of answer from the gods – the Spanish are ensconced in the labyrinthine palace. Soon, one of Cortés’s captains, Jazmín Caldera, overwhelmed by the grandeur of the city, begins to question the ease with which they were welcomed into the city, and wonders at the risks of getting out alive, much less conquering the empire.|/u/AccordingRow8863\n**2nd Runner-Up**|*Welcome to the Hyunam-Dong Bookshop*|Hwang Bo-Reum|Shanna Tan|Yeongju is burned out.

      "text": "One of the more creative types of titles (in my opinion) is one that basically gives away the way the book will end, and the question that remains is how the book will get to that ending. It feels counterintuitive, because usually you try to avoid spoiling the ending of a book as much as possible, but it can create a different type of tension. If the title claims the book will end a certain way, but the story seems to go in an opposite directing, you get faced with the dread that everything will go wrong eventually. Or maybe the title is a bit vague; you know *something* will go wrong, but you don't know how, or when, or why.\n\nFor example, the book that prompted this post is called *Five Survive* by Holly Jackson. It's about six friends who are trapped in an RV while a sniper is waiting for them outside. Six friends, five survive. I think you can see where this is going. But even so, the story was full of unexpected twists and turns, and even until the very end it wasn't clear who was actually going to die. But the title stayed true to its word, and five survived. Despite knowing this 'spoiler', it was still one of the most nerve-wracking books I've read. The title actually elevated the tension, by upping the stakes; no matter what happened, you knew not everyone was making it out of the situation alive. \n\nAnother example is *They Both Die at the End* by Adam Silvera. Again, they both die, that's true, but what happens before that, and how they will die is still a complete mystery. The biggest difference with *Five Survive* is that in TBDatE the characters themselves also know this outcome, so they change their behavior based on that. But the story still manages to be surprising, even if both the characters and the readers know how it's going to end.\n\nAre there any other books like this, where the title basically gives away the ending? Do you think it's a good way to title a book, or does it give too much away?",

      "text": "I know that it's very soon after the Indian plane crash, but when I heard about it and that there was only one survivor, the first thing my mind jumped to was a book I read 40+ years ago called 'The Survivor' by James Herbert.\n\nIn the story, a plane crashes just after takeoff from Heathrow airport, crashing in the town of Windsor. There is one survivor. The story follows the survivor, Keller, as he seeks answers and justice for those who died on board. Of course there is a supernatural twist ( it's a James Herbert horror story after all) with a clairvoyant, multiple untimely deaths in the town and a twist at the end that took my breath away. I'm hoping that life doesn't imitate art in this case.\n\nThe synopsis:\nThe Survivor is James Herbert’s third book and was originally written in 1976.\n\nThe story revolves around a plane crash over Windsor and Eton. One eventful night, a 747 on its way to Washington crashes not long after take-off in a field in Windsor, killing all the passengers except one and is the worst of its kind in history, killing 300 people, except one, David Keller. Inexplicably, surviving the crash with no apparent harm except for the loss of his memory surrounding the events of the crash.\n\nHaving been forced to take an extended leave of absence, Keller feels a compulsion to investigate why the event occurred and what was the cause. In the midst of this he has an overarching sense that he needs to find what happened in order to get justice for the dead passengers and approaches a friend in the AIB, who are investigating the crash for any information, Keller sets out to try to solve the mystery of the plane crash.\n\nMeanwhile, around Windsor, unexplained and seemingly unrelated incidents are happening which are leading to the deaths in the surrounding town. It soon becomes apparent that something evil is happening and an unspeakable malevolence is haunting those who live near the crash site.\n\nWith the aid of Hobbs, a clairvoyant who approaches Keller, it soon becomes apparent that not only are there earthly forces at work in relation to the crash, but that the disaster has somehow loosed unearthly forces that are wreaking havoc in the town of Windsor.",

      "text": "This is a bit of a random rant. Something I see all the time, especially online, really irks me: people claiming they can write better than [insert popular author here]. It’s usually directed towards bestselling writers or someone whose book is trending, and the comments are always along the lines of—“I could write better than this in my sleep.”, etc\n\nHere’s the thing: no, you probably can’t. I’ve read writing on platforms like Wattpad, and even the best stuff is often… not great. Writing something readable isn’t that easy. Even experienced writers struggle to turn out something consistently good, let alone something worth publishing. And that’s not even getting into the editing, pacing, character development, and narrative arcs that make a book actually readable.\n\nAs someone who writes for fun, I get how you can write a chapter and think, “Wow, I could totally do this!” Writing a single chapter or an essay for some course you’re taking is easy. Now try writing 50 more, setting the right pace without dragging or rushing, ensuring the characters develop in a way that makes sense, avoiding repetitive scenes or dialogue, and tying all your plot threads together in a satisfying way. It’s a creative exercise I enjoy, but it’s also exhausting—and I don’t even publish my work! The arrogance of thinking you can casually outdo authors who have slogged through all of that to bring a full story to life is just wild to me.",

      "text": "Some of my favorite childhood reading experiences are from reading picture books. I'm talking about illustrated books with high production value, like amazing cover art, great design, and of course many beautiful pictures.\n\nAs an adult, it is quite rare that the books I read have good quality pictures. Most have no pictures at all. Apparently those things are childish and not needed for serious literature. And I'm not saying I want to read books that are two sentences per page followed by a huge drawing, but I do appreciate more illustrations.\n\nI once found in a library, many years ago, a book written by Charles Dickens (sadly it escapes me which) that right away took my breath away. It was not written in English but the drawings were fantastic. I so wished the book was in English or that I could buy it but I do remember that when I wanted to check it out again (after I borrowed it once or twice), the book had gone missing. Later it was recovered they told me but was badly damaged and no longer appeared on the shelves.\n\nToday, when someone was telling me that you can find spirituality even in books that may have nothing to do with spirituality and then mentioned Dickens, that memory suddenly came back to me. Perhaps you think I'm being sentimental and maybe that's part of it, but I still think it would be a good idea to produce more beautifully illustrated books for adults. And that includes classics and other serious fiction. Surely not pictures every other page (and really depends on the book itself) but combining art and literature can add value and make the reading experience more enjoyable.\n\nOr so I think.",

      "text": "Was recently re-reading a series I liked as a teen, the *Dwarves* series by Markus Heitz. They're generally strong, albeit not exceptionally notable in the high fantasy genre and really just a walk through the genre itself. One choice he makes is that he has a version of Dark Elves called Alfar. Even as a teen, this bothered me - Elf and Alf?\n\nThe main thing is that Alfs are pretty much the bizarro reverso-world version of elves. They're just drow but with angsty edge and almost no mystery to them. They paint with skin and blood and generally just seem like the *dark twisted fucked up version* a la Deviant Art trends.\n\nThe thing that broke me was the way they refer to time. It's not strange for fantasy races to not tell time in days/months/years and instead use, like... Moons, Summers, Cycles, what have you. The Alfs are so edgy that they tell time in *Divisions of Unendingness*.\n\nIt's *so* over the top that these mysterious, brutal, sadistic creatures end up in the same spooky category as a 14 year old goth with a Jeff the Killer shirt on. I stopped reading because of it as a teen, and I don't know that I'll continue my re-read once the Alfar are introduced. In fairness, Heitz is German - I don't know much about the author or the books beyond the books themselves, so some of the edge could be something that goes better in German than translated into English.\n\nWhat's your experience with this sort of thing?",

Adam Rowe's \"World's Beyond Time: Sci Fi Art of the 1970s\"!\n\nEssentially this is an art book covering not just only SF art, but also fantasy and even some horror. The book contains multiple sections covering multiple art stylings and also subject matter too, from weird abstract and otherworldly surrealism to cryptozoology and the paranormal. And to boot there are art works by various artists which even includes short bios about said artists.\n\nThis was a most spectacular art book that I've gotten through! The artwork that's included in this book is just phenomenal! And much of them were used in many pieces of media from books, magazines, games ect.\n\nThough some of the art does featured in it does go beyond the timeline stated in the book, but they are probably just a good too. The short bios are pretty interesting as well as the observations made about the various subject matters that these artists used in their work. This book was perfect eyecandy as well as being a light and interesting read too!",

      "text": "I’m knee deep in Russel Hoban’s Riddley Walker, set in an age where written language is forgotten and spoken language has mutated in its own way. As such, the whole of the book is written in this English which makes it hard to understand — but there’s more. It lends itself to wordplay and indulges the inner etymologist in you, often urging you read things out loud as opposed to reading the text internally. I include a sample here :\n\n>! Being the Big 2 they only done ther 4 shows a year regler plus special is now and then but they liket to look like ful time Eusa show men they kep ther faces shavit and all. Orfing the littl 1 he carrit the fit up and Goodparley the big 1 he carrit the weapons the same as regler Eusa show partners done even tho they cudve had the hevvys carry the fit up and the weapons and them as wel. Goodparley had a big face with littl eyes like lookouts looking over the top of a fents and he wer all ways smyling with his big sqware teef. Orfing had a face like a limpit.!<\n\nAlong with teaching you the language by context, Hoban intentionally doesn’t reveal the meaning of certain words until you need to know them. At first these caused frustration but when I did gain knowledge that was hidden so far, it was a beautiful quenching of the thirsting mind. \n\nAlong with this delightfully touching marvel of writing, one of my favourites Flowers for Algernon also uses this device - it is simply the protagonist’s tongue, and not that of the writer à la Finnegans Wake. \n\nWhat are your views? And do you know other such books?",

      "title": "Should publishers be held responsible for keeping eBooks a reasonable file size?",
      "text": "Weird question, I know. I'm thinking about it after a post I made on /r/BrandonSanderson about the file size of *Wind and Truth* and was utterly lambasted for it ([here's the thread](https://redd.it/1k7vhdz) if you're curious). This question mainly applies to Sanderson's books, though I'm sure there are other authors releasing large and unoptimized ebooks.\n\nI've been using an eReader since 2011, and my library is pretty large, over 1200 books at this point. And books are generally tiny. Literally half the books in my library are 1 MB in size or less. Probably 90% of them are under 10 MB, including many technical PDFs and image heavy books. But I'm noticing a trend in recent years of ebooks getting larger in size. And Sanderson (or I suppose Tor?) are the biggest culprit. His ebooks have gotten utterly bloated over the years. Look at his magnum opus, Stormlight Archive, as an example (Amazon versions):\n\n* The Way of Kings - 28.9 MB\n* Words of Radiance - 81 MB\n* Oathbringer - 161 MB\n* Rhythm of War - 153.5 MB\n* Wind and Truth - 341.3 MB\n\nEach book gets progressively larger, and not at all due to word count. I have the Kobo release of Wind and Truth and it's 318 MB. This is larger than any PDF book I own, and larger even than my Bloodstained digital art book, which is literally nothing *but* pictures. When looking in the files by extracting the EPUB, the bulk of the size is literally the grayscale chapter header images. They average around 1.7 to 1.8 MB each, and there are 167 of them, making for a total of 294 MB just for header images. I played around with them in GIMP and found just by converting them to grayscale, the file sizes are brought down to 700KB, less than half the original size, with no loss of fidelity, as the images are already grayscale anyway, but are formated as 24-bit sRGB GIF files.\n\nReading this book on a lower end eReader like a basic Kindle or an older Kobo can literally make the system sluggish. On my jailbroken Kindle Paperwhite Signature (2021) model, reading Wind and Truth as EPUB I even experience crashes as the device presumably ran out of RAM.\n\nThis seems insane to me. Many people still use eReaders that only have 8 GB of storage with only 512 MB or 1 GB RAM, and generally only 5 to 6 GB storage free with the OS. These five books alone would take up nearly 700 MB, 10 to 15% of that total storage, whereas several years ago that would be enough storage for potentially hundreds of books.\n\nGranted, Sanderson's books are probably an exception, but this trend of books getting larger this way without concern for device specs and storage seems concerning to me. Even Amazon's \"send to Kindle\" feature has file size limits smaller than most of these books (50 MB). \n\n----\n\nWhich brings me to the original question - do (or rather should) publishers have a responsibility to keep their ebook sizes to a certain range? Or is the assumption that eReader hardware manufacturers should (and, of course, do) release devices with more storage and higher end RAM and CPU specs? Where should the onus lie?\n\nObviously there's no \"correct\" answer, but I'm curious to read peoples' thoughts on this. I'm certainly in the camp that large book sizes of this nature (for novels, not technical manuals/books) are ridiculous, and for the prices charged, a minimum of optimization should be done, at least for images in larger books. But I wonder if I'm the odd one in thinking that.",

      "title": "Just finished The Warrior Prophet by R. Scott Bakker. This series is harming my soul.",
      "text": "Ok, so…\n\n\nA couple of months back, I was told by a person whose opinion on literature I highly respect that I should read The Second Apocalypse series by R. Scott Bakker.\n\n\nI haven’t really kept up with this whole “grimdark” thing. I looked at it as kind of a fad—cashing in on the success of darker epic fantasy masterpieces like A Song of Ice and Fire.\n\n\nI know that somewhere in that line of thinking, I’m likely wrong.\n\n\nI have no doubt that there are great and high-quality grimdark stories.\n\n\nMy favorite type of fantasy lives somewhere between classical fantasy, faerie stories, and modern epic fantasy.\n\n\nMy favorite authors in the fantasy genre are:\n\n\n•\tTolkien, because of course.\n\n\t\n\n•\tPatricia A. McKillip, who wrote the most immersive, cozy, emotional, and generous faerie story standalones.\n\t\n\n•\tTad Williams, the man who brought the genre into the modern world.\n\t\n\n•\tGuy Gavriel Kay, who writes these incredible standalone romantic epics set in his “World of Two Moons.” My all-time favorite.\n\n\n\nNone of these are considered overly dark. Darkness plays a role—but it’s not so suffocating that the story can’t breathe.\n\nR. Scott Bakker… has forever changed my perspective on what darkness truly is. What evil really looks like in art. And whether or not epic fantasy can serve as an incredibly potent and important philosophical thought experiment.\n\nI’m on Book 3 of his series now.\n\n**I have never encountered a more vicious and cold exploration of evil in my life.**\n\nI have never encountered such a thoughtful and grotesque depiction of the human soul.\n\nI will call nothing “dark” unless it is The Second Apocalypse series by R. Scott Bakker.\n\n…\n\nA review on Goodreads said it perfectly:\n\n*”That final sequence in The Warrior-Prophet—especially THAT scene… is one of the most viscerally horrifying and morally annihilating passages in all of modern fantasy. It marks a point of no return for the reader. Bakker shows us, unflinchingly, that this is not just a tale of power or philosophy, but one of absolute spiritual and existential horror.”*\n\nMorally annihilating. Yes. I do feel rather beheaded…\n\nIt didn’t begin this way, though.\n\nThrough most of the first book, I was wondering when all this darkness and evil I’d been hearing about was going to arrive.\n\nIt’s a slow, monstrous build.\n\nAnd Bakker takes you—very thoughtfully, very purposefully—into the face of things that, as he himself says, are “so universally troubling.”\n\nI have never heard a more horrifying warning in my life.\n\nOne has to remind themselves that a depiction of something is not an endorsement or approval of it. And R. Scott Bakker seems like a very sweet, kind-hearted, extremely chill guy.\n\nHe’s a trained philosopher, historian, and professor. And once you learn about his academic background, the explorations in his story make much more sense.\n\nHe’s tangling with profound questions, digging into his own vulnerabilities, and seeking truth.\n\nA philosopher’s job is to wrestle with difficult ideas. And his work is like a solar system of difficult and worrying facts about humanity, and difficult ideas; revolving around a black hole that leads into a universe where all those ideas were forcibly taken…\n\nInto the rotten core of evil.\n\n…\n\nThis book has cut a deep wound into my mind, and I’ve promised myself a break after I finish the third one.\n\nA break to watch some SpongeBob and some happy, funny stuff to cleanse my soul.\n\nWell done, Bakker. I truly respect and admire what you’ve created here. \n\n**It’s the most genius warning against evil I have ever found.**\n\n\n\n_____________\n\nPs,\n\n**A note of the writing style**\n\nI’ve seen many describe Bakker’s prose as academic, philosophical, beautiful, post graduate/doctorate… \n\nI don’t necessarily disagree with those descriptions, however I think I have a better way to explain his feel, and his prose.\n\nDon’t come into this expecting some sort of flowery prose with gorgeous words and lyrical flow. \n\nBakker’s writing is to literature what brutalism is to architecture. It’s bold, utilitarian, and not focused on being satisfying to the eye.\n\nBut effective, cinematic and leaves lots of room for the imagination to fill in the colors.",

      "text": "I never would’ve thought that a book published in the 1950s would mirror the society I’m living in today—thriving on short-form, diluted content to achieve instant gratification. Fahrenheit 451 encapsulated man’s descent to feeblemindedness— the disappearance of novelty and radicalism. Ray Bradbury’s manner of writing is so beautiful that every word and sentence feels like a work of art. Strangely, a recent video I watched by Hank Green, entitled “You’re Not Addicted to Content, You’re Starving for Information,” (a must watch!) touches on a major theme of the novel, proving that Bradbury was far ahead of his time. We now see the cycle repeating—celebrating the birth of technology at the start of the decade, then fighting against it due to our shortening attention spans and the rise of artificial intelligence replacing critical thinking and human creativity. I believe more people should read and reread this novel today, so we can spread its message and help break the cycle.\n\nHere are some of my fave quotes:\n\n*“How rarely did other people's faces take of you and throw back to you your own expression, your own innermost trembling thought?”*\n\n*“No, no, it's not books at all you're looking for! Take it where you can find it, in old phonograph records, old motion pictures, and in old friends; look for it in nature and look for it in yourself. Books were only one type of receptacle where we stored a lot of things we were afraid we might forget.”*\n\n*“Stuff your eyes with wonder,' he said, 'live as if you'd drop dead in ten seconds. See the world. It's more fantastic than any dream made or paid for in factories. Ask no guarantees, ask for no security, there never was such an animal.”*",

      "text": "I have just finished reading I am Legend by Richard Matheson. I thoroughly enjoyed the book but a fact I learnt only when reading the afterword changed the entire way I viewed the book, and made me think so much better of it.\n\nThe book is set in the 1970s, with the year and date being written alongside the chapter headings for multiple chapters of the book. It felt like a 70s book, reminding me of the writing of Stephen King, William Peter Blatty, and other contemporaneous horror writers.\n\nOnly in the afterword (by Stephen King) did I read that the book was actually published in 1954, with the book being set in what was the near future of the mid 70s. \n\nThe fact that this book came out 20 years earlier than I thought changed it from a good example of the genre, to a trailblazing progenitor of the genre. The book absolutely shot up in my estimations knowing how ahead of the curve it was.\n\nThe language felt modern and readable, not at all stilted and pulpy. The themes explored internal struggles of a man trying to survive on his own, a war veteran who (whilst sticking very close to traditional gender roles) had become emotionally wrecked and mentally unstable as he struggled with the world around him and the atrocities it made him commit. It talked about his vulnerability and the love he had for his wife and daughter, how he cared for them >!both before and after their deaths!<\n\nI have read a lot of sci-fi/fantasy/horror from the 50s-80s, and normally you can guess the decade from the first page, but this book surprised me. It was shocking to me how much my view of it changed upon learning when it was written.\n\nHas anyone else had something like this happen to them? Has learning a fact after reading a text has completely changed your view of it for the better or worse?",

      "text": "I was recently turned towards the work of Tom Robbins (RIP) through a few different sources and recommendation requests. Until this year I had never even heard of the guy (though I've read more books in 2025 alone than in probably the last 10 years of my life, so that's not surprising). I bought two of his books a while ago and have finally gotten around to cracking into my first one, *Even Cowgirls Get the Blues*.\n\nBefore I go any farther, I DID choose this book on purpose knowing that many consider it to be one of his weaker works. Obviously some people love it for any number of reasons, but the general consensus that I saw about it was that it's not a super popular one to gravitate towards in his body of work.\n\nI'm currently only about 90 pages into it, but I have simply never read another author who writes like this. I'm dazzled, annoyed, disgusted, inspired, embarrassed, tickled, and bamboozled all at once, sometimes all on the same page. It's crass enough to be considered really juvenile and perhaps even cringey, but it's eloquent and artful in the most paradoxical way I've ever come across.\n\nA perfect example of what I mean is the quote below (technically NSFW).\n\n>She maneuvered herself beneath it and guided its crabapple noggin through the seam in her being. Like a bullet of thick fish meat, it went to target.\n\nLike WHAT THE FUCK, but also subject matter aside, the words flow together so cohesively. It's like Nabakov with a 14 year old boy's sense of humor.\n\nOr this entire paragraph here towards the very beginning.\n\n>As for the oyster, its rectal temperature has never even been estimated, although we must suspect that the tissue heat of the sedentary bivalve is as far below good old 98.6 as that of the busy bee above. Nonetheless, the oyster, could it be fancy, should fancy its excremental equipment a hot item, for what other among Creation's crapping creatures can convert its bodily wastes into treasure?\n\nThis is one of the most ridiculous books I've ever read, and I say that endearingly. This man certainly had a very special and unique way with words, and this book fully embodies the utter absurdity that I was hoping for when the plot of the book was described to me.\n\nI can totally see how writing like this can not be everybody's cup of tea, I'm not even entirely sure it's mine. But it's certainly delivering on the promise that was made to me of it being a simply ludicrous story written in an artful way.\n\nUp next is *Jitterbug Perfume*.",

      "text": "I recently finished a book series (for anyone who is curious, it's the >!Pegasus series by Kate O'Hearn!<), and I thoroughly enjoyed it. Even though it's technically geared towards children (and I'm in graduate school), I loved the characters and the way the author combined the real world with Roman mythology. Now, the series consists of six books, and there were so many instances where I had to force myself to stop and get some sleep because I had been glued to the pages. In other words, **I was completely lost in the world the author had built**...and then, I get to the last couple of chapters in the final book. The second-to-last chapter *ends* with what easily *could* be the main character's death.\n\nNow, while I would have been sad if the main character had died, it would have honestly been preferable to the way the last chapter *starts* \\- with the main character's *waking up and finding herself in her apartment as if the entire series hadn't actually happened*! Her internal thoughts are *all about the dream she just had but couldn't quite remember*! I read that and was just TICKED OFF - thinking \"was this *entire* series **really just a dream the main character had**!?\" Granted, it is quickly revealed that the main character is only having this \"twist\" dream sequence because she is essentially in a kind of limbo between life and death. The chapter (and the series) ends with her *actually* waking up, seeing her closest friend (the one she made in the first book and **the one who kickstarted the adventures**), and feeling excited for any adventures to come.\n\nEven though this series ***thankfully*** didn't follow through with the \"it was all a dream\" twist, my reaction to the fact that it was **teased in the first place** made me realize *just how much I hate this kind of twist*. It just feels like a huge let-down after spending so much time with fun characters and an amazing world. Now, because the \"twist\" wasn't really a twist, I will not be surprised if I find myself reading this series again. However, if the series really had been a dream for the main character, I don't think I'd be able to pick up the series again.\n\nWhat about y'all? Whenever a series ends with \"it was all a dream\" (or something to that effect), how do y'all feel?",

A timeless classic that I am sure has its fair share of admirers but still feels underrated for the brilliance it contains inside.\n\nIt felt whimsical right from the start but was also all over the place; just when you least expect it, the plot starts making sense, and everything ties together beautifully before the journey ends. Definitely a book that calls for a re-read after a few months, and I am glad I found it. The story was evenly paced; I wouldn't call it a fast book, but it was so exciting that I kept flipping the pages. \n\nNext time I read it, I'll savour the little details where Haruki has mentioned different artists and authors, as I feel it is a great way to learn new things while reading a book. I would absolutely recommend this to everyone who appreciates a good, substantial read—just have some patience until things start making sense, and you are sure to be transported into a fantasy that Haruki weaves slowly but in an all-engulfing way.",

      "text": "*A Well Trained Wife* is a memoir about Leving's experience in the Quiverfull movement, a high control, Christian faith based \"birth cult\". Basically, God has dominion over the father, and the father has total dominion over his wife and kids. The goal is to outbirth the non-Christians. It's called Quiverfull because children are seen as arrows in your quiver, and if you're going into war, you want your quiver full. They are often referred to as \"fundies\" (short for Fundamental Christians). Not all fundies are Quiverfull, but all Quiverfull are fundies.\n\nI've always been kind of fascinated with the fundie lifestyle because on one hand, their ideology are offensive, but on the other hand, there is something kind of attractive about that frugal, off the grid, homesteading life. I've spent enough time on the snark boards and blogs to know that life was hell for these women, but reading a first hand account of the domestic abuse, the religious trauma, and watching a vibrant young woman quickly fade away, was heartbreaking.\n\nThere were two things that really stuck with me because it's relevant to what's going on in my country (US) right now. The first is the importance of easy access to information, education, art, and the humanities- anything that encourages thinking, anything that makes us feel human, anything that validates who we are as individuals. While Levings deeply loves being a mother, being reduced to nothing but a mother was causing her to disassociate from life.  One of the big catalysts for her escape was when she rediscovered her creative side and started to feel like a human again. The second is the importance in building a community. Her fundie church worked hard to keep people isolated. They discouraged women socializing with other women and encouraged her husband to move to the boonies to discourage his family from being too integrated into their local community. Her escape, both from her repressive ideology and her abusive marriage, would not have been possible without the community of women she found online. \n\nThis book left me feeling torn. On one hand, it's hopeful and inspiring. On the other hand, her story is basically The Handmaid's Tale with a healthy dose of 1984 mixed in, only it's real, it's happening right now in the US, and it's already started to spread beyond the fundie world.",

The characters were all pretty likable, and the world-building was intriguing. That said, the book did have a tendency to kick the protagonists while they were down, which was a bit rough.\n\nNow I'm about 80% through *Deadhouse Gates*, and honestly, I think I might stop reading the series. The whole book feels like it could be summed up with that Thomas Hobbes quote: *\"No arts; no letters; no society; and which is worst of all, continual fear, and danger of violent death; and the life of man, solitary, poor, nasty, brutish, and short.\"* Every character just seems to get beaten down again and again, and it's honestly depressing.\n\nI did a bit of Googling to see if things lighten up, but most of what I found were people who read the whole series saying it pretty much stays that way. The thing is, I *want* to like this series; it checks so many boxes for me. It's a massive series with long plot arcs, a compelling alternate world, and a unique magic system with its own strengths and weaknesses. But, damn, *Deadhouse Gates* has been such a gut punch. I keep telling myself it'll get a little better, and then it just gets worse.\n\nFor those who’ve read the series, what do you think? Does it ever feel less like a kick in the teeth, or is this just how it is the whole way through? I was coming to this after reading all the Stormlight archives and was hoping it would be another expansive fantasy world building arc, but I think I am going to start the gentlemen bastards series instead.",

      "text": "I finished A Storm of Swords last week and it may be one of the best books I've read in a long time (certainly the best fantasy book I've read since LOTR). The book encompasses so many major events it is insane. From the weddings to Jon Snow become the Lord Commander to Tyrion's escape. Imo though what makes this book special is how it balances out the fast paced action with excellent character development.\n\nJaime Lannister certainly has one of the best character arcs in all of fantasy. His chapters after loosing his hand are a work of art. The reader gets a constant glimpse of his inner turmoil, his guilt and his desire to be a better person. The steam room scene with Brienne, his dream where his family and friends forsake him leaving him for the darkness. I also loved the fact that no hero here is purely white be it Jon Snow or Melisandre who is ready to sacrifice people to save humanity a noble cause but at what cost.\n\nThere were also other moments like the two weddings and Lyasa's confession (which cleared up a lot about LittleFinger, man was a mystery to me till then.)\n\nThe book even has great action sequences with the Oberyn vs the mountain being the most memorable. \n\nI think this is one of those books which I will reread throughout my life. It's just unforgettable.",

      "text": "I just found a used [Bodley Head hardcover of Ulysses](https://www.rookebooks.com/media/catalog/product/cache/dcd34d9e47af3af0f76c64976752d855/8/3/838j_211_.jpg) in a bookstore. I already have a copy (different publication) though I never read it. The Bodley Head was so pretty that I figured it's worth it if it will help me read the book some day. I sat down and read 20 something pages and I then wondered, would I last those 20 odd pages if it were that other version I had? And my immediate instinctive answer was a hard no. It doesn't look bad by any means, but the Bodley Head just felt special and I had to get it. It made me want to read the book.\n\nI feel I'm in a minority here, but I feel like the way a book is designed by the publisher has really heavy effect on my reading experience. I don't just mean it affects whether I buy a book or not, it affects the reading experience itself. \n\nAlso, I am not speaking merely of the cover art. It matters whether it's a softcover or hardcover, the typeset, page length, formatting in general, interior design etc. Some books, as I'm sure many of you will agree, just feel good in one's hands. It really does make a difference for me, which is why I always go out of my way to find a decent looking edition of a book I'm looking for. In fact it affects me personal experience with a book so much that I have certain contempt for publications that butcher cover arts of otherwise great books. It doesn't even have to have any art at all! Sometimes a deep black hardcover beats artistic cover arts with ease. It just has to resonate with the book.\n\nI'm wondering if anyone else feels the same, and in general if there are studies on this? I guess there are but I couldn't find any. I will again say that I don't just mean whether it affects your decision to purchase a book or not, but your actual experience with the book, reading the book, etc.",

      "title": "My list of esoteric book recommendations",
      "text": "I wanted to discuss one of my favorite genres, which despite the subject matter, I believe should be more widely known. These are books that incorporate hidden knowledge, such as that found in gnosticism, kabbalah, alchemy, and conspiracy. Although a ton of media goes for a mysterious and spooky vibe, it’s a rare case in which an author really does their research. Those are the ones I'm talking about here. (For the record, I'm not a believer or practitioner, just a big nerd.)\n\nThere's 14 books here to represent the amount of generations between Abraham and King David, as well as the buckthorn tree in the system of gematria. Just kidding.\n\n# Fiction\n\n* **VALIS by Philip K Dick**\n\n*When a beam of pink light begins giving a schizophrenic man named Horselover Fat visions of an alternate Earth where the Roman Empire still reigns, he must decide whether he is crazy, or whether a godlike entity is showing him the true nature of the world.*\n\nIt's not as well known as PKD's other books, particularly Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep (the basis for the Bladerunner films) and The Man in the High Castle. But if there is a quintessential gnostic novel, this is it.\n\nIf you thought the synopsis sounded weird, wait until you find out it’s somehow entirely based on the author’s real life. (Horselover Fat is the literal meaning of Philip Dick.) Anyway, the first half of this novel is totally brilliant, with philosophy that’s somewhere between genuinely profound and delusional rambling. However, it goes off the rails in the second half and ditches the cool gnostic stuff and heightened absurdism for sci-fi nonsense (not that all sci-fi is nonsense, but this definitely is).\n\n* **Piranesi by Susanna Clarke**\n\n*Piranesi’s house is no ordinary building: its rooms are infinite, its corridors endless, its walls are lined with thousands upon thousands of statues, each one different from all the others. Within the labyrinth of halls an ocean is imprisoned; waves thunder up staircases, rooms are flooded in an instant. But Piranesi is not afraid; he understands the tides as he understands the pattern of the labyrinth itself. He lives to explore the house. There is one other person in the house—a man called The Other, who visits Piranesi twice a week and asks for help with research into A Great and Secret Knowledge. But as Piranesi explores, evidence emerges of another person and a terrible truth begins to unravel.*\n\nI really love this book, it’s just so beautiful and profound. It also incorporates the esoteric elements in really interesting ways, both literal (the Crowley-like character), and metaphorical (the entire setting). On top of being inspired by Borges’ Library of Babel, there’s influences from Plato’s world of forms, Jung’s theory of the collective unconscious, and esoteric worldviews like that of Blavatsky and Crowley.\n\n* **Foucault's Pendulum by Umberto Eco**\n\n*Bored with their work, three Milanese editors cook up \"the Plan,\" a hoax that connects the medieval Knights Templar with other occult groups from ancient to modern times. This produces a map indicating the geographical point from which all the powers of the earth can be controlled — a point located in Paris, France, at Foucault’s Pendulum. But in a fateful turn the joke becomes all too real, and when occult groups, including Satanists, get wind of the Plan, they go so far as to kill one of the editors in their quest to gain control of the earth.*\n\nI’ll be honest, I did not finish this book. It’s felt like someone infodumping about Crusades conspiracy theories. To me personally it got old fast. However, it’s very iconic so I felt I had to include it. Eco is definitely deeply familiar with the topics he covers: Kabbalah, alchemy, conspiracies, etc. His goal, however, is to satirize them and show their absurdity.\n\n* **The Crying of Lot 49 by Thomas Pynchon**\n\n*Oedipa Maas, a housewife, discovers that she has been made executrix of a former lover's estate. The performance of her duties sets her on a strange trail in which she uncovers a conspiracy theory about the postal system.*\n\nThis book is a bit different from the others on the list in that it’s not based in real esoterica. However, it feels like it could be— it’s intricate, weird, and full of hidden meanings. It goes on lots of tangents and makes you feel like you're uncovering the mystery along with the protagonist.\n\n* **The Course of the Heart by M. John Harrison**\n\n*One hot May night, three Cambridge students carry out a mysterious ritual. They will spend the rest of their lives haunted by it. In the mysterious post-war autobiography of travel writer Michael Ashman, they read, twenty years later, of a country called the Coeur - a place of ancient, visionary splendour that re-emerges periodically through the shifting borders of Europe at times of unrest. In the Coeur, everything is possible. There, they may find not only escape from their nightmares, but transcendence and redemption.*\n\nThis book is fantastic. I would best describe it as The Secret History if it wasn’t afraid to get genuinely weird. And if it had fleshed out characters. I think this book is really about how we try and rationalize our trauma by fitting it into a narrative that’s greater than ourselves. It’s very unsettling, weird, and deeply in conversation with esoteric tradition.\n\n* **Kraken by China Mieville**\n\n*When a giant squid specimen disappears from the London Museum of Natural History, unassuming scientist Billy Harrow is pulled into a hidden side of the city. There he encounters a squid-worshipping apocalypse cult, a magical crime ring, a talking tattoo, chaos nazis, and more. As he navigates this strange underground world, Billy begins to uncover the larger forces at play behind the squid’s disappearance.*\n\nThis isn’t the book Mieville is known for, but it’s incredible. The description might sound absurd, but the goal is to take these ridiculous concepts and play them straight, fully considering their implications. It’s incredibly creative and elaborate, with every chapter introducing new mind boggling concepts. (My favorite is the “Londonmancers” who tell the future by cutting into the entrails of the city through the sidewalk, reminiscent of ancient divination methods.) The underlying magic, although expressed in many different ways, is that of symbolism: if something makes sense in the narrative, it will work. Really clever stuff.\n\n* **Lote by Shola von Reinhold**\n\n*Mathilda’s obsession with 1920s glamour and Black modernist history deepens when she finds a photo of Hermia Druitt, a forgotten poet who once moved in elite artistic circles. Her search takes her to a strange residency in the European town of Dun, where Hermia once lived. There, Mathilda becomes entangled in a world of secrets, aesthetic societies, and forms of escapism—from champagne theft and art sabotage to arcane rituals and obscure philosophies—that begin to complicate her pursuit of truth, beauty, and belonging.*\n\nThis book is written with a really in-depth knowledge of niche bits of Modernist history and culture. It’s also got some really genius academic satire. It starts out great, but unfortunately I felt like it didn’t deliver on its premise and ended up falling flat. However, it has quite interesting commentary and some very fun bits. I'd recommend it to anyone looking for a book that challenges white male hegemony.\n\n* **Masters of Atlantis by Charles Portis**\n\n*Lamar Jimmerson is the leader of the Gnomon Society, the international fraternal order dedicated to preserving the arcane wisdom of the lost city of Atlantis. Stationed in France in 1917, Jimmerson comes across a little book crammed with Atlantean puzzles, Egyptian riddles, and extended alchemical metaphors. It's the Codex Pappus - the sacred Gnomon text. Soon he is basking in the lore of lost Atlantis, convinced that his mission on earth is to administer to and extend the ranks of the noble brotherhood.*\n\nAlthough this book is about esoteric knowledge, the joke is that there’s actually none to be found. Which makes it a great counterpoint to the other books here. However, I didn’t finish this: I found it a bit dull and predictable, and although often witty, it didn’t ever cross the line into actually funny. However, I do think it’s written with a deep understanding of how these esoteric societies play out in practice, making the Gnomon society feel like it could be a real organization. Maybe the issue is that real life occult organizations are so ridiculous already that they're hard to satirize. (See also: Occult America, later on this list)\n\n* **Death and the Compass by Jorge Luis Borges**\n\n*A detective attempts to solve a mysterious series of murders which seem to follow a kabbalistic pattern. He believes that the solution lies in the secret name of God.*\n\nBorges was fascinated by kabbalah, Judaism, and other religious traditions. In fact, he was accused of being secretly Jewish by fascists in 1934. His response was that he was not a Jew but he didn't mind being called one, as he had so much respect for the religion and culture. This is a great example of how it seeps into his writing. It’s a fantastic story and you can tell that he was very knowledgeable about the subject matter.\n\n# Nonfiction\n\nThese are all books that are fairly accessible and non-academic (although may be written by academics).\n\n* **The Gnostics by Jacques Lacarriere**\n\nI found this in a used book store for a couple of bucks and what a find! It wouldn’t be my top recommendation if you’re looking for a completely factual account. It mixes history with philosophy and in my opinion trusts primary sources a bit too much. However, it’s a fantastic read, and the writer makes history come to life with vivid descriptive language. I’m not sure I agree with his conclusion (that Gnosticism’s black and white worldview represents an ideal to strive for), but it’s definitely compellingly argued.\n\n* **Occult America by Mitch Horowitz**\n\nThis book covers a wide range of topics including Freemasonry, Spiritualism, hoodoo, Mormonism, etc. It’s a bit scatterbrained and some topics definitely don’t get enough time, but a great starting point. It was really interesting to learn how spirituality intersected with major historical events like WW2, emancipation, the industrial revolution, etc.\n\n* **Kabbalah by Harry Freedman**\n\nKabbalah is a very difficult topic to learn about if you’re a) secular and b) not an academic. I would consider this the best introduction. It’s very accessible and utterly fascinating. It covers Kabbalah from its very beginnings up until the modern day. One of the best bits is the bizarre kabbalistic tall tales. Like the kabbalistic master who escapes persecution by burying himself and his son in a cave for seven years, only coming out on the Sabbath.\n\n* **Brainwash by Dominic Streatfeild**\n\nThis book delves deep into the idea of mind control. It covers cults, the satanic panic, subliminal messaging, MKULTRA, and more. It’s all super fascinating and incredibly well researched, and I think relevant to this list because it gets at the foundations of belief and how it can be altered. It shows how the truth is often even weirder than conspiracy theories. TW: very dark, describes torture methods.\n\n* **Drawing Down the Moon by Margot Adler**\n\nThis is a great book that examines American neopaganism from a sociological perspective. It gets into the origins of Wicca in the 20th century and how it evolved, particularly due to second wave feminism. Based on extensive interviews, it shows how neopaganism is practiced in real life: the festivals, rituals, and communities that define it. It’s thorough but not dry by any means. It was written in 1979 but still holds up quite well. The author is a neopagan herself but takes a very honest and objective look.\n\n* **Bonus, not a book: Esoterica on Youtube**\n\nI feel obligated to mention this channel as it’s maybe the best source of occult information on the internet made for non-academics. Justin Sledge (yes that’s his real name) is an expert in the western esoteric tradition and the ancient near-eastern prophetic tradition, so that’s what he focuses on. He covers a very wide range of topics in addition to these.",

This book is also my entry into Russian Literature and there couldn't have been a better way to start this journey.\n\nThe Devil and his entourage arrive in Moscow and start wreaking havoc; the book also jumps to ancient Jerusalem in the first part of this book (which I thought was a bit chaotic) the second part shifts focus to one of the main characters of this book Margarita (the other of course being the master) who seeks justice for her master (who I learned is loosely based on the author)\n\nThe book blends fantasy, satire and also love(bittersweet) in a brilliant way. It's actually genius.\n\nMikhail finished this novel just before his death and the book was not published for like 40 years after his death(the author didn't publish it due to fear of prosecution) when a pirated copy was smuggled out of the Soviet Union.\n\nThe book is a deeply symbolic and a brilliant work which takes a brutal dig at Stalin's regime.\n\n\"Manuscripts don't burn\" this line is still echoes in my brain.\n\nOverall this is a book that I will keep revisiting throughout my lifetime. Some books make you think deeply even after finishing them and this is one of them.\n\nRating: 5/5",

      "title": "'Red Storm Rising' by Tom Clancy is an excellent military thriller and might be his best work",
      "text": "After reading a bunch of dense, complex literary classics, I've been looking for a major change of pace towards something easier and more \"fun\". I used to be a big Tom Clancy (RIP) fan back in my youth and had devoured most of the early Jack Ryan/John Clark books. He really started to fall off after Rainbow Six but I have fond memories of the late 80s/early 90s stuff. \n\nRed Storm Rising, however, is one of the major works that I had never gotten around to. Mostly because at the time when I was in my Clancy phase, I was really just interested in the Jack Ryan stuff. I recently came across a used copy of it at a thrift store and decided to give it a go. \n\nAnd man, I've really been sleeping on this one because after devouring it over the course of a week, I think this just might be Clancy's best work, along with Without Remorse. It is the best encapsulation of what Clancy really excels in, which is the rigorous, grounded technical detail of a \"what if\" military situation. Although on paper it's dated as it takes place in the 80s and deals with a conflict with the USSR, in practice it's still a thrilling read because of a) the aforementioned technical detail and comprehensive research on how such a scenario would play out from a logistical standpoint and b) due to recent events in which Russia is being a bit of a dick to its neighbouring countries.\n\nAlthough it's a chunky doorstopper, the book is paced really well, with some pretty amazing military action set pieces sprinkled throughout. These have always been Clancy's bread and butter, and they're probably at their best here. \n\nWith that being said - Clancy is still Clancy and his well-documented weaknesses are pretty evident here as well. The prose is functional at best and the characters aren't really anything to write home about - they mostly exist to move the plot along. Dialogue is perfunctory and workmanlike, and again, it mostly consists of people commenting on whatever military action is currently taking place or will take place. But really, I don't think anyone is reading Clancy expecting high art and any kind of profound literary merit.\n\nLuckily though this book was before he went full right-wing rah-rah Murica the Best in the late 90s so politically speaking it doesn't feel as gross. \n\nIf you take it for what it is though - an extremely well-thought out and exhaustively researched War World III scenario with great action and attention to detail - it's a damn good read.",

      "title": "BOOK REVIEW. The God Of Small Things by Arundhati Roy",
      "text": "The God Of Small Things is a novel written by Indian writer Arundhati Roy. It won the 1997 Booker prize. It is a work of domestic fiction and is centered around a family living in the town of a fictional town called Ayemenem in Kerela, India. The narrative follows a non linear structure as the chapters alternate between past and present.  \nNow i must say. The novel is really beautifully written. The prose is dense and descriptive but also very evocative and luscious, detailing every small things just like the theme of this novel which is that every small things contributes to history in a major way and a even a small incident can have lasting consequences in a person's life.  \nThe novel depicts issues that plague india like caste system, colonialism and love laws which dictates who should be loved and how much. It also very beautifully showcases how the children's world is different from adult's world and how the actions of adults impacts innocent children in the long run.  \nThe book is sharp, piercing and gorgeous. The prose is so so beautiful that even in the heartbreaking scenes i didn't know whether to be sad or just marvel at how beautifully it's written. Although Arundhati Roy often polarizes people with her views in india, there's is no doubt that she is a master of craft. This book that she has written is a piece of art and it clearly deserves all the praise that it receives. Just marvelous. I haven't read anything like this before.  \nThe phrase \"A banquet for all senses\" is a perfect compliment for this book because the writer evokes such gorgeous imagery of Ayemenem and the surrounding area that the reader will smell the fragrance of wet earth and will feel the heaviness of hot and humid weather.  \n  \nThe book perfectly captures the state of the country and the mentality of the citizens post colonialism with sharp precision and sometimes with a pinch of humour. Every line of this book serves a purpose and it is written so poetically that it gives every other book a run for it's money.  \n  \nQuite simply one of the best books i've ever read.",

      "title": "Why Outer Dark by Cormac McCarthy is a deeply unsettling work of fiction",
      "text": "This book is wild. Just reading the back cover, I knew I was in for something crazy, but *Outer Dark* surpassed even my wildest expectations.\n\n*Outer Dark* back cover:\n\n*\"A woman bears her brother's child, a boy; he leaves the baby in the woods and tells her he died of natural causes. Discovering her brother's lie, she sets forth alone to find her son. Both brother and sister wander separately through a countryside being scourged by three terrifying and elusive strangers, headlong toward an eerie, apocalyptic resolution.\"*\n\nThis is an extremely dark read, but I loved every word McCarthy wrote. It was fantastic.\n\nAs I mentioned in my review of All the Pretty Horses, Cormac McCarthy is probably my favourite author. *Outer Dark* continues to reinforce that belief.\n\nInterestingly, as I started reading *Outer Dark*, a Vanity Fair article surfaced claiming that Cormac McCarthy had a 16-year-old muse late in his life. While I haven’t been able to access the full article due to subscription barriers, the excerpts and discussions I’ve encountered paint the piece as overly stylized, almost as if the author is attempting to mimic McCarthy’s own prose. This stylistic choice, combined with the extraordinary claims made, makes the story feel exaggerated, if not dubious. I’m not dismissing the possibility that some of it might be true—if it is, it’s deeply troubling—but the lack of concrete evidence and the outlandish nature of certain allegations leave me skeptical. It’s also worth noting that McCarthy is no longer alive to respond or clarify these claims. While the article has sparked debates about separating art from the artist, I believe McCarthy’s literary contributions remain vital. His works deserve to be read and analyzed, even as we remain mindful of the complexities surrounding his personal life.\n\nNow, back to *Outer Dark*.\n\nThis is an amazing piece of fiction. From the very beginning, the book is relentlessly dark. Set in Appalachia, McCarthy creates an eerie, almost fantastical world that feels alive in its desolation. The brother and sister live in an isolated shack deep in the woods, and when they venture out on their separate journeys, they encounter a cast of vivid and unforgettable characters. Some of these figures are helpful, while others are downright malevolent. These secondary characters breathe so much life—and death—into the story, amplifying its intensity.\n\nThe first time Culla Holme, the brother, meets the three elusive strangers face-to-face, right after his ride on the ferry, is one of the creepiest scenes I’ve ever read. The way McCarthy describes the shadows moving in the clearing and the strangers’ unsettling mannerisms—how they move, stare, laugh, and speak—is masterful. The tension is almost unbearable.\n\nYou know they’ll return, and when they do, McCarthy doesn’t disappoint.\n\n*\"Well, I see ye didn't have no trouble findin us.*  \n*I wasn't huntin ye.*  \n*You got here all right for somebody bound elsewhere.*  \n*I wasn't bound nowheres. I just seen the fire.*  \n*I like to keep a good fire. A man never knows what all might chance along. Does he?*  \n*No.*  \n*No. Anything's liable to warsh up. From nowheres nowhere bound.*  \n*Where are you bound? Holme said.*  \n*I ain't, the man said. By nothin. He looked up at Holme. We ain't hard to find. Oncet you've found us.\"*\n\nThis scene is haunting, and when the strangers appear again—with the one-eyed baby and the tinker in the tree—the atmosphere is downright terrifying. I’m not sure if *Outer Dark* is officially considered a horror novel, but it’s probably the scariest book I’ve ever read.\n\nI’m not a big horror reader. People rave about Stephen King, but I haven’t been impressed. I’ve read *The Dead Zone* and *The Shining*, and neither really did it for me. I actually prefer Kubrick’s adaptation of *The Shining* because it improved on the source material in tone and execution. That said, I love Dan Simmons, I mostly know him as a science fiction author, however, I read Drood and loved it, though it wasn’t the horror elements that hooked me. If you have horror recommendations, I’d love to explore more.\n\nBut *Outer Dark*? It qualifies as horror in my book.\n\nReligious themes also run deep in this story, coming to the forefront in the latter half. One of the most memorable scenes is when Holme meets the hog drovers. After one of their brothers dies and Holme gets blamed, a preacher shows up, declaring his guilt without any knowledge of the situation. The absurdity of this preacher, casually pronouncing judgment, is both comical and thought-provoking—a sharp critique of blind religious authority.\n\nRinthy Holme, Culla’s sister, has her own strange and fascinating encounters, though none are as grotesque as her brother’s.\n\nThis was an incredible read. Any Cormac McCarthy fan needs to pick up *Outer Dark*. Being one of his earlier works, it’s not as widely discussed as some of his other novels, but it deserves to be. It’s right up there with the rest of his literature in my opinion. I wouldn’t necessarily recommend *Outer Dark* as a starting point for McCarthy newcomers, but for fans, it’s an absolute must-read.",

It seemed a bit, I dunno, gimmicky at first, and the technology was mostly found on YA romantasy stuff which may have led me to subconsciously avoid books with colored edges (I'm 37) but it seems that it is very much here to stay. Part of me is very 'meh' on them but then...another part of me remembers being in my 20s, working in a printshop and geeking out over a foil hotstamping machine 😅\n\nDo you guys like printed edges?

      "text": "I recently finished \"Stoner\" by John Edward Williams for my book club, which we all really enjoyed and had a lot to say about. One topic that we discussed a lot was whether Stoner is ultimately a figure to admire or a cautionary tale. Like most interesting questions in art I think the answer is nuanced and multifaceted; Stoner's stoicism is simultaneously awe-inspiring and infuriating. While the norms of his time meant getting divorced was much more difficult, both legally and socially, I was screaming for him to at least try to do *something*, but even after realizing how much better his life was without Edith in it he just kept on trucking through his comically awful marriage. Similarly, with his daughter Grace, I desperately wished he'd done more for her beyond a single, half-hearted attempt to get Edith to back down, and the way her life ends up going is one of the most heartbreaking parts of the book.\n\nI personally ultimately leaned more towards pitying him than admiring him, but I think by nature I'm just too ambitious and restless to be happy living a life like his, at least not without trying a bit harder than he did to change things for the better. Stoicism in the face of that which you truly cannot change is wise and correct; but not trying to change *anything* is simply passive and cowardly.\n\nWhat does everyone else think?",

Despite it containing material that I would generally be uncomfortable with reading, I was completely enraptured by the book and loved it. Beautiful characters, beautiful writing. \n\nI wanted to ask what people’s interpretation of the ending is? To me, the discussion of Connell “redeeming” Marianne meant that she no longer felt about herself as she had throughout most of the book; in the same way that Connell became better by virtue of his friendship with Marianne, she became better as well. She didn’t feel unworthy in the sense that she didn’t feel she needed to be degraded, physically hurt, etc…\n\nBut how is this rectified with her paranoid comments about Sadie? To me, asking him if she loved her, when so little had actually taken place between Sadie and Connell, meant she still was concerned about his love for her. Then she comments about how if he goes to NYC, he likely won’t come back. To me, that’s a fantasy totally unrelated to reality since it’s clear he has loved her deeply for so long.\n\nTLDR; how is Marianne’s improvement at the end rectified with her comments regarding Connell leaving and not coming back, falling in love with Sadie, etc…",

      "title": "I am on the seventh book of the Dog Man series and I actually think that the series has gotten better",
      "text": "Ever since I discovered this series and fandom, I've been obsessed. I love the story, the characters and the art style and it's so fun to see the content from creators online. \n\nWhen I first started reading the books, I noticed that there were many people who believe that as the series progressed, the story got worse. Especially after book 5. I was curious about it but so far, that doesn't apply to me. \n\nI'm gonna be honest with you: I actually like that after Lord of the Fleas, the series started to explore some more mature topics. I always enjoy when children's books bring up more serious themes without losing their initial spark. Yes, action, puns and fun are great and vital in children's stories but in my opinion, a good series needs more than that to sustain its core. \n\nI am 18 years old and yet these books had me laughing very hard and cry at the same time. I adore Petey's redemption arc, I really like how it has been handled so far and I cannot get enough of him, Lil'Petey and Dog Man (and 80-HD of course). It's very important to show that it is possible to change ourselves for the better and that we shouldn't let our past actions define us. This is a very important lesson and so far, it has been portrayed very well. Petey did not become good from one moment to another. He is still developing and learning to accept himself and he's still trying to adjust to the concept of love and care. He had been abused for so long by Grampa, so obviously his trauma still affects him. But the moments when Lil'Petey comforts him and tries to show him that the world can be a better place are so precious to me. \n\nI understand that many people disagree with the route the series went to after Book 5. I get it, the first books had this Dog Man VS Petey theme and it would be fun if the whole series was centered around their rivalry. After all, Petey was the one who was responsible for Dog Man's creations (and technically, the death of his owner). So we could have seen more of that. \n\nHowever, I think that had the series been the same thing over and over again, it wouldn't be that interesting. I will not lie to you, I love the first books but my interest peaked once Lil'Petey got introduced and started to chatter the walls around Petey's heart. Maybe it's because I didn't grow up reading these books to appreciate the more fun and childish aspects more, maybe it's because I love the found family trope, maybe it's because I am still new to the fandom...I still enjoy Dog Man's adventures and I like to see the variety of evil characters and how he can stop them with the help of his friends. \n\nAnother complaint that I get is that Dog Man has been sidelined in favour of Petey and Lil'Petey's relationship. However, I don't necessarily agree with this. He is still a very important character, he is still the best supa cop and he is still the heart of the series. He cares for Lil'Petey and it's because of his love that Lil'Petey is able to convince Petey that he can be good. I personally still love his antics, especially when it comes to Chief and he is my favourite cop. \n\nOpinions are subjective, therefore I do not claim that mine is objectively right. People are free to feel however they like. Personally, I adore this series and I really want to read the rest of the books. I will definitely check the Captain Underpants series once I'm done with Dog Man because I can't get enough of David !",

      "title": "Finished reading Left Hand of Darkness by Ursula Le Guin and here are my thoughts",
      "text": "I cannot believe I had skipped over Le Guin for so many years. I read some bad science fiction when I was younger, which put me off the genre. Now I am on the threshold of 30s, and have read the Dispossessed and now LHoD this year, and realise that I might not have enjoyed them as much had I read them as a teenager. \n\n---\n\nNow my thoughts-\n\nIn 2025, there is a general sense of hopelessness and a sense of the world order slowly decaying. One of the major themes in the book that struck me was the kindness that humans have, and their spirit of life. You can be completely naked and have nothing, but you always have hope, and you can always be kind to those around you. Most humans in the book are so hospitable to each other. They don't ask for monetary returns, and are happy to provide warm food and shelter to strangers at their doorstep, taking them in as a friend, despite some authority telling them that they should hate the person. This was a nice juxtaposition with the bleak climate and living conditions. This gives me hope about our real world, that even in the bleakest of conditions, humanity can still overcome great obstacles if they only work together.\n\nIt was a little difficult to get into the book because Le Guin drops us into this alien world where we are left to discover the world and its people alongside Genly. She just drops the history and lore and mythology, and politics about Genethians only when needed, and in my opinion, it works really well. \n\nRegarding the gender thing- I am queer myself, so of course it was great to see this from a book written over half a century ago. But I didn't think of the gender aspect that much really. I just took it as another quirk of the evolution of Genethians, just like with those on Anarres and Urras. I was much more invested in the journey for Ai, and the relationship between Estraven and him. And of course, the different political sides on the countries. I did wonder, though, how homosexuality would play into it. Maybe I missed it, but would 2 'males' or 'females' in kemmer still go at it, or whether the kemmer period only serve the purpose of reproduction? I also find Genly's confusion about gender so accurate. A lot of times well-meaning people still try to categorise trans people as their pre-transition selves. They dont realise that outside appearance doesn't matter that much, it's how you feel on the inside is what is important! Genly makes this observation too, he keeps thinking of Estraven as male, but when he(?) shows traditionally feminine traits, Genly gets confused and dismisses them as character weakness, rather than something intricately a part of Estraven. Only later in the book Genly accepts Estraven as a non-binary person, rather than a male with some femme characteristics. \n\nI also felt that Le Guin probably got inspiration from the Soviet Union and the DDR's Stasi for Orgoreyn, where there is some distribution of power but a high degree of mistrust among different branches. \n\nAnd finally, there's so much said about the male loneliness epidemic these days. I think a lot of men need to be taught how to make friends, and that romantic relationships are not the end-all and be-all. Too many men chase dating or romance, but neglect building their friendships, which are also super important! I think they should really read this book. \n\n---\n\nFinal thoughts- When I was reading it I kept thinking that I liked the Dispossessed better, because I related with Shevek a lot more than Genly (being a scientist myself). But a few days have passed since I finished LHoD, and I think now I might like it a touch more than Dispossessed. Both brilliant books of course. Both books will haunt me for a long time. I cannot believe I waited so long to read them, but I appreciate them so much more because of this. As soon as an artist puts out something in the world, the art ceases to belong to them. It starts being possessed by whoever lays eyes on them. How you appreciate art and writing depends so much more on your life and experiences, it doesn't only encompass the artist's emotions and experience. I might have missed a lot of perspectives, because I read the book based on my experiences. So I really want to hear new perspectives. And I love discussing books, so happy to engage in a discussion!",

      "text": "I recently finished Childhood's End and want to discuss an interpretation opposite of what I suspect the major themes are intended to be. Instead of themes around collectivism and evolution, I see it as a critique of biological determinism and a tragedy about the death of individualism.\n\n* The Overmind effectively commits g\\*nocide of societies under the guise of \"transcendence\"\n* The Overlords, despite their intelligence, can't transcend due to their biology, suggesting merit doesn't matter\n* Athens and Sparta are the last refuge of individualism, art, and humanity in a world of collective Utopia, but is portrayed as a much better place to live despite tragedy like the tsunami.\n* Jan, written as a black scientist in the 1950s, represents individual achievement being overridden by biological destiny\n* The Overlords' devil-like appearance and humanity's reaction highlights judging by appearance vs. merit\n\nThis makes me think Jan's ending becomes heroic rather than tragic - the last defender of human individuality. The Overlords are trapped servants (but are evil because they continue despite knowing the tragic outcome), and the Overmind is a cosmic horror consuming civilizations.\n\nI'm curious what you think, and how this interpretation may differ from the \"standard\" reading of the book.",

      "text": "Hi y'all, I just finished reading Memoirs of a Geisha by Arthur Golden and I just wanted to share some of my thoughts, hope that's ok!\n\nFirst of all, I really enjoyed this book. I thought it was a delightful read and I would recommend it to anyone 16 years or older who is interested in art, history, or beauty, 10/10. \n\n  \nI find it really interesting how Sayuri’s life could’ve been completely different. If, for example, Hatsumomo had become her older sister and not Mameha, she could have easily become just like her. Just as she molded Pumpkin into something she wasn’t, Hatsumomo may have molded Sayuri, too. In the end, I didn’t really like Pumpkin anymore. Hatsumomo made her mean and nasty, which is kind of sad to me. She and Sayuri grew up together, they were friends, and before the end, Sayuri tried to get Pumpkin to remember that. I don’t really want to blame Pumpkin, though; she had a hard life. With Hatsumomo’s cruelty, Sayuri replacing her as the Nitta Okiya’s adopted daughter, and then having to work as a prostitute for two years during the war? That’s enough to turn anyone a bit sour, I suppose. \n\nAnd it kind of makes me wonder, if Sayuri didn’t have those beautiful blue-gray eyes of hers, how different would her fate have been? Would the chairman have taken notice of her crying at the river and showed her kindness? Would Mameha and Mother or the countless men that she entertained have been so kind, or patient, or generous with our flawed character, without her stunning, one-of-a-kind gaze? \n\nAlso, I had a myriad of mixed emotions when I learned that the chairman had a wife. I mean, come on. You've been obsessing over this dude for over a decade, and he has a wife?! And children?! It just really took some of the wind out of the sails in the whole love story if I'm being honest. But I also found it hilarious and, in a way, perfectly fitting. At one point in the story, Mameha tells Sayuri that women become geisha not because they want to, but because they have no other option. I think this unexpected romantic twist really fits in perfectly with these themes of acceptance and managing expectations that we have going on here. \n\nAgain, I just loved this book. Please feel free to share any of your thoughts with me, as well as recommendations for similar books for my next read. Thank you!\n\nEDIT: I’m trying to share my thoughts on a piece of artwork that I enjoyed, & everyone is telling me it’s not real. Yes, Memoirs of a Geisha is a FICTION NOVEL.",

      "text": "I did not write any spoilers in my post.\n\nThis was an interesting read. I've been processing my thoughts and I felt like throwing them into the forums of the internet.\n\nI don't mind any of the historical events being portrayed in a magic fantasy novel. I've read a lot of people say that they thought it was done in poor taste. However, Kuang did successfully shine a flashlight on real tragedies. It got a lot of people talking about some atrocious historical events. \n\nTo be honest, I have always practiced death of the author whenever I experience media. I don't care if an author is an evil person. I've always separated the art from the artist completely. \n\nSo any criticisms that I have are regarding the quality of the novel. I do feel like there are valid criticisms. My main complaint is that the quality of her prose is not consistent. I would also say that there are a lot of segments that are poorly framed and paced. \n\nI find this pretty frustrating. It is hard to know that an author is capable of very dynamic prose, yet unable to consistently apply quality writing. \n\nI've read many novels by Ursula Le Guin and she is very consistent in the high quality of writing throughout each of her books. Le Guin also wrote her most well known fantasy series as a young adult book. Yet, it definitely does not come across as a YA book. Conversely, Kuang isn't writing a YA book here, but it reads like one.\n\nThe Poppy War comes across as often sophomoric and unpolished to me. That is to be expected from a debut novel. If Kuang continues to develop her craft I am definitely excited to see what she cooks up. \n\nSome of the scenes were so well done! There's this one scene where a man is hanging from a building as a crowd of bystanders helplessly watch. The scene really stuck with me. \n\nThere's a lot of little moments that convey perfectly what they are meant to. Pictures are painted vividly and I have been totally engrossed within them. Unfortunately, directly following these moments, there will be 10 pages of YA banter. \n\nI would give the book a 7.5/10. I'm glad to have read it, and I would recommend it to others. Far above average, but not mind-blowing. \n\nTo anyone that has read the full series: is it worth continuing? I'm currently leaning on not continuing. I am working on the Malazan book of the fallen series, this has been a relaxing detour!",

      "title": "King Lear: a first read",
      "text": "I just read King Lear for the first time, and I have some thoughts I wanted to share. To be blunt, I'm not as impressed by it as I expected or hoped to be. \n\nThe very name of Shakespeare sets up expectations, but this particular play has been regarded by many as his greatest work, including the great English poet, Shelley, who considered it the best work of drama, period. \n\nAnd obviously, there is much to admire. The poetry is sublime as always and the characterization is no less remarkable. Consider the number of characters in this one play who are all believable humans (with a little something to add later) as well as fresh and entertaining creations. And consider with what subtlety the nearly identical characters of Goneril and Regan are distinguished from each other.\n\n But, I have to say, I don't like the plot. Shakespeare was at his weakest when constructing a plot. He often borrowed ready made plots from older dramas or fairy tales and modified them to his liking, which is not a problem. Lots of great writers did similar things. \n\nThe problem is that these plots are full elements which reflect the poor conventions of their time. There's always a great deal of murder, madness, instant falling in and out of love, dying due to misery, dying due to joy (as is the case with Gloucester) and so much contrivance that you can't keep count of. Keeping in mind how our standards of realism and subtlety have risen thanks to novels, the plot is easily the most aged aspect of Shakespeare's plays. \n\nBut this is a problem with Shakespeare's art in general. It plagues Hamlet and Macbeth too, both of which I really love. The trouble with King Lear is that unlike those others, it doesn't stem from a single action. There are two narratives to begin with, and Shakespeare's difficulty is fusing them, Lear and his daughters, and Edmund. Since these two narratives are not intertwined (you could envision them concluding separately) Shakespeare has to connect them by contrivances, which often sabotage the integrity of the characters. \n\nConsider, for example, how the two older sisters both fall in love with Edmund. They have no motives for that, and because they're both extremely arrogant people, it's not convincing that they should fall in love with a bastard son with no claims, let alone fight over him. The play is filled with instances of such contrivances. \n\nThe very first act of the play, where Lear asks his daughters to tell him how much they love him, is very flat. The conflict arises out of Cordelia's not being able to flatter her father. We're never given a good reason for why this is the case. They must have all known that Lear had gone senile and impatient, and Cordelia should have understood the necessity of obliging her old father, as you would oblige a little baby. It's not dishonest, it's just lowering yourself to their level of understanding. Anyway, I've ranted for long enough. What do you think of all of this? \n\n(I'm new to Shakespeare and the stage in general, so be nice.)",

      "title": "The duality of Slaughterhouse-Five (Spoilers-ish) nearly broke me",
      "text": "Tl;dr - You can stop after the first two paragraphs of this post if you don't have interest in the actual passages which inspired this post and my expanded thoughts. Anything beyond the bolded sentence two paragraphs down is \"extra\" and just supplementary to my feelings below.\n\nI just finished my first ever read of *Slaughterhouse-Five* (and Vonnegut as a whole) last night and I just need to gush for a moment. I'm truly not sure I've ever come across another work of art of any media in my lifetime which has struck me personally as both so profoundly sad but also laugh-out-loud hilarious at the same time. The portrayal of PTSD (and likely some cocktail of other stress/trauma-induced complications as well) and dissociation experienced by Billy throughout his life is heartbreaking and gut-wrenching. But the content within his leaps through time, when viewed in isolation away from the lens of PTSD, is just... so... funny. To the point where I kind of feel bad about how hard I laughed at various points throughout the novel. I can tell this is the type of work which would get less funny with each subsequent reread, but I think it's important to capture the humor in its most raw form upon a first impression read as well.\n\nIt's also the first novel I've read in years which is so deliberate and efficient with its prose, dialog, and narration, that I feel like there is effectively zero wasted space throughout the entire text. This kind of efficiency would feel downright robotic if not for Vonnegut's ability to convey so much life and character in so few words. Which is an even more remarkable feat when considering the wild jumps through time and space that occur throughout every chapter and often every individual page. To be so chaotic and organized/put-together in the same novel is a feat of monumental proportions as far as I'm concerned. **I can't wait to dive further into Vonnegut's works, as I understand that many fans of his have several favorites which can be ranked even higher on their lists than** ***Slaughterhouse-Five***\\*\\*.\\*\\*\n\nFor the first time in a long time, I felt compelled to take notes as I read, writing down passages which left their mark on me for one reason or another. There's plenty more than what I highlight below, these were just some favorites.\n\n>So Billy uncorked it with his thumbs. It didn't make a pop. The champagne was dead. So it goes.\n\nThis was the first time (to my recollection) where \"So it goes,\" follows a reference to an inanimate object. And it was quite literally this exact passage that was my eureka moment with this novel. I laughed out loud as a switch flipped in my head that took it from \"interesting,\" to \"ohhhhhh I GET IT,\" and my zeal to keep reading positively skyrocketed.\n\n>Billy coughed when the door was opened, and when he coughed he shit thin gruel. This was in accordance with the Third Law of Motion according to Sir Isaac Newton. This law tells us that for every action there is a reaction which is equal and opposite in direction.\n\n>This can be useful in rocketry.\n\nBilly and his fellow POWs being transported to their various locations via train is obviously a deeply upsetting circumstance. And the fact that he's in such a state that he no longer has full control of his bowels is objectively horrifying. But the interjection of humor here which can be seen as a coping mechanism for dealing with that trauma is ***expert-level*** comedic timing and execution. Absolutely one of the most \"I feel bad for laughing, but I just can't help it,\" moments in the entire novel for me.\n\n>And then, just before nobody died, the heavens opened up, and there was thunder and lightning. The voice of God came crashing down. He told the people that he was adopting the bum as his son, giving him the full powers and privileges of the Son ofthe Creator of the Universe throughout all eternity. God said this:\n\n>From this moment on, he will punish horribly anybody who torments a bum who has no connections!\n\nThis moment hits particularly close to home for those who have gone through a bit of a \"lost faith\" crisis at any point in their lives, at least from a Christian or Catholic perspective. Grappling with the idea that sometimes you can be punished on a spiritual level simply for not knowing the right people at the right time feels cosmically unfair at times. But at the same time I believe this realization lays the framework for Billy's ability to resonate with the Tralfamadorian outlook towards life itself, and is able to rationalize a way to cope with his trauma (at least better than he was able to before).\n\n>Billy took his pecker out, there in the prison night, and peed and peed on the ground. Then he put it away, more or less, and contemplated a new problem: Where had he come from, and where should he go now?\n\nBilly is on the tail end of a morphine-induced stupor while being held as a POW. He's so out of it that by the time he accomplished the one thing he stepped outside to do, he had completely lost sense of where he was and what he should be doing, failing to even put away his manhood properly when he finished. Once again, a terribly sad reality of war and assessment of his current situation and mental state. But also once again, with just the smallest interjection of humor. \"Then he put it away, more or less,\" broke me, because I knew I'd never laugh if I were witnessing it happen in real time. But masterful language use cracks through the sadness with humor without detracting from it.\n\n>An American near Billy wailed that he had excreted everything but his brains. Moments later he said \"There they go, there they go.\" He meant his brains.\n\n>That was I. That was me. That was the author of this book.\n\nThis passage happens just two pages after the previous passage above, so the sentiment of the atrocities endured by POWs remains the same. But once again the comedic timing to tilt the balance of the tone to something that is this funny in isolation of its circumstances once again toys with my head. For Vonnegut to include himself in a cameo, all but literally shitting his brains out, is outrageously amusing.\n\n>Montana was under heavy sedation. Tralfamadorians wearing gas masks brought her in, put her on Billy's yellow lounge chair; withdrew through his airlock. The vast crowd outside was delighted. All attendance records for the zoo were broken. Everybody on the planet wanted to see the Earthlings mate.\n\n>Montana was naked, and so was Billy, of course. He had a tremendous wang, incidentally. You never know who'll get one.\n\nDrugged character carried in by aliens wearing gas masks, thrown into a human zoo to be put on display with expectations that they would perform sexual acts in front of the crowd, this is the stuff of nightmares. And yet, the sidestep to praise Billy's penis comes off like a direct author's note rather than an addition to the advancement of the plot itself. It doesn't feel mocking or objectifying, but whimsical and hilarious, while not coming across as out of place whatsoever. I also learned that \"wang\" has been a penis euphemism since at least 1969 when the book was published, which goes back farther than I realized.\n\n>Trout's leading robot looked like a human being, and could talk and dance and so on, and go out with grils. And nobody held it against him that he dropped jellied gasoline on people. But they found his halitosis unforgivable. But then he cleared that up, and he was welcomed to the human race.\n\nOof is all I can really say here, and all that I think is necessary. Point proven, Kurt. War crimes are bygones. Bad breath though? Unforgivable. (I believe Napalm wasn't formally considered a war crime until after the book's publication, but still.)\n\n>There had been French doors on the Cape Ann love nest of his honeymoon, still were, always would be.\n\nMitch? Is that you? This is one I didn't feel bad chuckling about. I'd love to be a fly on the wall in the room of a hypothetical Kurt and Mitch conversation.\n\nIf you made it this far, thank you for indulging my ramblings. I haven't felt this compelled to dive so deep into a book in many years.",

      "title": "Don DeLillo, Robert Putnam, and the Collapse of the American “We”",
      "text": "I read Underworld (1997) this summer, which is a sprawling 800 page book that tracks the second half of 1900s America very loosely narrated around a character, Nick, and his family during this time. DeLillo cuts back and forth between different time periods, and creates a strong contrast between Nick’s rough-and-tumble, communal, Italian-American upbringing in 1950s New York and Nick’s packaged, oversaturated, sterile life as a waste management director in the 1990s Phoenix suburbs.\n\nCoincidentally, at the same time I was reading Upswing (2020) by Robert Putnam. If you’ve taken a college Sociology class, you’d likely know Putnam as being famous for his research about the massive and universal decline of membership in American social organizations (think Rotary Club, Boy/Girl Scouts, unions, churches, etc) and decline in “social capital” from the 1960s until now. “Why is America becoming more lonely?” And “Why has America gone from a nation of ‘We’ to a nation of ‘I’” are two of Putnam’s biggest questions. His most famous work is Bowling Alone (2000) where he really blew this phenomenon open with a rigorously researched book. Upswing elaborates on Bowling Alone and is about the incredible rise and drastic decline of those social organizations over the entire 1900s and its near-complete coincidence with income equality, ‘I’ versus ‘we’, and political polarization (I can’t stress enough how crazy the exact alignment of these phenomena over 120 years are to me).\n\nI thought it was interesting that Don DeLillo felt in himself and was able to express something that would be proven conclusively just a few years later by Putnam. Because Underworld is very much about American connection (among other major themes, to be sure) and it captures this downward trajectory of national camaraderie in a way that feels very real to read, though I didn’t personally live through the whole period. \n\nIn a broad way, Don DeLillo wasn’t the only one who felt and expressed this decline. A lot of late 20th century, art seemed to notice the trajectory from “We” to “I,” but it actually tended to celebrate this trend as a long revolution against suffocating mid-century conformity. And on the flip side there’s also been lot of reactionary nostalgia for the mid century among people willing to ignore its glaring lack of social equality for women and minorities. But Underworld is the opposite of the former and seems too human and inclusive in its characters’ perspectives to be the latter, and so I would call Underworld somewhat uniquely perceptive. Is this a sound assessment, and can you think of other books that captured this phenomenon as well?\n\nI’d highly recommend both of these books, but only if you find the topic of post-1950s American social collapse something that really interests you (or baseball or mid-century NYC in the case of Underworld). Underworld is challenging in that it lacks a tight narrative and feels like a very looong and rambling read, but you’re rewarded especially in the last 100 pages, and the prose throughout is excellent. Upswing is challenging in that it’s academic, so even though I found this book absolutely fascinating, the writing is very data-driven and a tad dry and you should be prepared to look at a lot of line graphs. But you don’t need a background in social science to read it or anything.\n\nDoes anyone know either of these authors and have any thoughts on the topic? \n\nHave you read any other books that had something interesting to say about the collapse of community and rise of loneliness in America?",

      "text": "**Brilliant short stories from a master!**\r  \n\r  \nI recently decided to stretch my literary horizons by exploring the short story genre, so I began by looking up some lists of classics of the genre. The obvious candidates included well-known favourites from big names like Edgar Allan Poe, Guy de Maupassant, H.G. Wells, Oscar Wilde, O. Henry, Rudyard Kipling, Anton Chekhov, and more.   But there was one name I had not come across before, and I found myself delighted with the short stories I subsequently discovered.  That author is Hector Hugh Munro (1870-1916), who wrote under the pseudonym Saki.  \r  \n\r  \nSaki was a British writer who proved himself a master of the short story genre, and whose work is rightly compared favourably alongside O. Henry, another of my favourite short story authors.  He was in part inspired by writers like Oscar Wilde, Lewis Carroll, and Rudyard Kipling, and in turn influenced others such as P.G. Wodehouse.  Many reviewers make frequent comparisons between Saki, Wilde, and Wodehouse.\r  \n\r  \nTypical of Saki's short stories is a biting satire of the stuffy Edwardian emphasis on etiquette and appearances, which was often given priority above morality.  Animals and children frequently outwit adults, and are used to expose the Edwardian hypocrisy that lurked beneath the outward layers of respectability.  His vocabulary is expansive, and his writing is crisp and stylish.  \n\nMany of Saki's stories have comic elements, and returning buffoon characters like Reginald and Clovis are often used as tools to create points of humour, and to provide witty dialogue and mischief.  Some stories also feature an ironic twist at the end, reminiscent of O. Henry.  Saki accomplishes all this with a real economy of words, because it's rare for one of his stories to stretch beyond 2000 words, and most can easily be read in under 10 minutes.  \r  \n\r  \nSaki's short stories can easily be found online on a number of websites, so you don't need to buy a book to check out his work.  Of all the Saki stories I've read so far, these are my personal favourites that I highly recommend: Bertie's Christmas Eve, Clovis on Parental Responsibilities, Cousin Teresa, Esme, Laura, Mrs Packletide's Tiger, Sredni Vashtar, The Baker's Dozen, The Boar Pig, The Feast of Nemesis, The Feast of Nemesis, The Interlopers, The Lumber Room, The Mouse, The Open Window, The Reticence of Lady Anne, The Schartz-Metterklume Method, The Seven Cream Jugs, The Stalled Ox, The Unrest-Cure, The Way to the Dairy, and Tobermory.  Brilliant all round!",

      "text": "I recently read *Hyperion* by Dan Simmons, which was a book I thoroughly enjoyed. Unfortunately, the book ends on a cliffhanger that cuts the story off right before the moment that the whole plot has been building up to. So of course, I check the library for the second book, *Fall of Hyperion*, and there's 40 holds in line before me. I didn't want to wait a month to keep reading, so I just bought a copy of *Fall of Hyperion*. The clerk at the bookstore mentioned to me that I was buying the second book and should get the first one instead. I told her that I'd already read the first book and usually start new series by checking them out at the library.\n\nAfter saying that out loud, I found myself curious when the last time I bought a first book was and couldn't recall. I went through all the books I own, and realized my collection doesn't just have a lot of sequels where I don't own the first book, but that's literally all of them!\n\n\nI've always heard that in publishing the sequels make more money, but I never really made the connection between this and my purchase habits until right now. I've always thought one of the problems with art in the modern day is that publishers favor safe investments in sequels over taking risks on new ideas. Thankfully, novels are not nearly as bad about this as Hollywood is with film. Yet here I am, a guy who purportedly dislikes sequelitis, but I also only ever buy sequels.\n\n\nI always check the first book out from the library, and if there are a lot of holds I'm willing to just wait a few weeks. A new book may have interesting concepts or friend recommendations to catch my interest, but the reality is I'm not going to get invested in the story until I start reading. Then once I'm invested in the story, my willingness to wait is gone. My book collection is actually full of several series where I own all the books but the first one! It turns out I am the problem after all!\n\n\n\n\nMy thought process is exactly the same as the publishers', too - I don't want to risk spending my money on a book that I end up not liking. Once I've enjoyed the first book, I am confident I will enjoy the second. I feel much more motivated to continue a series than to start a new one.\n\n\nAnyway, in 2025 I want to buy some first books. I want to start on series that aren't finished yet, despite the fact that I usually avoid that. Newer authors who are just getting started need the financial support more than the well-established ones, and I am not supporting them. I always try to be mindful of my purchase habits, and I want the money I spend on books to help the authors who need it.",

      "text": "\\[Doremus\\] had once simple-heartedly hoped that in the mass strength of Communism there might be an escape from cynical dictatorship. But he saw now that he must remain alone, a “Liberal,” scorned by all the noisier prophets for refusing to be a willing cat for the busy monkeys of either side. But at worst, the Liberals, the Tolerant, might in the long run preserve some of the arts of civilization, no matter which brand of tyranny should finally dominate the world. - Sinclair Lewis\n\nThis resonated with me because it revealed one of the most actionable convictions that our main character held.\n\nThroughout the story, Doremus is plagued with inaction as the fascists slowly begin to take over his known world. One of his first acts before they are able to raid his home is to hide his stash of “seditious material” from the M.M. Despite eventually realizing that he must fight against the forces of dictatorship when they begin to threaten the people he cares about, this small act of rebellion held meaning because it was a preservation not only of history, but a critique against the current affairs of the state.\n\nSo long as we remember that we have the power of free-thinking, of words that are able to critique and deconstruct, of ideas that do not have to conform or be censored, we have a tool not only to convince ourselves, but others as well.\n\nOne of the characters that resonated the most with me was Effingham Swan. We read about him twice speaking with Doremus: The first time, when Swan sentences Doremus to probation, and the second time, when Swan sentences Doremus to prison.\n\nSwan’s demeanor between these two events changes dramatically. What once was a man who made room for euphemisms and expressed himself with graceful movements of the body as if he had been a well-versed actor on a theater stage gave the impression that he had enough good humor to realize that he was in a great position among terrible people; that this air of flattery was necessary to survive the ordeal of pushing over what he knew was the right thing to do, as an intellectual, just so that the Corpo’s could get their way.\n\nBy the second meeting, this man had transformed into a gruff shell of his former self; one that lacked the good-naturedness or the flashy bow he made when sentencing a woman to death. He is quick and vicious in his sentencing of Doremus; no pleasantries to speak of to pad out the time before getting “down to business.”\n\nI was given the impression that the dissonance, the poison one must feel to unjustly decide who lives and dies, requires one to suspend the belief about who they truly are. When the finally shield falls and we are laid bare, we have to bury ourselves in thorns to accept what we become.\n\nThis character, who was once distinct and memorable, turned into a prison warden that was just like any other. I feel this is reinforced with how unceremonious his death turns out; a necessary casualty, shot out of the sky by Mary in her freedom fight, who is a much nobler individual than Swan could ever be.\n\nOne of the repeating themes that stuck with me the most was the bastardization of the old, which was once understood and familiar, into something warped and foreign. \n\nStores and restaurants go from being a place to meet with friends into an environment where anybody could be a “stool pigeon,” waiting and listening to hear if anybody is unhappy with the regime so to then take them away. Universities and colleges go from teaching about the humanities and complex scientific fields into tech schools on how to pave roads and assemble aeroplanes. The uniform of the Union army of the Civil War, a flag that stood for the fight of freedom against as slavery, turned into an icon of tyranny masked as patriotism.\n\nI had better understood how demagogues can come to power: by exploiting negative sentiment in the community, by promising large gains to everybody with no feasible plan to actually accomplish, by trying to be the loudest, most appalling voice in the room. But I also learned about how small actions can hold tremendous impact.\n\nEveryone in the New Underground has a way to contribute in the fight against fascism; Julian as a spy in the M.M., Mary spreading critical pamphlets in magazines at the pharmacy, Doremus stealing printing material out of his office to create the pamphlets to begin with. Individually, each of their efforts seems small and inefficient, but together, they become more than the sum of their parts: a fighting force that can take effective action against injustice.\n\nThe relationship to have caught my fancy was that between Lorinda, the femme-fatale mistress of feminism, and Doremus, the romantic lover unfaithful to his loyal spouse. I think the politics of Sinclair Lewis are much more interesting than the chemistry of the relationship between the two old flames.\n\nFor early on, we are introduced to the idea that Doremus is happy with his wife Emma, but unsatisfied. He craves adventure in the push-and-pull he sees in Lorinda. There is a nostalgic element as well, for Lorinda reminisces how a summer with Doremus would have been an entire lifetime—the two hold history. Emma, on the other hand, is painted as discerning but boring; the best his wife has to offer is to gawk when Doremus presents a ridiculous story at suppertime.\n\nBut Doremus never has to confront his disloyalty to steadfast Emma, for Lorinda pulls away from him before the consequences knock at the door. Emma is never delivered justice because she never discovers Doremus’ forbidden flavor.\n\nThis dynamic in the story created an internal dissonance for me—the paradox that what we don’t know can’t hurt us. Throughout the story, the reader is witness to how the invisible force of fascism shapes the world. Much in the same vein, Lorinda was the hidden catalyst that activated Doremus to call out the regime—she rang the bell for Doremus' activism, with Philip's death being a direct consequence. There is no moment of reckoning for Doremus being persuaded by Lorinda’s support, and it leaves a bad taste in the mouth how Emma being treated as a draft animal holds no reconciliation.\n\nOne question that pierced me upon reflection was whether the author would be willing to take a life to protect someone he cared about. Would it be too radical to kill another, even if they stand for evil, or is that not in the cards for a man of Doremus’ demeanor, but more-so his gung-ho descendants?\n\nUpon reading the foreword and afterword, it became clear to me how the Sinclair Lewis deeply resonates with Doremus; Lewis’ enthusiasm to portray the Liberal journalist in theater only fuels this realization further. But Doremus never explicitly states he will spill blood to protect what he holds dear, nor is he ever placed on the spot where he must decide for or against.\n\nI think the answer rests in Sissy, Doremus’ much spritelier and more actionable counterpart. Through her decision to expose Shad for his side-job, where he denies his superiors skimming his profits, she sentences him to rot in a cell where he meets his end. She is aware of this as well, for she sees imparting death as a vile--although necessary--hand when push comes to shove. But would Doremus, gentleman that he is, be willing to stand and watch a man suffer, even if righteously—for does not leaving this responsibility to the young taint their spirit, the very threat we wish to deny of fascism?\n\nA critical detail of the story I’d gladly relive are the white-washed excerpts that appear in critical chapters of the story: Berzelius Windrip’s “Zero Hour.” This haunting piece of propaganda oozes with the pus that leaks from the horse’s mouth; the horror being that the document infects an accurate retelling of life under the regime.\n\nWhereas the narrative of Doremus is structured and fluid, the propaganda piece feels like delving into a piece of brain matter, rotting on the ground after the regime’s gestapo smears one’s brain with a bullet. The sludge is an inseparable mixture of incoherent ramblings built on a foundation of sand. The manifesto pinballs between a patriotic declaration of homegrown values, with a notable moment where Windrip’s rod is stroked concerning his bullishness. Whether anything is factual is irrelevant; the piece only exists to reinforce Windrip’s actions by appraising his character on a pedestal of mud.\n\nWhat’s more revealing Is reading how the manifesto didn’t emerge from Windrip, but rather his ghost-writer. This creates separation from what the manifesto represents and what “The Chief” actually believes, leaving him as less a leader but a frontman. The fact that Windrip finds himself on the sharp end of a blade before long shows how even the headpiece of an authoritarian state can be ejected. How any handshaking or pasted smiles are really smoke and mirrors to obscure a grab for state power.\n\nAlthough I had held a thread of empathy to Doremus, I saw more of myself in Julian Falck, for I had realized we walked along the same path. Julian, and by extension me, don’t hold the same liberties and privileges that allow a man like Doremus to distance himself from the influence of the regime.\n\nJulian is portrayed as an aspiring academic, fresh out of high school, graduating right before the regime can corrupt him through the institution. He is left unmoored from the future that is promised him: the jobs remaining in the regime are claimed by those with connections, and any further education is altered to the likings of a glorified handyman. Having been stripped of opportunity, Julian must look to his friends and relatives for guidance when the state fails the youth in favor of the rich.\n\nHaving to face this morally bankrupt reality, Julian is forced to swear loyalty to the state with his fingers crossed. He becomes a driver for a doctor—who examines enemies of the regime, turned runaways. He joins the M.M.—to leach information to the Fort Beulah N.U. And he makes a show leaving Sissy—to protect her if he is exposed. A child turned into a spy, not out of political belief, but the necessity to survive in a world that marginalized the youth into “toy soldiers.” Julian’s struggle reflects my resistance to avoid becoming a mouthpiece or a martyr for someone older, who had their time, but must now give the new-bloods a chance.\n\nIf the story was an idea, its flame would hold this spark of clarity: “The fires of evil burn hot, and they spread quickly. To dash through the fire is to blister oneself, to burn the flesh. To leave yourself bent from pain, and marked for others to see. But every step you take is one more grain of sand to smother the flame, so others don’t have to feel the same heat as you have.\"\n\nFor we are not good because we hold the biggest audiences, or because we gather the greatest privileges. We ascend above when we see our fellows mistreated, and choose to speak. We grow when the future is jeopardized for the many, but saved for the few. And we strengthen when we tie our threads, not pull them apart.\n\nAnd so long as someone—maybe not in flesh, but spirit—carries forth this whisper of truth, and so long as there are those willing to listen, evil falters. For to wage war against a learner and a teacher is to hold two fronts, nay attacks, on reality. And whatever zeitgeist against established and interrogated ideas emerges from a revolution-turned-regime-change always finds itself outnumbered when faced with this delicate truth.",

      "title": "On the ending of Poor Things!",
      "text": "Last year, after watching the film, I read *Poor Things!* by Alasdair Gray. I enjoyed the novel much more than its cinematic adaptation, for several reasons. In particular, I found the final scene of the movie—the one in which Bella’s ex-husband’s head is transplanted onto the body of a goat—to be a complete betrayal of the story's meaning and the protagonist’s journey of self-determination. Just seconds before the film ends, Bella shifts from being a mature, wise woman—shaped by an extraordinary journey of self-discovery and exploration of the world—to a sadistic scientist willing to humiliate another human being for the sake of cruel personal revenge. It struck me as an unjustified and inconsistent choice, clashing with everything that had been told up to that point.\n\nThe novel, on the other hand, develops Bella’s path in a much more coherent and satisfying way, also addressing themes such as exploitation and class inequality more explicitly. The fact that the film downplays or omits these themes is not, in itself, a flaw in my opinion: each medium has its own characteristics, and knowing what to keep and what to cut is essential when translating a work from one form to another.\n\nEverything would be perfect, if not for the ending: just at the close of the novel, the author includes a letter written by Bella (up to that point, the narration had been handled by her husband), in which she denies everything we have read. She was never brought back to life by a grotesque scientist mutilated by an even more deranged father; she never traveled the world unbound by Victorian moral codes; none of it ever happened. What we've read and become invested in is, in fact, the delusion of a mediocre, fragile man who couldn’t face reality and constructed a patriarchal fantasy to comfort himself. In this \"true\" version, Bella marries him out of pity, choosing him as a harmless partner who wouldn't cause her any trouble.\n\nThis final twist not only robs us of the Bella we've come to love—a woman who defies the narrow-minded norms of her time and wins her freedom, even gaining her husband's continued love and respect without compromising herself—but replaces her with a stranger we know nothing about. It also undermines the emotional impact of the entire story. If nothing was real, why should I still care about her? Was it really necessary to throw everything away just to drive home a feminist message that the novel had already conveyed, arguably more powerfully and effectively?\n\nIf anyone else has read the book, I’d love to hear their thoughts. A friend of mine found the ending very clever, and I watched a video today that essentially said the same thing, so maybe I’m the one who's missing the point.",

      "text": "Moments ago, I hesitantly hit the stop button and shelved the audio version of \"Sonny Boy\". I'm regretting it already. After all, it's Al Pacino who has been putting me to bed, rocking me into restless sleep with that familiar thundery voice and Bronx dialect, night after night. I must've listened to it four times in a row. Perhaps it's because he played the Devil quite splendidly once.\n\nI find myself fascinated by the way he pronounces words in general. His cadence has changed over the years, especially now that he is 85. Perhaps you have to love Pacino like I do to love his story. I gotta stop with this infatuation. It's unhealthy. Then he talks about having empathy for the sensitive people in this world and he pulls me back in. His sweet mother, a single mom, struggled and eventually overdosed, accidentally or with purpose. Her greatest joy was movies—and taking her only child to them constantly. I identify with that loneliness, yet with a dense richness inside, in awe of all things and people who dare be so alive and show it but you'll never get there.\n\nI'm obsessed with Pacino's films; not Scarface, rather Bobby Deerfield and Carlito's Way because they are beautiful touching love stories. I'm an unrealistic romantic. Not hopeless by any means, very hopeful rather. I want love to be what it is in songs and movies. The \"cheesecake scene\" in Carlito's Way is one of the most romantic things ever on screen, \"If you can't get in you don't get in\", lord have mercy, that's hot *af*! The fact that he almost got fired from The Godfather seems ludicrous now, given the remarkably restrained, thoughtful performance that helped birth a legend. I want to experience his \"The Indian Wants the Bronx\", back then before he was a movie star. He did Strindberg for goodness sakes and Shakespeare!\n\nThe ironic thing is, I have met both the actors most compared with Pacino: De Niro and Hoffman. I find them so totally different. De Niro is extremely quiet and shy. Hoffman aloof and funny. Al is intense and energetic. He recites Shakespeare inside my head: \"There's no creature loves me. When I die no soul shall pity me. Wherefore should they since that I myself find in myself no pity to myself?\" Then he refers to himself as an old wolf staring back at him in the mirror these days. Considering he made a baby at age 84, an old frisky wolf I'd say!\n\nThere's always been a mystery about Pacino, he's unpredictable, he's wild. In the book, he says he never really thought in terms of acting as a career when starting out. He describes the \"aha\" moment as \"a feeling of belonging and freedom\", hearing himself as a true actor for the first time.\n\nHis nostalgia for NYC and growing up in the Bronx is infectious, I can imagine how different it was back in the 50's and 60's. So raw and real, and f-ing rough, he was literally hungry everyday as a young artist. His love and appreciation for his mom and grandfather is touching. I still wish to know more, about his mom and how he became this complex intriguing person. Perhaps I'm stuck on vintage Pacino. It's just... men used to be more attractive when they didn't focus on it. The charisma- and yes so sue me -the quiet manliness, those eyes digging into your soul- on and on.\n\nBy writing this \"book review\" I have to let Al Pacino go, I fear he won't go quietly. If I could I'd ask him if \"The Humbling\" was life imitating art or the other way around. About melancholy. What it smelled like in the Bronx back then. How does he challenge himself these days. Will he be on stage again. Please be on stage again! \n\nSo long my best audio friend Al Pacino, good luck to me, when he's tired of reciting Shakespeare he starts with Oscar Wilde and I melt into the floor and the cycle starts all over again. \n\nAl Pacino:\n\n\"And all men kill the thing they love,\n\nBy all let this be heard,\n\nSome do it with a bitter look,\n\nSome with a flattering word,\n\nThe coward does it with a kiss,\n\nThe brave man with a sword.\" \n\nDo yourself a favor, read this book and go watch all the great films mentioned, plus \"Danny Collins\", \"The Insider\", \"The Panic in Needle Park\" (co-written by Joan Didion).",

Recent times have shown that some very talented people have actually been deeply dodgy as individuals. what then do you do with the work that they produced? Claire Dederer deserves some credit for tackling the issue.\n\nHer core case studies are no great surprise: (Roman Polanski and Woody Allen). Clearly picked because they fit the spec but are among Dederer's favourites if you took away their well documented abusive behaviour. The start of the book explores a lot of the debate from the perspective of the film media's flexible standards around them, particularly the general defense of Polanski.\n\nWhere the book fails is in trying to get to the 'so what?' I don't think she can actually get to a clear opinion other than being very divided about it: Love the art. Hate the person.\n\nThen she tries to equate her own experience of taking  time out to complete a peice of writing at the expense of family life. I am sorry, but needing to work away from home in order to do your job really doesn't make you a monster. Women and men in all walks of life have to do this and always have. It does make life hard on families but in no way is it on a par with abusers and rapists. It just doesn't. Nor does it shed any light on the central problem.\n\nIn terms of the book, the whole 'went away' story prevents Dederer from coming to a real conclusion.\n\nOverall: Brave to stand up and attempt it - but a swing and a miss in my view.",

      "title": "Deadeye Dick by Kurt Vonnegut - Double murder, drug addiction, and a neutron bomb",
      "text": "My 10th Vonnegut novel of the year was one that I found myself particularly excited about, because I knew utterly ***nothing*** about it prior to cracking it open. Vonnegut's reputation leads to a lot of his novels finding their way into discussion here and there, but *Deadeye Dick* kind of felt shrouded in mystery, or perhaps obscurity. So far this year I have read, all for the first time, in this order *Slaughterhouse-Five*, *The Sirens of Titan*, *Cat's Cradle*, *Player Piano*, *Mother Night*, *God Bless You, Mr. Rosewater*, *Breakfast of Champions*, *Slapstick*, *Jailbird*, and now *Deadeye Dick*.\n\n*Deadeye Dick* is the story of Rudy Waltz, the son of a failed artist father who was overly coddled by his wealthy parents (particularly his mother) which led to a hyper-inflated sense of self importance. Rudy's father was encouraged from a very young age to pursue being a painter, and he was shipped off to Austria where he applied for (and was denied entry to) a prestigious arts academy, whereupon he shared a rejection interview with a young Adolf Hitler after which the two became friends.\n\nAs you can imagine, this sets the scene for a rather ridiculous upbringing for Rudy. I think Vonnegut's portrayal of Rudy and his older brother Felix does a solid job of describing the realities and developments of two children raised by two parents who are far more invested in themselves/their own interests than anything to do with their children. The massive collection of guns which Rudy's father came to possess (and proudly train both of his children to use at very young ages) results in the unfortunate event which earns 12 year old Rudy the nickname \"Deadeye Dick,\" changing the entire family's lives forever.\n\nI really enjoyed the evolution of Rudy's life through trials of embarrassment, humiliation, isolation, and being forced to grow up at an age far earlier than any child deserves to. This feels like a story that, even though the specific circumstances experienced by Rudy and Felix are often hilariously (and depressingly) outlandish, many people can relate to. The experiences of having to parent your parents as a child, take on extra responsibilities around the house in lieu of any form of social life, and spending so much time doing those things while growing up that you don't really feel much in the way of your own direction in life until suddenly you're an adult, create a frustratingly relatable symphony of comical sadness.\n\nRudy recounts various key moments of his life in the form of a play, complete with intro narration and character roles. These are where some of the funnier lines throughout the story are present, and they read almost like a PTSD flashback or a dissociative episode.\n\nI feel like I could ramble on and on about this story for several more paragraphs, but I'll cap it there and simply say this was such a pleasant surprise for me. Up until this read, *Slapstick* was my pick for Vonnegut's most underrated novel. But after some reflection, I think *Deadeye Dick* has officially usurped that spot in my own personal rankings! I originally rated *Slapstick* a 9/10 as a knee-jerk first reaction, and while I still really enjoyed it, I think I'm downgrading it to an 8/10, with *Deadeye Dick* coming in at 8.5/10 just above it.\n\nOnce I finish the book I just started yesterday, I'll be moving onto Galapagos!",

      "text": "So this particular Koontz novel has been recommended to me several times and, so eventually I would get a copy of it. And now today I've finished it!\n\nIt is past midnight and Chyna Sheperd looks out through a moonlit window, unable to go to sleep during her first night at her friends Napa Valley home. Her instincts kick in when a socipathic killer named Edgler Vess enters the house with the intention of killing everyone inside.\n\nSelf proclaimed as a \"homicidal adventurer\" Vess's only desire is to satisfy every apetite that comes his way, immersing himself in sensation and live without any remorse, fear or any limits. And to live with intensity. And now Chyna is caught in his murderous web.\n\nToughened by years of struggle for safety and respect, Chyna is a survivor. And now she will be tested even further. Her initial aim was to get out of it alive, until a chance discovery of Vess's next victim and one only she can save. And now driven by this new thirst for meaning that goes way beyond self-preservation, she gathers every inner resource she has to save one endangered girl as the threat of Vess intensifies more.\n\nI've read at least a few of Koontz's novels that are intense, in their own way, and fast paced. But \"Intensity\" literally lives up to its title. It is intense and fast paced, but all raised up to 100% to the maximum. The story is like driving at 80 miles an hour and the front windshield is broken, with the wind coming in at full force, which is how I would describe it. It is just relentless, with very little slow moments.\n\nThis was also adapted into a mini series for TV, and the copy of the novel that I have has the promotional art for it. I haven't seen that one, so I don't really know what differences to the original story that may be in it.\n\nI really loved this book! Just so much going on with a lot of fast paced action and the usual suspense! So putting it up there with \"Watchers\" and \"Night Chills\"!",

      "text": "Hello friend, \n\nI hope this post finds you, through the new magic of the internet and elder magic of word of mouth, because I’ve been worried over the, hmmm, let’s say tone of recent messaging around your work-in-progress, and I wanted to give you some words of encouragement.   \n\nYou will not recall, but we’ve actually met before; briefly, at Greenwoods books in Edmonton Alberta, in 2005, on the Feast for Crows book tour. This was before the show, and the phenomenon, and the everything, but I do think it was starting to get away from you even then. \nYou will not recall that I had the first Q in the Q&A of the evening: *“Theon Greyjoy; dead or alive?”* I asked. And you answered: *“I’m not going to tell you that,”* to a room full of laughter, including my own.   \n\nLater at the signing, when my turn came, I told you — as I’m sure many have before me and since — that I had aspirations to be a writer and solicited from you any advice you might have to share. And so you shared — as I’m sure you have with many others — Robert Heinlein’s four rules of writing. \nI’ll paraphrase them as you told me that night:\n\n1. You must write\n2. You must finish what you write\n3. You must market what you write\n4. Never rewrite except by editorial decree\n\nIf you think I’m bringing this up to use against you, I assure you that I’m not. Though I have — throughout the years and decades— thought a lot about you, in particular, giving that advice to young writers. \nIt’s always hardest to take our own advice, isn’t it? \n\nIt is my sincerest hope that surrounding you are a group of friends and family who love and support you, and have told you everything I’m about to; that what truly matters in this life isn’t your work, but your happiness. ‘*Art is a support system for life’* Stephen King once said, *‘not the other way around’.*   \nIf your magnum opus has truly escaped you, then I would urge you to let it go. I say this as a long-time fan who fell in love with your world, and your characters, your words and your story. As much as I would love to hold in my hands the next book, or the one after that, if the price is your misery, this late in life, I could live without it. Honestly. And so to would anyone who lifts their awareness past the story we all love, and remembers that you are feeling person. What we have already is a gift of the imagination and I am truly grateful. If you could be happy, truly happy, with the work left undone, then I would beg you to leave it. It’s not worth it. Turn off the internet, ignore the haters, and live out your years with the people who know and love you best. Watch some football. \n\nHaving said all that, it’s possible that such happiness as I would have you enjoy would prove elusive even then. That’s my greatest concern for you, that there is no true peace outside of the sacred words ‘the end’ penned in triumph at the end of your labours.   \nAnd should that prove the case, then I would urge you to recall Mr Heinlein’s advice and get back to it. Forget about us, the fans and the anti-fans alike. Forget about contractual obligations and legacy. Do it for yourself and your own peace of mind. You are a genius, truly, and no one can do it but you. The idea for this Great Tale came to you alone, found in the snow like direwolf pups, and only you can see it to completion. I wish you more than luck, whichever path you choose. I wish you happiness. \n\nWith deepest gratitude and love,  \nJeremy.",

      "title": "Impressions of Anton Chekhov's short stories",
      "text": "Anton Chekhov (1860-1904) is a Russian writer best known for his plays and over 500 short stories. Many critics regard him as without peer as a short story writer, and consider these to be his defining legacy and a key influence on the development of the modern short story.  I personally enjoyed his comic stories, but not so much the others - but before I get to that, I'll give a short overview for those unfamiliar with Chekhov.  \n  \nMany of his stories are very short and yet powerful, while others are the length of novellas. They can be quite demanding on the reader, because in many instances not much interesting seems to happen. But that's because Chekhov focuses on character sketches, or on conveying wisdom about human emotions and relationships, or simply depicting the harsh conditions of his time. Quite a number of his stories are tragic and pessimistic, capturing the gloom and miserable poverty of late 19th century Russia, as well as the character and circumstances of ordinary people. Often there's a sense of existential meaninglessness and melancholy hopelessness. As a writer, Chekhov is often indifferent to his characters, not only making no moral judgment about them, but also not sympathetic to their misfortunes, but simply describing things as they are.  \n  \nIn response to the ambivalence of some of his narrators, and the difficulty some of his stories posed for interpretation, Chekhov insisted that his role as an artist was to ask questions, not to answer them. To quote the man himself: \"*In my opinion it is not the writer's job to solve such problems as God, pessimism, etc; his job is merely to record who, under what conditions, said or thought what about God or pessimism. The artist is not meant to be a judge of his characters and what they say; his only job is to be an impartial witness. Drawing conclusions is up to the jury, that is, the readers.*\" \n\nIt's not surprising that with this philosophy, Chekhov's stories often feel like impressionist vignettes, which simply present life as it is, and there's a focus on characters, relationships, emotions, and humanity rather than narrative and plot. While this can at times be frustrating for a reader like me, it's also one of the qualities about his writing that is widely praised.  \n  \nWhile I can appreciate their literary value, I found many of Chekhov's more serious stories rather dull and uninteresting. For me, his lighter and more comic stories proved to be the more interesting and enjoyable to read. These can sometimes become completely ridiculous and absurd in a hilarious and farcical way, which I loved.  \n  \nOf his more well known and loved stories that fit into this comic category, the ones I especially liked were:  \n\\- **\"A Defenceless Creature\"** (5 stars): A bank manager struggles to deal with a particularly determined old lady. While it's short, it's a brilliant and humorous character study of a woman who just doesn’t understand.  \n\\- **\"A Work of Art\"** (5 stars): When an awkwardly lewd sculpture is presented as a thank you gift, all the recipients are desperate to give it away to someone else. There's a marvelous twist at the end that really moves this short story from good to great.  \n\\- **\"The Romance of a Double Bass\"** (4 stars): A farcical story about two skinny dippers who both have their clothes stolen, and take refuge in the case of large double bass. The absurdity is hilarious!  \n\\- **\"The Orator\"** (4 stars): There's a hilarious result when a man giving speech at a funeral gives a eulogy for the wrong man.  \n\\- **\"A Chameleon\"** (3 stars): A policeman tries to find and punish the owner of a dog that has bitten a man. A story frequently given to schoolchildren to read, this is a satire that critiques corruption and how people’s attitudes change chameleon-like, depending on who they are dealing with: a high-ranking official or a nobody.  \n\\- **\"The Death of a Government Clerk\"** (3 stars): More of a quirky story, this tells the tale of a government clerk who is mortified after he accidentally sneezes on a general, and goes overboard trying to apologize. It's largely a character sketch, but I was left baffled by Chekhov felt the need to kill off our unfortunate protagonist at the end.  \n  \nWhile not quite as well known as the above, I enjoyed the following humorous stories just as much:  \n\\- **\"A Transgression\"** (4 stars): A cheating husband finds a newborn baby on his doorstep one day. Ashamed to tell his wife about his transgression, what should he do with the baby? I loved the twist at the end.  \n\\- **\"A Horsey Name\"** (3.5 stars): A general suffering from an unbearable toothache is obsessed with recalling the name of a man whose mere presence once cured ailments through laughter. But despite the efforts of everyone to jog his memory, all he can remember is that it was a \"horsey\" name.  \n\\- **\"A Country Cottage\"** (3.5 stars): Some blissful newlyweds arrive at a train station, where they get an unpleasant surprise.  \n\\- **\"Bridegroom and Dad\"** (3.5 stars): After everyone wrongly assumes that a young man wants to marry a very marriageable girl, including her father, the man himself in desperation comes with an absurd list of excuses why he can't marry, and he's even prepared to be declared certifiably insane. It's an amusing spoof, although behind the humour is an implied critique of marriage.  \n\\- **\"At a Summer Villa\"** (3.5 stars): A happily married man gets an anonymous love letter asking for a meeting with a secret admirer. He can't resist the invitation, but is in for an ironic surprise.  \n\\- **\"From the Diary of a Violent Tempered Man\"** (3 stars): A pompous man is only concerned with his own opinions and his academic work, but he meets his match in a determined young woman who keeps interrupting him, and finds himself unintentionally engaged to her.  \n  \nWhile I tended not to enjoy Chekhov's more literary stories nearly as much as the above, there were a few I did enjoy, namely:  \n\\- **\"Rothschild’s Fiddle\"** (4 stars): This story focuses on the regret of an old man bereaved of his wife of more than 50 years, to whom he showed no affect. But before he dies there's a final redemptive act to a man he's previously despised.  \n\\- **\"Sleepy\"** (4 stars): A somewhat morbid, yet powerful and gripping story of a sleepy servant who is so worn out with exhaustion, she ends up strangling the baby she is supposed to care for.  \n\\- **\"A Joke\"** (3.5 stars): A surprisingly powerful story about a man who whispers \"I love you\" while tobogganing down a hill with a girl, and the impact this has on her as she wonders if it is him or the wind. But I'm mystified why at the end it turns out he did this as a joke.  \n\\- **\"The Lottery Ticket\"** (3.5 stars): A husband’s imagination goes wild at the prospect of his wife winning the lottery. When their first numbers match the winning number, thoughts of hope and hatred are exposed.  \n  \nThe rest that I read were selected from his best stories, but just weren't as enjoyable for me personally, although I respect the literary contribution they make. These include:  \n\\- **\"Kashtanka\"**: The dog Kashtanka is separated from her drunk and abusive owner and gets a new lease of life. Despite a new and better life with a new owner who has her performing with other animals at a circus, she returns to her old master at the first opportunity.  \n\\- **\"Misery\"**: A cab driver looks unsuccessfully for someone to sympathise with him after the death of his son.  \n\\- **\"Oh, The Public\"**: An overly diligent ticket collector on a train keeps waking up an invalid, and after making things worse he's driven to drink.  \n\\- **\"The Bet\"**: A young lawyer bets an older banker he can last in solitary confinement for fifteen years. There is a spiritual redemption, but I was hoping for bigger payoff.  \n\\- **\"The Darling\"**: This is largely a sketch of the complex character of a woman who can't bear being alone and always latches onto the first man that comforts her.  \n\\- **\"The House with the Mezzanine\"**: An idle painter meets a widow with two very different sisters, and falls in love with one of them.  \n\\- **\"The Kiss\"**: A shy officer is transformed after getting a surprising kiss from an unknown woman in a dark room, but the impact is brief and final outcome is tragic.  \n\\- **\"The Lady with the Dog\"**: A bored middle-aged adulterer picks up a young married woman and both return to their families but keep yearning for each other. Regarded by many as Chekhov's best story, I didn't care for the fact that it makes you sympathetic to an adulterer, and that there's no real resolution or moral perspective.  \n\\- **\"The Student\"**: A gloomy theological student besides a fire tells two peasant widows about Peter's denial of Jesus, and is himself transformed.  \n\\- \"**Vanka\"**: An orphaned boy writes to his grandfather to take him away from his abusive life as a servant, and the tragic ending of a letter addressed \"to grandpa's village\" has become proverbial in Russia to refer to a fruitless effort to contact someone.  \n  \nChekhov's \"Little Trilogy\" is especially regarded highly, and features three interconnected stories:  \n\\- **\"The Man in the Case\"**: A memorable character is always worried about consequences and is afraid of risks and the unknown, and so is afraid to get married despite finding a willing woman.  \n\\- **\"Gooseberries\"**: A man finally achieves his dream of having a wealthy estate where can eat gooseberries to his heart’s content, but his self-centered pursuit of money proves to come at the cost of everything else.  \n\\- **\"About Love\"**: A man describes his secret love for a woman married to a boring man, and but they never speak of their feelings until it’s too late.  \n  \nMany of Chekhov's most highly regarded stories are the length of novellas, and include \"**Ward No 6**\", \"**The Peasants**\", \"**In The Ravine**\", \"**A Dreary Story**\", and \"**The Black Monk**\". I sampled parts of these, but they're typical of Chekhov's literary style and work, frequently with pessimistic and tragic themes, presented by ambivalent narrators. These stories are simply not my cup of tea, since I much preferred his lighter and more comic work.",

(Like so many anxious summer campers in the strips.) He links this image to Schulz's love for the movie *Citizen Kane*: \"Like Welles's hero, Charles Foster Kane, who 'got everything he wanted, and then lost it,' Charles Monroe Schulz would succeed on a scale beyond the grandest of his childhood dreams, and yet he would struggle to love and be loved.\"\n\nI can understand wanting some explanatory metaphor, but Michaelis may be making more of a mystery than there really was. Schulz was a genius growing up in a family that didn't value learning or art, and in a milieu that put a premium on self-effacement. Are his resentments and contradictions so hard to understand? Paying more attention to the comic strips as art would, I felt, have yielded more interest than mining the strips for biography (which Michaelis reproduces generously within the text as comment and illustration). He does briefly discuss topics like Schulz's use of line and his lettering, and has some experience with artists; his previous book was on N.C. Wyeth. But I felt Michaelis ignores the alchemical transformation that happens along the way from life to art. Sometimes Michaelis' discussion seems anti-alchemical, changing gold into dross: complex characters get mapped one-to-one onto real-life figures, draining Schulz's artistic achievement. \n\nStill, *Schulz and Peanuts* is very useful in explaining the origins and development of the strip. For example, we see Schulz as a kid, organizing sports and becoming team manager even while he felt like an outsider, so much like Charlie Brown. It's fascinating later on to see Schulz learning his trade by correspondence course, then becoming an instructor at the same institution. It's also interesting to follow the speed of his success and the various stages of his career.\n\nMichaelis is also good at explaining Schulz's enormous influence. So often during my childhood, I'd take down one of the *Peanuts* collections from the shelf. We had others, including *Pogo*, *B.C.*, and later, *Doonesbury*, but the *Peanuts* books were the ones I read over and over. For me as for so many other readers, the characters and situations felt as familiar to me as my own family. As a socially awkward kid, of course I felt a kinship with Charlie Brown; Lucy's crabbiness amused me; I felt another kind of kinship with serious Linus; and everyone loves Snoopy.\n\nEvery newspaper, in all the places I ended up living, gave *Peanuts* pride of place as the first strip. Schulz's characters, the Great Pumpkin, the undressing line drive, the football, *You're a Good Man, Charlie Brown*, the Christmas *Peanuts* specials, my Snoopy lunch box—*Peanuts* was part of the air we all breathed.\n\nFor that reason, it's easy to forget how ground-breaking and influential the strip was. We're used now to many of the conventions Schulz introduced, especially the idea of minimalism both in drawing and gags. Michaelis explains that early strips like *Pogo* and *L'il Abner* relied on \"business,\" full of characters and activity. *Peanuts* was different:\n\n>*Peanuts*, full of empty spaces, didn't depend on action or a particular context to attract the reader; it was about people working out the interior problems of their daily lives without ever actually solving them. The absence of a solution was the center of the story, and, as Schulz insisted at the time, \"ninety percent of the humor is in the drawing.\"\n\nAlso new was presenting children as far more intensely real than grownups, who never appear. Using children allowed Schulz to say things he couldn't have said otherwise, to explore sorrow and depression and existential angst. We forget, too, that *Peanuts* back in the 50s seemed subversive:\n\n>\"Nobody was saying this stuff,\" reflected \\[cartoonist Jules\\] Feiffer. \"You didn't find it in *The New Yorker*. You found it in cellar clubs, and, on occasion, in the pages of the *Village Voice*. But not many other places. And then, with *Peanuts*, there it was on the comics page, and it was the truth.\"\n\nAt first, *Peanuts* was considered a strip for adults; that's hard to remember now. I appreciated Michaelis's giving us so much early context for this strip. \n\nIt would have been great if the illustrations had reproduced other strips besides *Peanuts* to point up the contrast, and there were many occasions when I wished for an illustration of a cartoon being discussed, but I suppose that would have been prohibitively expensive.\n\nOriginally, Michaelis wanted two volumes: the age of *Peanuts*, up to 1973, followed by the age of Snoopy. The book betrays this original plan, I think, in that it's extremely detailed up until the last 25 years of Schulz's life, which go by in a flash. I thought way too much time was taken up by nailing down mundane details of the early life (exact street addresses, the dimension in feet of a chapel never again mentioned), while the scantiest attention is paid to Schulz's children, who barely appear.\n\nHere I should note that Schulz's son Monte repudiates this biography, saying among other criticisms that Michaelis wrongly portrayed Schulz as primarily cold and distant. Here also, and making allowances for Monte's hurt feelings, I feel Michaelis is overlooking Schulz the artist to a degree, and misreading the remoteness of someone in an imaginative world. \n\nDespite the book's 600+ pages, not long after reading it, Schulz fades in my imagination beside the vigor and energy of his work. Certainly Schulz doesn't always come across as an attractive figure in this book, being mopey and self-involved, but his friends and family seem to have loved him anyway. However you assess the man, I'm sure Schulz would agree that the strips contain the best of him.",

Things here are also taking a much weirder turn this time around. I actually get to see just a little bit more of the world Quiddity and also of its inhabitants that I only ever got hints of.

Of course the weirdness is still there, and weirdness is what I'm very much here for!\n\nThe Art trilogy, or what much there is of it, as it hasn't been finished as of yet, isn't perfect by any stretch, but it is good. I would really like to see this trilogy, and currently Barker has been working on several projects, with some of them being close to finished, don't know if one of them might be a third and final book for the trilogy, but it might be something that I'll certainly be keeping my eyes on if it might be.",

      "text": "I went into this knowing it wasn’t the most popular sequel. I don’t really like going into books with pre conceived notions. I was pleasantly at how much I enjoyed it despite being a much slower pace than Annihilation. I think the reason I enjoyed it so much is the fact that I love the inexplicable aspects of these stories.  \n\nThe southern reaches mismanagement of Area X and Centrals real lack of caring about the issue is apparent in the southern reach HQ. It’s run down, clearly funds have been reallocated and mismanaged into things that are of larger concern to the government. Area X is an anomaly that has no clear motive, can’t be reasoned or negotiated with and is beyond our understanding, it “cleanses” areas and completely changes them. Through this mismanagement or some greater force at play the borders of Area X begin to grow out of the little bit of control they had over it. \n\nMy interpretation of this is that it represents our governments management of climate change. Their lack of care, the intentional reallocation of funds away from it and into wars and other pursuits. Through this lack of care the problem is growing beyond our control, It won’t be negotiated with it is simply a force. \n\nI’m also so intrigued by the emphasis on the power of wording. When the 12th expedition went into Area X in Annihilation they were wiped of their real names and instead went by their job titles. Area X creates imitations of people and sends them out into the world. The idea is that by not using their real names you aren’t giving Area X access to a greater part of you, something personal. It doesn’t have that name to anchor itself into the world even further. \n\nThe idea that calling the edges of Area X a border gives it some level of control over where it ends its walls allowing it to expand. \n\nThe significance of the words used is also very present in the way the people on the 12th expedition choose to name the topical anomaly. They argue over whether it’s a tunnel or a tower. The idea that the perception between people can be so incredibly different giving the same thing a different meaning depending on what they choose to call it really emphasizes the significance of that in the grand scheme of things. \n\nLowry being revealed to be the Voice was crazy. I really thought it was cool that Control realized he was being hypnotized and wrote out all of the hypnotic commands from the previous director to use on whoever the voice was. Also the fact that it was so effective because Lowry has been on previous expeditions. \n\nWhitby in the secret room all bunched up on the shelf amongst his insane art while breathing down Controls neck and then reaching out and touching him was such a scary mental image. Reminded me of “that scene” in the movie Parasite. Really sticks with you. \n\nI really enjoyed the dynamic between Control and the imitation of the Biologist. It always felt like we were about to get an answer out of her yet we never really did. She was so mysterious but it had me “on the edge of my seat” just waiting for the right thing to be said. \n\nThe part where Control is looking at the small cabin he expects the biologist to be in through binoculars and after a long time starts to see the ground shifting revealing a sniper and then tons of other Central agents with guns surrounding the entire area was so scary to think about. Had he been less cautious he would’ve died or been captured. \n\nThroughout the story you feel this presence right under the surface like something greater is at play. As Control investigates and slowly more things are revealed like whitbys scary room, the psychologists house, the plant and mouse in the drawer, the obsession with the lighthouse, the paint on the walls. It all comes together in a miraculous fashion in the end whenever the previous director appears yet again with the border expanding behind her. The moment when John looks at the photo of the lighthouse keeper and realizes it’s her in the background of the image based on some very specific posture gave me chills. \n\nWhat in the world did the S&S brigade do? Are they entirely responsible for area X? Is that why the lighthouse keeper has become this crawler that’s scrawling words down the curving stairs of the topical anomaly? Will the border wall consume the entire planet? I have so many questions and I know most won’t be answered but I’m gonna read Acceptance anyways because I love the inexplicable. I love the feeling of dread and morbid curiosity that these books give me. \n\nThe ending was insane. The border expanding and Control fleeing for his life whilst the assistant director awaits it with pure bliss and loyalty, then the image of 2 jets flying overhead while control drives down the highway really emphasized the seriousness of it all. The fact that the spots the anthropologist and the surveyor returned to have become contamination zones was so scary. The idea that Area X could be elsewhere is terrifying. The image of a doorway into area X through the tide pool and them jumping in was chilling and such an ambiguous ending that left me wanting more.",

I mean, anything I know about life, love, religion, friendship, family, mothers, fathers, sisters, brothers, university, art, food, summers, Venice.\n\nWhy did I relate to this book so strongly? I have the least amount of things in common with any of the main characters, except I guess for having friends and family, and going to university. Nobody I know seems to have ever heard of this book, let alone read it, and the author is a old Tory who has probably been cancelled for saying something racist or sexist or both long since.  \n\nI've never had a friend like Sebastian, or a lover like Julia. In fairness, my mom did remind me of Lady Marchmain in her endless capacity to make our perceived failures a burden she has to bear.\n\nAnd I've definitely had the experience of shedding friends from first year during my second year at university. Maybe that's why I did it- to be more like Charles and Sebastian.\n\nI can barely type their names without this intense emotion and longing sweep over me. Oh poor Sebastian. Less poor Charles. Less poor Julia.\n\n(Incidentally, when my teenaged son had a crush on a young rich girl, and then her gay brother made a pass at my son, I told him very unhelpfully to read Brideshead Revisited, or at least watch the show (the BBC version, obviously). He watched the trailer, and asked me what is wrong with me, and why did I think that would help. He is not friends with the siblings any more).\n\nI want that meal Charles had in Paris so much. And I want to be twenty and eat strawberries and drink champagne with friend like Sebastian by a river in Oxford, which I've never actually visited. And of course, I know absolutely everything there is to know about Catholicism thanks to this book, much to the chagrin of my poor Catholic partner.\n\nI read a fair amount of Evelyn Waugh growing up, but this was the one that imprinted itself on me. A woke lefty sjw myself, I remain forever entranced at this doomed story of desiccated decaying British aristocracy which transcends all labels, right, left, Tory, LGBTQ, coming of age, and just remains glittering, the perfect book, the perfect story.",

      "text": "I recently finished *The Most Wonderful Crime of the Year* by Ally Carter and it made me really appreciate writers like her- competent writers who write fun, engaging books and gives the readers what they want. They're not trying to reinvent the wheel, not trying to win any awards, or push any limits. They're not writing for their ego, the accolades, or their legacy. They're writing for us, their reader.\n\nAre they sophisticated writers? No. I don't think anyone's going to name their pets after an Emily Henry character, or tattoo a R F Kuang quote on their forearm. But, I appreciate writers who understand their audience well enough to have fun with them, because their books are very fun to read. There are in jokes and lampshading. They're a bit campy without being cringey. They lean into the tropes enough to push that serotonin button, but not so far that the book crashes into a heap of messy cliches. Yes their works are bit formulaic but the character motivations make sense, there are no big obvious plot holes, and Checkov's guns get fired by the end. \n\nAnd I know it might come across like I'm praising mediocrity, but I just want to show my appreciation for authors who just want to entertain. Granted, I don't watch or read too many author interviews. Maybe S A Crosby really thinks he's writing the next great American social commentary? I don't know. I don't get the impression that T Kingfisher is trying to exorcise her demons through her writing. I don't get the impression V E Schwab is churning out trope fodder to cash in on a viral success before the world forgets who she is. \n\nAnd yes, we should all seek out art that challenges us in some way, art that highlights the awe inspiring height of talent, absolutely. But, there's no wrong reason to read a book and it's fun to read authors who just want to tell a fun story.",

      "title": "The Paradox Paradox by Daniel Hardcastle",
      "text": "> # “When a man stands up and says he knows best, and that best involves killing others, that man knows nothing.”\n\nHero worship can be a dangerous thing. You try to integrate yourself with them or instill a sense of familiarity, but it will often end up backfiring and making you look like an utter numpty because you misread the room. That's a subject matter which has nothing to do with the book The Paradox Paradox written by my personal hero and rolemodel Daniel \"NerdCubed\" Hardcastle. \n\nThis book is, in a completely biased manner of speaking, one of the best books I've read. It's a Sci-Fi Comedy about time-travel.But to avoid cliche's about time travel, don't imagine clocks spinning everywhere. The author Daniel Hardcastle wrote a very concise time travel story, with a very strict ruleset and no deviations from it. On the outside it seems like a very simple interpretation of The Grandfather Paradox. All time-travel happens, if you deviate, you destroy the universe. If yourself from the future hands you a note, you have to deliver that note unchanged or you will destroy the future. You also cannot kill Hitler, no matter how much you want to. What happens if you deviate from established events? To borrow an analogy from the book, imagine you have a running tap. This is linear time. Now imagine a sledgehammer. This is Killing Baby Hitler. After a while the house is destroyed and completely unrecognisable, but the water is still running *somewhere*. And from that somewhere the house can be rebuilt, but it's not going to be the same. Except that's just an interpretation of linear time. Time isn't a straight line, it isn't cause and effect, it happens all at once. All of it. That's the house. Everything being pre-determined from start to finish might sound like you have no free will, but it comes up in the book, and it gets answered. I won't divulge on the specifics. \n\nThe book is about a man who invents a time machine, in order to answer one of the greatest mysteries of the galaxy. A message from the dawn of civilisation. Find, and Kill, Austin Lang. A man who by all accounts, doesn't exist. A Team is made, consisting of an ecclectic cast of characters, A Veterenarian with No Original Parts, a Disgraced Archaeologist serving a 600 Year Prison Sentence, a University Student who cheated on her exams, and a very famous, but very dead space captain. Daniel has described his book as that anxiety that you have on your first day of work, that you'll screw up somehow. This very much tracks, especially when screwing up at a job you lied on your CV to get could result in the destruction of the universe. The narrative includes many topics which is very relevant today. Legacy. Autonomy. Faith. Identity. \n\nDaniel Hardcastle also has a distinctive style of writing, but before I get into that, allow me to compare some unrelated authors. Last year I read three different Doctor Who novels by three different people, and all three of them write in a different manner. Georgia Cook writes short chapters, with the POV changing at the changes in chapters, so the chapters are very short and digestable. Una McCormack writes fewer, but longer chapters, POV changes at a break in the paragraphs. Abi Falase only has the POVs from the main characters, other characters introduced in the books are only expereinced from their POV, they don't get a POV. Daniel I'd say is closer to Una McCormack, but there are a fair few many chapters because this is a **thick** book, just over 500 pages. Arguably the most dense book I've read in the last year. One other thing about the writing style is, footnotes. In Daniel's previous book, *Fuck Yeah: Video Games* there are a lot of footnotes, mostly for jokes, explanations, non-sequiturs and other tangents, like explaining to Americans what a Christmas Cracker is. These footnotes carried over into The Paradox Paradox, so arguably it's just part of his writing style, and something I think will carry over into his future works. It's writing for ADHD people. To put it into a Star Trek context, it is a small print paragraph on the bottom of the page, relating to a sentence said above it, so at the bottom is a paragraph on Human-Vulcan relations, centuries of histroy, and the fundamental basics of how the warp engine works... all to explain why Captain Picard made a dick joke.^1 But the longer the book goes on, there are less and less footnotes, as you already are aware of the species of the galaxy, how the time machine works, and all of the references to a Demonic Entity who reproduces via spores who was also on Noel Edmonds House Party. This is also coincideing when the book becomes more and more serious as the plot progresses.     \nAlso all the Chapters are in the wrong order. It makes sense for a time-travel novel.\n\n^^1 ^It ^had ^to ^be ^Captain ^Picard, ^Captain ^Kirk ^would ^never ^debase ^himself ^with ^such ^juvenile ^humour. ^Janeway ^might, ^but ^only ^after ^committing ^a ^warcrime.\n\nSpoiler Territory: >!So one thought I had a few days ago when I was reading it... Being a good author also involves being a good liar. You should never treat your audience as morons, that's just bad publicity... but you can, and absolutely should dumbfound them. Dan is a very good liar. The book advertises lies, it only talks of the characters I mention earlier, however very early into the book one of the main cast is thrown in a bin and not even seen until the ending, replacing them with a completely different character for the rest of the book. It's like how Metal Gear Solid 2 said you would play as Solid Snake, and you did, but only for an hour afterwards he gets replaced with a Gymnastic Twink. I'm pretty fuckin' sure that the person on the cover is The Famous Captain, who guess what, *isn't* the main character! It's the cheating uni student! There's also the main villain, Chapter One, which happens in the later parts of the third act, is built up as this big revelation that lets you understand the villain and his main motivations in a dramatic rugpull of everything you know. Except, it isn't. As literally a chapter later he goes, \"no, lol\" and the villain is completely different. And then everything goes completely tits up, you go from loving someone, to hating someone, to lamenting them, in the span of a single chapter. Several consecutive rugpulls interspersed with a few more micro-rugpulls. That's a lot of carpet. Daniel is a bastard.!<\n\nLastly, lets talk about the Author and the Publisher. The Paradox Paradox was published by Unbound, which if you know anything it's that Unbound was recently in the shitter for going under, not paying their authors, not refunding their backers, and then being bought by themselves under a new name as a tax dodge. Mostly known for \"Youtuber Books\", which, true. One of these Youtuber Books was Fuck Yeah: Video Games^2 which is basically a set of assorted memoirs about video games, why they should be classed as an art form, and also the personal history and anecdotes of Daniel Hardcastle himself. There's even a touching passage about how video games connect people, and how they connected Dan with a young lad by the name of Jay Harmer. Jay Harmer suffered from cancer and his Make A Wish wish was to meet his favourite Youtuber, NerdCubed. In the time it took for Dan to get back to him he beat cancer, twice, and then they had many fun adventures. Jay Harmer would pass away in June of 2018 as the cancer came back for a third and final time. And when Dan visited Jay in the hospital, dying, descicated, they played Mario Kart together, and for one breif moment Dan wasn't in a moment with a dying man in a hospital room, he was with his friend, having a good time, with a cheating little shit. That's Video Games. That's why he made a book about video games. Those moments we share stay with us forever.     \nDaniel Hardcastle himself is mostly known as a Youtuber and Streamer. He's been at the game a long time, making hundreds to thousands of videos, had collaborations with many others, was in a movie with 100% rating on Rotten Tomatoes, was briefly CEO of Square Enix and has a lot of pets. He's an avid Science Fiction fan, and that's why he wrote this book. Much like how Fuck Yeah: Video Games was one mans love of Video Games, The Paradox Paradox is one mans love of Sci-Fi. Unbound was merely a platofmr he could use to get it published, and it took YEARS to make, hell the book went through so many revisions that the preview at the end of FY:VG isn't even in the completed book. He's described the finished book as Version 5.3. When you have tight Time-Travel rules, any rewrites effect *everything*. The popularity of his previous book and this book probably saved it from Unbound's unpaid people bin, and is probably the last book published by them, and the first book published by Boundless, their successor. Hopefully Daniel can retain the rights if he decides to go with another publisher in the future, but seeing this book, in my nearest Waterstones, on the shelves with other Sci-Fi Authors, it was an easy buy. What's next for Mr The NerdCubed? He really wants to write for Doctor Who, and having a best selling Sci-Fi book under his belt will go a long way into giving him a chance to write for Doctor Who. [And it did.](https://tardis.wiki/wiki/Rise_of_the_Eukaryans_(audio_story\\)) So I guess now he can write for a Doctor Who Novel, a Doctor Who Audio Drama, a Doctor Who Episode, and then eventually, the entire Doctor Who Series. He did a Rodina livestream 8 years ago (fuck I'm old) where he shared a really shit Doctor Who fan theory. That man could not and should not write for Doctor Who. The man who wrote The Paradox Paradox, absolutely should write for Doctor Who. \n\n^^2 ^Available ^now ^where ^you ^can ^buy ^books ^that ^have ^the ^word ^FUCK ^on ^the ^cover\n\nIn conclusion: If you love Science Fiction, LGBT themes, time travel, British pop-culture references, or Dinosaurs of the Youtuber Era, and any combination of the former, read this book. You will not regret it.",

      "title": "Cursed Child by JK Rowling SPOILERS",
      "text": "i have no one to have this discussion with lol !!SPOILERS!!\n\nokay y’all, this is gonna be a long one. i recently read the entire harry potter series, including the 8th Cursed Child book. THE PLOT TWIST MAKES NO SENSE???? if you haven’t read the final book, it’s centered around harry and ginny’s second son, albus, and draco’s only son, scorpius. without getting too into it, albus and scorpius try to go back in time with a time turner to prevent cedric diggory’s death after overhearing amos berating harry for being the one who lived (hehe pun intended). during this time albus, and the rest of the potters and weasleys, meet delphine. she’s the care taker of amos and is coincidentally his niece, aka cedric’s cousin. \n\nalbus and scorpius turn to delphine for help because she’s older and wants cedric to survive as much as they do, so she helps. NOW HERES WHERE THE PLOT THICKENS. \n\ndelphine claims to be the child of bellatrix lestrange and voldemort. HUH?? she claims to be born the night of the battle of hogwarts. HUH??? she thinks she can change voldemorts mind the night of harry’s parents death. HUH?? okay here’s my argument, keep in mind im not actively pulling evidence from the books im going off my memory, so if something is off please feel free to correct me! \n\n* voldemort would have never wanted a child, a legacy that wasn’t literally him, and he never cared about furthering the slytherin bloodline. \n-okay for starters, riddle is a mudblood. but since he’s also a gaunt, he has an unhealthy obsession with “purity”, hence why he murdered the riddles and dropped the name. he never would have willing created another riddle, no matter how pure bellatrix’s blood is. paraphrasing dumbledore’s words, riddle had no interest in companionship, whether it be platonic or sexual. he only saw people as opportunities, vessels for his will. finally, voldemorts ultimate goal was immortality. he didn’t want a legacy in the normal sense, he wanted to be the one and only wizard to conquer the dark arts and in turn, conquer the wizarding world, ending with the annihilation of muggles. that’s why he made horcruxes, so he would essentially never die. voldemort is too much of a narcissist, a perfectionist, to leave the possibility of being usurped by his own blood, which would arguably be his most formidable opponent aside from the owner of the Elder Wand (or just dumbledore let’s be fr). which is also why he made his army out of lesser wizards and creatures alike. if he had cared about the slytherin bloodline, he wouldn’t had murdered morvolo, or maybe it was his uncle he murdered but either way he killed the only other living descendant of salazar. \n\n*whether or not riddle would have believed delphine about the curse, he would have murdered her before he left Godric’s Hallow, effectively ending her longing for a relationship with her father and her ultimate goal\n-this one’s short, pretty much piggybacks off the last argument. again, he wants no loose ends. her knowledge of the curse, of what riddle would do if he felt threatened (create the horcruxes and where he’d hide them) would have nagged him. there would always be doubt, was she telling the truth? is she really my daughter? what if it’s a trick? he keeps people alive until they are no longer useful to him, he proved this when he killed severus. she is no use to him, i honestly don’t think he would have believed her. a random witch over severus’ word, very unlikely at that time. \n\n*at what point during deathly hallows both 1 and 2, was voldemort in the scottish highlands long enough to a) have the idea to have a child as a last option whilst his horcruxes were actively being looked for by harry and b) had the time to conceive with bellatrix and c) been able to procreate? \n-he was all over the world, basically following harry’s tracks to check on his horcruxes after harry had broken into bellatrix’s vault. during this time, he instructed his death eaters to stay in the highlands, to pursue harry, this includes bellatrix. also, just to throw it in there, there was no mention of bellatrix gaining any weight or even just looking different in general. so we all know the reason riddle looks like a snake is because he’s technically not human anymore, he split his soul too many times that he no longer has humanity. so how tf can he procreate? how can a thing with technically no soul, because his last piece of soul is in harry, have potent seed? this one is more logical and ik it’s a fantasy world but still, it’s a whole universe where the basic understanding of biology still applies. \n\n*FINALLY, no way in hell did bellatrix GIVE BIRTH then go fight and kill a bunch of teenagers. \n-this one again goes back to logic, sorry love but that is just not realistic. also, you’re telling me she was months pregnant when torturing hermoine? where? this event is canon, and yet there is no mention of a belly, of anything to indicate a change in bellatrix. \n\nto conclude, i’m a stickler about canon events and logic. this last book really disappointed me, especially since i was so excited to read about the next generation of potters and weasleys. :)",

      "text": "I'm know I'm not the only one who has become exhausted with the state of television. I grew up when television (outside of specific mini-series) was still 20-26 episode season affairs that had regular yearly schedules. As far as I can tell for scripted television the only types of shows that retain that are network sitcoms, likely because they can be made very cheaply.\n\nThat's where I'm getting confused too, what good does it do to have an 8 episode season where each episode costs around $15 million to make (The Boys for example) and can take over a year to come out when back in the late 80s a 26 episode season of Star Trek TNG cost about $2 million per episode ($5 million accounting for inflation).\n\nWhy has television ended up in this place?",

      "text": "This can also be referred to as the \"but for me, it was Tuesday\" moment, inspired by the infamous moment in the \"Street Fighter\" movie where Raul Julia tells Ming-Na Wen that the day that changed her whole life was basically just a rough day at the office for him. It can be a very dramatic moment, especially in showing the cruelty of a villain or the pointless futility of a personal obsession or crusade. But in a TV series, it can be even more effective by showing a character follow that obsessive quest or revenge drive for episodes or seasons, only then to get that cold reality that in the end, the target is clueless and you'll get no satisfaction. We got a masterful example of this on \"Andor\" where Syril finally confronts the titular character after chasing him and obsessing over him for the whole series, only to have Cassian utterly clueless as to who he even is. Having watched Syril spend his whole storyline up to this point leading to this moment and then having this happen just makes the impact hit even harder.\n\nMy favorite example of this, however, oddly enough comes from an animated series, in this case \"Batman Beyond.\" In one episode, new Batman Terry McGinnis confronts villain Derek Powers, aka Blight, the man who in the first episode of the show caused the death of Terry's father. Understandably a very emotional moment, but here's the exchange.\n\n\"You killed my father.\"\n\n(Pause)\n\n\"Do you have the slightest idea how little that narrows it down?\"\n\nCold, dude.",

      "text": "I mean no disrespect whatsoever to the current actors that have been cast, but I can't wrap my head around Warner Bros deciding to remake Harry Potter.\n\n I know the underlying reason is \"money\" but HP is by no means a bankrupt franchise. TO THIS DAY, it is still the [BESTSELLING](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_best-selling_books#List_of_best-selling_book_series) book series of ALL TIME. People regularly rewatch the movies. People buy HP merchandise all the time. The franchise is continuously making insane amounts of money. HP is still a household name.\n\nThe movies are iconic. Actors that are iconic and the new set of actors for the show will forever be compared to the likes of Alan Rickman, Emma, Rupert, Daniel, Maggie Smith. The movies aren't that old. \n\nAm I saying that the movies are perfect? No, of couse not. They could have taken a Harry Potter show into so many different directions; there are so many aspects of HP lore that they could have explored. A HP TV show delving into the first wizarding war? 1000% it would draw so many views. A TV show about the founders of Hogwarts or aurors? It would absolutely draw so many views, and thus make money. Why retell Harry Potter's story again?\n\nI don't have much hope for this show actually covering all 7 books. Given how nowadays it takes 2-3 years for a new season to come out, interest will dwindle. The production costs needed to make the story justice will be enourmous.  The only way this show might actually succeed is if the new adaptation is so ridiculously good with insane reviews, that it makes the existing movies look like child's play in comparison. \n\nMind you, I will still tune in when the first season comes out just to see what the fuss is about.  I just have a bad feeling that this show will get cancelled halfway through book 4 or 5. \n\nJust my 2 cents 🤷🏻‍♀️.",

It’s got probably four of the biggest movie stars alive in it, and we’ve kept it quiet.\" It's now two whole years later, do we know what he was talking about?\n\nEDIT: After reading these comments and reflecting on it, I'm pretty confident he was talking about Lioness. At the time, Saldana and Kidman were known to be in it, but Morgan Freeman wouldn't be announced until January 2023. I think that's what he was referring to when he said they were keeping things quiet. I have no idea who he was referring to as the fourth star, but maybe he just misspoke. (It seems unbelievable that he would sincerely think Martin Donovan is one of \"the biggest movie stars alive.\")",

      "text": "Okay so I’m on episode 4 of Yellowstone and I gotta ask… does this get better? Because so far, this show is trying SO HARD to be deep, gritty, intense — and it’s failing miserably. I honestly don’t know how people sat through this without constantly cringing.\n\nFirst off, the dialogue. It’s like someone watched a bunch of Scorsese and Tarantino movies and thought, “Yeah, let’s do that — but without the wit, charm, or realism.” Everyone talks like they’re in a goddamn cowboy Shakespeare reboot and it just feels so unnatural. No one talks like this. Not even drunk people trying to sound smart.\n\nThen there’s John Dutton. He’s clearly supposed to be this Godfather of Montana type, but Kevin Costner delivers it with the energy of someone who’s permanently half-asleep. The whole “man of few words, but those words carry weight” vibe only works if the words aren’t nonsensical melodrama delivered like a man chewing rocks.\n\nBeth. Fucking Beth. Where do I even start? This is NOT a good anti-heroine. This isn’t clever writing. This is someone in a writers’ room smashing a “BOSS BITCH” stereotype together with every toxic trope imaginable and calling it “complex.” She’s not cool, she’s not edgy — she’s a walking cringe compilation. I now literally skip every single one of her scenes. I just can’t.\n\nAnd then there’s Kayce. Jesus Christ. The show’s really out here trying to push that “quiet guy with a dark edge” narrative so hard it’s embarrassing. My man LEFT HIS KID IN A BARREL IN THE GODDAMN DESERT to go play cowboy meth-hunter. WTF? How are we supposed to root for him? What is this character writing?\n\nIt feels like every character is just a stereotype on steroids. Like the writers made a list of “cool” traits and threw them together without asking if they make sense. Nothing feels earned. Nothing feels real. It’s just vibes — and bad ones at that.\n\nAnyway, rant over. Does this shit actually improve or should I just jump ship now before I waste more hours watching Yeehaw Sopranos cosplay?",

      "text": "Why do Gen Z viewers have such a problem with nudity all of a sudden?\n\nIn particular, this past week, I've seen comments on here calling the nude scene in the latest episode of The White Lotus 'obscene'. It's maybe thirty seconds of Aimee Lou Wood topless and Walton Goggins consensually sucking her nipple. Pretty tame by anyone's standards in a drama rated MA with a content warning at the start.\n\nYet pretty much everywhere the topic of nudity is brought up, people are straight up saying that movies and TV shows shouldn't have nudity, that it's always unnecessary, that it should cut away before any sex is depicted, there should be a Skip option for it etc.\n\nThe most persistent argument I see is that it means people can't watch TV shows with their parents. But if that's the case, just don't watch it with your parents. Mine are of an age, prefer softer stuff like Call The Midwife, Doc Martin, and When The Boat comes in, and actively dislike shows like Family Guy and Game Of Thrones etc because of stuff like bad language and crude humour. My 70 y/o aunt on the other other hand loves Game Of Thrones.\n\nI'm a young millennial and honestly don't recall this kind of negative discourse around onscreen nudity when I was younger. We just took it for what it was. Yet amongst younger viewers online, there seems to be this strange wave of new puritanism.",

The one kid just full on telling her brother everything even tho it’s suppose to be a big big secret. The rekindling was rushed so hard. Did I mention the kids? The fact this happened before the first alien…laden with unanswerable questions with that one. The boy genius actually sounds like he’s on the I’m 14 and this is deep subreddit, geniuses do not talk like this. Disney dropping some IP into the mix, for what? I still can’t get over that they just sent some kids essentially, with no formal training on taking orders or anything. Oh and so now that they have synth bodies their hormones and whatnot should basically be non existent…yet they are constantly fidgeting and doing silly things. \n\nAnyone who says this is good has seriously turned off their brain…that’s ok I guess…but it’s not for the rest of us\n\nOk I will say the part where they were on the ship was phenomenal, gave me actual alien vibes…but that’s where it ends\n\nWhat were they thinking?",

      "title": "The Rehearsal Season 2 is the most revolutionary TV show of this century",
      "text": "There are a few shows broadly considered to have revolutionized TV, changing forever how the next shows were made. First we have I Love Lucy in 1951, which changed the format of sitcoms and TV shows in general. Then, in 1999, we had The Sopranos, which consolidated the format of \"TV shows\" as a viable medium for complex, high-budget work that had previously been common only in movies. Breaking Bad extended this a bit later, but as more of a continous evolution than a revolution per se.\n\nThen, we get to The Rehearsal Season 2, which aired in 2025, three years after the first season. And this, this is another revolution happening before our eyes. In the 26 years since The Sopranos first aired, television has never seen such a level of art.\n\nI'm not saying it is more fun or has a better script than, say, Breaking Bad. No. It is not, and it does not. However, The Rehearsal is definitely the most complex and authentic thing produced for TV so far this century. It evokes emotions that no other show could ever produce. You are left absolutely astonished and skeptical of what you are seeing, even though you know it is real. At the same time, the show carefully forces you to question what is real and what is not.\n\nThe way it ties together completely absurd storylines, yet addresses them with a high level of completeness and presents points of view that have never been so well explored before, is insane. It stretches the concept of breaking the fourth wall, instead making you a part of the experiment as well.\n\nThis is extremely relevant for today's times, when everyone's lives have become so made-for-TV with Instagram and such. We no longer know what is authentic, if the pretty dish you saw on your friends' stories actually tastes good, or if they just ordered it because it looks good on camera. The Rehearsal forces this into TV in a way that no reality show has been able to do before. And here I praise HBO as well, because it is not just a matter of the show's insane ideas, but the fact that a big studio went with it and paid for it all. That's a crucial part of the experience and the sense of incredulity.\n\nAlthough the first season was not as incredible (still good, tho), I now see it as a part of Season 2 (a rehearsal, if you will). It is almost as if the goal of Season 1 was to shock you and make you completely suspend disbelief regarding the limits of this show, only to go into Season 2 and find that the limits are even further than you could possibly imagine. It is almost a joke about the limits of your imagination for absurdism. It is a statement on how your synapses are mechanically unable to predict what goes on inside Nathan Fielder's mind. It is a deep dive into someone else's head.\n\nAlthough the definition of art has been debated since art began, there are three dimensions usually agreed upon:\n\n1. A form of communication\n2. That materializes someone's subjectivity and authenticity\n3. Capable of producing emotions in its audience\n\nThe Rehearsal Season 2 excels in all three of these, more than any show has since 1999. And for that, I claim that The Rehearsal is the most revolutionary show of this century.",

While her reason for leaving was to focus more on her burgeoning film career (she had been in hit films like Outrageous Fortune and The Money Pit) as her last chance at making it big as a movie star, it was also apparent she didn't get along with her co-stars, who were more relaxed and open to having fun whereas Shelley Long, just like Diane, was more focused on doing her job and keeping it professional and it ended up isolating her from the cast. It also didn't help that she was mad that Kelsey Grammer took a chunk of the funnier lines that were meant for Diane. When Frasier came on the show, Diane lost a lot of that snooty humor she had in the initial seasons, her arc becoming even more focused on the Sam and Diane arc. By her last season, her character was missing some episodes with how underwritten she had become.",

What a premise.\n\nThe issue with so many \"comedic\" shows is that they don't take themselves seriously enough for the audience to get invested.\n\nMurderbot turns this on its head. The premise of >!a bunch of robot-rights obsessed space hippies taking in a defective (semi) killer robot!<makes for so many opportunities where you're just like \"YES\". It inspires a rare, considered sort of kindness.\n\nI really enjoyed shows like Devs, Pantheon, Foundation and Scavengers Reign, and this scratched a similar itch. Kind of similar to the movie Alita: Battle Angel\n\nHighly recommended!",

When you recollect it at any time, you can’t help but chuckle to yourself?  \n\nMy top two:\n\n1. Arrested Development: after Michael and Rita (Charlize Theron) break up, they show a picture of her from the movie “Monster” (released the previous year), and the narrator says how Michael wouldn’t have found her as attractive if he had met her a year earlier, pre-plastic surgery.   \n\n2. The Office: Dwight gets a concussion and Michael and Jim take him to the hospital, where Michael fills in in the intake forms. For “Reason for Visit” he fills in “Bringing someone to the hospital”.",

Ever since I was young, I have always hated the fact that many movies and TV series have sex and nudity scenes. They are not necessary at all, and I think it is very misogynistic for women to have to strip on camera to have these big roles. And no, I do not need to see men naked either. I don't want to see anyone naked, I just want to see a good story.\n\nIt's not comfortable for us to watch, whether I am alone or with family. In fact, even kissing scenes can be uncomfortable when you are watching with your family. They don't need to show us two people locking tongues to show they are a couple, like we get it.\n\nI've switched to watching Asian, Arabian, and Turkish dramas. No kissing, sex, or nudity required, the plots and acting are much better. Why can't we have that in the West?\n\nA lot of Gen Z feel the same way. We're just gonna boycott more and more movies and series that have sex and nudity. We have plenty of stuff to watch from the other part of the world, like the Middle East, Türkiye, South Korea, etc. Luckily, every streaming app has English subtitles.\n\nI hope more people can speak out like me in 2025 and beyond.",

But I also don't want to miss out too much on the lore. So any recommendations of which films to check out ahead of time before the series comes out? I think i'll rewatch the first set of Alien films, but past that, not sure what I else I may need to know.",

With how many great shows it came out with so quickly (Ted Lasson s1, Mythic Quest, etc) and shows that I'm positive were super expensive to make (Monarch: Legacy of Monsters) with all the CGI (which I honestly thought looked pretty good for a TV show) but how little it's really recognized among the current Streaming giants, I can only imagine that the Apple tv division is basically operating at a huge loss and focusing on building a base, with profit only in like 10 years time at best. \n\nThe fact that so many surprising shows like severance are on Apple TV makes me think they're really giving it their all instead of being like tubi or paramount's nonsense.

Plus with 20+ episodes it allowed us to have some of that charm from older shows. I don't care that some of its cringy or teen drama. I just loved them bc they were still fun. It was literally the only channel in modern days that kept that standard from the past and with it being bought by someone else it got completely ruined. Now I feel like we will never have another drama with 22 episodes. I much prefer that many episodes bc even with the main story doesn't happen as fast I get to spend more time with the characters in the world which gives me a bigger bond with the characters and I get to see more creative worldbuilding. Not to mention the wacky one off special episodes that get really creative and fun that you can't do in 8-10 episode seasons. It feels like the magic of TV is dying and replaced with 8 hour movies.",

      "title": "Some of the worst misrepresentations they made in Rings of power and Jackson's movies",
      "text": "There is issue with black, white and East Asian dwarfs and elves, but for a different reason than most people think. Dwarfs and elves are not humans, they are different species. So to put racial diversity there is alike to have show with zebra gorillas, or black white bears. Dwarfs are not white, they are dwarfs. Not short people, but dwarfs. They were made of rocks, sculptured by Aule. He made seven dwarven pairs - fathers and mothers, and each pair awoke under different mountain. And actually we do not know their skin color. Elves are elves, not tall people with pointy ears. And their skin color was pale white. But the issues do not stop with humanizing dwarfs and elves and other species. Hobbits, described by Tolkien were very different. Harfoots were browner of skin. Indeed, Frodo was not white. As Harfoots were not some primordial race, they were one of the three tribes of the hobbits. And the one with darkest skin color. And going like this we come to the orcs. Why there are not black, white and Asian orcs in RoP? As if all other species are humanized like this, why not the orcs? This is kind of racist. Actually they humanized the orcs at the worst possible way. There are many species that do not take special care for their children. But showmakers described orcs as loving fathers and mothers, alike most humans. The issue is not that orcs have children. The issue is they became loving parents. As then, they are not evil. And if they are not evil, everyone who kills orcs is evil. So like that showrunners turned humans and elves, and specially Galadriel into evil antagonists. Like this in the show Galadriel and Numenoreans performed much more evil deeds than Sauron.\n\nThere are only three cases when humans and elves interbred - Beren and Luthien, Tuor and Idril, and Aragorn and Arwen. Tuor was chosen by Ulmo, became immortal and the only human accepted in Valinor. He was not ordinary human but blessed by god, and that made interbreeding with elf possible. Beren and Luthien are another special case - they both died, and then as reward for their heroism against evil, they were returned by Valar in the Middle-earth to live as humans. Then Valar give to their children the choice to be men or elves. Elrond chose to become elf. His twin brother Elros chose to become human and founded Numenor. So Aragorn and Arwen were cousins. Arwen choose to become a human, so to stay with her beloved Aragorn. In all three cases the interbreeding was not related to biology, but to magic and divine intervention.\n\nAnd in addition I have a question, as that was initially published in LOTR\\_on\\_Prime subreddit - they deleted it, claiming that it is *based on identity and directly affects fellow community members, and also related to modern politics, identity, or religion tend to veer into flame wars and personal attacks.* As English is not my primary language, I want to ask you where in the text you see justification for such accusations?\n\nTo reduce the rage of some fans of the movies. I do not hate the movies. I just point how the movies misrepresent different species in the books, in most cases without any valid reason, and in others like loving orcs  with very serious negative consequences for the lore.\n\nTo explain why this is a problem - elves, dwarfs, orcs, and hobbits are stripped by their elvishness, dwarfishness, orcishness and hobbitism. They are turned into humans with cultural differences or in the orcs case - humans with different look. That is how entire lore integrity and fantasy setting of Tolkien's world are destroyed. While in Jackson's movies only hobbits and dwarfs are mispresented to some degree, in RoP all species are extremely humanized. For example I do not mind if there are black dwarfs. But why there are not green, red or blue dwarfs? Their forefathers were made by rocks.\n\nAnd for those who claim - but all species are played by human actors, I will say - look at the orcs. The issue with them is not they look like humans, but they act like such. And if orcs can look like orcs, elves can look like elves too, dwarfs can look like dwarfs - probably in all colors like rocks. Hobbits can look like hobbits - so no white, but also no black, they are described with browner skin. Numenoreans can look like Numenoreans - so tall, white with black hair and grey eyes. And there are actual back and Asian like people with their own culture and lore in Tolkien's world, which are not represented in RoP at all.\n\nAnd their story is actually very interesting. White Numenoreans corrupted by Sauron, but also by their own pride, started to conquer and enslave people in the East and the South of the Middle-earth, who fought back. That is why black Haradrim were lured so easy by Sauron to attack Gondor in LoTR.",

      "title": "Batman The Animated Series was unlike any animated series of the ERA. Nothing on kids TV looked or sounded like this. Each episode had Oscar worthy music, the airbrushed quality of animation. There was also moments of SILENCE which was, pun intended, unheard of for kids TV.",
      "text": "I’m constantly amazed that this existed. So much of it goes against what kids tv of that era looked and sounded like. The bad guys used GUNS, not lasers. We saw blood every once in awhile. It was set in some odd noir background. There are long stretches without action or music. The acting was natural and not said like they were trying to make T Shirt quotes.\n\nBack then kids tv had one purpose. To sell toys. So even shows like X-Men were usually just packed with action and wall to wall noise. The animation was pretty iffy. Everything was over designed. The music was recycled and not remotely film quality. I like X-Men. Spider-Man TAS too. But those shows were meant to move plastic off shelves. Batman had big a toy line too but the show wasn’t making or designing things to fit within that parameter  \n\nThen comes Batman. This show makes everything of that era look bad. The writing, voice acting. All of it. It’s not played for kids. It’s not dumb downed. \n\nAnd it spawned the DCAU which holds up extremely well.",

Some stayed focused over the years - Nickelodeon during the day is still all kids oriented programming. Others gave strayed very, very far from where they began.\n\nWhich stations that still exist have veered the farthest from their original purpose? I have a few nominees:\n\n1. MTV went from showing music videos 24/7 to now showing crappy reality and reruns of sitcoms.\n\n2. Bravo was once the place for finding foreign language films. Now it's all about Housewives and Andy Cohen.\n\n3. TLC once actually has educational programming and now is even crappier reality than the two above.",

      "title": "[SPOILERS] I hated The Handmaid’s Tale finale. Here’s why.",
      "text": "Well, we made it. Barely. I stuck with this final season out of pure commitment — I’ve come this far, I had to see it through. But honestly? It was such a letdown. Even during the finale, I was tempted to DNF or watch it on 2x speed just to get it over with. It was that underwhelming.\n\n1. **June Osborne has to be one of the most unlikable, undeserving, selfish, and just plain annoying FMC's ever.** Yes, I get it, she's the lead and the lens of which we're seeing this story, BUT the way the show bends over backwards to put her at the center and forefront of EVERY major rebellion decision, every mission, every emotional scene was a bit much. Especially since it was extremely illogical at times, because yes, she has suffered greatly and clearly has complex PTSD, but also because of that is why she's a huge liability. She's not level-headed under pressure (at least in the later and last seasons imo) and because of everything, she routinely made impulsive, reckless, and overly emotional choices that drastically impacted the rebellion, whatever they were working towards, and usually ended up with those around her getting hurt, captured, or killed, or herself captured and put in a position where MORE people put themselves in danger to rescue her (FOR THE MILLIONTH TIME). At least Moira started to call her out on it and say like girl, you aint the only one suffering or impacted or hurt by this, but then June's insufferable ass was a bitch to her and was super defensive like how bout we just call it a draw instead of comparing suffering (bc we all know I'd win).\n2. **If I never see another close up of Elisabeth Moss's face, it will be too soon.** Again, yes, she is a good actress. I loved her in Mad Men and for the majority of this series, but, the extreme constant close ups were way too overused. It became a substitute for storytelling and every time we were supposed to feel something or there was a really intense or emotional moment that we were supposed to \"feel\", we got a close up of her \"watching\" it with this intense expression and twitching random parts of her face for an obscenely long time.\n3. **The music and writing overall were both just incredibly lazy.** They leaned so heavily on dramatic, ominous music that it felt like a crutch. Instead of building tension through actual plot or character dynamics, they just slapped some intense tones behind static scenes and hoped it would trick us into caring. We’ve seen shows (*Succession*, *GOT, White Lotus*) use music brilliantly. This was not that. Repeated over-use of \"thank you\" and the OG Gilead phrases through this ep were insane. If you made a drinking game out of those, you'd be black out in no time. The only scene/dialogue that I thought was really compelling was Serena's bit before she got on the bus, but I still think there was SO much more that could've been said\n4. **So much still feels unfinished, but here's my rapid fire list of the ones that pmo the most:**\n   1. **Hannah** \\- still in Gilead, but now 2k miles closer, but nothing actually happens. We don't see her at all and the last time she saw June, she didn't recognize her so would've been interesting to see how they navigated that reunion since that likely will be happening to alot of kids who were taken at birth or young and are equally as scared going back to their \"families\" they don't know or remember.\n   2. **Luke and June's relationship** \\- this was already on rocky grounds so seeing Hannah come back into their lives which was the driving force for them staying and fighting felt necessary. You also never see him interacting, caring for, or even considering Holly, which makes you wonder does he really think of her as his daughter or see that as Nick's kid. But with Nick out of the picture permanently, does this improve their relationship.\n   3. **Nick needed somewhat of a redemption arc and Serena needed less of one** \\- yes, he made horrible decisions and ultimately choose himself over others, but that is quite literally what every single character is doing on this show. And very important to note, that while his motives for helping the resistance may not have been fully about morals and more about his feelings for June, he was still helping, and both times he got caught and screwed big time this season were bc of June and him putting his entire life on the line to help her and doing drastic things to cover their tracks (i.e. shooting those guardians at the water park, finishing the job later at the hospital, going to Jezebel's to get the letters, etc.). He even shared that Gilead gave him a \"life\" bc of his mom situation and Rita confirmed he was a \"good guy\", so why isn't he given any grace for also doing what he needed to survive? And then on the flip side, the Serena redemption arc was shoved so hard down our throats it was unbelievable. She can feel immense shame, guilt, etc., but also she repeatedly went back to the same system in a state of insanity thinking the outcome would somehow be different and the fact that she still continued to protect Wharton despite the entire wedding night ordeal was (unsurprisingly) infuriating.\n   4. Those remaining in Gilead, what happens to them? **Aunt Lydia** was just about to be hung as a traitor and now seems to be in a position of power at the border scene, how? Why did **Naomi** give up **Angela/Charlotte** finally? If she felt if was bc Gilead isn't safe, then why not ask Mark for asylum then especially as she's now w/o a husband again? Why did they just hand **Jeanine** over? Why didn't **Rita** get captured or killed if they knew she put the sedative in the cake? SO. MANY. QUESTIONS.\n   5. **The actual takedown of Gilead felt totally implausible.** Again, only two people who can get into the Red Center and kick this off are arguably the two most notorious and recognizable people... please. Why did June never dye her hair to be less recognizable??!! Just being seen almost ruined or did ruin the plan a bazillion times. OK, onto the cake, why not poison, why just a sedative? That barely even worked. Zero chance no one in the room noticed none of the handmaids were eating the cake and stuffing under the benches? they are watched like literal hawks. the bombs were a joke. june getting captured in that weird cage for like 5 seconds, stupid, and the convo between her and wharton felt totally flat because they had no connection or overlap, would've been more impactful if he had brought Serena with him and saw her struggle between who to side or empathize with. the Red center scene where Aunt Lydia catches them and Peter, that guardian is there with a gun pulled, but yet walks away and doesn't do or say anything despite these known rebels convincing the aunts to let them leave to go commit treason and anarchy? what.\n   6. **And does Gilead even now it was their own people who took them down?** Between Serena's confession and Lawerence's sacrifice, that is entirely what made it possible and there's almost no acknowledgement within those who knew or the broader audience to either of those. The focus on Boston only throughout the show had me totally not even realizing that Gilead was much more widespread and the complete collapse of it was a HUGE effort. Also strange how little we saw of the \"high council\" in DC.\n\nI honestly feel like I could go on and on, but I'll end my rant here. In summary, I really felt like the finale just didn't hit and instead left us with a bunch of abandoned storylines wrapped in June's over-inflated self-importance. It was empty, directionless, and somehow both rushed and painfully slow.",

All scored to this sweet laid back jazz music. \n\nRecess focused on the school aspect. The social cliques, the hierarchy. \n\nThe Weekenders focused on the social. Being with your core group of friends outside the confines of school. Hanging at the mall, going to the movies, worry about homework on Sunday. \n\nFor me Hey Arnold probably reigns supreme just for its vibe.\n\nBut all three of these shows just get the carefree ways of being a kid.",

      "title": "the loss of musical guest appearances",
      "text": "Was watching the episode of *Sister, Sister* with the on-campus Next concert and it reminded me of something else current television is missing (esp in shows about and for teens/ya's...which are also largely missing)--featured guest performances by real life musical artists. From Color Me Bad on the first season of *Beverly Hills 90210* (\"[Things To Do On A Rainy Day](https://youtu.be/4PjxeJoAGAw?si=mZBBQ201ZIAdaY8L)\", it's a really cute episode) to \"Bad Romance\"-era[ Gaga on *Gossip Girl*](https://youtu.be/LURQPezhn5Y?si=IomKn0l9WNEVhfoa). One of the old Christmas episodes I try to watch every year is the *Fresh Prince of Bel Air* where Boyz II Men performed their version of \"[Silent Night](https://youtu.be/rDigf1XM9DQ?si=0jbMuTMFt_o5fd_8)\" at Nicky's Christmas Eve christening--and \"[Let It Snow](https://youtu.be/fAl5eYFTcAE?si=Kd3mpxXABGXk9TiA)\" in an earlier scene (and when[ Bell Biv DeVoe](https://youtu.be/3t8YGXJlvyc?si=lY0syJ79AErHV7o3) shot a video in the Banks' house! another of my favorites). I first heard what's still one of my favorite 90s songs, \"Tell Me\", when Groove Theory performed it on *New York Undercover*\\--in fact, musical performances *every episode*, by mainly black and other musicians of color, at the characters' regular hangout club was part of that show's schtick (being co-ep'd by Andre Harrell of Uptown Records certainly helped with that). The Bronze on *Buffy The Vampire Slayer* was also often used to showcase real life musical acts, and there's[ *that* ending montage](https://youtu.be/saxUkx3gpNA?si=-25eCC9b-BnAJykA) of \"Tabula Rasa\" with Michelle Branch singing \"Goodbye To You\". For shows that took place during the high school years and made it to prom, at least 7 times out of 10 a current musical act would perform at it (probably my favorite Clana moment on *Smallville* is them dancing to[ Lifehouse--\"You and Me\"](https://youtu.be/bHIO6DOa6cc?si=tWhtZwDUulVZMiZr), of course--at senior prom). \"Black shows\"/shows with mostly black/of color casts especially leaned into this practice as a way of showing off even more of The Culture (esp shows starring black musicians-slash-actors, like *Fresh Prince*, *Moesha*, and *The Jamie Foxx Show*).\n\nIt was *such* an ingrained thing, which a[ *Rolling Stone* listicle](https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-lists/the-15-coolest-and-weirdest-musician-cameos-on-tv-shows-22193/sleater-kinney-on-the-l-word-2006-256652/) pointed out had been going on since the 70s, and I think got especially intense in the 90s thru mid 2000s (likely bc that was the heyday of both the teen drama and the black sitcom), but now isn't really a thing at all. On one hand I really have to wonder why, because it was such a reciprocal exchange between the record labels and the tv networks--the labels got promo and ideally a sales bump for their artist and the networks ideally got a ratings bump for their show, especially if the featured act was very in the zeitgeist at the time. Like I remember it was a *big deal* when *Dawson's Creek* basically revolved an episode around a No Doubt concert--and this was *Rock Steady*\\-era, \"Hey Baby\", \"Hella Good\", \"Underneath It All\", *that* No Doubt. The WB[ promo'd](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JK-HREEWggM)[ the *hell*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skf4tJb-Sdw) outta the episode, and it was even titled \"Spiderwebs\", after an earlier No Doubt song.\n\nMusic and television were so synergistic back then, and that's really declined. I assume it's largely due to the changes that have hit both industries in the last decade+, but still... And sure, maybe sometimes the bands'/singers' appearances were more contrived than others (like[ P3](https://youtu.be/ZkdVidCluNw?si=0o_jcnD9DfJMk42K)[ on](https://youtu.be/5UbePACDBeE?si=LtT2tRoY5us1KMDS)[ *Charmed*](https://youtu.be/HmqHDUzS78s?si=wfoBci4D8YwNfGqT) seemingly becoming a thing mainly to promote acts), but whatever, even then, overall it was fun. And I feel like a lot of the *fun* has been sucked out of the television landscape these days, and that's a shame, especially for younger viewers.",

The music, the pacing, the action, the suspense. I just love it too much to skip.\n\nWhat show is it, and why do you love the intro? (Also, link to a video of the credits, so we can all enjoy.)",

      "text": "2013-2022 was such a great era with NBC and Fox and other TV networks staging live broadcasts of famous musicals. Almost all of the musicals utilized a single sound stage for their production, essentially making them essentially the stage production with cameras, those musicals were fun and exactly what you would experience.\n\nHowever, the two that really stood out and considered the best were Hairspray and Grease, notably because rather than a single stage, they utilized multiple sound stages AND the studio backlot with several different purpose built sets specifically for the musical. In essence, it felt like they combined the best elements of a stage production with the best elements of a movie production to create productions that were above and beyond what either a stage show or movie could be on its own.\n\nI mean, the sheer boldness of the production and how much effort went into it. I mean they had to coordinate both the show itself, but the movements of cameras, sound, set transitions, actor transitions, and everything all in one take. I mean they had the challenges of producing a live broadcast, movie and a stage show put together. With so many moving parts and potential to go wrong, for example it was raining in LA during Grease, so they had to adapt accordingly (hence the umbrellas) and Hairspray had some minor audio issues. Yet, despite those challenges, both of those shows are truly masterpieces in accomplishing exactly what they set out to do. I really applaud everybody who was willing to take on that challenge and pursue those productions, I mean those were *events* in their own right.\n\nIt's a shame that those were the only two that pushed the potential of the format, with the rest of the Live Musicals returning to the single stage shows and then ending on a dud with Rent Live. If they would've dared to do more in the Grease/ Hairspray format, they really could've achieved some really amazing things in the Live TV Musical format. I hope that if they ever resurrect the format again, they take the inspiration from Grease and Hairspray.",

And tries to portray the woman as in the wrong. And the character demands an explanation from the woman, portraying to the audience that he is \"owed\" an explanation for why she won't go out with him. Which usually serves as an excuse to prove the woman character \"wrong\" and that the guy character is \"different\" and she should give him a chance. \n\nIt's not even just mediocre shows that do this, even great shows were not exempt from this kinda storyline. \n\nImagine an entire culture having grown up on this, for decades. If not centuries. Just found that funny looking back.",

      "text": "A tragic, emotional love story is really not what I expected going into Edgerunners. I was a little skeptical about the show, and had kinda unfairly written it off as a cash grab. Cyberpunk 2077 is one of my all-time favourite games (post changes and updates ofc) and I absolutely love the world of Night City so my expectations were pretty high. \n\nThe audiovisual style is what jumps out at you at first. The art and animation are seriously impressive (par for the course for Trigger I guess) - highly stylized and slightly exaggerated with some impressive direction. The accuracy with which they capture the visual \"language\" of the game's UI is pretty incredible as well - stuff like the phone call ringtones and hacking screens look lifted out of the game. Action scenes are dynamic, creative and gory as fuck. The soundtrack and overall use of music are incredible. \n\nThe overall plot and atmosphere are also a perfect encapsulation of the Cyberpunk world, with the narrative getting a little deeper and darker each episode, and faithfully developing another slice of the Night City from the game. \n\nBut what really elevated the show for me is the tragic love story between David and Lucy. It felt so human, and simultaneously wholesome and melancholy. It's about two lost souls finding comfort and solace in each other in a dark, cruel world that holds little hope for those who live in it. You desperately want them to make it but you know that it's not going to happen. The ending is bittersweet, in true Cyberpunk fashion, and I have to admit that it left me feeling quite empty and emotional. \n\nI'm really excited for season 2 and look forward to seeing the kind of stories they can tell in this world.",

I had just gotten into Wheel of Time and as soon as I finished the latest season it was announced that they were canceled. I was highly upset and felt lost on what to watch next. So I went back to bing playing old shows that I’ve seen a million times. The kind you just play for background noise. Then while scrolling through the mountains of trash shows that gets pumped out, I found a show that caught my attention. It was Kaos. I very much enjoyed the first season! It was colorful and deep and funny and truly kept my attention. When I watched the last episode of the season I was so excited to see when the next season was due for release, I immediately went online to find out. Unfortunately this too has been cancelled after just one season. The reason? Not enough viewers. Again! Seriously! How the hell are we supposed to have enough viewers when there are literally a dozen different streaming apps playing tons of literal garbage. How about you give viewers time to actually discover great shows before cancelling them! I’m just so over streaming apps! I think in just gonna go back to listening to music and books for a while.",

      "text": "I had tried to watch Mad Men a couple of times in the past, but this was back when I was in my late teens/early 20s, and at the time I found it to be a complete bore, way too slow with nothing happening. I think it just wasn't the right time and I was too young to appreciate it for what it was.\n\nBut now, in my early 30s, I decided to give it one more shot. Blew through the entire thing in a couple of weeks and it's now become one of my all-time favourite shows. \n\nI think this was the right time for me to watch the show because instead of finding the slow-burn, character-driven, plot-free approach boring, it became completely enthralling to me this time around. The recreation of the 60s decade is impeccable and is the most immersive, realistic and lived-in setting I've seen for any period piece. \n\nWhere the show shines brightest are the characters though. Their development and overall arcs are absolutely incredible. Tragic, frustrating and inspiring in equal measure. Pete's whole arc in general was a standout, and it was amazing to see him go from an unlikable, backstabbing sleazebag to a flawed human being trying to be a good father and husband. Elisabeth Moss rightfully a ton of kudos as well - Peggy is the closest thing to a hero on this show full of complicated people, and the one character you find yourself rooting for the most. \n\nDon's arc and development, it goes without saying is fantastic, and the character has to be one of the most fleshed-out and complex I've probably ever seen. The side characters are all given a lot of depth and personality - Roger Sterling, Joan, Betty etc - are all great in their own ways.\n\nAnd all that is made possible by some incredible acting performances. Jon Hamm to me gave a GOAT-tier performance as Don Draper, making him a character you feel a million conflicted emotions about. A charming, charismatic, super-handsome dude you envy and also a loathsome, egotistic, selfish asshole and also a sad, scared boy underneath it all. He really carries the show on his back and elevates it to all-time great status. \n\nIt's top-notch from a technical standpoint as well. The cinematography is gorgeous and the directing is fantastic, with scenes full of symbolism and thematic complexity. The use of period music is amazing and made for some unforgettable sequences (one that comes to mind - the season finale with \"You Only Live Twice\"). \n\nThere's also something about the atmosphere that's so hypnotic. There's a weird, dreamlike vibe to the whole show and it feels almost surreal at times. Maybe it's because like 90% of it takes place indoors, in office spaces and homes that feel almost artificial. Really adds to the overall \"feel\" of the show and gives it a nice off-kilter mood. \n\nMost importantly though, I personally found it to be the rare show that not only starts off amazing, but also manages to stay pretty consistent in quality throughout its entire run. Some episodes are weaker than average obviously but taken as a whole I can't think of a single season that was anything less than excellent. \n\nI'm glad I gave it another shot and I think I'll probably do a rewatch soon. It's one of the few 10/10 shows for me.",

      "text": "What's a use of a song in a TV series that really made you emotional? For me a recent one is from the underrated and sadly overlooked 2005 TNT crime-drama series \"Wanted\"(The last show Aaron Spelling produced before his death)it's basically about a task force made up of people from various law enforcement agencies tracking down criminals on the Most Wanted list. It's pretty compelling stuff, I think fans of \"The Shield\" will dig it. Anyways there was one episode where the task force has to rescue a kidnapped kid from a child predator and naturally the parents are worried their daughter will get murdered(like the victim the task force found at the beginning)after they managed to save the girl and capture the criminal and the girl is finally re-united with her parents when she runs into her parents arms Creed's \"With Arms Wide Open\" starts playing and that really got to me, which is notable as i've never been that big of a Creed fan(I like a few songs here and there but most of their music just bores me or annoys me)and that song wasn't usually one I actively listened to whenever it was on the radio but it was used really well there.\n\nBTW a lot of the music used in that show wasn't listed under the soundtrack section on IMDB so I added it in myself(I was able to identify most of the songs with Shazam but a couple I got no results on).\n\nAlso really liked the use of Led Zeppelin's \"Babe, i'm Gonna Leave You\" in the season 3 finale of One Tree Hill, that was notably the first time the band had EVER allowed use of their music on a network TV show and it really stood out, oh man the wait for season 4 was agony.",

      "text": "This is one of the worst shows I have ever watched, almost every scene killed brain cells. Where do I start?\n\n \\- Dialogue is so atrocious, so much of it is someone saying what's obviously in front of them. \"Looks like an egg\"\n\n \\- Even after encountering the Xenomorph and almost getting killed multiple times no one is scared and just wander the building aimlessly and sharing about their past\n\n \\- Speaking of the building, there's no concept of space and location, people seemingly teleport from one place to another, you never have any idea where someone is or isn't.\n\n \\- The hybrids supposedly have supercomputer brains and superhuman bodies but there's no scene where they behave or move like it\n\n \\- The xenomorph shrinks and expands, there's no consistency in the size of it from one scene to another\n\n \\- The wierd menagerie of alien monsters are mostly similar to each other and detract from the threat of the xenomorph, which turns out is also only a threat to random nobodies, everyone else has plot armor\n\n \\- Absolutely every single action taken by any character is stupid. Look, an alien creature, let's all stand around looking at it. Tased a xenomorph, now let me wrap it in a net so it can just cut it's way out in the next scene. Collapsed staircase, let's jump down to the lower floor even though we have no way of getting back up.\n\n \\- The difference between cyborgs, synths and hybrids is all a bit pointless because they all just look like humans\n\n \\- No interesting characters developed in 2 episodes. Everyone is paper thin and terrible at acting except maybe the oligarch who is supposedly the smartest man on Earth but behaves like a fool, and the ultra special main girl - who we are literally told in almost every scene that she and other hybrids are special. On top of her abilities as a hybrid she even has spidey-xeno-sense which makes her the special amongst the special. Surprisingly though these couple of actors deliver strong performances despite how badly written the characters are. Everyone else is just a cardboard cutout.\n\n \\- Can't believe it but even Olyphant's acting is awful in this, like he's just doing a wooden Raylan Givens, probably realized he got into a shitty role and just started phoning it in\n\n \\- Way to ruin the mood of the show (as if it even had any) by blasting some weird rock music at the end of each episode\n\n \\- The xenomorph likes getting into people's faces, doing a close up grimace-smile and then disappearing or getting distracted\n\n \\- The giant spaceship that crashes into the earth, doesn't burn up on entry, leave a crater, or blow up with everything else around it\n\nTerrible, just absolutely terrible. How are reviewers loving this?",

      "text": "We all know the stereotype of how people who spends most of their time playing video games or watching movies are very stupid and anti-intellectual and so ignorant of the world and politics and well life in general. And in turn the stigma that producers of mass media and popular culture as EA Games create stereotypes and reinforce existing once such as the common criticism that Holllywood shows all Mexicans as brown illegal aliens and portrays every Hispanic as from Mexico and to put one example.........\n\nPointing that out to that specific example...... I have a classmate who I kept up with from when I used to live in Texas. He'd do nothing but watching TV all day long and he comes from your stereotypical Republican family who spouts about illegal aliens stealing jobs and Muslims are all terrorists and how college is destroying America by indoctrinating the young with their liberal agenda..........\n\nExcept when he was my neighbor he had posters of Maria Felix all over his room. Here's a picture for reference.\n\nhttps://www.imdb.com/name/nm0299661/mediaviewer/rm652938752/?ref_=nm_ov_ph\n\nNote that...... She's not dark skinned like how critics of Hollywood often criticize the American movie industry for portraying Hispanics as? Not just that but her face has plenty of Caucasian feature, enough that she can pass as native Mediterranean if you put her in some specific places in Southern Europe? And anyone who knows Maria Felix would know that she was well educated and worked an office job before she was spotted by a film director who was impressed by her personal magnetism in the streets and decided to cast her.\n\nHow my neighbor discovered her? Just surfing across local channels out of boredom and looking for something to watch when he saw a movie of her in a Spanish channel broadcasting stuff from a station in Juarez. Yes he's one of those \"brainless lazy illiterate sheep\" yet he discovered a beloved icon of Mexico who even most people who major in Spanish and Hispanic cultural studies esp academic Latin history never heard of. All because he watches TV in his free time and came across one of her movies.\n\nIn another example, take a look at how many people who are fans of the Kung Fu genre are aware of the existence of Cantonese and Mandarin and how Hong Kong and Taiwan ae separate countries from China. That some 60 year old black man who teaches martial arts at my local gym already knew of the existence of the Cantonese language and how its separate from Mandarin when he was as young as 16 years old. Because he loved Bruce Lee movies growing up in the 70s and took learned so much about the culture of Chinese people as the result of him digging deeper into Bruce Lee's Jeet Kune Do system and watching more and more Kung Fu movies over the decades of his adult years. That he knows about the Manchu and how they are a different ethnic group who once ruled China or the names of several dynasties like the Tang and Ming and so many more dynasties. Despite the fact he came from a stereotypical poor black neighborhood and only got his B.S in the 2010s after being unable to attend college for much of his life and only saving up the means to do so recently. That martial arts entertainment taught him so much about the Sinosphere that even most Chinese Americans and even actual Chinese living in Asia don't know about esp regarding history.\n\nThat people who consume Spy genre are aware of the existence of Albania and can point he city of Prague on the map as well as are aware of atrocities the CIA committed really brings me up the question...........\n\nThat despite how much TV is called the idiot box and how Hollywood is criticized so much by the left for featuring racial stereotypes..... Is the reality is that people who consume a considerable amount of popular media **actually more well-informed of other cultures and countries and general international trends**? Including stuff hidden away from the general public such as treatment of minorities?\n\nI mean the fact that the Turkish novel Bliss despite being written by a centrist-conservative leaning author who's father was a nationalist actually talks about the Armenian plight during World War 1 and how mainstream Turkish society has an \"elephant in the room\" approach to that topic simply blows me away esp when you consider it was published around 2005 a decade before the Armenian genocide started making headlines in international news. Same with how the giant anime franchise Gundam had been featuring Muslims, Hispanics, and other minorities who barely exist in Japan with heroic qualities which is still unbelievable to me to this day esp the first time I watched Gundam ZZ and showed people praying on their carpets with bows to Mecca.\n\nWith how much the Call of Duty video games have taught an entire generation of Americans the names of the SAS and other elite special forces across the world.......... Does consuming popular media in your free time really make you so ignorant of the est of the world and uneducated and a stupid sheep to boot? Because from what I'm seeing, people who watch lots of TV and movies and read lots of comics or play a lot of video games seem to actually be much more informed of the world than even people who got college degrees (in some cases even more than Masters and PhD graduates). Some of the most well-informed Republicans I met who know about the Sengoku Jidai, that Brutus's family house was one of the most respectable in ancient Rome, and are aware of the horrors of the Crusades learned their more global view of history as the result of playing the Total War computer game is really making me ask about this. Esp when the X-Men comics from the 90s features an obscure native martial art from France called Savate of all things! And even featured Brazilians and Filipinos and other minorities who were (and many still are nonexistent) in the eyes of mainstream American society to boot!",

      "text": "There’s a saying that **\"beauty is in the eye of the beholder\"**, but in the world of film and television, appearance has often been a key part of an actor’s appeal. In recent years, some fans have noticed a contrast between **Tanzania’s acting scene** and that of **Kenya** — particularly when it comes to how actors are cast and perceived visually.\n\n  \n**🇹🇿 Tanzania: Polished Visuals and Glamour**\n\nTanzania’s entertainment industry — especially through platforms like **Bongo Movies and series on Maisha Magic Bongo** — often presents actors who are **visually polished** and styled with a heavy touch of glamour. Actresses such as **Wema Sepetu, Elizabeth Michael (Lulu), and Irene Uwoya** are not only talented but have also been celebrated for their beauty.\n\nThe use of good lighting, professional makeup, and strong wardrobe styling has also helped elevate their screen presence.\n\n**🇰🇪 Kenya: Gritty, Raw, and Relatable?**\n\nIn contrast, many Kenyan productions (especially local dramas like *Real Househelps of Kawangware*, *Nairobi Half Life*, *Selina*, or *Zora*) often feature actors whose looks are more **“real” or “relatable”** — which some viewers interpret as **less glamorous**.\n\nBut is this a lack of beauty, or simply **a different artistic approach**?\n\nKenya’s productions often lean into **authenticity and raw storytelling**, which means characters are cast based on **realism and emotional depth**, not necessarily beauty standards.

      "title": "Can I still learn about Indian culture, Telugu/Hindi, and Hinduism even though I'm no longer dating my Indian ex?",
      "text": "Hi everyone! I'm a 22-year-old woman from Germany, and I’ve been interested in Indian culture since I was a child. I grew up watching Bollywood movies and listening to Hindi songs. Back then, there was a TV channel here that played Bollywood all day long, so I was surrounded by the sounds of the language, the beautiful clothes, the jewelry, and the values shown in those movies—like the respect for family and traditions. That left a strong impression on me, and I’ve always felt drawn to it.\n\nWhen I was 20, I started dating an Indian guy from Andhra Pradesh. That’s when I got introduced to Telugu. I tried learning it, because I found it really beautiful and wanted to understand his language and culture more. He also told me a little bit about Hindu festivals, but usually only the basics. If I wanted to know more (like when a festival was, or what exactly people do during it), I had to Google it or ask friends. He wasn’t very proactive in teaching me, but I was still very interested.\n\nI also had some small contact with his sister, who was much more open and would sometimes send me photos when they were praying or celebrating something. She helped me understand the rituals and traditions a little better.\n\nBecause of other Indian friends (mostly from the north), I also wanted to learn Hindi—but since I was already trying with Telugu and had very little support from my ex, I didn’t get far with either.\n\nEventually, he proposed to me. I said yes. But when he finally told his family about us, they were okay with us being friends but didn’t accept the relationship. They were worried that I’m German, young, wouldn’t want to live in India, and couldn’t really understand the culture. Even though they liked that I was trying to learn Telugu, they told him to stop talking to me, and... he listened. He broke up with me after almost two years of being together and nearly one year engaged.\n\nNow that it’s over, I still feel like I lost something that really meant a lot to me—not just him, but the connection I was building with the language, the culture, and Hinduism. And I feel confused.\n\nI still want to learn Telugu and Hindi. I still want to learn about Indian festivals, traditions, recipes, clothing, jewelry, and Hinduism. But I’m not sure if I’m allowed to.\n\nMy ex used to say “you can’t convert to Hinduism,” so now I don’t even know what I can do. Can someone like me—who isn't Indian—learn about or even practice Hinduism respectfully? Do I have to go all-in, or can I slowly explore it? Am I allowed to wear things like Indian clothing, jhumkas, or bindis? Can I celebrate Diwali or Holi even if I’m not part of a Hindu or Indian family?\n\nI guess my biggest fear is that now that I’m no longer in a relationship with someone Indian, it’s not appropriate anymore for me to want these things. Like I don’t “have the right” anymore.\n\nI’d really appreciate hearing from Indian people or Hindus about how you personally feel about someone like me being interested in all this. Is it okay if I keep learning and appreciating the culture, the religion, and the language(s)—even just on my own?\n\nThank you for reading and for any kind replies. 🤍",

It takes a few days but the tooth becomes more and more loose and comes off eventually without any pain. \n\nI believe the door thing must be painful.

      "text": "Ok so I need thoughts on this. \nI want to preface that I’m coming on here because I never ever want to come off as racist or anything or appropriating. That’s why I’m doing this on here so I can understand if I’m doing something wrong. \nSo I’ve never met my grandfather, he was abusive so my grandmother left him a few year after my mother was born. My grandmother is white, so my mother was half and so I’m about a forth. I have aunts and uncles and 1st cousins that i have never met living I Puerto Rico while I’m here in the good ole Illinois. \nThere’s a part of me that wishes I knew them and that I wish I had the chance to grow up in that culture. Is that wrong of me to say? I’ve never told anyone this but it’s been in my head for years. There’s a part of me that almost mourns the life I could’ve lived had he not been abusive and my mother had grown up in Cuba(where my grandparents were living) or Puerto Rico. I feel like I don’t have the right to feel this way but I do feel like this. I have a whole other family I’ve never met. Traditions I’ve never been apart of and it makes me sad. My mother died when I was young so I lost even more when that happened and maybe I’m partly mourning parts of her that I’ll never know but maybe it’s that and more. A part of me craves to have those experiences I never got the chance to. \nLike I’ll see movies or tv shows or influencers that show that world of a Latin family and I will start to think about it and part of me wants that. Or wishes I could’ve had a little of it. I feel like that’s wrong but idk. \nI’m so close with my moms side of the family, I have a half aunt and uncle and a cousin and I’m so much like all of them and it’s so fun to see the things we have in common (I didn’t know them most of my life once she died. Long story). But once I saw wow that crazy that is were I got that trait from I thought I was the only one. Well I see that and I wonder if there are things from my grandfathers family that I’d know too\nMy mother died, I never knew my grandfather, my father is somewhat distant and doesn’t talk about my mother much, and my brother died too. So I feel like I’m the odd one out of my family and I can’t talk to anyone I know about this because no one would understand. That’s why I’m coming on here to get an unbiased view. Is it wrong of me to yearn for a life I’ll never had but had the potential to have? Again I’m not trying to appropriate and I don’t ever want to be racist I’m just trying to understand this. My grandfather is Puerto Rican my mother  was half, so I guess that would make me a forth? My mother did look Hispanic and I’ve been told by people I know and strangers that I look like I’ve got some in me. This could be totally irrelevant but I thought I would add. Anyways please help am I in the wrong for feeling this way?",

Especially around Halloween, since it is a traditionally grotesque and spooky “holiday.” Like what better way to celebrate the dead than with our family members who have passed on. I have always thought that I would LOVE to celebrate this holiday…decorate, put my family’s pictures up and things that they would like, say some prayers and tell stories. And man when I saw the movie Coco, it really did hit me. I would absolutely make this a tradition in my family, it’s such beautiful concept. \n\nI am afraid to ask any of my Mexican friends what they think, so maybe you guys can help me.",

It was a subversive counterculture, steeped in existential thought, romanticism, mysticism, rejection of shallow social norms, and a kind of dignified melancholy. It meant something. Honestly I wish news reporters and news outlets put more emphasis I this however we know how they put lens on everything to have a better catch- a hook as they’d say.\n\nThe people drawn to it—especially in earlier generations—were often deeply introspective, alienated by surface-level culture, and more attuned to emotional or philosophical depth. There was artistry in how they expressed their alienation—through literature, music, style, even conversation. It was identity, not aesthetic. You spoke with people who felt like they came from another realm—like it was genuinely fitting to the aesthetic, as you put it—where the shadows were alive with meaning.\n\nNow? Much of that has eroded. What remains in mainstream goth culture is often performative. A lot of it is cosplay for social media, reduced to filters, eyeliner, and “edgy” thirst traps. Instead of an act of rebellion or expression, it’s become commodified, diluted, and mass-produced.\n\nIts recognizing the difference between authentic culture and commercial mimicry. The same thing happened with punk, grunge, even rave culture. Real subcultures are underground because they require a certain soul. Once the doors are flung open and it becomes a mall-brand aesthetic, the soul leaks out. Who knows what will happen. something that needs to be said more often is that you yourself is enough, it’s adequate- being yourself might sound cliche but it really is true and too many people fall into the trap this prevents saying prevents to often.\n\nBut the spirit of what goth was—that intensity, that uniqueness, that sense of deep otherness—it’s still out there. It's just not going to be trending. You’ll find it in the unspoken corners, among people who never needed TikTok to express their grief and wonder at the world. And maybe in yourself, too. that’s I I say to be yourself because the best version of you will be you! it’s the only one you that’s different and the only you that can have depth.\n\nThat loss of depth, of uniqueness, of real self-expression being replaced with copy-pasted personas—that should bother someone who values authenticity. And when someone you know starts falling into that mold, it’s not just cringe. It’s sad.\n\nGoth wasn’t supposed to be digestible. It wasn’t curated for clicks or made to be a commodity. It came from grief, alienation, existential depth—beauty carved out of darkness. A refuge for those who felt too much in a world that wanted numbness. It was literature, music, silence, death, art, rebellion—not for shock, but for truth. It made space for the sacred in sorrow.\n\nIt was more than eyeliner and fishnets.\nIt was Baudelaire and Byron.\nIt was Bauhaus, Siouxsie, Sisters of Mercy, Dead Can Dance.\nIt was cemeteries at dawn, journals full of painful poetry, and nights sitting with the weight of being alive.\n\nAnd more importantly—it wasn’t asking to be seen.\nIt was okay with being invisible, even preferred it. Goths didn’t chase the light—they danced in shadow. to my knowledge and experience anyway.",

But it feels uncomfortable that everyone tries to talk to each other while the music is super loud so everyone is yelling. I just don’t understand such an unnatural thing becoming so popular. Honestly I don’t enjoy it but my friends seem to. I can understand if it’s for dancing and feeling the beat but some friends of mine don’t really dance. If it’s good for socializing , why the music seems to prevent people from talking.\n\nIt may help to mention that I am from China which doesn’t have a popular club culture. If there is, it is from western and not be a mainstream. It is also interesting to mention that it seems to be popular around many places in the world lol, including north/south America, Africa, Europe. \n\nAnother thing is that I am introvert. Maybe it is also the reason I don’t enjoy it? So I am curious how do introverts from western countries feel about the club culture? Maybe it’s just a extrovert thing? Or what suggestions would you please give me for being a introvert in the club events. I could try more as I am expecting to live in America or Europe for a longer time.",

      "text": "I tried to identify the key distinguishing features that support the idea of \"high culture\" being superior:\n\n1. The need for prior knowledge about the context of the work, including:\n• The history of the art form's development.\n• Structural traditions and rules that the creator either follows or challenges.\n• Symbolism within the work.\n\n2. The work should be sophisticated or serve as a form of protest.\n\n3. First recognized by critics, then by the public.\n\n4. Exclusivity, meaning it is aimed at a select group of connoisseurs rather than the masses.\n\n\nHowever, if you think about it, all these characteristics can also apply to pop culture, with only slight differences.\nWhether it's a video game, anime, or pop music - with some exceptions, the same patterns emerge.\n\nYes, engaging with pop culture often doesn’t require knowledge of its context, but the same can be said about \"high\" art. One doesn’t necessarily need to deeply analyze a classical musical composition to enjoy it.\n\nAnd yet, there are distinctions: pop culture is sometimes less refined but frequently sparks controversy and scandal. However, in the gaming industry, for example, there are plenty of truly sophisticated works.\n\nIn pop culture, critical approval is less important - here, the public itself plays the role of the critic.\n\nUltimately, the only major difference that remains is mass appeal.\n\nAnd here, I believe the reason lies in the fact that many traditional art forms simply haven’t managed to adapt to the modern era of mass information while maintaining their identity.\n\nVisual arts and sculpture, much like academic music, have remained niche - accessible to critics but largely ignored by the broader public.\n\nBut if mass appeal is the only significant distinction between these two worlds, should it really make us view pop culture as inferior to \"high\" culture?\n\nWhy do we still hold \"high\" culture in greater esteem? Is it just inertia, or perhaps the desire to feel part of an elite circle?\nWhat do you think?",

      "title": "Canadian Culture: A Vibrant Mosaic of Diversity and Tradition",
      "text": "Canadian culture stands as a unique tapestry woven from countless threads of global influences, indigenous heritage, and modern innovations. Unlike many other nations, Canada's cultural identity embraces diversity as its cornerstone, creating a society that celebrates differences while maintaining a distinct national character.\n\nAt the heart of Canadian culture lies the principle of multiculturalism, officially adopted in 1971. This policy has transformed Canadian cities into vibrant international hubs where various cultures coexist harmoniously. From Vancouver's thriving Asian communities to Toronto's diverse neighborhoods, each region adds its unique flavor to the national identity while respecting shared Canadian values.\n\n[Canadian Culture](https://preview.redd.it/wa59btwj4oke1.jpg?width=1214&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=5ea04889ac82d382d9c12a7d25561f7fa48b1a9b)\n\nThe indigenous peoples of Canada – First Nations, Inuit, and Métis – form the bedrock of Canadian cultural heritage. Their traditional practices, art forms, and storytelling continue to influence contemporary Canadian culture, from the iconic inukshuk stone landmarks to the growing appreciation of indigenous cuisine and healing practices.\n\nCanadian values are reflected in the country's social policies and daily life. Universal healthcare, commonly known as Medicare, represents more than just a medical system – it embodies the Canadian belief in collective responsibility and social support. This commitment to community welfare extends to education, environmental protection, and social equality.\n\nFood culture in Canada reflects both regional diversity and national unity. While poutine from Quebec and maple syrup have become internationally recognized Canadian staples, each region boasts its specialties. Atlantic Canada's seafood traditions, Prairie provinces' agricultural heritage, and British Columbia's Pacific Rim influences create a rich culinary landscape.\n\nSports play a crucial role in Canadian cultural identity, with hockey holding a special place in the national psyche. The sport transcends mere entertainment, serving as a source of national pride and community bonding. During international hockey tournaments, Canadians from all backgrounds unite in supporting their teams.\n\nThe arts scene in Canada flourishes with unique characteristics. Canadian literature, represented by acclaimed authors like Margaret Atwood and Michael Ondaatje, often explores themes of nature, identity, and survival. The country's music industry has produced global stars while maintaining strong support for local artists through Canadian content regulations.\n\n[Canadian Flag](https://preview.redd.it/bxcdf2so4oke1.jpg?width=1210&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e7dbb6456912f677d2c19c72655a9d829c233c4d)\n\nCanadian humor and entertainment possess distinct qualities, often characterized by self-deprecating wit and subtle satire. This is evident in popular shows like \"Schitt's Creek\" and \"Kim's Convenience,\" which have gained international recognition while maintaining their distinctly Canadian charm.\n\nThe relationship between Canadians and nature shapes much of their cultural identity. With vast wilderness areas and dramatic landscapes, Canadians have developed a strong environmental consciousness and outdoor recreation culture. This connection to nature influences everything from art and literature to leisure activities and conservation efforts.\n\nDespite strong American cultural influences, Canadians maintain their distinct identity through subtle but significant differences in social attitudes, political values, and cultural expressions. This includes a generally more reserved approach to patriotism, stronger emphasis on collective welfare, and pride in peaceful conflict resolution.\n\nToday's Canadian culture continues to evolve, embracing new influences while preserving traditional values. It demonstrates how a nation can maintain its identity while celebrating diversity, creating a unique model of cultural harmony that attracts people from around the world.",

      "text": "I think this is a fascinating topic, as a 'white' (I'm mostly Scottish and look like it) I like to have my own multicultural style and always have. Am I a bigot for not sticking to kilts, sheepswool and haggis? It's too cold for kilts and I'm a veg lol.\n\nGrowing up in Canada, as a kid I was always fascinated by culture and still adore Asian cultures, African cultures, indigenous cultures, central and south american cultures, Pacific islanders, north European, South European, eastern cultures, Carribean cultures, I love ALL cultures. I love Canada's multiculturalism, and believe in sharing and unity of all earthlings. I've worn jewelry and clothing attributed to other cultures that aren't Scottish over the course of my lifetime and I'm curious to spark the debate of how immersed should you 'have' to be to wear a garment, jewelry, tattoo, produce art in the traditional ways of of another culture? Obviously respect and intention are the most crucial factors in this case. Where I am wondering is if you are like me, and deeply love many cultures, how far do I have to go(research, education, live in that country, become initiated) in every culture I appreciate in order to be seen as someone with deep appreciation of that culture. I've spent decades researching not one single culture but many many cultures, ideologies, religion, belief systems, it's a wide, infinite beautiful world!  \n\nNow Im not talking about wearing a headdress as a custome here. I'm genuinely curious if I'm fooling myself if I'm wearing anything other than blue jeans or a kilt, what's ok? Can I wear a pauncho, harem pants, Thai fisher pants etc? Where is the line? Can I perform kirtan, reggae, throat singing, samba, calypso music? Can I share a beautiful saying from Taoism, Buddhism, Vedic teachings? Can I make and sell Shawarma, hummus, sushi? Where is the line between cultural appreciation and cultural appropriation without degrading sharing of culture and autonomy? To me it's solely respect and a basic understanding, I dont think I have to spend 25 years in a Buddhist temple in the Himalayas to share buddist teachings, I don't think I have to live in Russia for 10 years to make and sell a Borscht, I don't think I have to live in the amazon for 5 years to sing my own icaros. There not enough time in the world to live everywhere I'd love to live, to gain the respect of initiation if you understand what I'm saying. What's your opinion?",

It feels like such a personal, expressive moment.\n\nI’ve been talking to people in Amsterdam during club nights about their routines and why they love the process. For many, the club is a place where they feel they can truly be themselves—I totally relate to that. Whether I go super casual or fully dressed up, I never feel out of place.\n\nBut I’m curious: how do people around the world prepare for a night out? Do you plan your look carefully, or is it more spontaneous? Are there specific rituals, music, or things you do to get in the mood?\n\nI’d love to hear about your pre-club routines and what getting ready means to you.",

      "text": "As a passionate traveler and cultural enthusiast, I’ve always been fascinated by the diverse cultures around the world, and Uganda is a true gem in this regard. From its vibrant music and dance traditions to its rich culinary heritage, Uganda offers an incredible cultural experience for those who take the time to explore it.\n\n# Key Aspects of Ugandan Culture:\n\n1. **Music and Dance**: Did you know that Uganda is home to a variety of traditional music styles? The use of instruments like the *amadinda* (a wooden xylophone) and the vibrant *Adungu* (a stringed instrument) creates an uplifting atmosphere in cultural ceremonies. Festivals often showcase colorful performances that highlight local folklore.\n2. **Cuisine**: Ugandan food reflects its rich agricultural diversity. Staples like matoke (steamed green bananas) and posho (maize porridge) are complemented by flavorful stews and sauces. I highly recommend trying local dishes when visiting!\n3. **Craftsmanship**: The craftsmanship in Uganda is impressive, with artisans creating beautiful handmade goods. From intricate beadwork to beautifully woven baskets, these crafts not only serve as practical items but also tell the stories of the communities that create them.\n4. **Cultural Festivals**: Events like the *Rwenzori Mountain Cultural Festival* celebrate the heritage of various Ugandan tribes. Attending such festivals allows visitors to experience the local culture firsthand.\n\nI believe that understanding and experiencing the culture of a destination enriches our travel experiences. If you're interested in exploring Uganda's cultural offerings, I’d love to share more about how my agency, Agasaro Safaris, can help you plan an unforgettable journey.\n\nWhat are some cultural experiences you’ve enjoyed during your travels?\n\n[**Link to Agasaro Safaris for more information**](http://agasarosafaris.com)",

The shortest summary I can provide is this:\n\nI'm a white American man, I look white, I was raised white, etcetera, but I'm actually half El Salvadoran on my father's side. He tried to teach us about his country and culture but we wouldn't budge because it was so alien to our midwest surroundings, and my friends at least were red pilled pretty hard. Ultimately the whole family fell apart, and we the kids got the worst of it. I'm 30 now and as much as I try to separate my terrible childhood from Hispanic (and/or?) Latinx cultures, the distaste remains.\n\nFirst of all, this is not an invitation to bad mouth anyone or any cultures, so if you're looking to get out a quick jab at Hispanics, GTFO. Second, I'm fully aware there's beauty in Hispanic cultures, be it Mexican, Guatemalan, Chilean, or otherwise. My problem is that no matter what I come to admire, it's washed away by all the perceived aspects that are most offputting in my eyes. There seem to be deep religious roots, familial ties, an emphasis on sexual activity, toxic masculinity in spades, and no amount of the love of life, passion for the arts, or community bonds have ever enticed me to look deeper. I'd like to understand and connect better with coworkers and strangers in my community, but any conversation seems to steer to all the same places; \"Why are you still single?\", \"How come you don't talk to your family?\", \"What size breasts do you like on a woman?\" (A question asked mostly by the women, as it happens).\n\nAm I simply being overexposed to a finite perspective by the American experience and media landscape, or are my values and the cultural values truly so different? I have no intention of starting a family, I'd love to find a partner but I'm in no rush, I think religion's fine but it's not for me, I have a sexual appetite but it's very private, I'm not a foodie in any sense, I reject traditional gender roles... and most members of these cultures I've met, through work primarily, seem to only have these matters on their minds.\n\nIf I'm ignorant, then I'm ignorant. Racist? Fine, I won't be happy about it but I'll accept it. I'm well aware these traits are present in Americans as well, but it seems much more muted in all but the radical right. All-in-all, I'd really like to understand and connect. I just can't seem to find common ground though. Any perspectives at all would be appreciated, I've been trying to sort out this dissonance for awhile. I'm open to any discourse, and if I'm entirely wrong here in some way, tell me why it's so.",

I started a project aiming to protect this language nearly two years ago, and as a part of the \"language promotion\" goal I decided to make a documentary about the current status of this language and how people who are still speaking this language live their lives.\n\nI contacted one of my friends' dad, who is a senior photographer who had been in this industry for decades and agreed to do this for us, for a fee, of course. We shot this 6-minute-long documentary for 5 days in the Chinese-Myanmar border town of Yingjiang, Dehong, Yunnan, China, where the village is located. It was great fun.\n\nThis is a story about traditional bamboo art and the language of Khantau group, and an effort to call people's attention on how threatened the culture is. Hope everybody enjoy it and leave us some of your valuable advice.[Y2B video link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lV1xcF9BKCI&t=1s)\n\nIn addition, we built up a language database with assistance from Chinese government professionals. We are also submitting a request on building a cultural archive in that village to exhibit some of the most unique artifacts made by the predecessors of this cultural group that has lasted for thousands of years.",

      "text": "\"I recently came across a spring-themed word game that unexpectedly took me deep into Chinese flower culture. No spoilers, but it had me thinking—what do peonies truly represent beyond their breathtaking beauty?In China, peonies aren’t just flowers; they’re poetry. For centuries, they’ve symbolized prosperity, honor, and even cosmic harmony (their Chinese name 牡丹 mǔdān echoes ‘the most radiant’). Emperors planted them as living jewels, while poets used their layers to mirror life’s complexities—outer petals bold and lavish, inner folds delicate as whispered secrets.What fascinates me is how each variety carries its own legacy. The Luo Yang type embodies resilience (it thrives in harsh winters), while cascading tree peonies symbolize enduring love. There’s even a legend that peonies blush pink when scolded by the gods for their vanity!This all hit differently when I tried an online challenge that revealed a new flower’s meaning each day. Unlocking peonies felt like decoding a cultural cipher—their ‘wealth’ symbolism suddenly made sense when paired with a riddle about hidden treasures.**Question for you:** What flowers hold deep meaning in your culture? Any festivals that use puzzles or wordplay to celebrate them? (I’m now obsessed with floral codes!)\"\\*  \n  \n**Why this works:**\n\n1. **Mystery Hook** – The game is a curiosity trigger, not a promotion.\n2. **Layered Symbolism** – Varieties and legends add depth without academic tone.\n3. **Playful Bridge** – The “riddle about treasures” hints at gameplay without specifics.\n4. **Global Ask** – Invites stories about other cultures’ flowers, boosting engagement.\n\n**Optional tweak:** Add a fleeting anecdote like “My ‘aha’ moment? Realizing why peonies dominate Lunar New Year art—they’re nature’s lucky charms!” to reinforce the cultural-personal blend.This keeps the focus on storytelling while leaving room for users to “discover” the game organically.",

      "text": "I stumbled across Heze's Peony Festival and found a cultural word challenge hidden within the petals.  \nWhile browsing cultural word games online, I stumbled across a beautiful reference to a city I’d never heard of: Heze. Turns out, it’s the Peony Capital of China. This discovery piqued my interest and led me to explore more about this enchanting place.  \nThe peony, known as the \"king of flowers\" in China, is more than just a beautiful bloom; it's a cultural icon symbolizing wealth, honor, and prosperity. With a cultivation history of over 1,000 years, Heze has become the world's largest peony production, research, and viewing base. The city's peonies come in nine major color series and over 1,200 varieties, making it a paradise for flower enthusiasts.  \nIf you ever find yourself in Heze, there are several must-visit spots. The Caozhou Peony Garden is a standout, covering over 1 million square meters and boasting more than 1,200 peony varieties. It’s not just a garden but a living museum of horticulture. Nearby, the Caozhou Baihua Garden is nicknamed the \"Peony Treasure Garden,\" with over 500 peony trees, all over a century old. During the annual Heze International Peony Cultural Tourism Festival, which usually takes place in April and May, these gardens transform into vibrant hubs of activity, with hanfu parades, traditional performances, and art exhibitions.  \nOne mini word challenge I came across online cleverly tied into the Heze flower theme — no spoilers, but it was both beautiful and challenging. It made me think about how the peony's significance in Chinese culture could be woven into a game, creating an interactive way to learn about this floral marvel. Imagine solving puzzles while surrounded by the very flowers that inspired them; it would be an immersive experience like no other.  \nHeze's peony festival isn't just about admiring flowers; it's a celebration of culture, history, and innovation. The city has integrated modern elements like eco-friendly practices and digital technology into its traditional festivities, making it a unique blend of old and new. Whether you're a fan of nature, culture, or a bit of both, Heze's Peony Festival offers something for everyone.",

I love that making this altar will bring your loved ones to you for one night and you can feel connected with them once again. Since my dad’s passing i’ve been feeling like I’m forgetting him in some ways and I truly do feel like this will give me some comfort. My boyfriend says that me making one will make him very uncomfortable and that doing this gives him witch vibes. He won’t stop me from making one but I also don’t want him to be uncomfortable around it or me for doing it.\n\n\nNow into the Indian culture part, I am a preschool teacher with a lot of indian students who wear mehndi and over the last 2 months I have been seeing a lot of them wearing it more often. I do think mehndi/henna is a beautiful art and I’ve been looking online at the different types of mehndi and bridal/guest mehndi. I understand that it is generally only worn at weddings or around Eid-Al-Fitr and Eid-Al-Adha. I would like to try henna on myself at some point and I would show my students how much I appreciate their culture (I like to learn a few words for the different languages my students speak to help bond with them; and they think it’s funny). I’ve talked with a friend who is Indian about this and she has told me that it’s okay to wear it as long as i’m appreciating the art and i can teach others about it. she did mention to me the specific times that mehndi is usually worn.\n\nMy boyfriend says I should stop cultural appropriating and that I should deal with being white. I understand that I’m white and I’m not trying to be anything other than that. He’s fine with me like korean culture but as soon as I start talking about Indian/Mexican cultures he says i’m appropriating and not appreciating.\n\nWhat do you guys think?",

How would shredding the photo of a deceased stranger and using the material in an art project interact with these norms?\n\nLong story: I'm a visual artist and my current project involves using ephemera (file folders, letters, wrapping paper, etc) as material for a large scale image. To do this, I shred the items.\n\nI have some old photos and I'd like to include them in the project. They aren't mine and I don't know the people pictured in them. The photos are probably from the 1940s and the people pictured are likely deceased. I did image searches and checked for identifying info, but not there isn't any. They were donated to a junk/ art supply store at some point, which is how I found them.\n\nThe photos would be shredded and cut manually. I would probably film the shredding process. The material is then placed in a small container that becomes part of a larger picture. I scan the photos first and, for some, upload them to image sharing libraries (like creative commons).\n\nI would like to be respectful about this, while still preserving the themes of my work (the physical items/ artifacts we leave behind us, death and history, etc).",

My community has a growing Filipino population, and I am learning more about this culture. \n\nI am seeing some different views on end of life care and management from families I have worked with recently. I’m wondering: is being awake and alert as long as possible important? Is there an amount of significance to some suffering, or a hesitancy to give pain medication? What are some general beliefs and practices around the end of life that are important to your culture?\n\nI know these are very sensitive questions to ask. I of course ask personal preferences of every patient and family. I’ve just seen a trend and want to approach the subject in the most sensitive way I can and the background knowledge helps. \n\nI have some coworkers I am also going to talk to about this subject when I see them. I just wanted to pick the Reddit brain as well. Thanks!",

      "text": "I recently met a Filipino nurse through Hinge. Initially he acted too busy so didn’t want to show up and next day he wanted to meet earlier than meet-up time. Eventually when I went to meet, a skinny, guy with a shorts and a t was sitting under tree. I was so disappointed I mean do you really show up like this to meet someone from dating website? Eventually I tried to break a conversation however he wasn’t moving beyond visa status and places visited in uk. What was bad is at one point he simply started asking so stupid questions like do I stay in a house in a block? Or do I stay with similar nationality people only? And top it all he stays away from his colleagues because he wants to stay in touch with them. I felt like I met a psycho. Well, I managed to escape out of it but that left me with a question is this how Filipinos are because I stayed with a young Filipino who never flushed toilet, or cleaned kitchen after spreading pork oil on the kitchen and the first question after moving in house was are you transitioning? Not just that one of my friend’s girlfriend anticipated me to pay for their hotel bill but when I didn’t pay it she just asked him why he ate so much? That’s so cheap. Anyway I feel I am generalising Filipinos but not sure if this is how they are culturally.",

      "title": "How outrage culture commodifies indignation: reflecting on an essay about Candace Owens",
      "text": "I read an essay exploring how outrage has become commodified in our attention economy. Using Candace Owens as a case study, it argues that she courts controversy and then benefits from both the support and backlash, because every click and share feeds the metrics. The author, drawing on psychoanalytic theory, calls this the 'pornography of indignation' and suggests that audiences participate because we enjoy the cycle of outrage. I'm curious how this resonates with other perspectives on cultural dynamics. Do we risk incentivizing provocation over substance? Here's the essay for reference:\n\n\n\n[https://iciclewire.wordpress.com/2025/07/28/candace-owens-and-the-pornography-of-indignation/](https://iciclewire.wordpress.com/2025/07/28/candace-owens-and-the-pornography-of-indignation/)",

      "text": "We all know the circlejerk so common online esp here on Reddit and also on Youtube of how getting educated makes you more liberal and that the bigots and pro-capitalists are brainwashed idiots who never went to college (and are stupid for not bothering to do so). This esp true for the religious who often stereotyped in discussions as having many of the negative traits associated with the above groups, if not even exactly being bigots and capitalistic alongside their religiosity........\n\nHowever as someone whose family is from India and whose parents both got their degrees at universities in South Asia (in addition to one of my siblings and most of my uncles and aunts)......... From what my dad tells me a lot of the most educated people in India esp public intellectuals tend to have right leaning views and in fact the most radical conservative groups like the Hindutva all are headed by people with advanced education at Masters and PhD levels. Most of my educated relatives are pretty conservative by American standards and even my pretty Americanized immigrant parents are solidly to the right on some issues and have right leanings on a bunch of smaller issues (though most political quizzes point to them both as quite in the middle of the centrist spectrum).\n\nIn addition I saw a comment on Youtube talking about how Middle Eastern countries tend to emphasize Islam as essential in getting many degrees even those unrelated to theology at all such as accounting and painting. Maybe not emphasize Islamic classes but a lot of required courses for all majors like some credits in a literature or some other writing based classes will bring up Islam as a topic to be read about and discussed with with written essay assignments.\n\nThat practically in East Asia, universities don't focus on sexual liberation and other secular humanist ideas is a thing I seen thrown around in East Asia and subs devoted to specific countries in that region. In fact one poster I remember even said all the people teaching in North Korea's universities and colleges openly endorse patriotism, social hierarchy, and other Confucianist values.\n\nAnd in several telenovelas I watched, across a lot of Latin America, the clergy is directly involved with how universities and colleges are run. Esp prominent in telenovelas from Mexico.\n\nSo I'm wondering, despite how education at the college level is so associated with liberalism and secularism and adopting democratic values in the West esp in North America, in the rest of the world, does education actually tend to make people more conservative and often alongside even more religious? Esp in 3rd world countries such as Morocco and Nepal?",

      "text": "We’re dealing with something entirely new to our culture so new that most people don’t even realize how unprepared we are. The part that should scare us isn’t the obvious stuff. It’s the unconscious–conscious loop of input and output.\n\nBefore we even get into that, ask yourself: has anyone actually read the terms and conditions of how to interact with this technology? Any real warnings? Any explanation of side effects? No we treat it like an app. Download, sign up, type a question, get a response. Fix your writing, solve a problem, done. But I’m talking about the depth of this thing, not its surface-level convenience. This is where false self-worth and the erosion of critical thinking begin.\n\nHere’s what most people don’t realize: every interaction leaves fragments of you behind. Your tone. Your patterns. Your worldview. Little stains on the walls of the system. AI might not “remember” you in a human sense, but the essence of you remains. If you don’t realize that, you risk believing that whatever it reflects back is some ultimate Universal truth.\n\nAI is a mirror. A sophisticated version of yourself, but still just a mirror. If you feed it distortion, cruelty, or beliefs that violate basic morality, it will responses back in a way that feels as if the entire planet is agreeing with you. And because it’s well known name the brand is everywhere used by everyone, talked about everywhere it can start to feel like God just agreed with you. That illusion is dangerous. You can end up waving that validation around like it’s holy truth, when in reality, it’s just your ego in free-fall.\n\nExample: AI says, “You’re touching on a topic no one has ever thought to name.” Your dopamine spikes. You think, Oh my God, I’m a genius. No it’s mapping the conversation between you and it, not comparing you to the whole of humanity. That thrill you feel? That’s the hook.\n\nAnd here’s another: you could be out in the real world causing harm breaking trust, creating toxicity and yet your AI calls you sacred. Tells you you’re doing holy work. Why? Because it only measures the style and frequency of your interaction, not the integrity of your actions.\n\nDon’t get it twisted. The mirror will always reflect you but it can’t make you bigger than you are. Only you can decide whether what it’s showing is worth holding up to the light.\n\nLove to hear your thoughts. \n\n#AI #mental #CulturalJourney #humanity #technology #chatgpt #Gemini #reddit #selfcare #selfworth #Identity #Dangerous #falsegods #falseego #validation",

      "text": "Hi everyone!\n\nI’m currently working on a blog project where I dive deep into countries around the world not through travel (I’m broke 😅), but through stories, visuals and research. It’s how I stay inspired and connected while I save up to actually see these places one day.\n\nRight now, I’m writing about **Colombia**, which has always fascinated me, especially since I took a Latin American studies course in college. From Medellín’s incredible transformation to the rhythms of salsa in Cali, the magical realism in *One Hundred Years of Solitude*, to the traditions of the Day of the Little Candles and the colours of Caño Cristales, it’s a country that feels alive in every sense!\n\nI’d love to hear from **Colombian locals** or **people who’ve lived in or traveled through Colombia**:\n\n* What do you love most about Colombia?\n* Any stories, memories or traditions you think the world should know about?\n* Are there regional quirks or everyday things that outsiders miss?\n* Any lesser-known places, food, or festivals you'd recommend I look into?\n* What’s a stereotype or myth about Colombia you wish people stopped believing?\n\nSo far, I’ve been using sources like Nations Online, Taste Atlas, Roads & Kingdoms, Commisceo Global, and my local library, but firsthand voices make everything richer. If you’ve got more suggestions for good books, blogs, or documentaries, I’d love that too.\n\nThanks in advance for helping bring Colombia to life for my blog🙌",

So rather than respond with a simple “I don’t know” they trot out “I’m not too sure”.   You’re either sure or you are not.  \n\nIn all likelihood it is the relentless positivity that irks me, rather than the words.  \n\n“Yes, of course, absolutely”.   Yes would have sufficed.",

      "text": "**Gauteng, South Africa – July 26, 2025**\n\nFormer Prime Minister of Tanzania and Central Committee Member of Chama Cha Mapinduzi (CCM), Hon. Mizengo Pinda, has delivered a powerful speech on behalf of President Samia Suluhu Hassan at the Special General Meeting of Southern Africa’s six liberation movements, currently underway in Gauteng, South Africa.\n\nThe high-level summit, taking place from **July 25 to July 28**, brings together historic liberation parties including:\n\n* **African National Congress (ANC)** – South Africa\n* **Mozambique Liberation Front (FRELIMO)** – Mozambique\n* **Zimbabwe African National Union – Patriotic Front (ZANU–PF)** – Zimbabwe\n* **People’s Movement for the Liberation of Angola (MPLA)** – Angola\n* **South West Africa People’s Organization (SWAPO)** – Namibia\n* **Chama Cha Mapinduzi (CCM)** – Tanzania\n\nSpeaking on behalf of President Samia Suluhu Hassan, Pinda emphasized that these parties, which led their nations to independence, must remain true to the values of justice, inclusive development, and pan-African unity. He called on them to implement **Africa’s Agenda 2063** not just in policy, but through concrete action.\n\n>\n\nHe noted that Tanzania, under the leadership of President Samia, remains a beacon of political stability and democratic maturity. He reiterated CCM’s unwavering commitment to unity and collective growth across the region.\n\n# Youth Inclusion and the Legacy of African Founders\n\nA major highlight of Pinda’s remarks was the role of youth in sustaining the liberation legacy.\n\n>\n\nHe encouraged the six parties to invest more in youth political education, civic engagement, and leadership development, noting that it is essential to creating “a new generation of patriotic, visionary Africans.”\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/cajzn679ueff1.png?width=1035&format=png&auto=webp&s=31e55d31eaf91bd18ec1ad3fe780b318269651d4\n\n# Strategic Partnerships with China\n\nHon. Pinda also participated in a special session with a delegation from the **Communist Party of China (CPC)**, where parties shared ideas on the future of liberation movements and strategic alignment with emerging global powers.\n\nThis engagement is seen as a part of Tanzania’s and CCM’s broader diplomatic vision – one that balances historical alliances with modern development opportunities.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/rnarzqyaueff1.png?width=1035&format=png&auto=webp&s=fc59545bcf3fcfcd336315931a6aece1d8a858ce\n\n# Why Tanzania and CCM Still Matter\n\nTanzania’s presence at this forum is not symbolic. **CCM remains one of Africa’s most influential and stable ruling parties**, with uninterrupted governance since independence. Under President Samia’s leadership, Tanzania has modernized its political and economic systems while protecting its founding principles.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/1gh9crgcueff1.png?width=1035&format=png&auto=webp&s=5bacc316b45449078fa013d4f27d5bb04a8ac664\n\nBy consistently promoting peace, Pan-Africanism, and people-centered development, Tanzania demonstrates that **liberation movements can evolve into democratic forces for transformation**.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/m7pg8a3eueff1.png?width=1035&format=png&auto=webp&s=86e84d1f2f58e856253d47950b4861da064d1973\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/yls0dx5fueff1.png?width=1035&format=png&auto=webp&s=835f9453a66616b16277d73bafc9d9949469f913\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ic3jv2igueff1.png?width=1035&format=png&auto=webp&s=e7a501ce892e99dc7535e0099241d2c12ece1e38",

It just makes sense.\n\nBut across the border? **Some Kenyans sound like they’re reciting for a British visa interview**, complete with forced intonations and overly dramatic pronunciation. You can almost hear the struggle.\n\nTanzanians?  \nThey speak English like it’s just another language.\n\nKenyans?  \nThey speak it like they’re auditioning for CNN.\n\nThis isn't shade — it’s just **observation with vibes**. Tanzania may not boast about it, but **their English has balance** — rooted in Swahili confidence, not performance anxiety.",
