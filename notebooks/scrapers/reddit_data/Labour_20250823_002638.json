      "text": "just accepted the job offer of my dreams. It was great, paid $38/hr full benefits! The work is a combination of physical and technical, and the cherry on the top was it was good MORAL work. I would have been working with private landowners to plant trees on their property, giving them timber harvesting power in the future plus fortifying the American timber trade instead of outsourcing for wood. Not to mention improving the local environment. \n\nThe thing is I'd be working with a non-profit and my position is funded by federal grants. \n\nMy job acceptance almost feel through with one executive order but I got lucky until Elon fucking MUSK commandeered the treasury payment system so there are effectively no resources to hire me. He took my job. \n\nIt's fucking heartbreaking. In 2 years I could have paid off my student loans and had a down payment for a house if I had saved like mad. Now I'm stuck making $20,000 a year living paycheck to paycheck. And I don't think anybody understands what an opportunity like this is for some poor kid who grew up in a rotten trailer in Appalachia to have had. Fuck.",

      "text": "Whether it’s recruiters, hiring managers, family, or friends, so many people have no real idea what’s happening in today’s job market. The majority of adults are employed, and many of them have been working continuously for 15 or 20 years. As a result, they still view the job market as it was when they last had to navigate it. Their perspective hasn't been shaken by sudden job loss, so they often make tone-deaf or ignorant comments about job searching. That’s the only way I can make sense of the nonsense I’ve encountered.\n\nI find it genuinely hilarious when recruiters and hiring managers act confused about gaps on a resume. I once had a recruiter ask if the gap on my resume was spent job hunting, and then questioned why it took so long. There seems to be this widespread belief that people leave jobs willy-nilly just to go backpacking through Europe or to sit around doing nothing. Realistically, we can barely afford basic living WITH a job so what makes anyone think we can afford to quit and take on even more expensive adventures?\n\nThen there are the everyday folks who say the most facepalm-worthy things, like:\n\n* “If you don’t like your job, just quit.”\n* “People just don’t want to work anymore.”\n* “Maybe your resume needs fixing.”\n* “You have to get out there and network...”\n\nComments like these almost always come from people who are completely out of touch with the current job landscape. They speak from a place of comfort, not experience. And until they’re forced to face the job market themselves, they’ll keep giving advice that’s as unhelpful as it is oblivious.",

      "text": "I applied for a job at a small mom-and-pop store, went in for an interview, and started training. I didn’t officially get the job yet, but the training was meant to see if I’d be a good fit. Training went good, there wasn’t an issue or anything, I made one mistake with change but it was immediately fixed by the person training me. She reassured me it was ok and everyone makes a mistake once and while. So I felt ok about the situation. After completing the training (they didn’t pay me for training yet) a week went by without any response from them. So, I called to check if there were any updates because, regardless of whether I got the job, I was supposed to be paid for my training.\n\nThey told me to come in for my first official shift. When I arrived, the owner was there, referred to me as a new hire, and they gave me a uniform. Naturally, I assumed I had the job. While the owner was there, he mentioned that he might need me the next day but would call to confirm, and that he wanted me to come in on Thursday. The shift goes fine, the was a bit crazy because it was Valentine’s Day, and what they sell is very popular on valentines days. So there was a long line and a lot of chaos, but I think I did pretty good for it being my first day and having to deal with that many customers. I’m not saying I didn’t make a mistake I did drop something but other than that everything was ok. Plus they put me in the back for most of the shift anyway. There was a point where I fell after I mopped the floor, (after closing) not my proudest moment but I’m being transparent here. So that day I go home and I’m feeling good about my day. \n\nSo, Thursday comes, and I show up at the usual time, only to be told there was a “mix-up.” As I stood there, they called the owner, and I noticed another girl coming out who was supposed to be training. Then, I got on the phone with the owner himself, and he told me they had decided not to go with me.\n\nSo, there I was, standing there in uniform, surrounded by a bunch of other employees, completely blindsided. They paid me for the days I had worked, and I left. It was so bad that even the manager was apologizing, saying she couldn’t believe he had done that.\n\nIt wasn’t even about not getting the job, I can handle rejection. But the way he handled it, having me come in just to be publicly let go like that, was completely humiliating. Like the way they all stared at me, just thinking about it makes me want to cry a little. I felt like I was just on display for everyone to look at in that moment. \n\nEdit: here are a few things I said in the comments but so you don’t have to dig through to find out. The floors were very slippery like before I mopped, them being wet made it worse. And also they were definitely trying to fill in permanent spots because 2 girls quit before I got there. One of them quiting because the owner screamed/yelled at her (I’m pretty sure but don’t quote me on this) but those were literally the only mistakes I had made other than being a little slow while working but I think that’s normal when you are new a to a job.",

After about a year, I made my first hop with the experience I gained and jumped to $65k Stayed there a bit, became specialized in a field only a handful of people do in the country, proved myself, and got a raise to $80k. Still felt like I was being underpaid based on my market value, so I hopped again—this time to $115k.\n\nEvery big income increase I’ve had has been because I changed jobs. Internal raises were always minimal, and loyalty never paid off.\n\nLooking out for your best interests isn’t selfish—it’s self-love. It’s recognizing your worth and refusing to settle for less. If a company won’t invest in you, invest in yourself and make the move. \n\n\nTL;DR:\n$45k → (hop) → $65k → $80k (raise) → (hop) → $115k.",

My monthly rent payment alone eats up nearly 80% of what I actually take home. After taxes, utilities, student loans, and transportation, there's barely anything left for food, let alone saving or any semblance of a social life.\n\nI feel like I'm playing a game where the rules changed, but no one told me. How are young professionals supposed to build a life when entry-level pay barely covers basic survival? Am I missing something, or is this just the new reality for everyone starting out?\n\nEdit \\*\\* Wasn't expecting so much feedback. I live in NYC.

But they are hiring foreign workers for cheap. There is a department of labor rule that says if you hire foreigners permanently, you need to prove no americans applied for the job.\n\nHere is how companies get around. They quietly advertise these positions in obscure random page of local paper newspapers. who looks for jobs in paper newspapers? literally noone. Newspapers gets money to print the ad and they do not post the ads in the internet. Many companies also donot adverstise these jobs in their career page, or make job searchable in the portal. Some of these companies are even reputed companies like Apple, Intel, Oracle, Uber, Microsoft, Linkedin, HCL, Palo Alto Networks etc. You can verify in DOL excel sheet link below. Look for \"RECR\\_OCC\\_EMP\\_WEBSITE\\_FROM\" column.\n\nThere are so many real openings that are hidden. **so, if you are hunting for new job, donot just apply from linkedin or indeed. Try going to libraries, find the newspapers job ads and apply to those jobs.** If you apply companies will have to consider you as candidate. It will give you a better chance. Even if they donot hire you, if enough US people apply they wont be able to hire foreigner.\n\nsome are listed in SundayNewsPaperJobs reddit channel. also [jobs.now](http://jobs.now) \n\nGood luck with your job hunt. You are equally qualified and willing to work hard for better future. Don't give up Please. We have been hunted, Lets start hunting!\n\nHere is the data source of this information.  \n[https://www.dol.gov/agencies/eta/foreign-labor/performance](https://www.dol.gov/agencies/eta/foreign-labor/performance)\n\n[https://www.dol.gov/sites/dolgov/files/ETA/oflc/pdfs/PERM\\_Disclosure\\_Data\\_FY2025\\_Q2\\_new\\_form.xlsx](https://www.dol.gov/sites/dolgov/files/ETA/oflc/pdfs/PERM_Disclosure_Data_FY2025_Q2_new_form.xlsx)\n\n[https://x.com/JobsNowPR/status/1952790284754141654/photo/1](https://x.com/JobsNowPR/status/1952790284754141654/photo/1)\n\nPlease note that this post is not against anyone. With storm of layoffs coming in few months due to AI jobcuts and economic slowdown, this is a reasonable approach to find job.\n\nWill this ever come in the news?",

She has a bachelor's in education and a master's in science education. \n\nTo be blunt, she is desperate to get out. She is now looking for retail/fast food positions and STILL cannot get hired. \n\nShe has used resume services. I've looked at her resume and applications. So have her parents, my parents, our friends, her parents friends, etc. Her applications and resumes are solid. She has over a dozen different resumes for different types of jobs. \n\nShe got furious at me when I suggested leaving one or more of her degrees off of her resume but has long since removed them depending on the job. \n\nShe has applied to jobs in every sector.  From Ed tech, education, admin, other teaching gigs, to insurance of all varieties, administrative assistant, receptionist... EVERYTHING. \n\nShe has applied to over 1500(!) jobs in the past 1.5 years. Of those, she has had exactly ONE interview. They wanted her but we couldn't afford the pay cut (this is no longer an issue). There were others, but those turned out to be scams such as MLM or similar. \n\nAs I mentioned, she is now applying and being rejected for retail positions, and fast food. She is depressed, miserable, and hopeless. She feels that she will never escape the classroom and I am running out of ways to encourage her to keep going. \n\nWHAT THE FUCK DO WE DO, REDDIT????? WHATS THE ANSWER? She will literally be a Starbucks barista. NO ONE WANTS HER. This woman, who has the work ethic of a sled dog, is apparently unemployable. \n\nHow can we fix this? What do we do? \n\nPlease help. Please.",

Serious workers everywhere feel like the system is stacked against them.\n\nHere’s some of the worst things I’ve noticed: too many job postings aren’t even real. Some are fake, some are scammers, and some are companies that post roles they never actually plan to hire for. And for the ones that are legit, here’s what I’m hearing in the market, people are being dragged through an average of 3–4 interviews, sometimes more, just to be ghosted or told “we went another direction.”\n\nHere’s what I’ve read: studies show over 40% of job seekers believe they’ve applied to fake or misleading postings in the last year. And the average time-to-hire keeps stretching out, even while wages stay flat.\n\nAnd here’s what it feels like up close: the endless applications that never get a reply. The hoops. The ghosting. The discouragement. I’ve seen it wear down people I know personally. It’s not just wallets getting emptied, it’s spirits getting broken.\n\nSo let me ask you again: what’s been the hardest part of navigating today’s job market for you personally?",

I used to think I’d find a place to grow and stay for years but that’s never how it works out.\n\nEvery time I leave a job, I end up with better pay and less stress. But when I stay, all I get is a tiny raise and more work. It’s like loyalty doesn’t matter anymore.\n\nEven finding a new job is weird now they ask for too much and pay too little. Entry-level jobs want years of experience and degrees and still offer like $18 an hour.",

      "title": "In China unemployed young adults are paying companies to pretend they have a job.",
      "text": "In China, a surprising and growing trend has emerged where unemployed young adults are paying companies to pretend they have a job by spending time in fake offices. These individuals pay a daily fee—usually around 30 to 50 yuan (approximately $4.20 to $7)—to sit in office spaces that look genuine, complete with desks, computers, internet, and sometimes meeting rooms and snacks. This phenomenon is mainly driven by China’s high youth unemployment rate, which remains stubbornly over 14%.\n\nPeople participating in this trend often spend typical work hours in these offices, pretending to be employees. They chat with others in the same situation, search for jobs, pursue personal projects, or simply maintain the routine of going to work to avoid the stigma and pressure from family and society of being jobless. Some even use these spaces to provide \"proof\" of employment to their families.\n\nOne example is Shui Zhou, a 30-year-old whose food business failed. He pays about 30 yuan a day to access a fake office run by a company called Pretend To Work in Dongguan. He shares the experience with other participants, feeling like part of a team despite the lack of real jobs. These setups exist in many major Chinese cities such as Shenzhen, Shanghai, Wuhan, Chengdu, and Kunming.\n\nExperts suggest the trend reflects deeper economic and social challenges and might even help job seekers maintain social connections and mental well-being compared to isolation at home. Meanwhile, the youth job market in China remains tough, and some young adults adopt this \"pretend work\" option as a temporary solution amid uncertain career prospects.\n\nIn short, young people in China are literally paying to \"pretend to work\" as a social and psychological coping mechanism amidst high unemployment and economic difficulties.\n\n[Source](https://fortune.com/2025/08/12/china-gen-z-unemployment-fake-work-offices-careers-jobs-lying-flat-rat-people/?utm_source=perplexity)",

I’m still a young professional and don’t have a ton of work experience, but I’ve never encountered anything like this before. \n\nI decided not to put a 2 week notice at my current job because it’s not standard practice in my industry. Generally, if you put a 2 week notice it’s accepted immediately. But again, this is standard practice in my field. I did not think it would be the end of the world to resign effective immediately, but I guess the CEO of my current company had a problem with it so he CALLED, a member of leadership at my new job to tell them that I didn’t put in a notice. \n\nMy new job called to get more information and I said it’s true, I didn’t put in a 2 week notice but this was also per senior teammate’s advise. I asked if there would be a problem with my start date and they said no but wanted to know what happened. They also asked if I was okay, so it seems like they sense how unhinged my previous workplace is. \n\nI was an overall good employee and I don’t think he would have anything else to say about me, but has anyone dealt with something like this before? I’m nervous about my current job offer reconsidering or possibly pulling the job offer. I’m thinking about seeking legal advise but I don’t know where to start. \n \nI also never signed a noncompete or anything like that. \n\nEDIT: I started my new job 2 days ago. Everything is fine thankfully and my new job agrees the CEO calling them was kind of pathetic.",

Decent salary, unlimited PTO (we all know what that really means lol), flexible hours, work from literally anywhere\nOption B: Required in-office 4 days/week. Similar salary, standard benefits, structured 9-5 schedule, and a 35-minute commute each way.\n\nI chose Option B and people around me think I'm crazy\n\nHere's my reasoning though - I've been working for home for over 2 years now and slowly turned an introvert. My apartment became this work/life prison where I never fully felt \"off\" because my desk was just always there\nAt the office, I actually weirdly like the separation. When I leave, work stays there. Plus the team vibes seem genuinely cool and my brain needs that social interaction.\n\nThe financial math makes some people question me like yes, I'm spending a bit more on gas and lunch occasionally. I'm not in a bad financial state whatsoever because the job itself pays well (both options had the same wage) and I also hit a pretty big win on jackpotcity so I went with the option that suited me the most\n\nAm I in the wrong here?

Teachers, drivers, nurses, developers, magicians, leaves on trees?? At this point it feels like just being alive is oversaturated.\n\nBut here’s what I realized. The people who are getting jobs aren’t posting here. The ones who are stuck (understandably) are the ones who are venting. And that ends up dominating the whole vibe. So if you’re trying to break in, it can feel like you’re walking into a hopeless desert. But that’s not the full picture.\n\nPeople get hired every single day. That’s a fact.\n\nI used to let all the negativity on here get to me too. But honestly, I had to stop treating Reddit as some global barometer of what’s possible. It’s not. It’s just a slice of the internet where people go to vent. And that’s fine. But don’t let it convince you that nothing is working anywhere for anyone. That’s just not true.\n\nIf you’re feeling discouraged I get it. But keep going. You’re probably doing better than you think.\n\nEDIT: Looking at the comments, I think this thread really proves the point I was making - most people on Reddit will share their negative experiences because they’re frustrated, which makes it feel like things are worse than they actually are, while there are few success stories shared. But just because the loudest voices are struggling doesn’t mean no one is succeeding. Jobs still exist, opportunities are still out there. So don’t let the general negativity here talk you out of chasing your goals. Reddit isn’t the full picture. Keep going.",

Basically, I go into a bunch of stores to check the products that the company I work for owns. \n\nHere's the thing. If you Google merchandising vendor, you'll get a breakdown of all the stuff a merchandising vendor is supposed to do, like setting up displays, inventory management, or negotiating prices. I haven't done ANY of this. I go to the stores that I'm assigned, I sign in on my app, and I look over the tasks that I need to complete. But everything im being asked to do has already been done by the employees of the store. Is the product out? Yes. Is the product stocked? Yes. Is the product facing the correct way? Yes. Is the product labeled correctly? Yes. I even called my manager asking if there's anything else I'm supposed to be doing and he basically said, \"no\". \n\nI'm paid by the hour and for each store I visit, I'm given 1 hour to complete the tasks assigned, but since the tasks are already completed, all I do is wait around the store or in my car til the hour is up. Then I check out and head to the next location where it's the same story. My manager even specifically told me over the phone to utilize the hour however I can, so I do. By watching YouTube in my car. \n\nThis has to be up there in the easiest jobs in the world. Did I just get lucky? Though Idk if I necessarily feel lucky, I think if this job stays the way it is, I'll probably quit out of boredom. Maybe my manager is just really incompetent and I'm supposed to be doing more than what I am? Anyone else ever been a similar job situation?",

This is a dramatic drop from the 66,000 jobs added in the same period of 2024 and represents the city's slowest job growth in over two decades, excluding recessions.\nKey points from the article include:\n * Primary Cause: The slowdown is largely attributed to President Trump's economic policies, especially his \"on-again, off-again tariffs.\" These have created business uncertainty, increased costs for materials and goods, and contributed to a downturn in tourism.\n * Industry Impact: Major sectors that drive the city's economy, including finance, insurance, hospitality, and retail, are now shedding jobs. Business owners report declining revenues and have stopped hiring.\n * National Trend: The sluggish job growth is not unique to NYC. Other major cities like Los Angeles and San Francisco are also seeing job losses, and economists suggest NYC's downturn could be a \"leading indicator\" for a national slowdown.\n * Human Impact: The city's unemployment rate stands at 4.7%, higher than the state and national averages. Job seekers are facing significant challenges, leading to a 10% increase in residents seeking help from city job assistance centers.\n * Other Factors: The article also mentions the rise of artificial intelligence potentially reducing hiring in the finance sector and increased competition from states like Florida and Texas, which are actively recruiting NYC companies.",

Built it from 0 dollars sales to where we are on target to hit 3 million this year. Been experiencing huge growth month over month. \n\nAnnual Income the business now generates surpasses my current job’s compensation. \n\nI could in theory still work at my current position but feel if I do my business growth trajectory will eventually plateau if I do not focus more on the business. \n\nWife wants me to wait till end of next year when we will be fully mortgage free but I feel that might slow the momentum being built. Last month we booked over 10k sales a day and I worked 100 hours every week. At my age I don’t know how much I can keep that up without having a health event. \n\nI believe if I can continue with my business plan and scale properly, in 2 years I can hit over 10 million in sales at which time I will implement phase two of my business plan to 15x that in 5 years. \n\nI normally would just leave the position and hope it opens a position up or three with the company. But with the push to AI I’m sure the company will just take the savings and call it a day. \n\nI still have a ton of RSU options with the company and I was originally hoping for an event this year that would trigger them to allow me to sell them off. \n\nSince I been with this company I have seen it grow 15x and love the fact that millions of people use the software I had a major part in creating. \n\nI’m leaning to following my wife’s advice and give it another 16+ months. There might be slower growth with my company but I can try to rebuild any lost momentum after that. \n\nWe will have the stability of zero debt. And open up the possibility of cashing out the option. \n\nAfter years of service feel I can probably continue for 1.5 without much stress, \n\nAny thoughts / advice is appreciated.",

I get to both interviews and they kind of imply that I'm not qualified when I have five years of comparable experience.

      "text": "I’m stuck on this decision and could use some honest advice.\n\nRight now I make $90k (not including bonuses) working from home 4 days a week fully remote (100%). I usually only put in 2 to 3 hours a day, not an exaggeration I’d say maybe 10 hours a week total realistically. I can work anytime I wanted as long as I finish my tasks. The benefits are amazing (my current employer even pays for the whole premium), and the job security is rock solid. I genuinely believe I could stay in this role until I retire if I wanted to. I am currently in a state income tax free state (LCOL) if that counts and honestly I am in love with the city I am in. After getting hired, I immediately moved to this city.\n\nBecause of the flexibility, I actually have time for hobbies and passion projects. I finally feel like I have work-life balance. The PTO and FTO are essentially unlimited as long as I don’t abuse it. Last year, I took a 3-week vacation without any issues, my manager even said “next year I’d take a whole month vacation if I were you😂😂😂” after coming back to work. It’s honestly hard to overstate how comfortable this job is.\n\nBut the thing is I think I’m starting to feel stuck and maybe even a little depressed. Being home all the time, not feeling challenged, and knowing there’s no real room for growth has been weighing on me. I feel like I could be doing more or becoming more, but this job isn’t pushing me at all. Plus I have all the time in the world for job hunting..\n\nNow I’ve been offered an in-person job in Kansas with a $130k salary. But I’m pretty sure it’s a full 40-hour-a-week role, and I’m scared of losing the freedom I have now. No more midday walks, nap, or hobby time. No more spontaneous travel. And I don’t know what the vacation policy will be like.\n\nSo I’m torn. Do I take the money and hope the structure and challenge are worth it? Or stay in this very comfortable role and try to find growth in other parts of life?\n\nHonestly, what would you do if you were in my case?",

The thing is, I work in HR so I can see all salaries, bonuses etc… so I’m obviously annoyed.\n\nI’m on round 3 in the interview process so the a new company. They said they want to move forward as fast as possible because they are excited for me as a potential candidate. More money, senior title, and less administrative work.

      "text": "I keep hearing, “The job market is fine, there are plenty of openings.”\nBut from what I see as a business owner, that’s not the full story.\n\nHere’s the reality:\n\n1. Degree Inflation is Out of Control\nJobs that used to require a high school diploma or an associate’s degree are now asking for a bachelor’s, sometimes even a master’s, for low-paying, entry-level positions.\nExample: admin jobs, customer service supervisors, or coordinator roles requiring a 4-year degree… for $35–40K a year.\n\n2. The $30–40K Degree Paradox\nThe serious, educated workers who are ready to work are fighting over these jobs. They’re overqualified, underpaid, and burned out before they even get hired.\n\n3. Upper Management Roles Are Disappearing\nHigher-paying leadership jobs aren’t opening up.\n\t•\tThe people in them are staying put because they don’t want to risk moving in an unstable market.\n\t•\tIf someone does leave, many companies don’t replace them, they just dump the workload on others to “save costs.”\n\n4. “Plenty of Jobs” Isn’t the Same as “Plenty of Career Paths”\nThe open jobs often don’t lead anywhere, no promotions, no growth, no stability. Meanwhile, people with advanced degrees are stuck working for less than they’re worth, just to have something.\n\n5. The Gig Work Alternative\nAnd here’s another layer: even if gig work pays less, people take it because it offers freedom, no rigid hours, no corporate politics, no degree requirements. Traditional employers are losing the talent war not to each other, but to flexibility itself.\n\nSo yes, jobs are open, but serious workers are fighting for scraps at the entry level while real career opportunities are bottlenecked at the top. Until that changes, the job market will keep feeling “broken” no matter what the stats say.",

      "title": "I live next door to my employer's office - they've started showing up at my apartment unannounced",
      "text": "I've lived here for a couple of years now.\n\nAbout a year ago my employer announced they were relocating their office in my city, and by pure dumb luck it turned out they'd picked the same building my apartment is located in. The north side of the building is offices and the south side is apartments. It's a big international business and the old office was well established for many years before I started working for them. I couldn't have seen this coming.\n\nObviously my employer has my address on record. Recently I've noticed my boss and coworkers showing up outside my front door outside of working hours without warning me. \n\nFor example, the other week one of the in-house IT guys buzzed my apartment and asked me to come downstairs to give him my faulty work headset so he could swap it for a new one. I was shocked and kind of horrified because I'd finished my shift more than an hour beforehand and was in my pyjamas taking a nap and chilling and drinking with my roomie. I was scrutinized for making the IT guy wait for me, since I had to get dressed into work appropriate clothing to come downstairs and meet him. He was standing inside my half of the building, waiting at the elevator for me to appear. I was told that since I lived so close by it was unprofessional of me to take so long to come down and meet him. (For the record I'm also disabled and in a wheelchair so it takes me a while to get ready and downstairs no matter what it's for)\n\nMaybe I'm in the wrong for this, but I don't like it. This is my home, it's my space, and just because my emoloyer moved in next door to me doesn't mean they get to invade my privacy. If they wouldn't send colleagues to knock on other employees' doors out of hours for work related business, why can they do it to me just because I'm nearby? My apartment building already gave office users access to the basement gym, which had been advertised as exclusively for residents, so now I can't even work out without seeing my boss and coworkers sweating up a storm while I'm trying to zone out and chill on the leg press. I've taken to only going to the gym after midnight to avoid them but sometimes they're still there. I don't want to be alone in the gym with my boss at 2 in the morning. They've also been given access to our gated car park, which again was previously advertised as only being for residents. Now when my carer comes over to help me out, my coworkers see me letting them inside, and now they know I have a carer helping me - thats personal information I really did not want to disclose.\n\nIm so stressed, it feels like I'm always on call even though I'm not and my privacy is nonexistent. I can't even go to the corner store on the weekends without dressing up nicely because there's a high chance my boss or coworkers are on a Saturday shift and will stop me to ask a work question. \n\nI am in the UK for the record but mostly just wanted to vent and ask if I'm crazy for reacting strongly to this.\n\nETA: with the IT guy example, it wasn't actually the IT guys fault. He was assigned to go get my equipment and was told he wasn't allowed to leave until he had my faulty headset. If I had told him I wasn't available, he would have got fucked over by his boss too. \n\nETA2: if I get any more comments going \"hurrrr op says they're in a wheelchair but 🧐 can GO TO THE GYM???\" I'm straight up blocking and ignoring you. Not only is this a dumbass rude comment to make but I've explained myself multiple times already in replies (not that I should even have to). Don't be another ableist bully, I already have enough of those at work.\n\nETA3: I can't believe I have to make this addition. It feels so fake that this happened just today. I woke up this morning to an email addressed to all the office members, saying that they now have unlimited access to the roof garden, once again previously advertised as being exclusively for residents. I can't even fucking go in my own garden without possibly seeing my boss and coworkers. That's like my one safe outside space where they CANT see me, where I go to study and eat my lunch sometimes, and now I've lost my privacy there too. It's unacceptable, I'm laughing because it's so fucked up I'll start crying if I don't choose to find this funny.",

      "text": "Our new COO has finally left his office and made his move. Up until recently, he was a mystery man who spent all his time in his private office, refusing to meet with anyone.\n\nLast week he called about ten long-term managers and supervisors to his office for a large meeting.  At the end of the meeting, he said each and every one of the managers were incompetent and had failed the company. He fired each of them.  These now-fired managers were the backbone of the company,  Long termers with advanced technical skills, a track record of success, and institutional knowledge of how things worked.\n\nTo everyone's shock, they were given no notice, warning, or severance pay. The COO told everyone who was terminated they were fired and, as a result, as per company policy, they would not receive any severance pay or unused vacation pay.  At the end of the meeting security guards arrived and escorted everyone out of the meeting.\n\nThe talk around the office is who would do the work of the departed managers?  They were all in the middle of major projects, had meetings planned with staff and customers, and had unique institutional and technical knowledge that their staff did not have.  Their staff does not know how to do their ex-manager jobs.  Think of the emails that were sent to the now-fired managers from customers, clients, consultants, and staff waiting for a reply!\n\nHave you ever seen anything like this before? It is outrageous!\n\n**\\* I only have to survive two more weeks and I can retire with a full pension. So no, I am not looking for a new job.**",

I was friends with the manager and she pointed out I was the top sales person for 8+ months (which was supposed to be kept a secret btw). In many ways I should have been offered a raise months ago. Anyway one day I found a new way of making money and arranged a meeting with the head of the company and respectfully informed him I’m putting in my two weeks. He looked so stunned. He started scrambling talking about he was thinking about offering me a raise blah blah blah but I stood my ground and said I was done. \n\nMy question is, why do bosses act so stunned that someone basically making slave wages made a decision that will be more beneficial to their life?",

      "title": "Employer offering me $4,937 severance if I waive all claims, worth it?",
      "text": "Location: Illinois, USA\n\nHey all,\n\nLooking for some outside perspective here. I’ve been with my current company since **March 6, 2025**. It’s a small manufacturing company, and I recently filed an **HR complaint** (June 10) about my manager for **racism, retaliation, and harassment**.\n\nOne example: on **May 12**, my manager made a racial “joke” toward me. HR investigated and **confirmed** it happened. They said no other racial remarks were found but admitted I was also given incorrect/confusing info during a write‑up over phone use. They “formally disciplined” him and warned him further incidents could lead to termination.\n\nAfter I complained:\n\n* My **overtime got cut**.\n* I was **reassigned** to a different department.\n* My work environment got noticeably worse.\n\nNow the company is offering me a **severance agreement**:\n\n* $4,937.80 gross (W‑2, taxed).\n* 27 hours of unused PTO.\n* Health insurance subsidy until **Aug 31**, then I pay COBRA if I want to keep it.\n* **Strings attached**:\n   * I have to waive **almost every possible legal claim** up to now, including discrimination/retaliation claims.\n   * I can’t talk about the agreement publicly.\n   * I can’t disparage the company.\n   * I can **never** work there again in any capacity.\n\nI’ve only been there **about 5 months**, so I know severance isn’t guaranteed, but the amount seems… low? Especially given the circumstances and the fact they’re asking me to give up a lot of rights.\n\nMy gut says this is more about protecting themselves than helping me. But I don’t want to walk away from money if it’s actually fair.\n\n**Questions:**\n\n* Does \\~$5k seem reasonable here, or is this lowballing?\n* Is it normal to demand a release of all claims for such a small severance?\n* If you were me, would you take it or negotiate for more?\n\nWould love to hear from people who’ve been in similar situations or who know how these agreements usually play out.",

He copied his emails to HR and a few engineers. Has anyone dealt with this? What would you do?  \n  \nFollow-up questions for the community if you faced similar situation:  \n  \n1. How would you respond to a manager’s demand while remaining compliant with your termination instructions? I replied and told him that I deleted all company files per termination notice and then he threatens that if I was unable to check in some code, he would sue me.   \n2. How to protect yourself? Since they deactivate all my access on the termination day, I had no evidence to prove anything.   \n3. What should I do now if they really send me legal letter?   \n4. Any tips on defusing this kind of escalation or negotiating a hand-off?  \n  \nThank you in advance!",

      "text": "I’ve been out of the workforce for about four years, and since December 2024, I’ve been applying for jobs. Out of 11 applications, four employees flat out told me the gap was the reason they didn’t move forward even though I applied to jobs I’ve done before and have real experience in. Three others went with people who had more experience, and the rest ghosted me.\n\nIt’s frustrating. I have a clean background, great driving record, and real skills but none of that seems to matter as soon as they see the gap. One income isn’t enough bills are piling up, and I need to get back to work. I’ve seriously considered listing a made-up job or freelance role just to make the gap look smaller like showing I worked until 2024 instead of leaving a full 4-year gap. Not trying to scam anyone, I just want a chance to get in the door. \n\nA few extra things about me:\n\nI don’t use Facebook much, it’s basically empty, I never comment or post.\n\nI don’t have a LinkedIn profile.\n\nI do have a professional website.\n\n 2  years ago created a business name and registered it in my state, something I plan to start   officially when I have the funds.\n\nI know most jobs want references, but unfortunately during that 4-year gap, I lost touch with former supervisors and coworkers.\n\nI am using incogni to remove my data, it helped when folk search my name. clean up the misleading information.\n\nSo I’m asking:\n\nwill background check will show the unemployment or the last job I had?  \n\nHas anyone been in this situation and found a way to get hired?\n\nIs it worth listing freelance or self-employment during the gap even if you didn’t have official clients?\n\nAre there job types or industries that are more forgiving about this?\n\nIf you filled a gap with something not entirely “official,” did it help or hurt you later?\n\nNot looking for judgment here. I’m just trying to survive and get back on my feet. Any advice or insight would help a lot.\n\nThanks.",

Once I receive this information, I will be able to give you an official salary offer. Please try to get this to me within 24 hours.”\n\nThis is an admin job not a teaching job, (supervisor to arts/humanities after school programming) and I deeply want it and put a lot of work into getting it, including submitting a very detailed portfolio of all the work I’ve done w students in the arts/humanities. \nThis is a dream job and I want it even at the lowest salary (62k), but I really don’t like that they asked for this.\n\nThoughts? \n\nAlso, I am not an external employee. I became a substitute teacher through them (Milwaukee Public Schools) after I applied for this job. So don’t they have access to this even if I don’t send it?",

The few that do exist (FMLA, OSHA, FLSA, Civil Rights Act), have tons of loopholes, exemptions for employers, and are easy to bypass. And when an employer violates your rights, the burden is on ***you*** to prove they did so. Which involves court and lawyer fees which most can't afford to pay.\n\nAmerica is the ***only*** country on Earth to not have mandatory paid vacations.\n\n31% of workers receive zero PTO. 51.3% of Americans receive no healthcare from their employers, despite healthcare being unaffordable and the #1 cause of bankruptcy. Unions are dying out and the current administration is actively working towards finishing them off. Said administration also axed Medicaid for tens of millions of people.\n\nUnlike most countries, you have no real job protections. You can be fired at will for any reason \\*except for your race, gender, and age. Which basically means they can't fire you for being a minority, but they can fire you for wearing green shirts instead of blue ones.\n\nBeing a worker here *sucks*.

I'm putting thought and effort into tailoring my applications and cover letters and these people don't give a flying fuck about anyone applying for the job. Like bro it's okay if you didn't choose me but then don't leave me in the dark for weeks on end waiting to see if I got rejected or not when for all I know you made the decision shortly after I applied.\n\nDoes anyone have any advice for how to get employers to notice you more, as well as how not to feel totally fucking useless and depressed during all this?

Usually, I can just slow down when I talk to avoid clutter and if I know I have to talk for long, I write down everything I will have to say and rehearse how to say them. I generally avoid unexpected interactions if possible. Throughout college and my early career (internship & research), I have never selected  \"yes, I have a disability\" or disclosed my condition, partly due to fear of rejection, but also because I never consider myself to be disabled aside from some stunted social abilities.\n\nI started working for my current biotech company for a year and a half as an engineer. Due to the nature of our work that involves clinical trials with animals (mostly rats, sometimes chimps) we are required to have regular psych eval every once in a while. Here is the thing, the psych evals that we have are just modified standard psychometric tests where we get asked questions for the shrink to fill out a form. I do fine by giving simple rehearsed answers and never mention anything that may disclose my mental conditions more than necessary.\n\nRecently, my company had a pretty big holiday party; and my dumbass got convinced to attend even though I have always turned down invitations, knowing that I would have to socialize. Despite my efforts to rehearse what to expect and what to say, after a few drinks, I started to clutter really bad when talking and at some point, when one of the HR ladies disclosed that she has ADHD, I let my guard down and also admitted that I have autism when asked. I thought nothing of it. I believe she brought it up to my supervisor and a few other colleagues of mine after that, as they now also know I have autism.\n\nI am aware of the fact that by not disclosing my autism, I may have lied on my psych eval and this can lead to legal consequences. I have always tried to maintain productivity and professionalism, but now it feels like there's a guillotine over my head when one day my team decides I am no longer fit for this job (that I really fucking like, despite how stressful it can be sometimes). \n\nThis post is more a vent than anything. I am mostly just fucking disappointed at myself for having slipped up at such a stupid party thing that I could have chosen not to go to and this may just be my anxiety talking, but I feel like I am looked at more at work now.",

Before someone could be fired, they had to go through a process with a formal oral warning, written warning, and performance improvement plan. Unless it was a case of gross misconduct.\n\nThey could not fire me without this process because I did nothing wrong, so they tried to intimidate me into quitting.  They pulled me into a conference room, and my boss, his boss, and the HR Director took turns screaming at me and calling me names and telling me everyone hated me and wanted me gone.   They demanded I quit immediately.\n\nThis was for a job that would give me a pension if I survived for another year.  If I quit, it would likely take at least a year to find another $90K job in my career field.  But who wants to stay in a place where everyone hates you! And if I stay, they would make every day more miserable.\n\n**I had talked to an attorney specializing in employment law, and he said that if I quit, I get nothing, including my pension.

      "text": "I need some help, long story short i joined a mom and pop company 3 months ago as a sales manager but decided to resign today because:\n\n- management yells profanities at staff\n- poor planning where unrelated roles and tasks just drop into our laps\n- CEO is a boomer who tried to argue with me on why i was taking a few days sick leave (i had a viral infection in my eyes that lasted 10 days, which is highly contagious and i even had a letter from the specialist but CEO still demanded i come to work or lose my job)\n- i drive 1.5 hours each way from mon to fri and frankly am just sick of it.\n\nNow the CEO and Vice wants to “interview” me tomorrow. What reasons should i use to justify me leaving? They are pretty vindictive so i dont want them to spread that “im the problem” when i have tried my best to accommodate and adapt to their ways. \n\nEdit: such amazing replies, thank you all! I feel that i should add more info (sorry for not doing it before)\n\n- i am from a country in SE Asia\n- We have rules that minimum notice period is 1 month \n- the interview tomorrow is not the exit interview, that happens on my actual last day with HR. Tomorrow’s meeting is mostly to understand why i am leaving which i find it weird to even make me go through this\n\nEdit 2, Its OVER!\n\nFirstly I want to thank everyone for sharing their thoughts and opinions, I didn't expect this to get over 1000 comments! I feel like i have to make some clarifications, so here we go\n\n1. In my country, all full time employment has a standard contract where we have to provide anywhere between 1 to 3 months notice period upon resigning and if either side breaks that clause, then salary for those months need to be paid instead. So if I were to leave immediately, I would owe 1 month's salary to the company and i'm not taking that route\n\n2. This interview is not the same as the exit itnerview that many were referring to, because that happens with HR. The CEO and Co wants to have a separate one to understand why I'm leaving \n\n3. Some of you think this story is fake because I said this mom and pop business has a HR team. I could have used the wrong term because this company has about 40 employees but is defintiely run in a mom and pop style where nothing gets done without the CEO's approval whether its accounting, marketing, development, etc. \n\nNow for the actual interview, both of them decided to shout my name across the office to \"discuss something with me\". As this is a small office, when they hear this it usually gets the rumor mills winding up because they know someone's leaving and this means me. I don't like having this kind of attention and wished they would have been more private about it but whatever i guess. \n\nOnce inside, both of them started by offering me many quality of life improvements at work like offering work from home, additional bonus, etc. . They started smirking as though i was a beggar only out for money so i told them my reason to leave was personal and i did not want to discuss further than that, and that wiped the smiles off their faces. \n\nThe whole thing ended with them wanting to pile on more stuff for me to do before i leave to make full use of me, i guess. A happy ending i would say and i felt much better going into it with everyone's advice here, so thanks again!",

These are plans neither of us can cancel, reschedule, or get refunded.

      "title": "I have been a hiring manager for 7 years at multiple companies. I see a lot of people here talking about difficulty getting hired. Recently, I have interviewed the worst candidates ever about 50 a week. Tips to get interviews and nail them. Will answer any questions in comments",
      "text": "I have been a hiring manager for 7 years, for jobs paying $14/hr all the way to 350k a year salary. \n\nRecently, I have been interviewing for a position that pays $27-$32 an hour.\n\nThese interviews have been the worst I have ever conducted. \n\nIt makes me wonder what the recruiter is filtering out and if good candidates are getting phased out before I even get to meet them. I work very closely to make sure this doesn’t happen but lately with all the “personality test” some companies have and hoops. They are getting filtered out before it even makes it to the recruiter.\n\n\nHere are my tips to get through that and tips for a good interview.\n\nTips to get your resume in front of someone.\n\n1. Now with all the filtering systems, a referral from someone working at the company is best. It will get you to a recruiter and the recruiter can save your resume from going into the abyss.\n\n2. Apply for job even if you are not qualified, it is easier to get higher paying jobs because less people apply and even then the ones that are qualified sometimes have terrible attitudes and as a hiring manager I don’t have anyone to pick from and have to wait. I am willing to take someone who doesn’t match all the criteria to a T but has a good attitude. \n\nThese jobs are usually 120k+ \n\n\n3. Instead of explaining your job in the resume make bullet points of your tasks.\n\nExample don’t say: “I stocked shelves and helped customers and tried to sell credit cards and ran cash register”\n\nInstead say “ •Managed inventory • assisted customers •upsold product add ons”\n\n4. Some jobs require a lot of different tasks and you may know how to do a lot of things. When applying tailor your resume and include the things that will make you a good fit for this job\n\nExample, if you are a server and are trying to get into a sales type position, your resume should say “informed customers of available menu items that fit their request, upsold add ons and pushed daily specials”\n\nIt shouldn’t say “took orders and ran food to tables” \n\nBecause that isn’t going to help you in the new role you are applying for so it’s better to leave it out because the computer systems that filter the resumes may dispose yours.\n\n5. If you are able to get in contact with recruiters directly that’s even better. LinkedIn is a great option, you can also find most recruiters directly that’s emails and remember most recruiters want you to get the job because that’s how they get paid. A lot of them will even give you pointers on what the hiring manager wants if you just listen to them.\n\n6. If you lie to the recruiter, remember your lie. Most recruiters I have worked with take notes and send it to the hiring manger with your profile. \n\nVery often they tell the recruiter one thing and when I ask they forget or slip up. Also recruiters and hiring managers speak a lot and these things do come up so make sure to remain consistent.\n\n7. Make sure your resume is up to date even if you fill out the correct information on your application. Most of the time when I sit down with a candidate what a recruiter hands me is the resume not the application and I don’t see the most recent or relevant experience. I always ask if it is up to date but seeing effort was put into it and it is recent can make or break when I’m stuck between 2 candidates with similar backgrounds\n\n8. If the application requires a personality test read the job description and take into account any attributes they list and make sure to pick the corresponding on the personality test that will get you through most systems. If not just think of the job and what ideal person would be.\n\nExample if you’re not talkative and extroverted but you’re applying for a sales position the ideal person would be talkative and extroverted in order to talk people into a sale. Select that.\n\nIf it’s a management position, you know that a manager needs to be strong, outgoing and persuasive. Select those.\n\nBut most job postings specify what they are looking for.\n\n9. Use the job description and company’s mission statement to tailor your resume to get through any filtering systems.\n\n10. Please apply with an appropriate email something professional. \n\nInterviews- \n\nAnything you say or do around or to a recruiter or hiring manager will be taken into account even if it is not part of the interview.\n\nExamples of reasons I have not hired people:\n\n1. Not following the instructions sent in the interview email. Example: showing up to the wrong location when the address is written clearly in the email. \n\nIt shows you do not follow directions well.\n\n\n2. Showing up early before your interview time and demanding to interviewed earlier. I have had people show up for 2:00pm interviews at 11:00am and demand to be taken in at 11:00.\n\nI will say this is usually the older crowd that does this and they think it displays they are eager for the job. Which is a red flag to begin with. \n\nIt’s also a disrespect to my time and the time I set aside for you. \n\n3. Your interview starts as soon as you are near the location or anywhere you may run into someone who works at the company. Examples a cafe nearby or on premises.\n\nBeing rude to staff: door man, receptionist, security etc. \n\nI’ve had candidates come in and yell at the receptionist because they are late, I’ve seen candidates at cafes nearby prior to the interview being rowdy/rude/combative with someone taking their order. \n\nThe last thing I want is to responsible for hiring someone combative or having to deal with them myself. \n\nVaping in the lobby, while waiting 5 minutes until your interview. If you cannot control yourself enough not to vape prior to even having the job that means you will vape on the job. \n\nCigarettes, same thing. I try to stay away from hiring smokers because they need to stop what they’re doing to go smoke all the time and it is not productive and unfair to others who do not smoke and don’t go outside every hour. \n\nRefrain from smoking at the interview.\n\n\n4. Please don’t smell bad or have very strong perfume on and please don’t smell like weed or cigarettes or anything of the sort.\n\n\nNow mistakes I see during interviews- \n\n1. Assuming who you interview with will not be who you report to if you get hired. I look young for my age so very often people think there is an interview after me and don’t ask all the questions they should or say something like “yeah I have more questions but I will ask the next person”.\n\nOr being combative/rude/condescending\n\n2. Assuming since you have done this type of job for another company it is the same and being very cocky saying things like “yeah seems easy” “I already know this, dont have anyone questions”\n\nInterviewers like people who ask questions, it lets us know that you are taking it seriously.\n\nAssuming you have the job in the bag because you have had a similar position prior. This is a new place with new people, they don’t know you and you need to put forth the effort to show why they should go with you. \n\n3. Complaining about the job before even being hired. Example: When you are told expectations saying they are unrealistic. \n\nI get this a lot depending the position I am conducting interviews for but those expectations are there to let you know from the beginning what is expected. \n\n\nOr complain about the schedule that the recruiter already went over prior to scheduling the interview.\n\n4. Being desperate/begging for the position. Saying things like “please I really need a job”\n\nAs a hiring manager, interviewing takes up a lot of time and so does training. I want to hire someone who sticks.\n\nAny time I have ever hired someone desperate they quit because they are not considering what the job actually is and instead are just focusing on “I need a job” then realize it’s not for them or they’re in over their head or it feels too entry level for them.\n\n5. Asking questions too in depth for the position. Example: if you are interviewing for a cashier position, don’t start asking what the margin on products are and how the company is planning to navigate tariffs and inflation.\n\nThese are great questions but raise a red flag when you are interviewing for an entry level position or a position that has nothing to do with that.\n\n6. Bad mouthing other employers. Big red flag especially if it’s more than one employer you are bad mouthing, because most likely the problem is you. \n\n7. Assuming your age will speak for “experience”. \n\nIf your resume says 30 years experience but I interview you and you’re stuck in business practices of 30 years ago and say things like “this is what we did before you were born”.\n\nExperience doesn’t make you good. Just because you did something for 30 years doesn’t mean you’re good at it.\n\n8. Not understanding the job. I sometimes have candidates that do not understand the position even after I explain it and this is the main reason, I pass on people.\n\nAsk questions, get clarification, be engaged. \n\n9. Do not mention any personal struggles. Example: I’m a single mom, my husband died, my mom is sick etc.\n\nNone of these help me identify if you would be a good fit for the job and feel like you are trying to guilt trip me\n\n\nThings you should do at interview-\n\n1. Interviewers are human, I am very serious but if you make me laugh or feel like you aren’t my 39th interview of the day and it’s monotonous. I am more receptive and willing to hire. Personality sells in any position no matter what it is.\n\n2. Ask questions, an interview works 2 ways get to know the company from your interviewer.\n\n3. If you have any experience related to the job not listed on your resume make sure to bring it up even if it’s just volunteer work or a hobby\n\n\n4. Ask your interviewer what would make someone a great fit for the position and tailor your answers to that.\n\n5. Ask your interviewer what they are looking for in someone to take this position.\n\nThis is your opportunity to double down and sell your self on the traits they list\n\n6. Get a feel for your interviewer or team, if it is a retail type setting observe the type of people working there and let interviewer know you will be a great fit for the team.\n\nLast thing we want is to bring conflict into our team.\n\n7. Study your interviewer.\n\nIf you are given the name of your interviewer prior to the interview look them up online. A lot of them use LinkedIn and post quotes or post what they like to see in the work place.\n\nUse that to your advantage. Mention the quote or author or recite a work style they like. \n\n\n8. When you are leaving say nice meeting with you today (insert name). \n\nIf you call someone by name they are more likely to remember you.\n\n\nThose are the best tips I got. Any questions or advice I will answer comments.\n\nI hope at least 1 person benefits from this \n\n\nEdit: if anyone lands a job after using this I would love to know, comment or pm. Thanks wish you all luck\n\n\nEdit: Another tip, if you’re having trouble getting past the systems that filter out resumes, apply at smaller locally owned companies they typically do not have those and you’re much more likely to get actual eyes on your resume. \n\nEdit: another tip best day to apply is Tuesday \n\nAlso a lot of people has been saying they can’t get picked for interviews and bad candidates get through.\n\nSurprisingly, my main issue is people do not show up for their interviews. Out of 10 scheduled usually about 4 show.",

      "title": "Finally employed after 8 years- What I Learned and worked for me",
      "text": "Ive been applying to jobs ever since graduating with an MS in engineering 8 years ago. Technically my first application ever was June 2015, but Im not counting the time until I graduated (end of 2016). I am going to share things during all this time that I hope maybe helps people, or at least offers perspective into what its been like. \n\nDisclaimer: Some things may be opinions and not facts. What worked for me may not necessarily work for others, and others certainly dont have the same background. \n\nBackground: \nI graduated with a BS degree in Chemical Engineering with a perfect 4.0 GPA, and then went to pursue an MS degree elsewhere in grad school. During my MS program, I became a generalist in air pollution, solar technologies, and heat transfer. I thought a good career path for me in industry would be as a thermal engineer or process engineer, so I set forth to apply to those positions. \n\nWhat ensued was 8 long years of checking indeed and linkedin whenever alerts came up on my email, and applying to those positions. Along with the making accounts, diversity questions, entering the same info from the resume and all. I initially started applying to thermal and process engineering positions in the bay area. \n\nApplications:\nI applied to as many jobs as I had alerts for, plus more from searches. I started off pretty narrow, with a target of BS+1-3 YOE but then after a year of no results I started applying to anything, technician, BS+0, MS+0, MS+0-2, PHD even. I even branched out of state to other states. After doing this for 8 years, I got very good at identifying key words that let me know not to bother. Tooling? Part design? Network? Next.\n\nWhat I was doing outside applying:\nI had to be productive and make money somehow so I started tutoring locally for $50/hr, then increased over 5 years to $100/hr. I primarily do science math SAT, and more. I am fortunate enough to have family to stay with the whole time. \n\nCritics:\nThere were criticisms from family, friends, and even people online when they heard I havent found a job in 8 years. My mom supported growth of my side hustle, my dad said I should just suck it up and get a job at mcdonalds. Friends kept offering solutions: maybe its your resume, have you *really* been applying to as many jobs everyday?, “if its been this long, its you, everyone I know got jobs!”  What they fail to consider is that I am a smart guy, I got the highest score in nearly all of my college courses and for some it wasnt even close to the second highest. I can surely read job descriptions and come to accurate conclusions about how the market is. It just is unfathomable to most people how someone with a perfect 4.0 in college could go unhired. \n\nInterviews, Rejections, and Opportunities:\nI had about 1 phone screen a week, 1 onsite every few months, for the first few years. Then those numbers fell- people definitely start discriminating against you for being unemployed. Either lost the job at the phone screen round (mismatch or lacking YOE) or after the onsite (they went with another experienced candidate). Having no experience or internships really hurt. Tons and tons of rejections. The most notable were out of state companies NEVER contacted me. Waste of time. I watched software engineering boom, while my field was very dry in my state. Its possible there is a lack of opportunity and too much competition at the same time. A massive double edged sword. I had many referrals from family friends into company roles but none ever led to interviews. \n\nMy resume:\nI had many different versions, a longer one, a more generic one, and a combination of the two. What I found was that tailoring the resume to positions largely did not work if I wasnt a perfect match to everything on the job description. Waste of time. What ended up landing me a position was just the combination of the longer and more generic resume. What I also think worked was removing dates of positions. There wasnt a single date on my resume in the past year and I felt like I had a lot more success (they think im a new grad probably lol). \n\nThe Mental:\nNot having work in your field is hard. Watching your friends get money in life is hard. What kept me going is just “embracing the suck”. If somebody as smart as I am ends up not having worked for as long as I have, then it points to a severe market inefficiency or forces beyond the individuals control. The availability of jobs in a lot of fields has gone down, experience requirements have gone up with more competition, salaries have gone down (I see entry level positions paying even less than 8 years ago, coupled with inflation is even worse). I personally feel all this started roughly 6-7 years ago, before the pandemic, and now its becoming more widespread and everyday conversations are being had about layoffs, the state of the economy, etc. even my friends who said everything was roses back then are talking about this now. \n\nThe job:\nAs of the end of Feb I have now been hired for an entry level engineering position matching my background. The company liked me and it really seemed they were trying to move me through the interview process. First call was with HR, he said he would forward my resume no behavioral Q, second interview was onsite, no technical Q, then job offer. No BS take home assessments or anything. I personally believe that any job with a take home assessment has a low % chance of job offer conversion, or at least that has been my experience. \n\nMy conclusions: I used to think that people with their positions must have had hard work be the main contributor to their success. But after all this, I believe luck is the main contributor. If there are many other talented people that dont get a job, then luck is the primary.  Ive also learned that it is possible for someone to go unemployed (in a traditional career) much longer than they think possible. People are saying “finally got a job after 1-2 years”, “ive been unemployed for 6 months”. Well im here to tell you it can get a LOT longer than that. \n\nTLDR:\nNo job after graduating for 8 years, worked side hustle and stayed at home until got big break entry level opportunity at 34 years old. \n\n-Resume tailoring no good for me. \n- Out of State never hit me back\n-Take home assessments no good for me. \n-Referrals did not work for me. \n-Despite trash talk from others, indeed and linkedin easyapply led to many interviews. \n-Did nothing different all these years, still got job. \n-Approach has been solid, just job availability and requirements were gatekeeping me. \n-Parents friends, and even strangers dont believe its this hard to get a job and place all the blame on the individual.",

      "text": "Just had my first interview in 7 years. I am still employed but looking for a better pay.\nI was surprised the approach they had was defensive, instead of a conversation it was an interrogation \nI felt i managed well but it was horrible. At some point the lady got visibly offended i tried to negotiate a salary. She told me “if you go buy a coke do you expect to negotiate? This makes you look bad” and I replied “if you say so. To me this looks like normal open communication “. At that point the third person present ended the interview as it was obvious it wasn’t going to work out\n\nEDIT: just some details. The recruiter mentioned the salary and asked me if i agreed before i was interviewed. I said yes. During the interview with HR (no recruiter present), i was asked what is my salary expectation. I repeated the same number recruiter told me. HR said they had a lower budget. I said i would be open to negotiating to accommodate their budget . I don’t know if negotiating was the wrong word but she didn’t like it. That’s when she made comments about how bad that looks. She asked why i felt i deserved such a high salary. I simply answered I was just adapting to what was on offer. \n\nThey actually want to move forward with me, which tells me they simply wanted to intimidate me for a lower salary \n\nEDIT 2: i asked the recruiter about the salary discrepancy. She said it was her mistake to mention the salary for someone with experience with the exact same technology . I told her i have 8 years of transferable experience. I reminded her they were looking for recent grad when she mentioned the larger salary (i am much older than that) so how come they want such specific experience from a recent grad. She said they wanted to hire me. (How odd). I declined to move forward with them. I was clearly strong-armed into accepting a below average salary and they wanted to seal the deal quickly to get cheap labor",

The 8 years I spent as a caretaker were the absolute worst years of my life. The pay was not bad, it was absolutely horrible. $8.00 per hour, no benefits, no raises, the constant abuse...I'm sorry, I just can't do anything like that again\n\n\nAlso, I'm 41, I don't see myself moving up in that position\n\n\nAnd for those giving unhelpful comments like \"your degree is useless because of AI\"  no, it's not. I just need to learn to use AI in my workflow\n\n\nAnd for the especially unhelpful person who said \"shack up with a fat chick\" that is not helpful\n\n\n+++++++++++\n\n\nI've been searching for a job since early 2024, but with no luck.

I know that in order to get a job in that I'll either need to move, or find something that's wfh. I've been told to not even try and get anything that's wfh, because the only thing available is in tech\n\n\nMy last self-employed job was for Doordash in 2023, before that it was Uber Eats from 2020 to 2021. My last \"actual\" job was for Walmart from 2016 - 2017, and before that it was as a caretaker from 2008 - 2015\n\n\nIt's not that I want to stay in retail, or fast food for the rest of my working life, but just the fact that I can't even seem to get a job in that is frustrating.\n\n\nHow screwed am I, and what should I do?

Despite that it would be possible to attend the interview since I work from home and only apply for remote positions, as long as they could call or virtual meet at my specified lunch so I'd have 45 minutes to do an interview or call they usually say will only be 30 minutes at most.\n\nThey seem to have the expectation that applicants have no other obligations or commitments and will just be sitting around waiting for their call or drop everything to be available at the arbitrary time they specify. I had an interviewer flake on calling me because I said explicitly that I was only available at specific times which were between 9 - 5 anyway. It's as if the idea of needing to schedule a call or allow people to pick time slots instead of randomly calling whenever is foreign to some people in recruiting/HR. \n\nUnless I am missing something I don't understand why people say it's easier to get a job if you have one, because the whole process from preparing a resume for each job and then the prospect of having to miss your actual job to go interview at a potential one makes it a lot easier if you are unemployed and have nothing but time and open availability.\n\nThis is a minor thing but it's frustrating and a part of how foolish it is to have almost everyone on a 9-5 schedule as part of arbitrary work culture norms (in America) instead of a sensible arrangement where everyone has staggered availability so there's always someone available at the times before or after the 9-5 the way my job does it.

      "text": "Im a long winded writer, sorry in advance. TLDR at the end. \n\nFirst off, this is all first hand, not twisted office rumors. My office is right next to the management office and i heard it as it was happening.\nSo our project manager was demoted for being shit, but because he's worked with the company for 15 years, they didn't want to get rid of him completely. Me and my friend (we will him Jake for the sake of the story) have both worked here since this location opened about 6 years ago. When we started, our PM was the lead. He couldn't actually do the job, and so \"Jake\" was hired in house (he was previously a contractor) and given half the duties of the role because his education actually fit the role. \n\nA few years later and the original PM left for another company, and our old lead was promoted out of seniority, not skill, and his half of the job was given to someone the lead snuck in that had oreviously been fired and put on a no rehire list a decade ago, claiming he was a different guy. That lasted until a few weeks ago, when our client had enough and forced our company to remove him from the role or lose the contract. \n\nThey did so, but now they have 3 people in a 2 person job, so they had to pick one to get rid of. The new PM chose \"Jake\", over the newer guy to terminate. He doesn't know his mistake yet, as he's only been here a few days. \"Jake\" had been doing most of the acting PM duties, and the client absolutely adores him. He has automated half of this job for the entire location, but all his programs will cease to function without him very soon, and no one even knows how to do the role without them any longer. It won't actually effect my job so this is going to be \"fun\" watching everything crumble around me. \n\nSo now, the guy that \"Jake \" originally replaced because of his inability, was now put back into that role, but with more than double the employees and workload to manage, and no idea what the current job entails. \n\nBut back to my main concern. He was fired at the end of shift. Told it was his last day, and he would need to have everything returned and office cleared by Friday.\n\nHe went home, and had told everyone that needed to know, including our client. Many contacts there were very eager to hear he had been fired, because that nullifies our no poaching clause in the contract, and they would be very happy to being him onboard with  them. About 6:30-7pm the new PM called him and offered to give him another position in a different system as a temporary paycheck while he finds something new, and to think about it and get back to him. \nOne of the client contacts advised against accepting another job from our company, because he would then have to then quit later when he gets any official offer, which would bring  the client poaching concern back. \nHe texted our current PM back saying thanks for the extra opportunity but no thanks. \n\nAs this entire situation happened after work hours and mostly verbally, there was no official paperwork yet. He was going to come in and gather all his paperwork and get his stuff the next day.\n\nAt some point overnight, the PM and district supervisor, have now shifted the story to \"Jake\" quitting on his own, and are refusing to give him an official notice of termination. We can only assume it's an attempt to block any benefits he is due, or just to be spiteful and block the client from hiring him. \nThe only physical evidence of any of this happening is the 1 text of him declining being rehired hours later. \n\nWhat can he do?\n\nTLDR: friend was fired, employer tried to rehire later. Now is claiming he quit instead and we assume its to deny benefits.",

      "text": "After 7 months of straight unemployment, strenuous gig work and no luck I finally got somewhere with interviews on last week and I accepted an offer today! Here are some things I’ve learned:\n\n- Absolutely nothing.\n\nI read dozens of reddit posts regarding the best ways to apply which were to go directly on the company sites. Tons of recommendations on that so I did it for a while, maybe 15-20 a day. It did not do a single thing for me. \n\nReworked my resume probably 10 times and even made it universal, dumbed it down for any job I could get anywhere. Didn’t work much either.\n\nThe most success I’ve had and the way I secured my offer was legitimately through indeed. I would spam apply to 40-50 “easily apply” jobs that fit the broad search of “customer service” in my area, remote or in person, and hoped an interview landed. There may be a lot of ghost jobs out there but indeed has legitimately given me the most response/interviews back. Anyone telling you to apply through a company site is telling you to do twice as much work to get the same chance as someone applying through indeed. I have like 50+ eternally unused workday accounts.\n\nBut overall, it’s really just luck. There’s literally not a single job out there that doesn’t have 300 people already applying to it and a few thousand more from different countries. \n\nI resonate with you all deeply and wish you nothing but secure employment and happiness in the days to come. It’s only getting worse out there so please take it easy on yourselves. One day at a time!",

      "text": "After working at this mid-sized company as a P.E. for over 4 years, last Friday (8/15) at 4:00 PM I was sent to HR and told I'd been laid off effective immediately.  I was handed a check for the first half of the month, no severance, no accrued PTO ( we switched to unlimited this year), and a paper that the company wanted me to sign that stated I had resigned, was paid all that I was due and contained a material non-compete clause.  I refused and they said that they would not provide me a reference.   As I was driving home, my now former indirect corporate engineering director called saying that he heard that I was fired as a cost cutting measure and called the company's move suicidal.  He said would write me a great recommendation letter and to give any potential employer his direct line number.\n\nSo over the weekend I update my resume and start networking.  On Monday I signed up for unemployment, moved my 401k into an IRA, and filled out the forms to be put on my wife's insurance.  Tuesday I received a call from HR saying that they wanted to hire me back as a contractor in order to finish up the work I \"failed to complete before I quit\".  I replied that I did not quit, I was fired.  The HR flunkie argued that I signed their resignation form. I replied that I had not and that they should read what I wrote, which as \"All Lies Refuse to Sign\".  After a a few moments, Mr. Flunkie says that he would need to speak with his boss and someone would get back to me later.\n\nToday I get a call from Ms HR Director saying that If I don't come back in that would be equivalent to refusing to take a job and be grounds for denying unemployment.  I replied that I never refused, and in fact, would be willing to return as a contractor as they requested.  I told her that I would email her a signable .pdf  contract by the end of business today.  So this afternoon I downloaded an appropriate consulting engineering contract, edited it appropriately, and sent it to Ms HR Director.  Within 30 min. of sending it, she calls me up and starts screaming about my pay rate which, among many other Ts&Cs, was 4.5 times my former salary.  I waited for her to run out of steam and said that I understood her position and that she was welcome to refuse.  She then hung up on me.\n\nI wonder what will happen when they discover that a consulting firm, or any other P.E., will insist on redoing all my calculations and will charge the company much more than I would cost them.\n\n  \n**Requested Update:**  I've already received calls generated from my network tree.  The're mostly worthless independent recruiters who I politely tell thanks, but no thanks.  I did, however, receive a call back from a former boss with whom I truly got along.  He had left a past, but not my last company, to go to much greener pastures.  He said that his company just approved a new position that he believes I'd be great for.  After catching up, he said he'd set up interviews next week.  Talk about good timing.",

I got an email stating I had reached a “limit” of 30 days and that any request going forward may need further consideration from HR and senior leadership. Mind you I have not requested 30 days I’m currently sitting at 19. I’m completely confused by this as I have never heard of this process and sure enough there is no mention of limits in the employee handbook only to use your PTO with discretion which I’ve done.

This practice skyrocketed after the 2008 financial crisis and has only accelerated in the wake of the 2020 global pandemic, leaving millions of job seekers chasing opportunities that simply do not exist. At the same time, large-scale layoffs dominate the headlines, further complicating the labor market.

      "text": "Internships are often sold as golden opportunities—your “foot in the door,” a “trial run” for the real world. But let’s be real: a lot of internships, especially unpaid ones, look suspiciously like free labor with a fancy title.\n\nI’ve seen friends doing full-time work without a paycheck, being told it’s “experience.” Others land internships where they *actually* learn, network, and grow—and it does lead somewhere. So which is it?\n\nIs the internship system broken—or just misused by some companies? Should unpaid internships be illegal, or are there situations where they’re worth it?\n\nAnd for those further along in your career: did your internship actually help get you where you are now? Or was it just a checkbox on your résumé?\n\nWould love to hear both horror stories and success stories. Is the internship hustle still worth it in 2025—or is it just free labor wrapped in optimism?",

      "title": "The Job Market is broken in America",
      "text": "I'm from and currently residing in the United States, so I don't know if people in other countries have different or similar experiences.\n\nThe **Job Market here is broken**. It's not that you went to college and got useless degrees, it's not that you're necessarily lazy or that you're entitled. The **job market is actually broken**.\n\nThe main way to apply now is to apply online either on a job board or a company website or both (sometimes you apply on Indeed and it sends you to the company website). I have gone places years ago expressing interest in a position for them to say **\"Go online and fill out an application.\"** It seems it's necessary because they need it to onboard you into their system (making you an official employee). **This was one of the worst things to ever happen in the market**. It gave companies so much control and the ability to screw over workers. Companies couldn't make fake jobs **(ghost jobs)** back then to collect your data or just test the market to see who would take what pay. Also, I know since the offer is much more accessible that means more people apply for the job and due to what the internet became they likely get a ton of **fake resumes** too. The Applicant Tracking System (ATS) meant to filter out any undesirable applicants could've filtered out legit candidates for the job by design. Automating the process has actually done more harm than good. **It was better back then to go in person and fill out an application while also offering your resume, so that you could be contacted**. \n\nCompanies will say you need years of experience, but that's a way to deter you from getting the job. Many *low skill jobs* long ago did not require such list of qualifications to hire you. You know how ridiculous it is when many times they hire someone who doesn't even fit the criteria or the description of the candidate they're looking for. **This means they wanted something else or those things listed it never really mattered to them**. The fact a job that didn't require a degree in the 2000's now suddenly requires a degree today shows they create barriers artificially that aren't actually necessary. This especially hurts young people who came in with no experience, but are denied the opportunity out of circumstance than actual measure of competency or being qualified. **This is why I say getting a useless college degree didn't destroy the market because regardless of it you still should be able to get a job. If you can't get a job in the industry you pursued then it should've only affected that industry particularly not necessarily everywhere else**. This **\"being overqualified\"** sounds like an excuse to not pay you more money for your certifications and abilities compared to the average person. People should think about how many teens got part time jobs working at fast food or retail back then. Those teens didn't have 10 years of experience. Companies likely understood that they will leave soon because it's a temporary job for them (which makes sense as it just got your foot in the door). Now those same jobs require much more of people and they're **automating** them too.\n\nOne problem I really want to bring up considering the conversation about H1B and Elon Musk is **outsourcing**. Companies are giving away jobs for cheaper labor and it excludes citizens. American citizens are being undercut in the market and denied the opportunity, so that the companies can go find someone internal or find cheaper labor to maximize profits. Also, they're automating the jobs, so the amount of jobs available will decrease overtime anyway. Americans are left with less opportunity and **are insulted for it by being told they're just not good enough, lazy or stupid**. I read that companies had a shortage of **\"workers\"**(I read this on a article), so we need **\"undocumented immigrants\"** to fill in for the shortage even though many people, who are citizens, are out here looking for work. It's simply gaslighting people that companies are in desperate need of workers, but you're being denied the opportunity of jobs meanwhile they're talking about how they need to outsource the jobs away to everyone else and that it's the best thing for everyone in the country. Especially when I read many American workers train their replacements without even knowing it, but are told their replacements are better than them despite having to train them.\n\n**It's clear the job market is broken and something needs to be done about it.**\nOne central theme of all of this is that companies are screwing people in multiple ways simultaneously. They effectively block you out and take away your ability to negotiate and have any bargaining power. If every job requires experience then how can you get experience and if you can't get ever get experience then how can you bargain with companies hiring? **You can't.** You're at their mercy. \n\nThat was a lot to write and I don't want to take up more of your time. I just wanted to share the conclusion I came to after reading, experiencing and then thinking about everything.\n\nIronically the best way to get a job is through personal connections. A book from 1995 **\"Getting a Job: A Study of Contacts and Careers\" by Mark Granovetter** showed through data that personal relationships were the most effective ways to secure employment. Older people (I think blue collar) secured work through personal connections. It's still the same case today even with the internet that personal connections are the best ways to secure employment 30 years later.\n\n# **(Edit)** even if the numbers of jobs increased you still wouldn't get hired. Even if those jobs were low skill jobs too. That's how broken the job market is. They'd still try to outsource it or deny you for some convoluted reason.",

      "title": "Unpopular opinion: \"Just learn a trade\" isn't good advice for young men seeking stable, future-proof careers",
      "text": "I graduated from high school in 2015. At that time, an MBA still meant something, STEM was taking off as an surefire career path for young adults, and the trades, particularly in skilled fields, were a rock-solid way to secure one's future. Computer science and software development were \\*really\\* taking off at this time, too.\n\nI was just starting college and had no idea what I wanted to do with my life, beyond what I liked talking about (history, policy) and began working on my BA in Political Science - then on to my MA right after COVID hit. I was warned this was not a particularly good career path and that I should stick to a \"hard\" science or a trade. Quite ironic, given what would happen to those fields...\n\nRoughly ten years have passed since, and the labor market has dramatically shifted.... and not necessarily in the favor of anyone trying to get going on the American Dream. An MBA is just there to check a box, most STEM fields were crushed by outsourcing, and most people are aware of the beating Computer Science and Tech fields have taken since 2022, with endless layoffs in the last 3 years.\n\nThe situation is so bad, in fact, that I am aware of numerous cases of STEM graduates with Masters in Applied Engineering or Engineering Physics being told that their degrees are too \"generalized\". They finished their degrees with 3.9X GPAs, did internships with prestigious companies or government agencies, and are now flailing around and living at home because they're being rejected from every job they apply to. My younger brother recently finished his BS in Electrical Engineering and isn't using his degree despite possessing near-savant levels of knowledge of the field, instead, he's doing B2B sales with a company that focuses on electrical engineering. My sister-in-law, working on her MS in Aerospace Engineering is crushing 80 hour weeks between interning, writing in journals, and just going to classes because she can see the writing on the wall.\n\nSo, with so many \"safe\" fields destroyed by economic upheaval, immigration, automation (or the promise of automation) and greed, what do we have left?\n\nHealthcare, trades, and the military.\n\nAnd I’m going to say something that should be obvious to anyone who took sixth-grade economics: *no field is safe* when supply explodes and demand doesn’t. Oversaturation kills opportunity. It doesn’t matter how “in demand” a field is today - it can become obsolete tomorrow, just like the others.\n\nLet's focus on the trades for a moment. Lots of flashy headlines about supposed shortages, claiming six figures for skilled tradesmen which rarely seem to pan out, but focusing just on job availability, what do you think will happen to these fields if five, ten, fifteen million underemployed young men give up on trying to find a job in their degree field and swing into the trades?\n\nWill there be enough demand for plumbers, HVAC specialists, and welders in 2030 to support ten million guys around the country all pivoting into these fields at the same time? It's possible. Will wages remain unaffected? Absolutely not.\n\nWages will collapse. That’s how markets work.\n\nThe primary incentive for going into the trades right now is the money. What happens when wages flatten in these fields due to an oversaturation of skilled workers, as has happened to the humanities, then business, then STEM, then tech?\n\nRight now in central Florida, HVAC specialists are paid an average of $22.60 an hour. This isn't six figures, and it's not even halfway there unless you're working more than eight hours or over the weekend. Wages will not keep up with inflation and the rising cost of living if, suddenly, you aren't the only contractor in town, but there are three other guys who have the exact same credentials.\n\nThe same is true of the military, to an extent. The recruiting incentives will vanish and the standards for retention and promotion will skyrocket if the economy gets bad enough and the officer corps becomes a dumping ground for unemployed men with degrees.\n\nI fear that \"Just learn a trade\" will go the way of \"just learn to code\" and \"just get a degree\" very soon and it will have a catastrophic effect on our economy and quality of life.",

I still had limitations and they couldn’t accommodate me. I’ve been lost in a dark depression. I made the mistake of making my job my identity, but I honestly thought I was going to be set for the rest of my life.\n\nI have a BA in Environmental Science. I never got a ES field job because they were too far away or temporary or paid pennies. I’ve been in Horticulture the last 11 years- specifically as a Grower- starting in seasonal positions and working my way up. I was earning ~$29/hr in my last position.\n\nI’ve been unemployed for a few months now. I’m still on disability because I can’t lift 50 lbs yet- which is what my previous position required. I’m going to continue to get stronger, but I don’t want to ruin my body for such little pay. I’m seeing entry level seasonal positions in landscaping that require you to be able to lift 75lbs and only pays $15/hr. Typically grower positions are internal hires and employees are lifers. I’d have to start at the very bottom again in a seasonal position and everything is just so physically demanding. \n\nWe live in a major US city. I don’t want to move because we just bought a house a couple years ago. We have a renovation project that’s been put on hold since my injury. There’s so much that can’t be done until that project. I also want to try for kids before it’s too late- if it’s even possible for me.\n\nI want something stable with a decent wage. I don’t want to do sales or anything commission based. I’m friendly but not THAT charismatic. I have some interest in medicine but don’t really want to incur more debt if the pay is going to be basically the same as retail.\n\nI tried for an operations position at a major horticulture company but didn’t get it. The requirements were intermediate knowledge of Excel and SAP. I know how to use Excel but don’t have any proof. Is there some certification I could get? I don’t know SAP but I told them I’m a quick study. I don’t think they bought it. They also seemed concerned that I was looking for a desk job when all I’ve ever done is work on my feet. Except I also have some experience (from my previous job) with purchasing, inventory, database entry, and customer service.\n\nDo y’all have any recommendations for desk jobs and certifications to help get them? Or even medical jobs that pay well and don’t require too much schooling?",

The number of people on temporary layoff changed little at 846,000.\"\n\n\"The number of long-term unemployed (those jobless for 27 weeks or more) was little changed at 1.6 million in October. This measure is up from 1.3 million a year earlier. In October, the long-term unemployed accounted for 22.9 percent of all unemployed people.\"\n\n\"The number of people employed part time for economic reasons was little changed at 4.6 million in October. These individuals would have preferred full-time employment but were working part time because their hours had been reduced or they were unable to find full-time jobs.\"\n\n\"The number of people not in the labor force who currently want a job, at 5.7 million, was essentially unchanged in October. These individuals were not counted as unemployed because they were not actively looking for work during the 4 weeks preceding the survey or were unavailable to take a job.\"\n\n\"Total nonfarm payroll employment was essentially unchanged in October (+12,000), following an average monthly gain of 194,000 over the prior 12 months. In October, employment continued to trend up in health care and government. Temporary help services lost jobs. Employment declined in manufacturing due to strike activity.\"\n\n\"Within professional and business services, employment in temporary help services declined by 49,000 in October. Temporary help services employment has decreased by 577,000 since reaching a peak in March 2022.\"\n\n  \n[https://www.bls.gov/news.release/pdf/empsit.pdf](https://www.bls.gov/news.release/pdf/empsit.pdf)",

The corporations/companies expect you to be fully committed to them but they won't pay you a living wage in order to show you as the employee that they value your contributions...when employees are paid fairly they tend to work very hard in the beginning in hopes it will be rewarded but since the workforce environment as a whole leans toward contract hiring these companies have no incentive to give you equitable raises after each year of employment.  The reason they don't reward you for your commitment and tenure is by the time you've been employed for about 2-4 years you realize that going above and beyond is not rewarded, therefore the company will simply let you go and start the process over with \"fresh blood\" that will receive that same starting hourly wage that you as the first employee received upon hire date.  This new employee behaves as the first employee did, working very hard and trying to prove their worth but it usually doesn't pan out for this new employee.  \n\nMost corporations realize they can treat their employees as small disposable pieces of their corporate machine.  In order to move up or secure a permanent position you usually have to rely on the ability to schmooze a higher-up or get lucky that they \"like\" you; there are many hard workers who perform well at their job but don't have the social ability to \"play the game\".  \n\nAnyone else agree or have anything to add?",

I am looking to break out of it, mostly searching for something maybe in administrative or data entry. But I keep running into a problem where even the most basic data-entry and filing jobs either require a bachelors OR multiple years professional experience in that job function. Whilst I have been using programs like Word And Excel for years, I don't have the expensive piece of paper that says I know what I'm doing.\n\nMeanwhile, any time I get on the job search sites and look for entry level, almost all I get that are really entry level are both extremely low paying and/or involve lots of long-term standing and manual labor. Due to previous injuries, I can't really stand for long period of time. And lots of bending, squatting, and climbing is basically out of the question. While I don't think this would qualify me as 'disabled', I keep thinking somewhere out there a job that someone like me can work with a wage I can live on for awhile before maybe eventually getting promoted MUST exist, but I just can't seem to figure out where it is.

      "text": ">AT&T CEO John Stankey's blunt declaration to employees that \"company loyalty is dead\" - a striking statement given that his own parents dedicated their entire careers to the company, as has he. Rather than sparking widespread outrage or concern about employee morale, the market responded positively, with AT&T's stock price actually rising following his comments.\n\n>NVIDIA's Jensen Huang has famously stated he would \"rather torture employees to greatness than fire them.\" While this might sound like a commitment to employee development and job security, it could be interpreted as a philosophy of extracting maximum value from workers through intense pressure and demanding conditions. Yet this approach is often celebrated in business circles as visionary leadership rather than questioned as potential exploitation.\n\n\n>Cognition CEO Scott Wu told employees that six days in the office and 80-hour workweeks were expected, writing: \"We don't believe in work-life balance-building the future of software engineering is a mission we all care so deeply about that we couldn't possibly separate the two.\"\n\n**The cultural shift**\n\nThe pattern reveals a significant shift in corporate culture, where statements that might once have been seen as damaging to employee morale are now often celebrated by markets as signs of strong, decisive leadership focused on efficiency and shareholder value.\n\n\n**These are my ideas**\n\n1. Board Composition: Push for more employee representation on corporate boards, like Germany's co-determination model where workers have seats. This gives employees a voice in executive compensation and strategic decisions.\n\n2. Labor Law Updates: Strengthen collective bargaining rights and make it easier for workers to organize, giving them more leverage in these relationships.\n\n\n3. Tax Incentives: Create tax advantages for companies that maintain stable employment, invest in worker training, or meet employee satisfaction thresholds.",

      "title": "Finally escaped unemployment. Now I don't do anything.",
      "text": "I spent 2 years unemployed. It was hell. My life was drive for the food delivery apps, spam applications, drive for the apps, applications, go to bed. Over 1000 applications and I finally got a job. I want to begin with saying I feel amazing mentally speaking having a job again. It was destroying me, the anxiety, the overwhelmed feelings, the depression, the feeling like I didn't deserve to enjoy anything until this obligation was handled, like I was wasting time. I feel great now. My mental is doing so much better. My general anxiety has dropped by like 75% and my social anxiety by damn near 100%. I feel better about myself. This was the longest I have ever been unemployed since I was 13. And I grew up with a mother who at times worked 2-3 jobs to make ends meet so I just don't do well without one. This current job market is hell.\n\nHowever, now on my days off I do nothing. The job itself is nothing crazy, full time, active, around people, okay pay, I'm a merchandiser. I stopped being sore and tired after the second week and in fact now I have much more energy. My sleep has improved too. I also get a three day weekend. So, everything is in order to where I feel I should be able to utilize and truly appreciate free time. And yet, I'm almost suffering from couch lock (bed lock). I just lay in bed and doom scroll and distract myself with video games I don't even like and do some house work which eats up all of 2 hours. There's certainly shit I could be doing which I previously thoroughly enjoyed such as fishing. But I just cant seem to get myself going. I'm not tired, mentally or physically. I don't understand why this is happening. While unemployed it felt like I was wasting my life if I did anything for fun. Now with a job not doing anything for fun I feel like I'm wasting my life. How ridiculous is that? This has always been an issue I've had. My last job I worked 6-7 days a week and whenever I had a day off I just rested inside. Now though I get half the week off and I still do nothing.\n\nDoes anyone have advice, or has anyone been through similar? I do have more goals in order and getting this job was only step one for me, but now I am beginning to worry that when I've tackled these goals and made it where I want to be, that I'll still find myself going through this and feel like it was all for nothing.\n\nEDIT:\n\nThere's way more replies than I expected, and I've read a lot. I didn't realize so many would be able to relate to some of the things I mentioned. Thank you everyone. I will continue reading and try to respond to some a little after work tomorrow.\n\nAs far as the gap goes, I decided to start testing whatever I could and eventually put down that I've been driving for the apps. That turned the gap from 2 years into like 5 weeks. No clue if that actually helped. But I've done all the usual stuff like even walking in IRL and pestering management at places and only this seems to have made the difference. I've also applied to just about everything from janitorial, retail, trades, unskilled labor, coding, to office jobs. Basically if I qualified, had any prior experience, or believed I could learn on the job, I applied.\n\n  \nUpdate: \n\nThank you everyone. I clonked out right when I got home yesterday, just read everything here. I'm going to force myself out of the house this weekend even if all I do is lay in the grass and float some bait out at one of my spots for an hour (I prefer moving a lot and using lures when I fish). I've thought a lot about everything you guys have said and I'm realizing I more or less spent an entire 24 months in almost a fight or flight mode non stop. I didn't feel at ease or relaxed for a second. I think it became my new norm so I just didn't notice it, and those of you saying I need to just let myself chill and come down is what all of this is. It makes sense as I realize this.\n\nI will admit I have a horrible habit of burning myself out always wanting to go 100 in all areas. I think being stuck at 0, in an almost sort of limbo, while knowing what I needed to do and what I want in life but stagnating despite my best efforts and now suddenly having traction but being mentally exhausted from the past 2 years is what's going on here. Like I'm overly eager to finally just GO GO GO and put in work and to let myself enjoy life. I'm gonna take it slow, small waves over time for a big impact. I can get my social life rebuilt, get into some classes, get back into hobbies like fishing, but do it gradually rather than all at once.",

      "text": "Disclaimers: I used career development as this will overall be a bit of advise on to build one's career.  \nI have a degree in economics so there's my ethos. Otherwise this is just my two cents.\n\nTl;dr: I hypothesize that the market for \"non-people centric\" labor due to the increase in suppliers of said labor globalization has generated.\n\nDefinitions:  \nNon-people centric labor is any labor that is not organized around a group of people in a specific locale. e.g. a software engineer or finance analyst. While those labors do benefit people they aren't always tied to a specific group of people in the same locale.\n\n  \nPeople centric labor is any labor that is organized around a group of people in a specific locale. e.g. a Doctor must live near their patients. An engineer must live (at least temporary) where the construction is occurring and most construction tends to benefit locales where people live.\n\n\n\nGlobalization, for better or worse, has risen many out of poverty across the world. This has resulted in benefits and negatives of course, but one overall benefit is people are overall \"smarter.\" [Literacy rates](https://www.weforum.org/stories/2022/09/reading-writing-global-literacy-rate-changed/#:~:text=In%201900%2C%20it%20still%20barely,out%20of%20ten%20people%20worldwide), for example, have increased over the 20th century. Thus it should be no surprise that many professions are facing increased competition whether from immigration or outsourcing. However, this competition is not equally spread across all industries. Right now we are in a tech downturn, maybe in the future finance will be as well. In the past we saw manufacturing move out of the US and Europe.\n\n  \nThe common denominator (between tech & manufacturing) is that they are not tied into their local economy. It does not matter if a Volkswagen is made in Germany or China. It does not matter if code is written by someone in India or someone in Berlin (and let's not make any assumptions about groups of people being inherently less productive).\n\n  \nIt does matter though if doctor that lives in India attempts to treat a patient in L.A. It won't be effective treatment. This is not to say that immigration has not affected such jobs but that it has not affected them as much immigration + outsourcing has for non-people centric jobs. Not to mention that people-centric jobs tend to exist everywhere. A doctor from India could move to the US but India also needs doctors for their own people. This creates a stickiness that non-people centric jobs don't have. Even if a software engineer does stay in their country of birth, the work they do may not be for the people they live with. \n\n  \nSo what does this mean? Well the price of labor for non-people centric jobs will stabilize globally. Which means a decrease as many countries have lower costs of living than the US. Assuming their isn't a global increase in demand for such labor. Eventually supply/demand will meet though. Firms will attempt to capture these lower wage workers (e.g. Temu). Given a free market approach though, maybe our grandkids will find a more stable global economy. \n\nHence my advise is to develop your career around the people you want to live with. Look for jobs/firms that will be difficult to oursource. \n\nThe only other option is a combination of unions and workplace democracy. As the businesses benefit from all of this. But with both unions and workplace democracy those workers affected by globalization could negotiate for training or retirement benefits or any sort of compensation.",

Now is probably one of the most important periods in my life on the path to success career. Will there be a shortage of workers in engineering professions like in the 60-70s? After finishing school, should I get a residence permit in the EU or a green card in the USA and study there or try to study at Russian university? Should I expect the same tough interviews as now?",

I was wondering how I should proceed next or if it’s possible to receive my pay for my unpaid work. I try to be a pretty conscientious worker who helps out as much as I can. I’m the youngest person at my job and I usually catch when I don’t clock in and notify my manager so she can correct it. This week being Christmas I was of course pretty distracted and I work in retail so it was pretty busy when I finish my break I usually just get back to work. I have an app providing the days and hours I work as which also shows that I was there on the day in question. It also shows I clocked out twice so that’s more evidence that my attendance was so. Is it possible to get paid for those hours? And if so how long will I have to wait?",

What I didn’t know is that someone in HR has relayed to multiple people I am a “security concern”. I have received messages from my colleagues that there have been open discussions in the office about me.\n\nThis makes me want to leave the position, but I’m not financially in a position to do so, especially since I wouldn’t get unemployment because it would be me quitting.\n\nAm I overreacting or is this humiliating?\n\nAnother thing to add about this HR department - they apparently can’t keep PI data private. For “instructions” on how to complete onboarding documents, the file they sent me was a complete picture of a passport of another employee, passport number and all. I let them know and they said they “didn’t know” how that happened.",

I want to make sure that I'm qualified enough to land a job. \n\nSome questions I have when it comes down to applying:\n\n1. Are employers most likely to check an application online or in person?\n\n2. When applying online, what reliable and consistent website(s) should I use?\n\n3. Besides experience, what do most employers seek out on a resume?\n\n4. Are jobs more willing to hire just before holidays? \n\nFor context, I haven't worked at all, but it would be nice to earn some money for myself and build that portfolio. I just turned 18 and I've been applying to retail jobs for the past three months consistently, retail specifically because I've been told that working at fast food for your first career isn't recommended.",

Should I take it?\n\nReasons I should take it:\n1) Its CRAZY hard to find a job as a college student. Especially one that fits my schedule like this one. Nobody cares that's I'm in college. I'm just another \"run of the mill\" high school graduate to employers. \n2) Its an office job that requires no physical labor which I kind of need because years of working in warehouses has ruined my back. \n3) The higher paying jobs are more competitive and it would take longer to get them. I'm wretchedly poor and severely in debt. I kind of need something NOW. This job wants to hire someone ASAP.\n3a) I'm trying to save up to fix my car so the commute isn't so ghastly. I want to get it fixed ASAP.\n4) This is for a test proctor job and its somewhat more relevant to my long term goal career than a warehouse or food service job. \n\nReasons I shouldn't take it:\n1) This is the worst, longest commute I've ever had in my entire life. And I've taken the bus for years at a time before. And it's 12 hour shifts so I would come and go to work in the pitch black.  \n1a) By the time I get home at 10pm on the bus, I'm already late for bed.\n2) Maybe I should try for a higher paying job? I know I can get one. It might just take longer. \n3) I really don't feel safe walking alone at night as a woman. I don't really think anyone is.",

I’m on the verge of a breakdown.\n\nThis has been me at my job (on my lunch, obviously not during work- I’m still at least trying to be professional) for the last few weeks and even off the clock, at home.\n\nI am a 27 yr old reservist, former active duty enlisted- trying to find my way to a new career, or at least a new job to try and excel in while I also figure out the reservist lifestyle.\n\nDoes anyone have good leads or suggestions on what I can do to mitigate this?\n\nEdit: Thanks for all the help and support, folks. I’ll take the mental health tips to heart, and any future advice will be appreciated.",

      "text": "I will be namedropping and name shaming these \"companies\" in my area because they deserve to be called out. I have reported all of these jobs as fake ghost jobs to these job boards like Indeed, but some you can't report because they're on the companies own websites. Reporting these real companies to the BBB might be a better option but in most cases nothing happens...\n\nI have seen so far 50 fake job posts on Indeed in my area just this month. These are just a few that I can fit in this post. I can prove these are fake jobs because the companies dont even exist, they do not have a website and cannot be found on Google, or there are no businesses in my area on google maps with those company names. OR the jobs are being spammed with no intentions of hiring you to get as many applicants possible to sell your information. If these \"companies\" are posting 20+ job listings but don't even have a website, it's 99% fake job postings. If they're posting less than 10 but has no website okay we can give them the benefit of a doubt because I've seen that happen before for family owned businesses, and at least those mom and pop shops showed up on google maps. 20-30+ job postings and no company website and nothing on Google Maps is ridiculous and a big red flag. How are you gonna hire 20+ people and have no proof of your existence?\n\nThese company names are generic like they have acronyms like TQC or they're generic like Intelligen, none of these companies exist. And these companies on Linkedin do not have any reviews but have over 30 job listings that have been opened for 30+ days. [Intelligen Jobs and Careers | Indeed.com](https://www.indeed.com/cmp/Intelligen-1/jobs?q=&l=#cmp-skip-header-desktop)\n\nThere was a job post from a company called Belva which is hiring for software development jobs but it's actually a scam call center in India. [BELVA Jobs and Careers | Indeed.com](https://www.indeed.com/cmp/Belva-1/jobs)\n\nPort City Executives has a job post in my area but they are located in Conneticut, they do not have any office in my area. These job posts are listed as account representative internships entry level. [Port City Executives Careers and Employment | Indeed.com](https://www.indeed.com/cmp/Port-City-Executives)\n\nTQC is a call center in Pasadena California but is posting jobs all over the country, require you to already live in or relocate to near Pasadena for minimum wage [TQC Careers and Employment | Indeed.com](https://www.indeed.com/cmp/Tqc-2)\n\nEpic is a notorious one also, they also post jobs all over the country and require you to take FAANG type leetcode interviews and then you to relocate to Madison Wisconsin if you even make it that far for the onsite interview [(13) Search all Jobs | LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/search/?currentJobId=3955127048&f_C=163658&originToLandingJobPostings=3955127048,3849819243,3955120929,3986116441,3886682190,3988346514,3880427853)\n\nAbercrombie stores asks for your social security number before you even get an interview, if you even get one, and you still won't get hired, same with Hollister, American Eagle, and other stores like them. Who knows what they'll do with your social security number, they have all of your personal identity if you apply for a job there\n\n5 jobs were taken down in my area, Management Science Associates Inc apparently is located in Pittsburgh but has job postings in United States so it appears in all over the country [Management Science Associates, Inc. Jobs and Careers | Indeed.com](https://www.indeed.com/cmp/Management-Science-Associates,-Inc.-1/jobs)\n\nAerotek asks for your social security number on a phone call before you even get a job offer. Criminally awful benefits with long contract times if you even get the job from what I heard. People call Aerotek/Actalent a cult, has offices all over the country but has no intentions of getting you a job in most cases they're just collecting your information to sell it to data companies, if you submit your resume to them you just did their job for them for free now they get to make money from your information they were reported multiple times to the BBB for this but they still keep doing it [United States (aerotek.com)](https://www.aerotek.com/en/locations/united-states)\n\nBrooksource is notorious for spamming job posts listing them as entry level jobs but will say 5 years of work experience is required, falsely advertising these jobs as remote to gain as many applications possible around the country. [(13) LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/company/brooksource/jobs/)\n\nInfinite Advantage Inc doesn't even exist [Infinite Advantage, Inc. Careers and Employment | Indeed.com](https://www.indeed.com/cmp/Infinite-Advantage,-Inc.)\n\nAmway lies about their pay range for their warehouse job posts. It’s actually near minimum wage. Lies about pay range to get people to apply. [Amway Jobs and Careers | Indeed.com](https://www.indeed.com/cmp/Amway/jobs?jk=f6a9be8f61edc931&start=0&clearPrefilter=1)\n\nGordon Foods posts jobs claiming they hire immediately for these jobs but has no intentions of actually hiring for these. I know this because I applied months ago and never got an interview. They had this job post listed since April 2024. [| Gordon Food Service (gfs.com)](https://gfs.com/en-us/careers/search/result/?jobID=part-time-freezer-associate/R-26735)\n\nFedex posts fake ghost jobs also. My application for their delivery driver and office printing center jobs has been in \"under consideration\" hell since March 2024. and they use a ai chat bot for your job application so wtf is the point a human is not seeing your application\n\nTarget posts fake retail job posts. They made me go through their one way video recording hell for cart pusher and cashier jobs and I still got rejected. Same with Best Buy and other retailers that use one way video recordings, it's just free discrimination for them if you're an ethnic minority without you seeing another human. This is a minimum wage job, not Microsoft, why are you requiring video recordings to see if we're ethnic minorities to be discriminated? Have you noticed why Target has only white teenage girls working there and no ethnic minorities like asians, this is why...\n\nMcdonalds makes you go through their online 64 question IQ test for their fry cook job. I did that too and got rejected somehow\n\nI applied to Tim Horton near my house and the manager texted me saying they stopped hiring in my area but there is one hiring 2 hours away... Fuck that shit\n\nPrecise Advancement Inc does not exist, look at the reviews on google maps they're even saying it's a fake ghost job  [Precise Advancement Inc Job in grand rapids, mi | Indeed.com](https://www.indeed.com/cmp/Precise-Advancement-Inc/jobs)\n\nASR Health Benefits is a health insurance call center is posting a EDI developer job as remote but requires you to live in the area and does not post the wage range, has a 1.9 review on google maps so you know how they treat their customers [ASR Health Benefits - EDI Developer](https://www.asrhealthbenefits.com/home/job-postings/edi-developer/)\n\nAccenture and Meta posts fake jobs, they just laid off thousands of employees so do you really think they have any intentions of hiring  people for the jobs they just laid off with these job posts they keep putting up? Entry level positions do not exist for these big tech companies anymore because they only hire people who are mid to senior level of experience now. Accenture announced they have stopped hiring for the foreseeable future via email.\n\nBig Lots posts fake jobs, they filed for bankruptcy. Do you really think they will hire you when they just went bankrupt?\n\nCU Answers has no intentions of hiring anyone for these minimum wage jobs. Apply and you'll get ghosted or never have your application seen [CU\\*Answers Jobs in grand rapids, mi | Indeed.com](https://www.indeed.com/cmp/Cu*answers-2/jobs?jk=8cc7e0ea5d6c8907&start=0)\n\nLacks Enterprise posts tech and trade jobs with no intentions of hiring, and puts the pay range near minimum wage insultingly low, or sometimes no wage range at all, and require a bachelors degree when the tasks they want you to do absolutely does not require one its just factory work and manual labor [Lacks Enterprises Jobs in grand rapids, mi | Indeed.com](https://www.indeed.com/cmp/Lacks-Enterprises/jobs)\n\nLastly, Walmart and Sams Club. They spam these job posts in my area but has no intentions of hiring anyone. Theres over 50 jobs posts they spammed. I know someone who works at my local Walmart and he said they haven't hired anyone in months but are still spamming job posts to make it look like they're hiring\n\nI'm sick of these fake ghost jobs. And entry level jobs seems to be non existent when they all want to pay minimum wage and want you to have 5+ years of work experience to even get an interview, or the companies and job dont even exist, this is why we can't get jobs in 2024. How is this shit not illegal yet?",

      "title": "Left My Job Over a Comment My Boss Made",
      "text": "Working retail was okay, it was truly fun and laid back. My only issue was that anytime I for some reason could not show up to work I was met with snarky comments from my boss. I once called out of work due to a really bad asthma attack, the following week I was told “Hopefully you don’t call out like you did last time and show up”\n\nIt didn’t bother me until recently where my mother was hospitalized. The doctors told me that she could’ve died in her sleep that week because of her low red blood cells (thank god she got her blood work done) Being 16, I’m not going to leave my mother alone. My father works from 5am to late afternoon, my brother needs someone to look after him and I can’t leave my grandmother alone. I called out of work that day from both jobs because I couldn’t leave her alone.\n\nI told one of my bosses ( I had two, a younger and older ) That I wasn’t going to work that day. I told the younger one because he’s more understanding. I thought that he would tell my other boss whats going on. Boy was I wrong. I come to work the next day, a couple of minutes goes by and this conversation takes place:\n\nOlder Boss: So why didn’t you come yesterday \n\nMe: My mom had low red blood cells and had to get blood transfusions, luckily the doctors notified us of it or else i coukd have lost her this week\n\nOlder Boss: You know my daughter is in the hospital?\n\nMe: Really? Is she okay?\n\nOlder Boss: Don’t ask you don’t care\n\nMe: Yes I do is she okay?\n\nOlder Boss: Shes currently in labor\n\nMe: Omg! Congratulations!\n\nOlder Boss: I couldn’t go see her because you called out\n\nMe: Oh…\n\nOlder Boss: The next time my daughter is giving birth make sure your mother isn’t in the hospital.\n\nKeep in mind, his daughter hadn’t given birth yet, she was just in labor. That comment basically flipped something in me. I wasn’t interested in working and just wanted to leave. \n\nSo the next day I wrote an email to him AND his wife (shes a doll i love her) explaining what happened to my mom, how the conversation went, and how insensitive it was. My final paragraph on that email was just expressing my appreciation of them and just letting them know that I will no longer be working for them.\n\nPetty, yeah probably. But knowing myself if I put in my two weeks and showed up for a job I didn’t want to work at anymore I would not work and just leave off a bad foot.\n\nLuckily I am blessed to always have work and found a new job not even a week later. \n\nNever double down for a job that doesn’t respect you <3\n\nEdit:\n\nHi! Thank you for all the warm comments. Seeing that people other than family and friends applaud my decision makes any feeling of regret die down.\n\nI’ve seen two comments that I’d like to address (have been deleted but I want to clear any confusion.)\n\n1. “Did you even try asking your mom to plan out her blood issues better? /s” \n\nMy mother got a type of gastric bypass surgery (Not sure which one but I believe it’s where they tie your stomach tubes) Because of this she eats like a rabbit. She’s unable to tolerate some foods, causing her to throw up. It’s truly disheartening to see. I miss eating burgers with her. But she makes do with what she can, she eats avocado, lentil beans, lots of protein like egg chicken etc. Although she’s eats and gets full the best she can, it’s not enough for her body truthfully speaking. So she has regular appointments getting her blood work done, this one appointment however wasnt a simple, “all good go in home”, it was “we need to see you at the hospital now.” Now thankfully because the doctors balanced out her blood cells they have her taking various medications that can help and food!!\n\n2. “I don't know if you’re aware of this but when you don't go to work you put everyone in a bind. I...”\n\nI was unable to read this fully because by the time i went to open it, it was deleted. For one yes i understand that i put everyone in a bind. But truthfully i’m not going to prioritize my job when my mother is sick. And i’m not sorry for saying so. If my bosses can miss work and put me in charge because his grandkids have an event I can for sure miss work because my mother is on the verge of dying. It is also not my fault that other than me, they have a worker who has worked there for over a year but is still learning how to operate on her own simply because she’s a beginner english speaker. (To be clear they don’t help her or even trust her to advance more because she can’t understand english, which is not her fault and she’s doing the best she can. Shes taking english classes and even has a scholarship. Anytime i learned something, she would ask me about it and i would help to translate for her. I loved working with her. Despite the language barrier she got the work done.)They shouldn’t rely on one worker to run the whole store truth be told that’s why theres a something called a staff.",

      "text": "I saw a clip yesterday from a GOP lawmaker in Pennsylvania—Jesse Topper—and he literally said,\n“Not every job is designed to give you a living wage.”\n\nLike... does he even hear himself?\n\nYou're telling the world—out loud—that there are jobs that must be done, jobs that keep society running, and yet the people doing them don’t deserve to live off that work?\n\nThat some roles exist just to extract labor, with no intention of providing stability, safety, or a future?\n\nThat’s not just tone-deaf. That’s a full-on confession of how this system is designed:\nTo drain every drop of energy from working people, while giving back the bare minimum needed to keep them from collapsing.\n\n\n\nWhen I say everyone deserves a living wage, I’m not talking about utopia. I’m not talking about handouts.\n\nI’m talking about basic human dignity.\n\nIf a company profits from your time, your labor, your body showing up every damn day—then you should be able to afford rent, food, healthcare, and sleep at night without spiraling into anxiety.\n\nIf you're working full-time and still living in fear of eviction, hunger, or medical bankruptcy, you're not being paid too much—you're being stolen from.\n\n\n\nWhere’s the line? Where does it stop?\n\nWhat happens when a town is controlled by one or two employers—places like rural West Virginia or northern Arkansas, where Walmart or Amazon are the only real options?\n\nWhat if they just decide to cut wages across the board?\n\nThey’ll say, “Well, would you rather be unemployed?”\n\nLike those are the only two choices working people deserve: be exploited or be discarded.\n\nThat’s not capitalism. That’s economic blackmail.\n\n\n\nAnd it all ties together:\n\nThe myth of meritocracy that pretends hard work leads to wealth.\n\nThe illusion of a middle class that convinces people they're fine while they drown in quiet debt.\n\nThe divide-and-conquer narratives that pit struggling workers against each other, while the rich rewrite the rules from their penthouses.\n\n\nAnd when you call it out? What do they say?\n\n“Just get a better job.”\n\nAs if someone doesn’t have to sweep the floors.\nAs if someone doesn’t have to stock the shelves.\nAs if the people holding up the foundation of daily life don’t deserve to live from their work.\n\nIf your business model requires paying people poverty wages to survive, then your business isn’t viable—it’s parasitic.\n\n\n\n\nWe might not have wealth, power, or influence.\n\nWe we might not have a mic in Congress or a media team to soften the blow of my anger.\n\nBut if all I can do is write a post, then I’ll write a post.\nBecause pretending this is normal only protects the people who designed it.\n\nAnd we have to be done with that please.",

      "text": "Not even a fucking year ago I moved to this city specifically for this job. It was as close to a dream job as I could ask for: it was a small company (less than 10 employees), non-corporate, it shared the same values I did, and all of of my coworkers were just beyond fantastic, I genuinely couldn’t have asked for much better. I literally never once was written up, in fact my employer had nothing to say except to sing my praises when I would ask for feedback! I did damn good work, and I was proud to work there. \n\nWelp, it was all for fucking nothing. \n\nSince the election, and since the inauguration especially, we have been a lot more open in the office about talking our political beliefs, and exactly none of us were happy with Trump being elected, let alone the daily bombardment of downright crazy shit he’s been doing since 1/20. \n\nCome today, the owner asked me to come in a little early. We had a new employee starting in my department so I just assumed it was related to that, and discussing how the power structure or division of work would happen once they start. Could not have been further from the truth. \n\nHe starts with asking me about my weekend and how I’m feeling (I called out sick Friday) and after some small talk he goes “listen ____, I’ve loved having you work here and you’ve been so stellar in the role and frankly I’ve been so impressed with your work since you started here.  But unfortunately since the election, our business has taken a massive hit financially. Tariffs are screwing us, the markets are crashing, and frankly people aren’t buying our goods like they used to. So we need to reshuffle the company structure a bit, so today will be your last day.”\n\n\nI took this job specifically because it was a place I saw myself long term, it was a place I could be content staying at for more than a few years. I went $20k in debt moving halfway across the fucking country and for this job, just for me to lose it because Donald Fucking Trump has to go and play god emperor with our country. And my now ex-boss did say he would help me find a new job however he could, but like I work in a small niche industry, the odds of finding another job in my city is small to none… \n\nI’m so tired of this fucking country man.",

This was conveniently voted on after an early dismissal was called. Both bills are **DISASTROUS** for *all* workers in the United States.\n\n[A good explainer video, with actions you can take!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F78KIRdMDHU)\n\n**H.R. 1319**\n\nRemoves sections from Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 on who is an independent contractor and replaces it with a new definition.\n\nTL/DR: Everything defining a W2 employee can be used to classify them as a 1099 contractor\n\nParaphrased bill text:\n\n>\"A person is an independent contractor if the employer doesn't control details about the way work is completed, except the employer handles the final result. The independent contractor takes all the risks of entrepreneurship, such as managerial skill, business acumen, or professional judgement. *(aka, basic job skills)*. Other factors that **don't** make someone an independent contractor; if your employer requires you to follow laws/regulations, if your employer makes you comply with health and safety standards, if your employer requires you to have insurance, whether or not your employer makes you meet performance standards, i.e. deadlines.\"\n\n**H.R. 1320**\n\nIf you receive benefits from employment, you are still not considered a W2 employee.

What is a portable benefit? Work benefits and protections, such as:\n\n>worker's compensation\n\n>skills training\n\n>professional development\n\n>paid leave\n\n>disability coverage\n\n>health insurance coverage\n\n>retirement savings\n\n>income security\n\n>short term saving\n\n>financial contributions like Social Security, Medicaid, and Federal Tax.\"\n\nI wish I was joking. These combined 5 pages will **absolutely fuck up EVERYONE.**\n\nHave trouble keeping up with performance standards? Fired.\n\nHave office politics trouble? Fired.\n\nWant a union? Sorry, you all are not recognized as employees so you can't unionize!\n\nWant 1/2 the Social Security tax paid by employer? Sorry, we only do that for employees.\n\nThe big picture is of course de-fund Social Security and pocket more profit for corporations. This loop is currently in use for gig workers like Uber/Lyft drivers, Amazon/FedEx contract deliveries (out of their own cars!).\n\n**DO NOT LET UP, CALL CALL CALL, SPREAD THE WORD AROUND BEFORE THIS IS BROUGHT TO A VOTE!

Oh wow it didn't work this time. I did EVERYTHING and NOTHING happened. I'm not applying for a dishwasher by the way. It's literally a job typing away at a keyboard and maybe a few TPS reports.\n\nSo he sets me up with a folder of all my stuff, and was nice enough to drive me to the place I applied for 7 times. He drops me off and I walk up to the door. And it's locked, shocker. If it ended here I wouldn't have posted this and have been bathing in my vindication. Nope, a security officer sees me inside, asks if we have an appointment. I tell him what's going on, and he scorns me we have 30 seconds to leave the property. My dad tries confronting him, and non shockingly, didn't like what the security have to say.\n\nAnd what was the lesson in this? Oh yeah, it's that DEI is why I couldn't get that job. They'd rather hire H1 Visas for computer jobs now. I understand that companies do this practice, but it's not to displace white workers. It's because they're cheaper and less likely to unionize. But you might notice a tiny error, something so small... that THIS HAD NOTHING TO DO WHAT HAPPENED AT ALL.\n\nI always get people telling me that this is too dumb to be true in this now trilogy. You need to realise that THIS IS WHAT OLIGARCHAL MEDIA DOES TO PEOPLE. Fox News, Newsmax, CNN, etc etc. They have made the masses of America THIS FUCKING STUPID. We live in a post truth society. Christian Cons live in a different universe on how the world works. They still think it's 1975. This is how they are able to vote away YOUR FUTURE and yet still tell you that YOU'RE doing something wrong.\n\nI'm out of patience. Your Fox News family's a lost cause at this point. I understand my father is trying to help, but we can't sail across the sea if you think we'll fall off the edge of the world. This is why the Flynn effect is dying.",

The worst thing is the coworker is sitting next to me.

I used to think these two are nice guys, but now I’ve lost all respect for them.\n\nEdit: Some comments suggest that I should go to the HR. First, there’s no HR. This small company is in a third world country, and the Italian guy is the founder. Talking about politics in the office isn’t a taboo here as well. I can’t just tell them to stop talking about politics. \nI don’t know why, but the Westerners here are all Trump supporters. On the other hand, those who are from third world countries, including me, are against him. Maybe it’s because we know what dictatorship looks like as we’ve experienced it in our countries?As I said before, talking about politics isn’t a no-no here, so I know that 50% of my colleagues support him. \nBut yeah, I should look for a new job or work as a freelance. I’m working on that right now. But it’s so draining to listen to these people. \n\nEdit 2: I once talked to them about what Musk’s doing. They agreed that it’s probably for personal gain and ego boost, but at least dude is contributing. When I pointed out that no one elected Musk, they said a government won’t function if everyone inside has to get elected before working there.\n\nBackstory: I experienced sexual abuse. My parents are immigrants, and my sister is a lesbian. A friend of mine is stuck overseas because of the funding cuts. I can’t just GROW UP and ignore them.",

Took on extra work and helped my team mates constantly,  I saw the writing on the wall that the job was getting rid of remote work (main reason I took it). I applied and landed another job.   I did everything that I was told my whole life,  give a 2 week notice, don’t burn bridges, etc.  I submitted my notice this morning,  I had 3 days of vacation to the end of the week (approved months ago).  They just deactivated me and sent me a email saying my last day is today,  they will not be paying for any unused pto (apparently I agreed to that) and also will not be paying any earned commission from my sales between April - June (apparently I agreed to that too. Don’t remember that at all). \n\nSo I did everything right and the company has totally screwed me over,  set me back, and ruined my whole mini vacation.   \n\nI hope nothing but awful things for the company,  I would cheer if they went under tomorrow.   \n\n\nEdit:  working with an employment attorney on this,   A few of my old co workers are now looking to leave as well,  I have an exit interview with the company tomorrow.  \n\nEdit 2:  the exit interview will be solely to tell them why I quit. As I feel the higher ups have no idea of the shady business practices going on in the sales department and the mismanagement.  I will not be discussing anything about the lost wages or hiring an attorney. \n\nFinal edit:  thanks for the support and the suggestions. I’ve decided to put 100% of my focus on my new job and forget about this one. I will be ghosting the exit interview tomorrow and will file wage complaints with the state after 6 days per what my attorney suggested to start with.   I doubt this will go anywhere,  but I’ve had the last day to dwell on it and realized this shit company isn’t worth my energy nor emotion.   I can only hope the department of insurance catches on to the shady practices they do, and they get sued to oblivion,  again thank you for all the kind words and support.",

On the whole the most common responses have not been \"yes, I agree things suck\" which was surprising to me. Hopefully this list of suggestions will help other people who come to this post in the same predicament:\n\n* Apply to less jobs but do so more thoroughly \n* Apply to more jobs because 3-4 a day is far too few, aim for 20-30\n* Change careers entirely into (AI, IT, Data Science, Engineering, Defense Contracting, Railroads, etc.) in under 12 months\n* Get a job at McDonald's / Walmart. If you claim they didn't hire you when you applied then you're lying.\n* Update your (resume, website, portfolio) again, but in the way I particularly think is good\n* Be homeless before you liquidate your 401k\n* Be homeless before you file for unemployment\n* Try harder, because if I can do it then you must just be a failure.",

Things were fine for the first 2 shifts, although the place was a bit of a mess (nothing I can’t fix) and the shifts would mainly consist of just me and the two owners (who are also married) in the kitchen which was pretty intense. \n\nMy last shift (yesterday) was just me and the guy- a bit of a weird vibe and he’s a really black and white person and doesn’t do much talk which is a bit awkward when you’re with someone for 8 hours straight. But fine whatever. \nHe was planning a new dish and asked my advice about the plating to which I gave general input (I come from fine dining so simple and uncomplicated). \n\nHe lost the plot. Just started shouting at me that ‘my idea was stupid and that there are thousands of places doing that kind of plating right now and we should be the best place ever not just in the city and he wants to be famous and not do any of this boring shit and that he’s the best chef in the country and that it’s crazy I even thought to suggest something so stupid.’ I was DUMBFOUNDED. \n\nI’m 27. I’ve had plenty jobs in the past where stupid beefed up angry dudes in Michelin kitchens have shouted at me and I used to think it was a right of passage and that I was lucky to be in these places. But that’s all bullshit and I know that now. \nI’m an adult now and in this moment I realised how little tolerance I have for this shit. I have ZERO tolerance for it in-fact. Not for maniac chefs shouting at me for nothing. \n\nI said nothing back to him. Finished the shift in silence. And handed my notice in today. \nI feel AMAZING and I’m so fucking proud of myself for not even entertaining the thought of staying in that environment for another waking day. I’m done with toxic kitchen environments and it shouldn’t be the norm!!! \n\nIf you’re ever in the same position don’t put up with it honestly, I would trade in any fancy pants Michelin job I’ve worked for a respectful humble environment. Fuck hospitality and fuck idiots like my now ex-boss!!!!!!!!! \n\nEDIT: Wah! Thanks so much for so many positive comments and stories, you’re all really cool people- I’m trying to reply to everyone but (although yes technically I’m now unemployed lol) I’m going to be out and away from reddit! So will get back to you when I can 🫶",

      "text": "So I got two jobs. One is a government job and we get a nice little parking permit and don’t have to pay anything. \n\nThe other is a HOSPITAL. We just got new toll booths for parking. I mean imagine having an emergency and having to pay to park like what. \n\nAnyways, I work overnights at that job in the emergency room. And the overnight parking fee in the garage is now $50!!! So any overnight employee, working a graveyard shift which already sucks has to pay $50! Or, you can park a mile away and walk in the dark. With stop-lights, traffic, etc. it’s a good 20-30 min walk. \n\nSo we have to get to work let’s say a minimum 30 minutes early, walk a mile with all our stuff, UNPAID, then do it all again when you get off work. Or pay $50… like what the fuck. \n\nThought this was a great thing to share with anti-work!",

My job can be done 100% remote and requires no supervision. My boss also lives about 5 hours away. \n\nWe’ve all got weirdly vague meetings on our calendars for an “important discussion”, many trusted informants have shared that the word on the street is the company is about to roll back our WFH policies. During my meeting later today, I want to troll my piece of shit boss with questions and talking points he certainly won’t be able to answer. What are some good ones to mention? What have you all done? \n\nAlso, in solidarity with the rest of my coworkers who don’t want this shit, I plan to refuse to make any changes to my work schedule.

      "title": "LOL I got fired from a new job after one day of work because I asked about a meal break law violation",
      "text": "I was told during the interview with the company that since it's a business with multiple small locations and that we could be alone or with only a couple other employees running the store, and therefore we'd be required to stay on the premises and interrupt our lunch to help customers, we'd be given a 30min paid lunch. So my understanding of the Washington paid lunch laws is that it's 30min of time given to sit down whether we decide to eat or not (and that interrupted time counts as worked - not against our meal break; if this understanding is wrong, PLEASE feel free to let me know!). Washington law also states that \"employees must be allowed a meal period when they work more than five hours in a shift. A meal period must be at least 30 minutes long and start between the second and fifth hour of the shift.\" 4 hours and 15min into my 6 hour shift yesterday, when I asked my trainer how lunches were handled since it was getting close to my 5th hour, I was told that we don't get lunches and that if I wanted a 30min break to sit down, it would have to be deducted out of my paycheck. I subsequently did not get to have a 30min lunch that day.\n\nToday, I texted my interviewer to ask for clarification on the matter. She called me (which sucks, because I had hoped to get it in writing) to tell me that she expects us to only sit down long enough to eat which she said was about 5-15min and that \"eating for 30min is too much\" and that we were expected to continue working the rest of the time. She also seemed so offended about the idea of someone sitting for 15-30min of their lunch break either relaxing or playing on their phone. Then she started making a fuss about how I'm \"making a big deal out of it\" and that if I'm going to be \"bookish about 5-15min, then maybe you need to take some time to consider if you want to stay with this company\". I told her I don't mind staying. Then I asked her if she'd just be able to text it to me so that I can have it for reference later on. She replied, \"okay, I don't think you're a good fit for this company\" and hung up on me. In less than 40min, I was completely removed from the schedule and could no longer see anyone else's. What's worse is I forgot to even prep some food to bring with me for lunch, so I couldn't eat even if I wanted to, so I was effectively expected to just work my lunch break, even though I gave zero consent to waive my meal break.\n\nI know that they've not only violated my right to a meal break, but now they've added retaliation to the list by terminating me for bringing up a potential violation of my rights. AND, on a side note and potential other issue; when talking about paid hours with my trainer, such as when the clock starts and ends for a shift, I was told it was just for the times on the schedule. My schedule was 3:00pm to 9:00pm yesterday. And while I do consider that I didn't start working until 3:00pm (I arrived at 2:55pm, and they didn't have me start working for a few minutes even though they brought me behind the counter), I definitely didn't get done working until 9:20pm due to the store closing at 9pm, then having to count the money in the till, log things into the log book, turn off the lights, lock the doors, and call one of the administrators to get the code to secure the lock and make sure the store was fully closed. So I wonder if they're going to try to not pay me for that extra 20min (whether through the 7min rounding rule or for each minute worked).\n\nAfter getting removed from the schedule, I immediately started working on a complaint to the Washington Department of Labor and Industries for at least the meal law violation and the wrongful termination. I plan to contact the employer tomorrow to request a copy of their records of my time worked, rate of pay, total pay for the day I worked, and a  written statement stating the reasons for and effective date of discharge, so that I not just have that, but also see if they weren't going to pay me for the 20 extra minutes that I worked, since legally they can't shave off the full 20min; at minimum, due to the 7 minute rounding rule, they have to pay me at least 15min of that. Then if I find that they do try to pull that, I'd file to get wage theft added to the investigation (I don't care that it's only a $4-5 difference for me - it's how many years they'd have done it to others).\n\nAnd I was told that the employee who told me that we don't get meal breaks has been with the company for over 10 years... So, to think of just how long they've been doing this for...\n\nScrew companies who take advantage of employees like that and grow off of illegal business practices. I hope they get to experience the full force of the law.",

Still no problem.\n\nMy wife and I are tired of Florida and our lease is almost up, we do our research and decide we like Minnesota. We visited last week and found a nice place. A couple coworkers live there and helped recommend areas. We pay the application fee and pass the background check. We give our 60 day notice to our current place. I put in PTO for the move and My boss is happy for me and tells me to inform HR of the new address.\n\nHR tells me Minnesota is not in our footprint and they can't approve my move. If I go through with the move I will be asked to resign. Atlanta, Birmingham, Nashville, and Charlotte are the approved work locations. But my role is remote, my department is remote, and we have people in Minnesota, so wtf.\n\nMy coworker in Miami was offered a promotion by a director, but HR declined to consider her because she wouldn't relocate her family to Alabama, our boss has no idea wtf is going on.\n\nSo I've been told I'm remote, grandfathered, my department is remote, but if I move somewhere not approved I'll be fired, but I already live somewhere not approved, as does my entire team.\n\nEdit: I have reviewed all documentation provided. This new policy goes into effect January 1st. I was requesting to move in March. Since I have already signed the lease for the new place, and given my notice to the current place, I have updated my address today in the hopes that this will fly under the radar.

We used to have 4 developers, 1. Tech lead and 1 PM. Last Friday, my final coworker in the department was given his notice of redundancy, which means it’s now going to be just me after his notice period. At first, I felt lucky to still have a job, but after I reflected on the situation, I realised I’ve been feeling completely drained and mentally wrecked. I’ve been working late nights, promised bonuses that never came, and carrying a workload that was meant for an entire team.\n\nI had a meeting scheduled with my manager on Monday to talk things through, but it never happened. I tried reaching out unofficially, but no luck. In the end, I just sent the resignation email because I couldn’t keep waiting, and now I feel like I left in the worst possible way.\n\nPart of me feels bad because I know the company is struggling, but the other part of me knows that staying here is destroying my mental health. I can’t shake the guilt, though.\n\nDid I do the wrong thing by resigning via email? Has anyone else felt this way after leaving a toxic situation?\n\nUPDATE:\nMy colleague just got a meeting invite with the manager and HR. However, he has already signed his redundancy notice with the severance package confirmed and has no intention of continuing to work for them. I’m not sure if they can withdraw his severance unilaterally.",

      "text": "I just posted this as an answer in r/AskReddit, but then realized this needs to be posted here, as I haven't publicly shared this story before today.\n\nI once chose a career that was paid shit for money, but I loved what I did. Unfortunately it ended up badly with miserable working conditions, toxic workplace, and two dead bodies.\n\nI first decided to quit my decently paid job at that time (finishing carpenter) and become a tandem hang glider instructor instead. I was already a hang glider pilot at that time, even taught flying part-time for a year, and flew every weekend as a leisurely activity to help me relax and recharge. I was in my twenties and becoming a full-time instructor was my dream.\n\nI got a job at a local hang gliding school, so I moved myself, and my very accommodating and understanding wife, to a place close to the flight park.\n\nThe school was already facing some financial hardships when I joined, and it became apparent that the ownership was cutting corners wherever they could. I was on salary, and expected to work long hours without extra compensation when it got busy.\n\nThis wasn't a big deal on most days since I really enjoyed the work, but I recall examples such as when I ended up staying hooked into the glider for 10 hours straight without a break, taking passengers one after another. And this was after already working 4 hours prior on non-flying tasks earlier that day. My shoulders and neck were in pain for days after, but I couldn't take time off to recoup.\n\nThere were also frequent issues with one of the owners. His personality was a passive-aggressive type, and it became a big issue at the flight park. He was never the kind to say what was in his mind, but would find ways to make you feel it in a way you couldn't discuss it. \n\nThe toxicity made me consider leaving a few times, but it all came to a head after an incident which made me realize that my safety, and the safety of my students, was becoming a serious issue. Little did I know that this decision would ultimately save my life, but cost the lives of two other people.\n\nYou see, most people think of hang gliders as aircraft that are foot-launched off the side of a mountain. This is true for a lot of solo hang glider pilots, but as a flight school we were using something called air tow to get the hang gliders into the air. \n\nSimilar to towing ordinary gliders, there is a powered aircraft at the front (in this case an ultralight specifically designed for towing hang gliders), that pulls hang gliders along to the desired altitude. Once there the glider releases, and the tug (what we call the ultralight) goes back down to pick up the next tow. This allows for way more flights in a day as one doesn't need to break down the glider, drive back up the mountain, reassemble, etc...\n\nThis tow rig typically utilizes two weak links, one at each end of the tow line, designed to break after a specific tow pressure is exceeded. This is done for safety as it mitigates the effect of a lockout, which is an involuntary manoeuvre that can put a hang glider into an uncontrolled nose dive, and even stall the tow aircraft. During a lockout, the tension on a tow line is very rapidly increased, hence utilizing weak links designed to break before the lockout becomes a threat.\n\nIn an ideal world, you would toss a weak link out after every tow and replace it with a fresh one. But when it got busy at the flight park, the extra time required to do this swap meant fewer tows in a day, which meant fewer bucks for the school. \n\nThe owner often reused weak links until they started to show signs of wear. Now, this isn't a big deal on its own, as it merely increases the chance of a premature weak link failure. But it also entails that students be trained in case of weak link failures.\n\nWhen a weak link breaks, there is a sudden loss of thrust and therefore climb. On a hang glider this results in a brief parabolic trajectory, similar to the zero-g airplane flights, albeit on a much smaller scale. The low-g event is brief and lasts maybe 1-2 seconds, but since the drastic change in wing loading is experienced as a momentary loss of control, it was my job to train new pilots how to deal with this situation without going haywire.\n\nIn essence, when there is loss of control, untrained pilots tend to increase their control inputs, which end up becoming too great as soon as the wing loading returns to normal, and this leads to an erratic flight path. This is similar to a loss of control experienced due to oversteering on slippery roads. \n\nThe solution is to overcome the instinct to make any and all control inputs for a brief second or two, and then make the normal inputs as soon as the wing loading returns to normal. And to do that, I would teach the theory of dealing with it first, then simulate the link failure by occasionally and unexpectedly hitting a tow line release while under tow (always when high up near the end of the tow, to provide ample recovery altitude).\n\nThe goal was to experience the link failure event enough times under training to get students used to the sudden jerk, prevent the instinctual tensing up, and ending up in PIOs (pilot-induced oscillations).\n\nThe owner, who was also the tug pilot, didn't like the sudden jerk he would experience when this was done, and after much resistance on my part, he simply forbade me from doing the practical part of the weak link failure training.\n\nThe result was that my very next student was inexperienced in this scenario, and when the weak link broke during his very first solo flight, he ended up overcontrolling the glider into the trees.\n\nHe was ok, just had minor bruises and scuffs.\n\nMy initial elation quickly turned into anger as this could have ended way worse. And if I were only allowed to train this guy to begin with, this clearly could have been avoided. So I went back to the owner expecting that now, surely he would see the sense in resuming the practical weak-link failure training. \n\nHe said no. \n\nHe said the cost of fuel was too great to waste a hundred or so feet of altitude on weak link training.\n\nI called my previous job manager and they were still hiring my replacement. I quit what was my dream job on the spot and went back to my old job.\n\nUnfortunately that's not where the story ends.\n\nThe person who replaced me at the flight park, died the following season, along with the passenger he was with. And I'm very sad to say, it was in part because I wasn't there to do anything about... maybe at least channelling the cost-cutting, which continued after my departure. Maybe I would have been able to negotiate where the costs could be cut in a safer manner.\n\nWhile I was still at the park, before I had quit, I noticed that the tandem glider was starting to show signs of over-UV. To explain, modern hang gliders are built tough - they are certified for at least 6 G's of force, and can do amazing aerial feats (current world record for consecutive loops is 95 in a row, greatest single-flight distance is 764 Km or 475 miles, etc). \n\nThey can clearly take a lot of beating, but the one thing that damages them is solar radiation. A sail on a hang glider can only take so much UV before it degrades past its certification point.\n\nAnd so, when I noticed that the tandem glider sail was getting past its prime, I brought it up with the owner.\n\nHe said no bueno, but assured me that he would look into it at the end of the season when there was more cash in the bank. \n\nThe sail was faded but I felt I was still ok to fly it at the time, so I didn't press it further. As long as the sail was to be replaced as promised, everything would be ok.\n\nAs it happened, I had quit before the end of the season, and the guy who got my job didn't know anything about this.\n\nHalfway through the following season, the sail blew open while under tow, and the glider crashed, killing the instructor and the student.\n\nThe instructor deployed the emergency parachute (on hang gliders, the chute is designed to bring both people and the aircraft down under one canopy), but they were too low for this. After the scene investigation, it was determined that the chute was deployed roughly at treetop height, which is way too low for the chute to deploy safely.\n\nIf I hadn't quit for the reasons I did, maybe I would have quit later due to the sail not being airworthy, or maybe my pressure to replace the sail would have resulted in its replacement. Heck, maybe I would have even caved in to a pressure to continue flying it again - I'm not sure. But as it is now, two people are dead and the school had to close down.\n\nThe owner was never sued, although my understanding is that the family of the deceased student was discussing it at the time.\n\n\nEDIT: Sorry, I just realized I can edit the post, not just the comments. Yes, I have reported all of the above to the investigator (as well as to the police when I handed over the image files of the wreckage).",

      "text": "So I've been working at this company for about 8 months now as a marketing coordinator. The pay is decent but not amazing, so I picked up a part-time gig doing freelance graphic design on weekends and some evenings. Nothing crazy, maybe 10-15 hours a week max.\n\nMy boss found out last week when a coworker mentioned seeing my design work on Instagram. Now he's acting like I betrayed the company or something. He called me into his office last friday and basically said he's \"concerned about my commitment\" and that having a second job \"sends the wrong message about priorities.\"\n\nThe thing is, I've never missed work, never been late, and my performance reviews have been solid. I do my freelance stuff entirely on my own time and it's not even in the same industry - we do B2B marketing and my side work is mostly small business logos and social media graphics.\n\nHe didn't outright tell me to quit the second job, but he made it pretty clear he's not happy about it. He also mentioned something about \"reviewing my workload\" which honestly sounds like a threat.\n\nI checked my employment contract and there's nothing about not being allowed to have other work. The employee handbook has some vague language about \"conflicts of interest\" but my freelance clients aren't competitors or anything.\n\nI'm kind of torn because I actually like this job and the team, but I also need the extra income. The freelance work helps me pay down student loans faster and I'm saving up for a house down payment. Plus I genuinely enjoy the creative work.\n\nHas anyone else dealt with this? Am I being unreasonable for wanting to keep both jobs? I feel like as long as I'm doing good work and not violating any actual policies, what I do in my free time shouldn't matter.\n\nStarting to think I might need to have another conversation with him or maybe talk to HR, but I don't want to make things worse. Any advice would be appreciated.",

And do you guys think I am making a good decision with changing from permanent to contract roles? \n\n\n*Update*\nThank you all for your comments/career advice. Tho 1-3 people think I posted in wrong sub. \nMore details on the contract: I am NOT LIVING IN US and contract includes Medical insurance, 24D Leave,5% contribution in my Retirement Fund, and taxi Allowance. So benefit wise, it also adds more. \nTbh, the role is not my forte but my dream job and I am also shocked when this was offered to me as I have no work exp in the technology that they are using.",

I had an hour long commute one way, and I have a family at home. \n\nJuly of this year, I gave my notice. My boss begged me to stay, asked me to commit to a minimum of 6 months, and offered to fire one of my coworkers who I had complained about on multiple occasions for his grotesquely inappropriate behavior. I agreed to stay, but not for any of the above listed reasons. He fired my coworker that Friday. \n\nMonday September 30th rolls around, boss expected me to stay late to wrap up end of month. I had been asking him all day to help me wrap up so I could leave to pick up my kids (I’ve stayed every other end of month up until this point). He completely ignored me all day. When I left at 5pm, he said “okay, I guess I’m just going to do your job for you”. \n\nThat was the last interaction I had with him. While he was in his office, I quietly packed up all of my personal belongings from my desk and left. \n\nI sent him an email telling him my notice from July was effective immediately. I’m not 100% sure if he got it, but I got 3 texts the following day asking why I no-called no-showed. He got his boss to call me, and finally, HR called me. I ignored every single of one of them. \n\nETA: For those wondering, I was an auto service advisor for a dealership. We were always at 75% staff capacity because they take FOREVER to hire. And they have horrible paperwork process, so most of my late nights were spent filing paperwork from the 20-25 appointments I would check in daily.",

      "text": "I’m male. I recently applied for a job at a health insurance company’s call center. I have extensive experience in working customer service. Combined I have maybe about 9 years experience. 6 years at one , 2 years at another after that one during the pandemic and almost a year at the one I’m currently at. Things aren’t GREAT at the call center I’m at ,but I had a friend tell me they were hiring at another one for a little more than I’m making right now. So I applied. \n\nEverything  seemed to be going great , I spoke to the recruiter and she scheduled an interview. Right off the bat things felt a little bit shaky the interview was supposed to be with the department’s director and the head of the HR department , the director wasn’t able to make it so I had to continue from home over the phone , I was ok with it. The in-person interview went GREAT. The over the phone interview I was quizzed about some of the department’s duties and I answered them to the best of my abilities, now this is where it gets interesting .\n\n\nThe recruiter called me with a job offer for  LESS than she initially stated (19-20/hr) they offered me what I’m currently making (18/hr) so it really makes no sense for me to start a whole new job to be paid the exact same thing. I tell them to “let me think about it”. I hang up , and not 5 mins later I get a call back from the recruiter and she said “Great news! I spoke to the director and he agreed to 19/hr” so I say fuck it and take the job. They tell me I need to go in and meet with the HR lady once more and the VP. So that’s another trip BACK to where the in-person interview was conducted on the exact same day.\n\n\n I get there and I’m only met with the HR lady. She states “So I’m not sure if they told you about some of the policies we have regarding appearance?” I said “yeah no earrings , tattoos covered , and business professional attire”. She replied “yeah..those are some.., how long is your hair?”  I’ve been growing my hair since 2018 I always keep it neat and tidy tied up in a bun when  I’m in a professional setting.  I replied “it reaches my waist”  she then said “ohh well for men it can’t go past your shoulders, they’re very traditional here”.   \n\n\nI told her “Im not cutting my hair , that’s not something I can do”  not just for my own personal reasons but honestly if she had to ASK ME how long my hair was , does it matter ? If you can’t tell just by looking at my hair how long it is it SHOULDN’T matter!  She then said “I wish they would’ve told you , now I feel bad about making you drive back down here.” She asked if I had anymore questions I pointed at her and said “So it’s only men who can’t wear earrings then ?” Because she was wearing her earrings  and she goes “yeah they’re very traditional here” I didn’t wanna be THAT GUY and go “that’s kinda sexist isn’t it?” So I just said “oh ok”. She said “ill see if they can make an exception for you but generally the answer is no and I’ll send these forms home for you if they do so you don’t have to drive here again.”\n\n\nAnyways I got no call lol and my friend who initially told me about the job got hired for 20 and I was offered 18 because apparently I didn’t answer the questions I was quizzed on well enough BUT my friend who hadn’t been in an office job for 3 years answered “I haven’t been in an office job for a while but with a refresher course I’d be fine” and they just GAVE him the max amount lol. Guys I’m sick of this corporate and I understand Walter White more than ever lol.",

      "text": "Basically the title. We decided to travel to London for a week in July as we’ve never been. Flights/hotel/etc. are all paid in full and non refundable. We’ve talked about traveling together since middle school and now we’re finally able to find the time/money/resources to do it.\n\nMy friend started her new job 2 months ago and she let them know of this preplanned trip. Initially, it was no issue. But now that it’s getting closer to the date, suddenly it’s, “Other people are going to be off, you’re still in your 90-day probationary period, we can’t have this many people off work,” etc etc. \n\nShe called me yesterday to let me know. We’re currently getting our documents/screenshots ready to build a case. Wish us luck. Worst comes to absolute worst, there are always other jobs out there and who knows when we’ll have this opportunity to travel again?",

There are NOT plenty of jobs on base, let alone ones that would let me remain in Japan with SOFA status. Now that I'm no longer employed by Military AutoSource, everything that allowed me to be on base is invalid, so I can't do anything to look for work in person.\n\nWhen I contacted a higher up with MAS to ask about getting my pay for the week, paperwork related to being let go, and if there is anyone in HR to talk to. I get told there is no paperwork, I'm just fired, \"I'm HR,\" and a non-answer about payment for my work.\n\nI still have zero information on how much and when I will be paid and I have 90 days from August 1st to find a new SOFA status job or return to the US because I was required to enter Japan on a tourist visa. I can't find a regular job without having to leave the country and re-enter at a later date on a work visa.\n\nI'm hoping that I can find something here in Japan, but I am talking to my parents about staying at their house since I have no place of my own to return to in the US.",

I'm always keeping my options open for new opportunities, but I'm not actively applying anywhere at the moment, and had no intention of leaving anytime in the foreseeable future. I asked where he heard this, and he mentioned that my linked in page said that I'm open to work and actively looking. It said that because I hadn't logged onto my linked in account since I was unemployed. I still feel awkward that he stalked my linked in page and confronted me about it.

I wake up everyday wanting to preferably die than go for a whole full day to a place I absolutely don’t want to be at. I have no idea how can people live like this. My job wasn’t even that bad (IT support) but simply the amount of life I have to throw out just to continue throwing it out… everyday. I have no real savings, I don’t know what’s it gonna be. Somehow I’m happy though. In three days I won’t have to wake up to my fucking alarm. \n\nEDIT: a month later; I've found a remote job that pays way more. I'm still during onboarding and everybody in the team including my DM is so nice.",

      "text": "Well, that basically sums it up. The Case Management job I applied to last year offered the lowest salary, and only required a high school diploma. After a 3 round interview process with HR, a panel of 16 housing managers, and my supervisors, I was offered the job. \n\nAfter working in the company for about a year, my supervisors encouraged me to go back to school so I could complete my degree in psychology and get promoted to the senior case management position. My supervisor asked HR if I would qualify for the education incentive program since I wanted to go back to school to finish my degree, and HR said yes. When I graduated with my bachelor's in psychology and completed my degree, I reached out to HR about getting a promotion and a pay raise. \n\nAfter weeks of ghosting me, they responded by telling me no, and insisted that I lied to them about having a degree during my interview. Keep in mind I was offered THE LOWEST PAYING JOB BECAUSE DURING THE INTERVIEW I MADE IT CLEAR THAT I WAS STILL TRYING TO FINISH SCHOOL.\n\nAfter 4 weeks of trying to reach them i finally managed to get them on the phone. When I asked how it would make sense for me to lie about having a degree to get my job, when I applied to the lowest paying position because I did not have my degree..they refused to answer. \n\nWhen I reminded HR that they gave me permission to enroll in the education incentive program because I did not finish my degree...they refused to answer. \n\n\nThey asked me to provide evidence about what I was referring to. When I emailed all of the transcripts and applications they reviewed and signed to approve my course registration at the beginning of every semester, they refused to look at it and told me that I needed to \"let them finish their investigation \". \n\nThey promised me they would read the documents I sent. It has been 4 weeks, they haven't read a thing I've sent, and they still suspended me. The supervisors that encouraged me to enroll in the program are angry and confused, and I am angry and confused. My union representative told me they've been suspending a lot of other people as well and there's nothing they can do about it. \n\nNext time an employer tells me that \"we're like a family\" and that \"everyone sticks together \" I'm running for the hills.",

Which are the signatures and the \"thankyou emails\".\n\nStep 3: The employer has the right to accept or challenge your petition. If they challenge the petition you will go back and forth in emails or over the phone if nothing works before the deadline then you both will be requires to show up in person to a hearing. Where an administrative judge will determine if you proved that you have 30% of eligible employees and determine the type of vote.\n\nStep 4: The election: They only count the submitted votes if 1 person votes but votes in favor it passes, as the person starting the union its your responcibility to make sure people show up because the company if they're fighting will try to get anti union people to vote.\n\nStep 5: Congratulations you have a union, now you need to create a constitution and fill out tax documents for the union.",

However, shit just keeps getting worse. \n\nToday, the state officially denied my unemployment. I plan to appeal. But from my research, this takes time. \n\nMy daughter’s dental work is still delayed. We went to the appointment and I found out that she has several cavities and will need her teeth capped. The estimate since she’s uninsured still? $5000. FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS. That’s not even including anesthesia, which would be billed separately. I finally got contacted by Medicaid and I am faxing them the document they requested shortly. But I have no idea if they even cover dental. Nobody can give me an answer. \n\nI almost checked myself into a psych hospital the other day because my PCP won’t refill any of my medication, which I am now out of, without a med check. That is $150, which I don’t have. I am considering it again at this point, but who knows if they’d even take me since I’m uninsured. \n\n40 job applications in so far and have gotten absolutely nothing back. Moral of the story, don’t fucking trust HR and definitely join a union. \n\nI hope my next update will be with better news.",

As soon as I mentioned that it's illegal to not pay for training under the ESA in Ontario, she immediately backtracked, saying she will speak to the payroll operator tomorrow and that my payment is likely just on hold till next period. \n\nShe then called me and assured me that I'll definitely be paid for training, and that my case is different because unlike the other hires, I'm a resident of Canada and not an international student. She then told me I can continue to work there and don't have to hand in my uniform.\n\nI'm pretty sure she realized I wasn't some naive international student and can't just be easily exploited like that.

      "text": "Didn't get my direct deposit last night like I usual do, then when I checked my paystub on ADP I noticed that it didn't have my direct deposit info on it. Asked my boss about it and he said \"it is a privilege and I can suspend it for anyone at any time.\" The reason for this I can only assume is from me calling out due to an illness, which I provided a doctor's note for. I was also in the ER about a week before Christmas and I called him to let him know I was in the ER and that I potentially might not be able to make it, his response was \"if you don't come in, you're done.\" But he wants to talk about it in person. Now I will be the first to admit that I might not be the best performer, coming from being a mechanic most of my career to now being a salesperson, but my numbers aren't that low, but I do agree they could be a lot higher. It's whatever I guess, I'm just venting because I honestly think that this is insane. Now I have to wait til my check gets delivered to the main store every payday and go pick it up. Just lovely\n\nEdit: since a few people have asked this in the comments, I don't think the company is going under or having cash flow issues. We're a decently sized mobile phone authorized retailer in my area. There's like 8 or 9 stores in my district alone, and there's stores in 3 or 4 states. There's around 80 to 90ish stores total I believe \n\nEdit2: Another thing, I'm not implying that my pay is being held illegally. Normal paydays are Fridays, and I usually receive my DD Thursday nights around 11pm. The main point of the post was the \"suspension of my DD privilege\"\n\nEdit3: I made a comment saying that I wasn't the only one, saying that the 5 people I reached out to also didn't receive DD, that was a typo. I meant to say that I *AM* the only one that didn't receive their DD\n\nFINAL UPDATE: I was indeed *not* fired, my check is in my hand, omw to deposit now. He didn't talk to me like he said, he had an employee in his office and had that employee give me my check. Idk man lol. Thank you to everyone for all the support and for the opinions and for all the advice! Love you guys! Happy Friday!",

For one thing, it takes away a benefit from employees who have been there the longest and would have received more vacation. Now a 20 year employee and a new hire are the same.  Sure, you have unlimited time off, but if there are things to be done it is going to be hard to take it.  A real hidden benefit to the employer is in when you leave. Normally when you leave you'd get any unpaid vacation.  Now there is none.   Overall, its a good way to encourage turnover and replace long time workers with younger and cheaper folks.",

I was told I was their star employee, hardest worker,etc etc. They also told me I was next in line for promotional opportunities, as I come from an employer where I was in a supervisory role. \n\nA few weeks later our lead role is fired, and interviews are opened for the position. I obviously interview for the role. I'm told by higher ups I did great,keep doing what I'm doing, I'm a top candidate etc. Today they tell everyone on the team that I was not given the promotion. In private they tell me I'm simply too new and don't have the knowledge. However, I am a frequent point of contact for EVERYONE else on my team who has questions. I am also the first to sign up for overtime shifts, and always go the extra mile.\n\nI feel pissed off. I feel like I bust my ass every day, for nothing. To watch people who are half as good as I am be moved into roles with more benefits and higher pay. All day at work I've been pissed, and can't bring myself to even give a fuck about my job now. I should have just taken the offer I was given elsewhere for a bit more money. Has anyone else experienced this sort of frustration?",

      "text": "I work as a private teacher for a tutoring agency. At first I thought it was well paid, but considering the hours I spend preparing my lessons for every kid, it's barely the minimum legal wage per hour.\nMost of my clients are upper class. Also I'm overqualified for this job but I have no job opportunities currently, and no activity would be worse.\nOne of my client is a super rich family, owner of the biggest luxury dealership company. The client expects* from me that I'll coach her kid to have excellent grades so they could go to the best universities. I'll add that in my agency, I'm the only teacher in the discipline I'm teaching. For the kid, it's their last year of high school so the grades in the discipline are the more important and decisive for their future. \n\nWeeks ago, my employer had a whole rant on me that I should shorten my lessons, or she would have to pay me more, and she would have less taxes reduction (in my country, when you pay for private services, you can get taxes reduction). So, I must rush all the lessons I've prepared. I should adapt every week with what length she decided. Since then, I go to their place with anxiety, feeling like I'm always walking on eggshells.\n The worst being that her kid is far from dumb, they're' really interested and understand quickly, I have a great time with them. \n\nI've talked about it with the agency, they're on my side, because my contract says at the kid level, it should not be rush the year preparing high school diploma. \nBut the mother doesn't want to hear it. She wants me to be as quick as possible or she'll have to pay me more, and have less taxes reduction.\nCherry on top : the last session I had with the kid, I ask to go to the bathroom. I did my thing and went to wash my hands. I've seen a soap from a brand I did not know and was curious because I thought it stank for a hand soap (I've worked in cosmetics field)  and googled the name of the brand. I eventually found the soap to see the perfume notes.\nThe soap was 65€ (~73USD$). She pays me less per month (64€)  than the price of her bathroom soap. I'm worth less than the thing that wash her hands when she takes a dump. \n\nHopefully I still have ego and knows my value. She wanted me to help her kid preparing for the best universities in our country, she just lost her best asset in this project. \n\nTomorrow I'll call the agency and stop the contract with her. I'll be free. \n\nEdits : typo on *expects* - 73USD$ corrected - stinked replaced by stank \nEnglish is not my mother tongue, so there are grammar mistakes. \nIf you want to call me out about it, just remember \"you speak English because it's the only language you know, I speak English because it's the only language *you* know\"\n  \nAddenda :\n- Thank y'all for your kind words. I'll add some context : I'm only doing this job temporarily, I'm not willing to do this as my main activity. I'm not in the teaching field either, I could teach my discipline in high school but there is no current position available in my area (we are few). The field I'm working in is saturated and I need financial security first. \n- I cannot negociate my salary because it's set by the agency. I'll quit as soon as I'll find something more secure for me. \n\n- I cannot do freelance either because freelance is more sustainable when you're sure to have a good income with it, the freelance are taxed a lot by the state here. \n\n- However I love teaching. Most of the families I work with are considerate towards me. That one is the exception. And because the agency is letting me close their contract without conquences, I'll do it. \n\n- I cut my notifications. I didn't expect my post to blew up this big. I wish I could answer all of you, but I love sleeping. Thanks again for your support!!!",

      "text": "Seriously, every time I see posts from American workers, I feel like I'm reading dispatches from some alternate reality where basic human dignity got voted off the island.\n\nLet's talk sick days. You know what happens when I'm sick in Canada? I stay home. I don't lose pay for the first few days, and I definitely don't have to choose between recovering and paying rent. Meanwhile, y'all are showing up to work with 102-degree fevers because taking a day off means you can't buy groceries. That's not dedication that's survival mode.\n\nAnd don't get me started on your \"right to work\" laws. We call that \"right to fire you for breathing wrong\" up here. In most provinces, if your employer wants to get rid of you without cause, they owe you notice or severance. You can't just get walked out because your manager had a bad morning. The fact that this is somehow controversial in America blows my mind.\n\nThen there's the student loan situation. I graduated university with about $15k in debt, which I paid off in three years working part-time retail. My American friends are telling me about $80k+ debt loads that follow them for decades. No wonder you're all trapped in jobs you hate you're basically indentured servants to Sallie Mae.\n\nYour healthcare situation is just dystopian. The number of GoFundMe campaigns I see for basic medical procedures is heartbreaking. We complain about wait times here, but at least a cancer diagnosis doesn't come with bankruptcy papers. You're literally choosing between insulin and rent. In 2025. In the richest country on earth.\n\nThe gig economy stuff is particularly brutal. You've got \"independent contractors\" working 60+ hours a week for Uber or DoorDash with zero benefits, zero job security, and vehicles falling apart from overuse. But hey, at least some tech bro got rich off their desperation, right?\n\nWhat really gets me is how you've been convinced this is normal. Any time someone suggests maybe workers deserve basic dignity, half the comments are about \"bootstraps\" and \"entitled millennials.\" You've been gaslit into thinking that wanting fair wages and humane treatment makes you lazy.\n\nFrom up here, it looks like you're living in a corporate feudalism nightmare, but with better marketing.\n\nI'm not saying Canada's perfect we've got our own issues with housing costs and wage stagnation. But the baseline of worker protections you're missing isn't some socialist fantasy. It's just basic civilization.\n\nHow are you not rioting constantly? Genuinely asking.\n\nStay strong down there. You deserve so much better than what you're getting.",

Just do it lol.\n\nI can honestly say every job I’ve ever interviewed for has had atleast one drawback, like seriously maybe it’s a reflection of me but I’ve never had a workplace that has been 110% honest with what the job entails or has completely respected workers rights. I’m not saying I’m the best worker to ever exist, but atleast I can be honest about that, why bother posting an ad if you’re going to change the conditions of employment at the interview? \n\nMy job was supposed to be 8:30pm-5pm and at the interview I was told some days I’d start 8:15 and we don’t usually finish after 7, I am regularly doing 8:15-6:15 or even 6:30 days, which in all fairness I had the choice to say no.\nThe last job I interviewed for advertised part time and then told me they were actually looking for full time, again yes sure my bad for not withdrawing but I don’t understand why the job ads are never accurate or atleast updated.\n\nAs for my job itself, I literally had like 2.5 days of training and then had to raw dog it the past 5-6 months, month 4 was my peak, I’ve stopped getting headaches but now I feel like my skills are almost going backwards.\n\nI’m looking into pivoting into a job in a field I studied earlier this year, I’m glad I got to experience this because it’s solidified that I actually don’t like the type of work I’m currently doing.",

I know this is a mainly American concept with other countries providing cashiers seating. Remember working at cricket wireless, and apparently, our district manager had to beg the owners to let us sit down and no one was in the shop. \n\nThey wanted us to stand all day, i thought it was horrendous! I just don't understand the concept i think the only people who might complain about it now is boomers, and maybe gen X. The rest of us wouldn't have a care in the world if a cashier or well anyone would sitting down. \n\nI actually tried to get a job at Costco, and was denied due to them not allowing receipt and membership checkers to sit down. Saying to me that there company policy trumps ADA, which i call bull! A part of me want to apply and get a doctors note saying i periodically need to be in a wheelchair. \n\n  \nThankfully now i am in a job, i really really enjoy and it's just going to get even better! it's easy and i get to work from home.",

Watching U.S. work culture from Europe feels like watching a never-ending episode of Black Mirror, but everyone’s been gaslit into thinking it’s \"just how things are.\"\n\nLet’s start with paid vacation. You guys get what, 0 federally mandated days off? Most Americans I’ve met are happy with 10 days a year like it’s a privilege. In most of Europe, we get at least 20-25 days of paid vacation BY LAW. And that doesn’t include public holidays. You guys get grilled for taking a week off, while our employers basically expect us to disappear for most of August.\n\nAnd then there’s healthcare. Jesus. You tie one of the most basic human rights—access to healthcare—to employment. You lose your job, you lose your health insurance. Meanwhile over here, I can break a leg, go to the ER, get surgery, and not pay a single cent out of pocket. You get an ambulance ride and it’s like \"congrats, that’s $3,000.\"\n\nDon’t get me started on maternity and paternity leave. Most U.S. mothers are back to work within WEEKS. WEEKS! We give people months, sometimes up to a year, with partial or full pay, and dads too. It’s considered basic decency. But apparently in the U.S., bonding with your newborn is less important than boosting quarterly profits.\n\nThen there’s the culture of overwork. Hustle. Grind. \"If you’re not working 60 hours a week, you don’t want it bad enough.\" No thanks. In most of Europe, if your boss texts you after work hours, that’s harassment. In France it’s literally illegal to expect people to check emails after work. You guys brag about having to work weekends. We riot.\n\nNo job security, no protections, no dignity. At-will employment? You can be fired for any reason or none at all? That’s not freedom—that’s instability. People working 2–3 jobs just to survive. You have billionaires in bunkers and nurses living out of their cars.\n\nYou’ve normalized corporate feudalism and called it \"the American Dream.\"\n\nAnd somehow you’ve all been convinced that asking for basic labor rights makes you a lazy communist? Over here, even the centrists support unions and public healthcare. You can be right-wing and still agree people shouldn’t die because they can’t afford insulin.\n\nI’m not saying Europe’s perfect. But holy hell, compared to the U.S., we’re living in a damn utopia. How are you not rioting in the streets daily?\n\nSending love and solidarity from across the Atlantic. You deserve better.

She didn’t want that, so she called and opted out at the end of 2023. Got it in writing. We thought that was done. But then in 2025 they raised her paycheck contribution without permission and enrolled her right back into the automatic increase program anyways.\n\nWhen we pushed back, the plan administrator told us her opt-out was only good for one year. Nowhere in the paperwork did it say that. None of the annual notices spelled it out. And when we filed a complaint with the Department of Labor, they basically said, “Yep, that’s legal.” Because the SECURE 2.0 Act (2022) lets them do it and doesn’t explicitly require permanent opt-outs.\n\nSo unless you catch it every year, your paycheck gets smaller and smaller, whether you want it to or not. And for the record: No, we’re not anti-retirement or anti-saving. We want actual control over our investments. But nope. The US government decided Wall Street should get a little bit of everyone's money first, with this clever little trick.\n\nNobody warned us. Nobody explained. And honestly, I doubt most workers even realize this is happening. It’s legalized wage skimming dressed up as “*helping you save*.”",

      "text": "Not here to mock anyone - I’m from Western Europe, and honestly, once you take a real look, the American work/life system just feels like straight-up dystopia.\nNo paid vacation guaranteed. No real sick leave. Health care tied to employment. “At-will” firing. Union-busting is standardized. Insane rent. Debt for basic education. Credit scores as a leash...\n\nAnd the worst part even your so-called \"progressive\" politicians never seriously push for what we consider basic rights - universal healthcare, tenant protections, a decent minimum wage, or like actual work-life balance.\n\nMeanwhile, your media exports this myth of American greatness - the land of freedom, hustle culture, the self-made dream. And the wild part is that a lot of people around the world still buy into it. They envy the lifestyle, without realizing it's built on burnout, fear, and financial precarity.\n\nSo here’s my honest question, how do you keep going ? Why aren’t more people criticising this system ? Is it propaganda ? Lack of alternatives ? Fear of losing even the little you have ?\n\nThis isn’t judgment - it’s disbelief. From here, it straight up looks like the system is chewing you up and somehow convincing the rest of the world to call it freedom. And now that same shit is slowly creeping in over here too.\n\nI'm really curious to hear your perspectives.",

I, a server and cashier, was then told to deliver the food order alone. When I expressed my extreme discomfort and concern for my personal safety—being a young female out alone in the dark and engaging with strangers—I was accused of insubordination and threatened with a write-up and possibly termination. It wasn't until I asked if they would be okay with their 20-something daughter being out alone in the dark that they begrudgingly agreed and had one of our male staff make the delivery—you know…what they should’ve done in the first place. \n\nIs it surprising? No. Is it still pathetic, exploitative and evil that’d they’d be willing risk their employees safety for like $50 bucks? Absolutely. \n\nWhat disgusting injustice did an employer try to subject you or someone you know to? \n\nEDIT: People brought up a really valid point—that regardless of gender, no one should have to be sent out in the dark alone with strangers. That’s absolutely 100% correct, and I realize I didn’t clarify that my male coworker had expressed he was completely comfortable and up for the task. Why they asked me instead is a mystery, but I suspect it’s because they don’t like me and didn’t care what happened to me anyway—but that’s neither here nor there.",

      "text": "I’ve worked several jobs here in North Carolina (especially in the Triad) over the past few years, and I’m seriously starting to wonder why are there so many toxic, unprofessional employers here?\n\nAt one job at manufacturing company, when I put in a PTO request for a medically necessary surgery to fix my nose, my boss *seriously* asked if I was getting sexual reassignment surgery. Not only was that invasive and inappropriate—it was totally uncalled for. Same boss also made a weird comment about me pulling my hair back in a bun to keep it out of my eye while photo graphic products, saying it made me look like \"gay hipster” . To top it off, one day when I was looking at a photo my babysitter sent of my child, he yells for all the office to here “Stop looking at porn.” Like—what?\n\nThen at a different job at a car dealership, my boss asked why I couldn’t photograph cars outside when it was 15°F and the building had no power. My fingers were going numb. They also tied part of my pay to video production tasks. But when I actually got good at it and started making a decent amount of money, I was told to stop doing the videos because I was “taking time away from photographing cars”—even though I was still uploading the same number of cars as before and just adding an extra step.\n\nAnd as if that wasn’t enough, another job at a design and advertising firm literally fired me *two days after my wedding*. No explanation. No warning. Just gone. No idea what I did wrong. No feedback. Just booted right out.\n\nI have a few other stories from early in my career that are all on theme that are in NC.\n\nIs this just me? Has anyone else experienced this kind of garbage working in NC? I’m really trying to find a place where professionalism and basic respect are the norm, but it’s been a struggle.\n\nWould love to hear if others have been through similar things—or if you’ve found an actually decent employer here. Because I’m getting burned out from the nonsense and considering looking for employment in a different state or country.",

After the initial shock, I immediately sat down with my manager at HealthPlus Insurance (where I'd been a claims analyst for 3+ years) to discuss accommodations during my treatment.\n\nMy oncologist recommended I work remotely during chemo to reduce infection risk. I had documentation, a doctor's note, everything. My direct manager seemed supportive until HR got involved.\n\nTheir response? \"Remote work is a privilege, not an accommodation.\" They claimed my role was \"impossible to perform remotely\" despite the ENTIRE DEPARTMENT working from home during COVID just months earlier.\n\nThe \"compromise\" they offered was to let me take unpaid FMLA on my chemo days but required me in-office all other days. When I pointed out this violated ADA, the HR director had the audacity to say: \"We employ 49 people, we're exempt from ADA requirements.\"\n\nI tried to make it work - showing up between treatments despite fatigue, nausea, and a compromised immune system during flu season. My performance obviously suffered.\n\nAfter my second round of chemo, they put me on a \"performance improvement plan\" for missing metrics. Two weeks later, I was terminated for \"failing to meet productivity standards\" - literally while my white blood cell count was at its lowest.\n\nThe final insult? They contested my unemployment claim saying I was fired \"for cause.\"\n\nI got a lawyer. Turns out they actually had 53 employees (they counted part-timers differently), making them subject to ADA. Yesterday we filed with the EEOC.\n\nThis company's entire business is HEALTH INSURANCE but they couldn't show basic humanity to someone going through cancer treatment.\n\nCompanies don't deserve loyalty.

I don't know if I'd go so far as to say it's compromising my health and safety beside the effects on the immune system as I'm not in the elements more than a few minutes at a time, but it is thirty or more times a shift. It's pretty miserable to be in wet clothes for an entire shift. I can't find anything but recommendations from OSHA, WISHA (I work in Seattle), and Dept. of Labor and Industries. Nothing I've seen specifically addresses this situation. Can anyone direct me to a resource?\n\nEdit: Thanks for the responses. I've started wearing a rain jacket that I have in my car, which helps, but doesn't cover me from store to car. Plus, I'm annoyed that I have to be stealthy just to have basic protection against the elements. I like the clear poncho idea. I might give that a try. I was hoping to recite some obscure OSHA code back to the manager if confronted, but I guess I'll settle for a more practical mildly unjust solution.",

      "text": "I think some important context is that I'm autistic and have ADHD, so when someone tells me they want to have an honest conversation and that I should tell them any concerns I have, I assume they actually mean that.\n\nI had a job interview on a factory floor last week (yes, I am the one who jokingly asked how to bomb that interview, turns out I didn't need any help doing that). Woman from HR who is in charge of interviews that day tells me she's going to explain the role and everything bad about it so I know what I'm in for, and that if I have any concerns, I should let her know.\n\nShe tells me there's a lot of \"banter\" on the shop floor (red flag) and that there was only one other woman in my department. I tell her banter is a slight concern because I'm a woman and part of the LGBTQ+ community (I didn't mention that I was neurodivergent). She assures me that the company is very inclusive and that I would be fine. She also told me about a female line manager who was also gay (woohoo, they have a token lesbian).\n\nShe tells me it's a dirty, smelly job. I tell her I work with horses so dirty, smelly jobs are what I do.\n\nShe tells me it's dusty. I tell her that my asthma has been controlled up until about last week but I have a doctors appointment and have been prescribed more medication to help me get it back under control. She tells me I can wear a mask on the floor and that that would be fine. I also made sure to ask about PPE, including masks and ear defenders.\n\nShe offers me a second interview, I say yes, and make sure to mention that I also have lab experience and a masters degree so an admin or lab role would also be good if they had any open.\n\nI get to the job centre today and tell my advisor that I have a second interview. He says \"that's not what he feedback says.\"\n\nThe company told the job centre that they were \"taken aback\" by me saying I was gay because they were so, *so* inclusive. They said I had told *them* that I didn't think I was suitable because of my asthma. They said that I worked with horses and was concerned that I \"wouldn't have time\" for the job. I never said *anything* about not having time, I just told her about my previous experience with horses. I don't even have a horse, I just volunteer twice a week which I would stop doing once I got a job. She genuinely just plucked that out of thin air.\n\nThis was my second ever job interview and I've learned that if they ask you to bring up any concerns you have, don't do it. I didn't want this job, especially after she talked it down, but the fact she then lied to the job centre about things I said could have gotten my benefits decreased or revoked altogether. I'm sure this whole post makes me sound naive but I genuinely don't understand the culture of lying around job interviews. She told me to be honest, I was honest, and she still twisted my words. The worst part is that she was lovely, she was genuinely so kind and spoke to me like she was a friend, then stabbed me in the back. I don't even fucking work there.\n\nEdit for clarification: I'm not upset that I didn't get the job, it sounded like a shit job and she made that very clear. I'm upset that, after explaining that her job is to make sure I'm a good fit and that the job is a good fit for me, she lied to my job advisor about my answers, made stuff up, and told me I had a second interview then told my advisor that I hadn't. It made me look bad to my advisor who got me the interview in the first place. I do appreciate the advise on oversharing, though. It was my second real interview and I was told to expand on my answers more in my first interview, so I took that a little too far lol.",

The DOL is still very much investigating things. \n\nYes, all that Trump is doing is horrible for employees and will make things in this country worse. But it's not like he has completely abolished the DOL and the EEOC. Those agencies still exist and are still doing their jobs.

That’s $500–$900 out of pocket and I was okay with that.  \n  \nThat should’ve been the end of it.\n\nBut then the messages kept coming…\n\n* “Can I write you a tax donation receipt?”\n* “Will you be there to help?”\n* “I trust that if you recommended him, everything will be fine.”\n* “I hope this gets him more business.”\n\nThat’s when it hit me, wtf lady!\n\nThis wasn’t about food. Or even help.\n\nIt was about quietly dragging me back in, not just to pay for it, but to own it if anything went wrong.\n\nI don’t like being the fallback when people don’t plan.\n\nIdk what it is these days, is it the economy or the water?",

      "text": "There are some careers (e.g. Nurses, doctors, EMTs, teachers, chef) where you are directly helping people and I can understand how those jobs would be intrinsically meaningful and fufilling. However I think for most people working in standard office jobs, they are most likely helping a company make and sell a product. \n\nThe problem is that:\n1) Especially for larger companies, their individual contribution to the product was so small, it may as well be negligible. This is where the phrase \"just a cog in a machine\" comes in to play. \n2) Unless they own the company, they have absolutely no stake or ownership in the product. Their name will never be attached to it. It will not be a part of their legacy. No one will ever even know they worked on it outside of their immediate friends and family. \n3) this doesn't apply to all companies, but often times the companies product doesn't even improve people's lives. So the product that the worker spent their whole life working on wasnt even a net positive for humanity.\n\nWhen people look back on their careers, most can only say that they played a negligible role in creating a product that isn't even theirs. In my opinion, they essentially did nothing with their working life. \n\nPeople can dress up their careers with all this fancy bullshit lingo, say they \"want to grow\" in their careers, or they are \"excited for the new opportunity\" when they get a new job. If they were being honest, what they really mean is they want to make more money, and they are excited for the new opportunity to make more money.\n\nIn short, most people's careers are inherent meaningless and all they did with their lives is make a pile of money (and that's if they're lucky).",

The EMTALA is the legal framework for preventing \"patient dumping\" - the practice of refusing to treat a patient in a medical emergency due to the lack of ability to pay, thus \"dumping\" them on another institution. This process could continue indefinitely but often ended when the patient died. \n\nHospitals, especially rural hospitals, will be heavily impacted by the reduction in Medicaid. When the MAGA voters see that their personal hospitals are in danger of closing, they will cast about looking for a solution, and they will find one: allow hospitals to refuse treatment to the indigent and conserve resources for those that can pay. \n\nThis is where the hate of illegal immigrants comes in. The Right Wing Echo Chamber will convince MAGA that illegals are the ones stealing healthcare resources, but that under current law, hospitals can't turn anyone away. MAGA will the call for EMTALA to be gutted, likely by simple lack of enforcement (e.g., turning a blind eye to dead homeless people), but quite possibly by a partial or complete repeal of the act. \n\nPlease tell me I'm full of shit, because I've managed to scare myself with this one.",

      "text": "Trump and his 1% buddies are openly threatening to dismantle the government, denaturalize/deport immigrants, threatening political opponents, and tariff our imports to further inflate our economy until it pops. I’m here getting ready to go to work… it’s just surreal. All the warning signs for a fascist hitting office, and some are fucking cheering! The US, a keystone in stomping out Hitler, just elected Cheeto Hitler and it’s driving me crazy. \n\nA lot of people are saying keep your head down for the term and it’ll blow over, but how can I when Trump has all the tools to “Legally” throw away future elections. When he’s threatening political opponents, any queer person for just existing, legal immigrants, public services that MILLIONS OF AMERICANS NEED TO SURVIVE. The wealthy continue to squeeze the US like an orange peel, either for self interest or foreign influence. It’s baffling…. And I’m still getting ready for work.\n\nA lot of people are tired of the meat grinder the is living in the USA. Hell the Healthcare Shooter is an obvious sign of that. But the spirit of the workers, the day to day laborers, feels broken. We’re all dependent on our jobs and public services to survive, unless you have enough money to “fuck the system”…. And I’m getting ready for work.\n\nI’m just fucking tired. Tired of being scared. Tired of worrying if me and my husband are gonna be arrested and executed in a few years because we’re gay and love each other. Tired of struggling to find higher paying jobs only for cost of groceries, expenses, and medical care to rise. Tired of the media not calling a leopard a leopard. Tired of ignorance and hate being disguised as religious righteousness. Tired of blatant hypocrisy. Tired of people worrying about the cost of eggs, instead of half the government openly welcoming Fascism…. And I’m getting ready for work like so many others.\n\nWhy?\n\nBecause I have rent due and bills to pay. Just like my neighbor, just like my mom, and just about everyone here.\n\n\nEdit: to all the comments saying I’m being hysterical. I hope I am. I hope I’m proven wrong. I hope nothing goes wrong the next few years and we move on with the next guy in office. Because I’m terrified if I’m right.",

      "text": "My parents run a small general contractor business (they don't own it they just manage it). They asked me to post job ads for laborers on Indeed. They wanted me to leave out any necessary requirements such as experience or CDL, and set the pay to a variable rate of $18-$25 depending on the employee. That might seem high but minimum wage in my state is $16 and places like Target already pay $18. I tried explaining this to them, as well as the fact that those with experience and/or CDL can make more money elsewhere, but they didn't want to hear it.\n\nFast forward two weeks, and all of the applicants only had retail and fast-food experience. This *shouldn't* be a problem, because the pay is the equal to entry-level jobs, but apparently to my parents it was. They honestly thought that experienced workers and / or those with a CDL would want to work for $18. *\"But it's not $18, it's $18-$25! If they have experience we'll give them more!\"* they tried telling me, but I explained that variable pay rates aren't usually enticing and most people will just assume they'll get paid $18. Their response? \"*No one wants to work anymore\"*. No, it has *nothing* to do with the fact that their job listing was uncompetitive (there's a million general contractors in our area btw), it's obviously the government handing out free money (to CDL holders apparently).\n\nEDIT: Newsweek published an article based on this post ([link](https://www.newsweek.com/fury-contractors-refuse-increase-pay-range-experienced-workers-2038789))",

The company I have been working at for a few years has just about every position that doesn’t need to communicate with a client or external party filled by someone abroad, whether it be drafters, QC, etc... I’m sure it’s the same way at plenty of other companies. That could be so many jobs being filled by Americans if it wasn’t for the greed of executives.\n\nInstead we’re starting a trade war with China, Canada, and Mexico that seems like it’s only going to hurt us short and long term. And of course abandoning our NATO allies as well because why not? Wonderful…",

      "text": "Every time anyone brings up deporting illegal immigrants, everyone jumps in with \"Well, who's going to do the jobs with horrible working conditions that no one wants for $5 hr?\" \nUm, preferably no one because that's shitty. Everyone should have fair wages and working conditions. Like, yes, the price would go up, but those same people also say servers shouldn't rely on tips and should be paid fair wages, and if the price goes up, so be it because they deserve to be able to support themselves and that's worth the additional cost. \n\nImmigrants don't get that same courtesy? Paying them below minimum wages that aren't even protected, arguably living under indentured servatude, that's all just fine and dandy? Exploiting people in hard situations for profit and cheap goods, that's what you stand for?\n\nI'm sorry, but if you're justifying illegal immigration because we should be able to exploit them for cheap labor, you're not really on their side and you're no better than every greedy CEO that justifies exploiting their employees for cheap labor just because they can.",

Putin is banning \"child-free propaganda\" while Elon Musk and his mother are condemning those without children. \n\nThe same people who would gladly replace your employment with AI, deny your healthcare, profit off your labor, erode your basic rights, and prolong your suffering if it would bring them an extra dollar, are the same people calling for you to give birth. \n\nI don't think we need to beat about the bush. We all know why the same group of people who would exploit you would also demand that you give birth. It is the same reason why cattle farmers also want their cattle to breed. In an exploitative system, there must be a continuous source of those exploited. \n\nWhile we try to fight against a system of oppression, the reality is that things won't change quickly enough, if at all. And that brings us to a very uncomfortable truth, something that billionaires have just fallen short of saying outright: our children will just be fodder for the system. \n\nWe work backbreaking jobs to barely be able to afford a house and health insurance? Guess what, our children will likely face the exact same, if not worse. With landlords and corporations buying up more and more houses, our children will live closer to feudalism than our great-grandfathers. Corporations replacing jobs with AI and automation to drive wages down even further? Wait till our children have to fight for jobs against the 20th iteration of ChatGPT, while at the same time being rejected by AI recruiters. \n\nThe point of this post is to surface an unsaid reality that we don't seem to see or acknowledge - we are sending children into a soul crushing system of exploitation. We talk about fighting for a better future for our children but those in power ensure that the odds are against us, while hoping that we would give them new generations of exploitable workers. The only upside to that grim future is that it is a future that our children aren't obliged to exist in.",

      "text": "Hadn't been happy for a while, so I've been shopping around my CV and got a pretty good offer last week, which I accepted. Once I did, I sent my director my resignation via email and copied the head of HR, and the HR rep for my building. Couldn't talk to my director in person because despite claiming there isn't a WFH policy, she was once again WFH. So email.\n\nGet a call from my director a few minutes later. Her concern wasn't that I was resigning. Her concern was that I had copied HR, and \"that's not how we do things around here\". All I can say is best of luck with that attitude, honestly.\n\nUpdate: really appreciate everyone's advice and support and well wishes. Just to clarify, she said everything over the phone, and eventually responded via email accepting the resignation. Since it was to join a competitor, the resignation was with immediate effect, so I've been taking a much needed break before starting my new job.\n\nHOWEVER, yesterday I noticed that they accidentally paid me my full salary, and now there's a hold on my account for the salary payment AND the other funds in there. Yes this is illegal, and yes I will be escalating the matter if it's not resolved by close of business today. I dont mind the hold on the incorrect salary amount, but illegally depriving me access to the rest of my funds? Nope, not gonna happen. Stay tuned.\n\nUpdate 2: should have mentioned, I worked for a bank, so yes my employer placed a hold on my salary in my account. Anyhoo, since I'm now *just* a customer (who just happens to know exactly who to call), I formally queried the holds. I got confirmation that my former director was the one who instructed operations support to place both holds on my account. And because a formal query was submitted via email, with tons of people copied, she authorized the release of both holds. Including the one I didn't have an issue with for the overpaid final salary. Which means the holds were BS in the first place. Anyway, I'm not touching the overpaid salary because I'm not trying to burn bridges within the industry unnecessarily. But I do plan to formally escalate the illegal hold and the hilarious response to my resignation notice. If there's an update worth sharing, I will. If not, cheers folks, y'all have been great.",

      "text": "Got laid off from my job this week. I was the top performer and definitely gave a lot more than what was required. It hurt, however I have a second job as a server/bartender and am also in the Army Reserve. I will scrape by. \n\nMy wife works for the city and 50% of her department has been laid off. She was told that the remaining employees are not getting pay raises this year, despite it specifically being in her contract when she was hired on. We both have graduate degrees and are high performers. I take a lot of pride in my work ethic, however it seems like both my wife and I have been taken advantage of with little to show for it. My wife and I are/were vastly underpaid for our positions. It felt like I was working for scraps and that all my effort and hard work is for nothing. \n\nWe are both still young, in our early twenties. A bright and secure future just doesn’t seem attainable. I count my blessings because neither of us are in debt, however children, home ownership and traveling seem like this far off goal we will never be able to reach. \n\nMy family doesn’t understand what it is like. I have clawed tooth and nail for what I have. I have wasted so much precious time that could’ve been spent with family or friends for scraps. Long days and long nights studying, and working with four hours of sleep and one meal a day. 80-120 hour work weeks for months on end. Tuesday was my first day off since September. \n\nIt feels as if all we sacrificed has been for nothing. The opportunity that existed for my parents and grandparents is not there for me and I am a fool for expecting that it would be. \nThe American Dream is dead. We are Sisyphus, fated to eternal labor. However, I do not know if I can find it within myself to embrace the present and find peace in the process.",

      "text": "BTW, this is not in America, so US labor laws don't apply here.\n\nThis was a small team of 10 people that the manager was assigned to. Myself included. I was the last person to be hired on the team. Everybody was my \"senpai\". And on the first day I worked there, they called a team meeting after work. We log off our computers at 4:55 PM, go to the meeting room, and we clocked out at 5:15 PM. Every day like clock work. I said, \"no problem. That's an extra 2 and half hours on the biweekly paycheck. And we didn't have to do any actual work except listen?\"\n\nWhen my first pay day came, I saw my full 80 hours, but the extra 2.5 hours were nowhere to be found. So I asked a couple of the guys if they only got paid 80 hours too. They all confirmed it. We were not getting paid for these meetings. The shift ends and once again the manager called for the daily team meeting and to log off at 4:55 PM then head to the meeting room. I do so.\n\nAnd so I sit there for 5 minutes. As soon as it hit 5:00 PM. I get up and say, I need to be somewhere important (with everyone's eyes on me), the manager says \"OK\", I leave the room, clock out and go home.\n\nThe next day, I do the same. And again and again. The manager never stops me. Then the manager pulls me to the side one day and asks what's this \"important thing\" that I need to get to after work every day. And I tell him it's a personal matter and he leaves it at that.\n\nPretty soon. It catches on. The other guys start leaving right after me. And eventually, within a matter of days of me starting to leave at 5, everyone else started doing it too.\n\nThe manager started scheduling the meetings for 4:40 PM. All it took was one person to not take this shit anymore.",

      "title": "Anyone else noticing the sudden push to get people into the trades?",
      "text": "It feels like lately there's this big cultural push to steer people toward the skilled trades plumbing, electrical, welding, carpentry, etc. Like if it’s some kind of hidden golden ticket to financial freedom or a way to taunt people who went to college.\n\nMost of the people saying this stuff I dont think have ever actually worked in the trades,maybe only as an owner,managemer or buy my course to scale your business types.\n\nI always hear “My buddy’s a (insert skilled trades job title) and makes six figures!” But they always leave out a few key details:\n\n* That “six figures” came from working 60–70 hours a week, every week.\n* When you break it down, that’s only about **\\$27 an hour** for physically brutal, dangerous and sometimes exhausting labor. \n* Some of those guys own their own business too, which makes them an entrepreneur, not a regular employee. So it skews the numbers quite a bit.\n* Also you almost always need thousands of dollars in tools *payed.out of pocket* to work. Imagine going to McDonald's and needing to provide your own fryer to be a fry cook.\n* And when you get sent out of town you get to hang out with a bunch of mentally unstable drunks/junkies.\n\n\n\nI think its sill how even unions inflate their wages by tossing in the *value* of the pension and healthcare into the hourly rate, which makes the numbers look better than your actual paycheck. Like having health insurance and a 401k is some kind of elite perk when its the bare minimum.\n\nHonestly, it makes me wonder if the trades are *so amazing,* why is there always a shortage? Maybe it's not a shortage of workers, but a shortage of people willing to get worked into the ground for glorified fast food wages dressed up as something noble.\n\nAnd something else I don’t get.\n\nWhy do so many of the older trades guys seem *proud* of how much abuse they took?\n\nLike, they’ll straight-up brag about missing their kids’ birthdays, working through injuries, and getting screamed at by bosses for years—as if that’s some badge of honor.\nYou didn’t get paid extra for that. You just gave your time, your health, and your sanity to people who now drive brand-new trucks while you limp to work with a worn-out back.\n\nThey pat themselves on the back for being “tough” or “old school,” but all I see is a generation that got exploited and now expects younger workers to go through the same thing—just so they can feel like it was worth it.\n\nIt’s like Stockholm Syndrome, but for job sites.\n\nYou shouldn’t be proud that you sacrificed time with your family to make some owner rich. That’s not character that’s exploitation. And if you’re telling the next generation to do the same? You’re not giving advice. You’re perpetuating the cycle.\n\nI’m not anti-trades. If someone loves working with their hands, that's awesome. But the way this whole thing is being marketed lately feels more like a desperate push to fill jobs nobody wants by dressing them up as \"honorable\" or \"real work.\"\n\nSorry for the rant but i kinda fell for the skilled trades shortage rhetoric and have been in this industry for a year now. And I understand why nobody wants to do it. Kinda trying to warn people that it isn't all its cracked up to be.\n\nEdit: And before yall go on about that couldn't be me Im in the union. Please read Crowns experience with so called union protection.\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/skilledtrades/comments/1khrgqo/i_was_in_the_union_the_place_that_promises_safety/",

All they have to do is amend the handbook and post a large notice on their bulletin board for the next 60 days alerting employees of the change and their actual rights. \n\nAt one point in time That Brewery publicly called me a liar and a “bad person” for exposing the truth, so… With the evidence I provided that lead to their charge, who’s actually the terrible person? The one who’s violating people’s fundamental rights, or the one who’s whistleblowing on the offenders? \n\nThere are whistleblower protections for a reason, and THAT Brewery & Pub of Pine, Arizona needs to learn what the difference between moral and immoral truly is.\n\nAnyway, that’s that for this case. Although, I’ll keep you posted if that changes because I’ve been getting whiffs of retaliation…. Small town problems after all. Thanks for all the support and following along. ✌🏻 \n\nEdited: my grammar",

      "text": "After waiting a full year, the labor board of my state (CA) is finally doing something about the claim I submitted. I worked at a job for almost a year with 0 meal breaks, and of course 0 rest periods. They finally scheduled a \"conference\" and when I got a hold of a DIR employee, they explained that it's not a hearing at all, it's more like a \"3 way call between me, a mediator, and my ex boss where I throw out a number of how much money I want and we argue about it and if we can't come to a conclusion then an actual hearing is scheduled another year from now\". \n\nHoly crap? Is this really how the law works? I hate that I even have to be on the same call as this woman, let alone argue with her. She was the most awful person I ever worked for.\n\nHere's an example: the way I found out my elderly coworker attempted to end their life was that she was laughing about the attempted overdose and saying \"she couldn't even do that right!\"\n\nYou can imagine how awful it was working for someone like that. She micromanaged, chose someone to pick on that day and screamed at them for probably 30 or more minutes at the end of the day for mistakes that weren't theirs, and would brazenly insult them. After the elderly coworker quit, it was my turn. It was grueling but I had to endure it because my fiancé got into a car accident and couldn't work, we needed the money.\n\nThe \"conference\" is soon and honestly, I'm worried she's going to find a way to come out on top with even this. I have logs, the only other two \"employees\" that might testify in her defense were actually illegally classified independent contractors, but still...I just honestly don't want her to get away with being such an awful boss and person. I worked 10-12 hour days with no food because she or the independent contractors made sure my schedule was so screwed there was absolutely no time to even breathe let alone eat.\n\nThere was one other actual employee who witnessed this and ended up getting targeted as well once I found a better job and got the fuck out, but he's afraid to come forward either even when he doesn't work for her anymore. I'm trying to convince him but he's autistic and just really scared, so I get it. She traumatized basically everyone who worked for her except her precious 1099 workers. I'm hoping my logs are enough, the worker at the labor board I spoke with said the burden of proof is on the defendant with proving that I took breaks, but I'm worried they might have edited my logs (with the software they were using, anyone could edit anyone's clock in logs)\n\nI honestly just don't want to just not deal with it now because of having to deal with someone that messed me up really bad during an awful period of my life, but if I win, I get a pretty big chunk of change. \n\nDoes anyone else have experience with going through the reporting and hearing processes with the labor board?",

      "text": "I work at a furniture warehouse in Minnesota. On multiple occasions, the business owner, or the sales staff have brought their kids to work with them. I wouldn't necessarily have a problem with them being supervised in the office, but they are instead allowed to roam the warehouse without their parents. We have heavy machinery, saws and power tools, and box cutters, as well as very tall racks and shelves that they frequently try to climb. Not only is this all incredibly unsafe, but it's unfair to the warehouse crew to expect them to provide a free daycare to the owner and sales people. It is not a safe environment for children, nor are we childcare professionals, it's really that simple. The warehouse crew has already brought up their complaints to management, who told us that we should continue to expect children in the warehouse. I decided that was unacceptable and filed a complaint with OSHA, but they told me that it didn't fall within the purview of Employer-Employee interactions and that they couldn't help me. They instead referred me to the Labor Standards board, who also told me it wasn't within their jurisdiction, and that I should try contacting the police. I have no faith that they would be remotely helpful so I'm not even going to bother. It does leave me at a little bit of a loss however. Surely someone in a position of authority should be able to help keep unsupervised young children out of an active warehouse. Any ideas?",

If I’m not burned out, I’m “lazy.” If I prioritize mental health, I’m “soft.” News flash: Working 70-hour weeks, hating your life, and retiring just in time to die isn’t something to flex about.\n\nAnyone else sick of this mentality?",

      "text": "So, \nI applied to be a cook at Saint Anthony Hospital. I interview and receive a lowball job offer. \n\nI accept and sign the offer for a FTE daytime position. And upon asking was told I’d be working mornings starting anytime between 7-9am.\n\nAs the weeks go by I complete my new hire onboarding documents, get my pre employment health checks, everything. Also enrolling in evening time classes at school.\n\nNow today, two days before I’m set to start they tell me “the position never existed” claiming the reason being since the woman that interviewed me was no longer working there.  If the position never existed then wtf did I apply to? Wtf did I interview for? And how tf am I looking at an offer letter stating I’d be starting in that position?\n\nNow they’re offering me some 14 hours every two weeks on a rotating weekend schedule.\n\nI’ve been anticipating starting work here for weeks. I’ve been to the building several times to get bloodwork, fill documents, etc. and have gotten friendly with the staff. I’ve adjusted commitments in my personal and professional life to accommodate the terms we agreed on. Then the pull this BS. \n\nThis feels like such an inconsiderate unprofessional slap to the face.\n\nI was actually considering taking legal action since I signed an offer letter. Now the offer letter had a disclosure saying it does not imply a contractual agreement, so idk if it’d even be worth the effort. \n\nMan I’m frustrated. I only enrolled in class because I was confident I’d be able to afford them this time thanks to my new job. What a waste of time.",

      "text": "I’m 26 and I work in shipping/receiving and sandblasting aircraft parts at a small aerospace company in New York.\nI used to push through the stress—until my body started shutting down.\n\nThey moved my desk to face the floor so everyone, including management, could see me constantly. Since then, my nervous system has been in pure fight-or-flight. Every day at work, I now experience:\n\t•\tTight chest\n\t•\tRacing heart\n\t•\tNausea\n\t•\tShaking\n\t•\tOverheating\n\t•\tPure panic that starts as soon as I walk in the building\n\nOne day I felt so bad I went to urgent care. My vitals were all over the place. The doctor told me this was likely caused by prolonged high-stress exposure and inhaling chemicals without proper protection.\n\nI filed an OSHA complaint because I had been working with acetone, sandblasting without proper ventilation or consistent PPE. OSHA investigated and fined the company. They found that respirators weren’t properly fit-tested, and chemical exposure procedures were violated. So I was validated on that front.\n\nBut instead of supporting me, my job started pressuring me for more medical documentation every time I showed signs of distress. They didn’t even wait for OSHA’s decision before trying to pull me into private meetings, asking why I was taking breaks or why I looked anxious.\n\nIt’s turned into interrogations. Cold, clinical conversations where I feel like I’m being accused of faking it. They ask:\n\t•\t“What exactly is wrong with you?”\n\t•\t“Can you bring in another doctor’s note by tomorrow?”\n\t•\t“Why didn’t you disclose this earlier?”\n\nIt’s humiliating. It feels like I’m on trial just for being sick—from the job they made unsafe.\n\nThey’re now moving into an open floor plan with even less privacy, more exposure, and no breaks from noise or supervision. I’m already in a trauma loop from being watched and micromanaged. This is only making it worse.\n\nI’m trying to figure out what my rights are—OSHA helped, but now I’m looking into New York Human Rights protections and ADA accommodations. I want to file a formal complaint. I might even pursue medical leave because I physically can’t function under this pressure anymore.\n\nI’ve worked hard. I’ve stayed quiet. I’ve tried to be “professional.” But my body is breaking. And now that I spoke up, I’m being punished instead of protected.\n\nHas anyone else gone through this? Been gaslit and interrogated for getting sick in a toxic job?\nWhat helped you leave safely—or fight back without losing your sanity?",

It looks like a $20k robot slave will be for sale by 2030 or sooner, and its abilities will swiftly increase to become the dominant form of labor in the next two decades.\nNone of the world’s governments seem to be responding to this massive change that will increase income inequality and make tens of millions jobless.",

So, I am writing this with managers and employers in mind who also started at the bottom.  \n\nThe office party.  Let's be real.  I would confidently estimate that 80+% of employees do not care nor want to attend.  Many of them, like myself, may be introverts and prefer a quiet night at home.  They only attend out of obligation and feel pressured to attend otherwise their careers at the company are capped.  I'm sure 99% of them would rather take free time and cash instead given the option.  \n\nFree food is always enjoyed, but NONE of your employees want to meet up after hours, off the clock, off-site somewhere difficult to find in the dark, get stuck in evening traffic, and then have to drive home at 10:00 PM when it's 20°F degrees out.\n\nI genuinely want to thank my employees for their hard work, because without them I would not be in the position I am.  So here is what I am doing.  Christmas Eve we are having an office party.  People will punch in, do no work, hang out, talk, and I will buy lunch for everyone.  After lunch, everyone is dismissed and will be paid for the full day + bonus compensatory with their contributions to the company.\n\nIf the employees are attending the office party as part of their job, it should be considered working time, and they should be paid.  They should not have to spend their own time and gas, either.",

      "text": "Hi everyone,\nMy husband and I are Ukrainian war refugees who came to the U.S. legally through the Uniting for Ukraine program. We both have degrees and over 15 years of experience in the food service industry. We worked hard, paid taxes, followed every rule.\n\nAt first, we had jobs at a long-term care facility where we were promised visa sponsorship and fair pay. But another employer — a rural hospital kitchen in North Dakota (TCMC) — recruited us, promising $21/hr and green card sponsorship. We trusted them. We moved, changed jobs, and started over.\n\nBut after months of hard work, we never received the promised raise. I passed the evaluation, managed dietary compliance, handled food cost reports — still no raise. When I asked why, the CEO became hostile. He even texted me late at night demanding I come in on my day off. He said I had no right to question wages, even for my husband. That’s illegal.\n\nThen they told us they never really intended to sponsor our visas. We had already left the old job for them — where our sponsorship was in progress.\n\nAnd worst of all — there’s a Ukrainian minor still working in their kitchen, paid just $10/hour. She’s been there over a year. That’s a clear violation of labor laws.\n\nWe’ve filed official complaints with the Department of Labor and the Immigrant and Employee Rights Section. Not out of revenge — but because we want this to stop. We are not disposable. We are legal, skilled workers who just want a fair chance.\n\nIf this happened to us, it’s likely happening to others. Please speak up. Immigrant workers deserve protection too.\nUpdate:\nAfter we asked for a written explanation regarding why both of us are paid $17/hour — despite our extensive international experience — I received this official response from a senior administrator:\n\n“You do not inform HR or any administration personnel what you expect for a response, how you expect it, and when you expect it. We will respond when and how we see fit.\nYour continued lack of respect for TCMC staff and administration will cease immediately.\nI look forward to speaking with you tomorrow morning at 7:30am in my office.\nThis is a mandatory meeting.”\n\nThis was the only “response” I received — no explanation, no transparency.\nJust intimidation and a forced meeting.\n\nIt’s unacceptable that questions about pay are treated like misconduct.\nThis is exactly why so many immigrant workers are afraid to speak up — and why I won’t stay silent.\n\nI can add all the email screenshots. This is just horrible.\nEdit\nI’m not just sad because I was lied to. I’m speaking out because I know how to stand up for myself — and I won’t stay silent.\nBut imagine how many people stay quiet, enduring humiliation and deception simply because they’re afraid to lose their jobs.\nThat’s the part that truly breaks my heart.\n\nThis can’t be ignored. We need to talk about this.",

      "title": "I have the best paying job I’ve ever had, but my employer is beginning to push my boundaries",
      "text": "I (25F) work for a small business in NYC and I’m a student. During my interview I agreed to be paid under the table, manage the store 5 days out of the week (total of 22-25 hours), make social media posts (3 reels and 1 post per week), and show my face on camera for posts. I was so desperate for a job, so I was willing to say yes to anything. But, I said yes, nonetheless.\n\nI get $150 base + 20% commissions on sales per week. This amounts to about $400-$450 per week. It’s the best money I’ve ever made in my life, and they’ve been the kindest to me out of all my employers.\n\nRecently, I’ve found myself with little time to do things outside of work, or think about things that aren’t work-related. I was also just told I may just need to put in more hours at home to make posts. I’ve also received pretty aggressive pressure to show my face in videos to help attract customers to the store (create an audience that wants to meet me). I did agree to that when I was interviewed, so I feel extremely guilty saying I’ve grown really uncomfortable with the idea. When I brought this up to my manager, citing possible dangers associated with putting my face on social media for the store, she said my fears were flat-out not real and that I was overthinking. I don’t even think the possible risk of danger is the center of my fears, to be honest, I can’t put my finger on why I feel so deeply unsettled.\n\nWhat’s also odd is that she adamantly refuses to show her own face on the store’s social media. And, I also overheard her talking with someone about starting a social media marketing business. But, from what I remember hearing, I believe she said she intends to acquire labor cheaply or possibly underpay employees. I feel like I must have misunderstood, because I was completely visible and standing maybe 10 feet away from them.\n\nI don’t know. I can’t seem to get over this unsettling feeling that I’m getting, and I’ve been shaking with anxiety over the issue over the past week. I feel like I am overreacting, but my gut feels like it’s saying differently.\n\nI’m actually considering quitting, but obviously, then what lol? I did get past 2/3 technical rounds for Hack Reactor (bootcamp for software engineers), and if I’m officially accepted into this upcoming cohort (in June), I should be at least ready to interview for full-time roles after 12 weeks. Besides being able to afford living, maybe I could actually save up to finish schooling later down the line (I have a feeling I’ll still need a bachelor’s degree later in the future).\n\nAnyways, I don’t really have anyone to talk to about this, so any input is really appreciated!\n\n\nEdit:\nFirstly, thank you so much for all your replies! They were extremely validating and humbling to say the least. I also wanted to clarify a few things. \n\nI’m completely aware this is not good money. It is just more money than I’ve ever had access to in my life, and I’ve gone a couple days without eating before (not the worst, but I hate the anxiety over running out of money or losing access to it), plus just what comes with poverty. When you only have access to jobs that are entry level/unskilled labor, you settle for less. With these jobs a lot of workers don’t ask “Am I getting screwed over?” because the answer’s obvious. It usually comes down to, “How badly am I getting screwed over?” If anything.\n\nI went in this job, with the notion it would be temporary. It would hold me over until I could get better footing and move onto something better. And to be honest, I did like the projects and the pats on the back for my work and not being called stupid every day and being treated like a human being. And also, when I was told I’d be paid in cash, they framed it as a favor, so *I* wouldn’t have to pay taxes. I’m “family. I knew that was complete bs, and that they were avoiding paying taxes and insurance. I’ve been keeping track of all my pay from the beginning with deposit slips and a spreadsheet, and have put a portion in my savings account for tax season.\n\nI’m half awake still because I stayed up way too late last night. So, basically, I was always aware this was temporary, but now I think I need to expedite my exit plan. I’m going to be spending this week trying to plan what I’m going to do. I’m probably forgetting a bunch of stuff, but I might post an edit later if so. But I will definitely post an update once I leave this job, because it will happen. Thank you guys so much for the support!",

It’s never been explained beyond that. \nThis argument seems wrong to me. I am being paid for a task, and that work should be worth a certain rate regardless of geographic location.

      "text": "Hey everyone,\nI’m in a bit of a dilemma and would really appreciate some outside perspective.\n\nEarlier this year, I applied for a role I was genuinely excited about — it was perfectly aligned with my background in policy and advisory work. I went through two rounds of interviews, including a written scenario task and a final meeting with the CEO. I followed up professionally and waited… only to receive a standard rejection email about a month later. No feedback, no explanation.\n\nI recently saw that they reposted the exact same position — meaning they didn’t hire anyone.\n\nOut of curiosity (and maybe a little hope), I emailed the hiring manager politely asking for feedback and whether I should consider reapplying. That was days ago — and no reply.\n\nNow I’m torn. On one hand, I’m even more qualified now than I was back then (I’ve since gained more experience in the exact area the job covers). On the other hand, I’m hesitant to put myself through the same process again with an employer that seems… uncommunicative and kind of careless in how they treat candidates.\n\nWould you reapply? Or does their silence speak loudly enough?\nI want to be seen — not just sent through another cycle.\nThanks in advance for any advice or gut-checks.",

      "text": "It is sad, but true; it is also understandable to a certain degree. Trump/Musk played on the emotions of the common man. He knew emotional issues created more fervor and mitigated against rational input. There are few among us who don't harbor some prejudicial thoughts, and despots such as Trump have a talent enabling them to tap onto those thoughts while subjugating more rational reasoning.\n\nTrump sounded sincere. He convinced you he was on the workers side -- on America's side -- and no matter how often you were warned about the terrors of his MAGA Manifesto, Project 2025, it was easier to go along with his pronouncements than to argue against all of them.\n\nMake America Great Again! Sounds good, but it was all a lie promulgated by the oligarchs and corporations, and you fell for it.\n\nBut a mistake is just that, a mistake, and we can learn from our mistakes. See below, see the actual words outlining the inherent tyranny of the document, and see there in black and white the odious intention of destroying all unions and the rollback of all union protections and benefits.\n\nThere are Trump's words, beyond argument or dispute. The question is will you abide by the better angels of your nature, or will you continue to vote against your own best interest?\n\n\n\nUnions\n\nProject 2025 will...\n\n...require worker centers to file financial disclosures with the government. This could make it harder for worker centers to organize and advocate for workers. \\[601\\]\n\n...rescind the persuader rule. This means that employers will be able to hire consultants to discourage workers from forming a union without having to tell the government about it. \\[602\\]\n\n...let bosses decide if workers are employees or contractors. This means that bosses could call workers contractors even if they are really employees, which would mean they don't have to give them benefits like health insurance and paid time off. \\[591\\]\n\n...make it harder for workers to form unions. This means that it will be harder for workers to join together to form a union and fight for better pay and working conditions. \\[602\\]\n\n...allow states to opt out of federal labor laws. This means that states could pass laws that make it harder for workers to form a union or make unions weaker. \\[605\\]\n\n...get rid of unions for security workers in the government. This means that security workers in the government, like TSA agents, will no longer have a union to protect them. \\[159\\]\n\n...strengthen \"management rights\" and narrow the scope of issues that are subject to collective bargaining for public sector unions. This could mean less union influence over working conditions, scheduling, and other workplace matters. \\[81\\]\n\n...narrow the definition of activities that are protected from employer retaliation under the National Labor Relations Act. This could make it riskier for workers to engage in union organizing or other collective action. \\[601\\]\n\n...eliminate the Public Service Loan Forgiveness Program, which incentivizes a career in public service. This would reduce the incentive to go into public service, exacerbate student debt burden for public service workers, reduce diversity and representation in public service and lead to a \"brain drain\" from the public sector. \\[332\\]\n\nAgain, these are Trump's intentions, don't let them rule your future.",

This is the 3rd fucking program they've offered us as a solution like this rather than a pay raise, and it's insulting.

Despite the fact that this monitoring request does not stem from a client, my employer is now compelling other organizations to purchase this software for regulating remote workers. The stipulations include mandating that only I am visible on the screen with a white background, not wearing a smartwatch or using a mobile phone, ensuring the laptop remains locked, and even tracking the duration the device is locked. The only alternative provided is to return to the office. Yet, our firm has offloaded the workspace floor and furniture, putting us in a precarious position. We are now facing coercion to comply, and I seek guidance on potential legal recourse if denied the option to return to the office without risking termination.",

They seem to buy another company every month or two. \n\nWe lost a lot of the small company benefits, which honestly were the perks that kept people here for 20+ years. I understand that, but now they're starting to squeeze hours and mandate petty penny pinching policies.\n\nWithout going into too much detail we are a technical service industry that is required by law for most of our customers. We travel to customer sites and service equipment. Company structure is roughly 25 customer site technicians 5 in shop technicians and 5 office and managerial employees. The technicians generally bring in $1000-3000 per day of billable work per tech and we are generally scheduled 2 months ahead with cyclical work that is required to be done by customers. Average pay is anywhere from 25/hr to 35/hr. We have a lot of collective power if applied properly.\n\nIf I were to try to unionize our location, who would be required for the minimum to initiate a union vote? Would I reach out to an existing general union and they would help me with the process? There isn't exactly a union for our field exactly but we primarily work in a lot of industrial and manufacturing plants.",

She exclaimed that even when she doesn’t get lunch breaks or 10 minute breaks, the managers mark it off on her schedule to make it appear as though she got them.\n\nShe’s been working 12 hour shifts with no lunch or 10 minute breaks & she’s finally planning on quitting after being forced to stay overtime even when she was in tears.\n\nShe says that her other coworkers also deal with this as well, & from the times that I’ve visited on my own time I noticed employees being worked overtime without notice. She also expressed that her & her coworkers usually don’t even eat during these long shifts because they never have time to.\n\nWhat course of action can she do ? Every job I’ve worked at in the area always made sure to give me my breaks & made it very aware that it would be illegal for me to not get them, so hearing that an employer is just straight up refusing to give breaks to an employee working 12 hour shifts is just disgusting & I want to do anything I can to help my friend out.",

However, the person who responded has “human resources” in their title. \n\nAs soon as I saw her response I forwarded my email to the one she provided requesting to have my sick time processed for that shift. \n\n“HR” responded saying they cannot pay me sick time because I did not follow protocol. First they said the format of my email was wrong? \n\nI responded asking why that is relevant if all the necessary information was included in my email (name, shift time and location, reason for canceling)\n\nThey then responded saying that my email is supposed to be sent before the time of my shift, which it was. Again it was sent at 2:35pm, and responded to at 2:38pm. \n\nMy forwarded email was sent to the other email address at 4:06pm… 6 minutes after my call time but by that time I was already taken off the shift. \n\nNow they are refusing to pay me sick hours because I sent the (second) email “after 4pm” ????\n\nIs this legal? \n\nI have looked on NYS DOL website and could not find any information supporting anything like this. Other than specific company policies but this seems like a stretch. To reiterate, the person who responded at 2:38pm has Human Resources in their title IN the email.",

      "text": "# \n\n\n\nMAGA, he promised you protection and prosperity, and typically he lied about that, too.\n\nNow, no matter the demands your boss puts upon you, you have but two choices; submit or be fired!\n\nPreviously the National Labor Relations Board would be there to protect you from unreasonable demands being put upon you; but no longer. You see, Trump has fired the acting chair, and in doing so shuts down the entire Bureau.\n\nIncrease your working hours, reduce your salary, diminish your benefits, not a damn thing you can do about it!\n\nThis is the result the oligarchs paid him for, this is Musk's desire laid out on a silver plate, this is the beheading Bezos dreamt of.\n\nEven if you have a union, there is no other entity to which they can appeal.\n\nYou laughed when you thought he would stick it to the liberals; look in the mirror, liberal!\n\n© provided by AlterNet\n\nIn his ongoing rampage against the laws of the land, Trump this week fired National Labor Relations Board acting chair Gwynne Wilcox — despite her congressional appointment not being up. Wilcox’s firing closes down the NLRB, because it’s left with just two members, and the Supreme Court has ruled that the board needs at least three to issue any rulings. Trump also fired NLRB General Counsel Jennifer Abruzzo, leaving board attorneys who investigate employee and employer complaints without any guidance.\n\nPresto — American workers are no longer protected from illegal firings or unfair labor practices by their employers. The National Labor Relations Act of 1935 is effectively gone. Employers can now wreak havoc on their workers. Of course, most employers are already doing this, but at least the threat of unionization kept some from blatant bullying.\n\nThe backstory here is about power. Score another one for the oligarchs.\n\nAcross America, big corporations are treating their hourly workers like shite. Unions are about the only countervailing economic force and one of the last remaining political forces pushing for worker health and safety. But the latest data (out Tuesday) shows that unionized workers continue to lose ground — now down to under 10 percent of the workforce.\n\nElon Musk, the richest person in the world and a key Trump adviser — who over the years has compiled a truckload of violations from the NLRB, including firing workers who tried to form a union, and who kept his Tesla plant open during the pandemic in violation of state law — says he’s “opposed to the idea of unions.”\n\nBillionaire oligarch Jeff Bezos, the second-richest person in America, who also stood prominently before Trump when he was sworn in January 20, has been waging an unrelenting war on Amazon’s warehouse workers. (When workers in a Quebec warehouse recently voted to unionize, Bezos responded by having the company order the closure of every Amazon warehouse in the province.)\n\nAmazon owns Whole Foods. On Monday, workers in a Philadelphia Whole Foods market voted to unionize. Bezos is already taking aim.\n\nAn overwhelming majority of working-class people — especially men without college degrees, who form the bulk of hourly workers in Musk’s Tesla and Bezos’s Amazon — voted for Trump on November 5.\n\nThere are really two questions here:(1) How much more proof does the American working class need that Trump is not on their side but on the side of the oligarchs, who are siphoning more and more of the nation’s wealth to themselves from everyone else?\n\n(2) When will Democratic leaders and lawmakers have the backbone to tell this to working-class Americans, and come down firmly against the oligarchy?\n\n[https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/companies/does-anyone-need-more-proof-that-trump-doesn-t-give-a-crap-about-workers-opinion/ar-AA1y6HwN](https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/companies/does-anyone-need-more-proof-that-trump-doesn-t-give-a-crap-about-workers-opinion/ar-AA1y6HwN)?",

      "text": "Hi everyone. I worked for a freight shipping Company Called day and Ross for a number of years. We ended up getting a new floor manager who was best friends with the General manager. Thus guy was horrible. Abusive to employees, he would make sexual lewd comments about female coworkers and get aggressive and threaten us. I made a report to HR and after that he made every day a living hell.He gave me all the hardest jobs, gave me forced overtime under threat of termination  He would stand by me and watch my every move. I had gone ten years without a single Wright up, then recieved multiple in one week. One was for packing my backpack to fast to come back from break. He claimed it was dramatic and insubordination. Eventually he had my shift switched to graveyards a shift that I had notified the company prior to being hired that I was not able to do. I don't drive due to my epilepsy and their was no transit for that time to get me to work. He and the general manager said I had to quit and if I didn't they would go through the video footage for the last few years and find a reason to terminate me making it more difficult for me to find work in the future. They said if I left on my own, they would give me a good reference. I was exhausted from the abuse and HR just wouldn't do anything. They were all friends and would often BBQ together. So I was mentally and physically exhausted. I had just been diagnosed with a rare neurological condition that caused constant nerve pain so I was struggling to juggle going to doctors to get treatment and do the extra work load so I agreed to resign. After that I have applied at every where house in town multiple times but just can't get hired anywhere. I have never been unemployed for longer than a couple weeks but now it's been a year and a half and I'm over $20,000 in debt after trying to not become homeless. Today I was having a conversation with my ex wife who is the daughter of one of the supervisors who works there. She had mentioned to him that she finds it weird that I haven't been able to get a job because she and I used to work together and she knows how good my work ethic is. He told her that he was in a meeting with the managers and they were laughing and boasting about how they made ne quit and the general manager was bragging about how he called around to all the warehouses in town and had me put on their no hire list. I asked if he would testify in court if I were to pursue legal action, but he won't because he just bought a home and doesn't want to lose his job for speaking up about it. Does anyone know what I can do. I'm broke, I'm sick, just had a doctor say I have red flags for cancer and if I dint find employment soon I'm going to be on the street. Any advise would be greatly appreciated, I have a learning disability, so I'm a bit slow and don't have a support system that could advise me on how to proceed. Thanks for reading my post guys",

      "text": "Hi there,\n\nI recently made a post about my insurance being canceled for non payment while on FMLA. Or at least that’s the reason I was given by our benefits department. I immediately issued payment to get my plan reinstated, but was technically uninsured for approximately 8 weeks before realizing that my insurance had been canceled by my employer. I haven’t been billed by my physicians yet, but am concerned about having to pay for all of those appointments (1-3 every week since my leave began) where I wasn’t covered. \n\nHowever, after retrieving my pay stubs, I can clearly see where the premium deductions were made in January (I received two paychecks that month, as I exhausted my sick time and PTO). I’ve since reached out to HR, and they’re “investigating” now. I also requested copies of the cancelation notices that should have been mailed to me. \n\nMy question is this—if HR doesn’t somehow resolve this, does this warrant a complaint with the EEOC? I’m trying to give them the benefit of the doubt, but this is just one of many issues I’ve encountered during my leave, so I really don’t want to poke the bear and cause a fuss by reporting this. I’m fearful of retaliation/termination once I return from my leave.\n\nAny guidance would be greatly appreciated! ❤️",

At the last meeting he had he mentioned that he had over 9,000 of our tips in that account. There are 10 people that currently work at this place and two other people have recently quit in the last couple weeks and no one knows how much we actually make in tips. I happened to get a peek at the sales today and credit card tips themselves were at $352. I can't even imagine what we all collectively earned in tips from June to August. This is just so confusing and it doesn't feel right to me or my coworkers that he's doing this. Aside from this, he constantly lectures about \"labor costs\" and says we need to keep our labor low so he doesn't have to \"close the doors\". Is what he's doing illegal?",

      "text": "so apparently my workplace (convenience store) has been violating labor laws by allowing me to work 7.5 hour night shifts without a break. our time kiosk software flagged this, and other employees not taking breaks.\ni believe this is a recent legal change since i've worked no-break graveyard shifts in convenience stores for years here in CO. i was always under the impression my contract included a provision to forfeit breaks if they couldn't be taken. \ntheir current solution is to assign one person to work an extra two hours, and during that period, we each alternate clocking in and out for all 50 minutes of our break immediately. obviously, this goes against the purpose of a break, and still leaves me working a six hour shift alone. it may be fulfilling the letter of our current break and wage laws, but it doesn't seem to support the spirit of those laws. wondering if anyone has seen or dealt with something similar, and what our rights are in this situation? i'm reaching out to union reps in the area as well",

      "text": "Below listed are the aims and intents of Trump and his cabal of oligarchs, along with relevant page numbers of the actual document. While each of them is tyrannical in nature I think one stands out above the rest. Most of them are overt and employing little guile. But the section reserved for the implementation of overtime pay is particularly insidious.\n\nAs the law stands now, overtime pay is mandated when a worker labors over forty hours in a given week. Under the new proposed legislation overtime will be predicated on either an eighty-hour work period, or one hundred sixty-hour work period, Under the later, for instance, if a worker labors 50 hours for three straight weeks, but only ten hours the final week he won't be eligible for overtime pay.\n\nYou can rest assured the boss will cut his hours down to ten that final week.\n\nProject 2025 contains over 900 pages and many of them are anti-union and anti-worker laws just waiting implementation by Trump.\n\n\n\nCheck these out:\n\nOvertime\n\nProject 2025 will...\n\n...raise the overtime pay threshold. This means that fewer people will qualify for overtime pay. \\[592\\]\n\n...allow employers and workers to agree that overtime will be calculated over two weeks or four weeks instead of one week. This means that if you work a lot of extra hours one week, but then work fewer hours the next week, your boss might not have to pay you overtime if the total number of hours you worked over the two weeks or four weeks is less than 80. \\[592\\]\n\n...change the rules about overtime pay for people who work from home. This means that if you work from home, your boss might not have to pay you overtime unless you work more than 10 hours in a day. \\[589\\]\n\n...make it easier for businesses to classify workers as independent contractors. This means that if you are classified as an independent contractor, you will not be eligible for overtime pay. \\[591\\]\n\n...allow businesses to not pay overtime for certain benefits they provide to workers. This means that if your boss gives you benefits like help paying for school or childcare, they might not have to pay you overtime for those benefits. \\[592\\]\n\n...weaken unions, including potentially eliminating public sector unions altogether. Unions are often instrumental in negotiating and protecting overtime pay provisions in collective bargaining agreements. A decline in union power could lead to weaker overtime protections. \\[599\\] \\[82\\]",

They government should look into them and make them pay higher taxes or more to unemployment or something,     more brain storming could be done for better \"punishments\"\n\nTo the one that's more relevant to my situation PLACES NOT ACTUALLY FUCKING HIRING ANYONE.    In the past couple of weeks I've sent out hundreds of resumes and applications only had 4 interviews.  One of them low-balled the shit out of me almost 4 an hour less than what I said I need to make and not that far off from what someone in that field would make anywhere else.\n\nOne said I \"failed the interview process \" because I \"didn't paint enough of a picture with my answers\" \n\nAnother one sent and email 2 weeks later saying they went with someone else but the job is still up on indeed and the third I had to make an appointment with an hour window I put mine in for 10 am to 11 am I walked in let them know I was there told to sit and wait and I waited.     For over and hour and left.    They knew I was there.    I was 15 minutes early and left a little after 11.   \n\n\nAll I Wana make is $20 an hour and it's not far fetched I've been in manufacturing for almost 10 years as a welder and fabricator. And will experience working on and using all sorts of equipment,  I don't have any certs or formal schooling so that hurts me.        I'm almost at my wits end.    I have loans I need to pay the bank wants to reposses my vehicle my checking account it negative.  I keep trying to do odd jobs but they just don't pay enough.  \n\n\nThe reason why I'm not working ,  I was laid off,   I did have another job for a week and I had to quit that place a REALLY difficult decision I only ever quit 1 other job and that was a quick lube place during Covid.       I shouldn't have quit this other place but I didn't expect me to not be \nAble to find a job at all for 3 months.  I can't get unemployment because of me quitting.      So soon I'll be turbo poor no vehicle no job (no public transportation where I live)    won't be able pay any of my bills.      This is absolutely ridiculous. \n\nOne of the reasons I need to make at least $20 is my existence bills and some people fail to understand that.     I need to make tbag much because if I don't I won't be able to afford the fuel to get back and forth to work or i won't be able afford food. I would settle for less at this point and just stop paying a ton of my bills and save up for a beater and let them reposses my vehicle. But I can't even find a job like that close enough that I could save.",

Are employers in Alberta required to provide extra compensation for working on statutory holidays like Thanksgiving? Or is it legal for them to treat it like any other workday if that's what the contract specifies?\n\nI'd appreciate any insights from those familiar with Alberta labor laws or who have experience with similar situations.

      "text": "As the title says, we are moving to a new HR and payroll company for the sole purpose of taking advantage of their clock-in system that uses and stores biometric data to confirm employees are who they say they are. This change inevitably raised our supplemental insurance costs by 25%-50% when they discovered this new HR company didn't not work with our current, cheaper, insurance provider.  \n  \nMy frustrations with my employer are two fold:   \n  \n1.) I don't use iphone and I don't consent to apps or devices that want to collect and store my biometric data if I can help it. So here I am faced with a new requirement that my employer is implementing to confirm my identity when clocking in using face ID and retinal scans. \n\n2.) Because we are switching to an HR company that uses biometric clock-ins, we were forced to forgo our partnership with our current supplemental insurance and now in some places our insurance will be double, leaving most of us with between $100-$300 a month increases to our primary and supplemental insurance.\n\nWe mean literally nothing to them. I work an a \"small\" company with less than 200 employees, most of whom make barely above minimum wage. So it royally pisses me off that in an attempt to \"save money from persistent wage theft\" we dumped an astronomical amount of money into moving to an entirely new HR company and to add insult to injury are having our healthcare \"BeNeFiTs\" jacked up because this new company doesn't work with our less costly current provider.\n\nI say benefits with sarcasm because it is not a benefit when it is too expensive to afford, given the terrible pay we are provided. \n\nI thankfully have a husband who gets decent supplemental insurance and at a lower cost, but I just feel for some of my coworkers who came to grips with the news in our benefits meeting yesterday, and said out loud \"I will have to cancel my insurance, I can barley feed myself as it is, I won't be able to afford this.\"",

      "title": "Why would your employer own your FSA money if you leave",
      "text": "I recently found out that if you leave your job, any money left in your Flexible Spending Account (FSA) essentially belongs to your employer. Yep, that money *you* contributed with your hard-earned paycheck, meant for your medical expenses, goes right into your employer's pocket if you don't use it before you part ways. And honestly, this makes no sense to me.\n\nHere’s why it’s frustrating:\n\n1. **It’s Your Money** – FSAs are funded by employees through payroll deductions. So how can an employer just take it if you leave? Imagine having money set aside for planned medical expenses later in the year, but you switch jobs in March—now all of that disappears.\n2. **The “Use It or Lose It” Rule Is Already Harsh** – Even if you don’t leave your job, you already face the “use it or lose it” rule at the end of the year for whatever you didn’t spend. It seems like employees are being punished twice: once with an annual deadline, and again if they change jobs.\n3. **Encourages Wasteful Spending** – With this structure, employees are forced to rush to spend the remaining balance in their FSA on things they may not need, just to avoid losing money. This doesn’t benefit anyone—least of all the employee.\n4. **Penalizes Job Mobility** – FSAs, as they are now, actively discourage people from switching jobs unless they’re okay with potentially leaving behind hundreds or even thousands of dollars in unspent FSA money. Why should your healthcare savings determine whether or not you seek better employment?\n\n# What Needs to Change?\n\n1. **Allow FSA Rollovers to New Employers** – Just like with retirement accounts, you should be able to roll over your FSA funds when you switch jobs. After all, this is money *you* contributed.\n2. **FSA Funds Should Stay with the Employee** – If someone leaves their job, they should be able to keep access to the remaining balance to use for qualified medical expenses until it’s spent.\n3. **Flexible Deadlines for Job Leavers** – Even if FSAs don’t get rid of the “use it or lose it” rule completely, they should at least allow a grace period for people who leave their jobs, rather than forfeiting the money immediately.\n\nThis system is outdated and frankly unfair to employees. Reform is long overdue to ensure that FSA funds remain with the people who paid into them. What are your thoughts? Has anyone else been burned by this? What reforms do you think could fix the FSA system?",

      "text": "Hi everyone,\n\nI need some advice about my current work situation. I’m a Registered Nurse in California, and I’m contracted as a full-time employee. However, despite being scheduled full-time, I am frequently assigned as an “extra nurse” and often get called off on the day of my shift, specifically 2 hours before shift. This has been happening regularly, and I’m concerned that I’m not working the hours I was promised.\n\nThere was nothing in my contract, nor was I informed beforehand, that there would be a chance I could be called off from my scheduled shifts. My understanding of full-time work was that I would be guaranteed a certain number of hours each week.\n\nThis has been impacting my income, and I’m worried it could affect my eligibility for benefits as well. I’ve also read a bit about California’s reporting time pay law, and I’m wondering if I should still be compensated even if they call me off last minute.\n\nHas anyone else experienced this? Is this practice even legal in California? Any advice on what steps I can take or who to contact would be appreciated!\n\nThanks in advance for your help!",

      "title": "I Work in a massive privately owned manufacturing company —The Corruption, Cover-Ups, and Nightmare Work Culture They Don’t Want You to Know About",
      "text": "I have to be as vague as possible because if this company is identified and they figure out who I am, not even kidding—I feel like they’ll come looking. Lol. No joke, this privately owned corporate giant makes Black Mirror feel a little too real.\n\nThe company I work for is responsible for just about everything plastic. If it’s plastic packaging, there’s a good chance it passed through here. Danger to sea life? You name it we got it. I live in a place so small it’s not even a town—it’s officially considered a village. No McDonald’s, barely any businesses, and one massive factory that showed up about 20 years ago and just kept growing. What started as a laid-back, trustworthy workplace with great pay eventually expanded into multiple buildings and became the town’s biggest employer. Then, after a major buyout, billions of dollars started flowing through, and everything changed.\n\nNow, you can’t step into one of the two gas stations or small handful of stores without seeing someone wearing the company shirt they hand out. But when outside corporate interests took over, they started bringing in their own people, handing out management positions to friends, and running the place like a private club. And once a company gets big enough in a small town, there’s no accountability. What used to be a solid job turned into something straight out of an HBO drama.\n\nThe usual corporate nonsense got worse—fudging time cards, sexism, favoritism, and “adjusting” drug test results after major accidents. But it doesn’t stop there. We’re talking covering up assaults, extreme drug use, high-ranking executives (not saying how high, just in case) cheating and keeping mistresses in plain sight in the giant glass HR building, and full-blown criminal activity.\n\nOne of the company’s truck drivers had a history of drinking on the job and multiple DUIs. One day, he drank before his shift and ended up ending a motorcyclist. After what I can only assume was a ton of money changing hands, it was swept under the rug. No company name in the news, just one vague article about a “truck driver.” In a town this size, that should have been the biggest headline of the year. Instead? Nothing. When you work here long enough, you start to feel like they could make you disappear if you did something they didn’t like.\n\nI’m not some high-ranking executive—I’m just a few steps above entry-level, still working on the factory floor. But over time, I’ve pieced things together—between constantly signing paperwork “agreeing to their policies”, overhearing the right conversations, and befriending a supervisor who introduced me to a high-ranking corporate employee who was a little too trusting with their secrets. I still consider these people friends, but the work environment is toxic, and after enough time, it starts to mess with your sanity.\n\nWe work 12-hour shifts, and if you think workplace screaming matches are rare, try several a night. The corporate systems they claim improve production don’t actually work, which throws everything into chaos. Meanwhile, the building manager—who’s supposed to oversee operations— regularly sleeps for half the shift, hides in a janitor’s closet, and watches movies. But if we stray from their broken systems? It’s not pretty. You can get written up for not wearing gloves while using a tape measure, and speaking up about only getting one 10-minute break in a 12-hour shift is a quick way to get fired, no questions asked.\n\nAnd before you ask, “Why don’t you just leave?”—well, the pay was really good then, and it’s REALLY good now, and in a small town with almost no other high-paying jobs, that’s not an easy decision.\n\nI want to highlight two specific incidents that really set the tone for what kind of company this is. I have plenty more stories I’d be willing to share if anyone is interested.\n\nFirst, not long ago, an employee—who, to be fair, was very good at their job—had a serious problem with anger and violent outbursts. Whether there was something personal going on, I don’t know, but there’s no excuse for the level they took it to. We’re talking constant verbal abuse to all of his peers, throwing heavy and sharp objects, and even threatening to end multiple coworkers—while openly keeping a weapon in his vehicle.\n\nThe company’s solution? Slap a “No weapons” sticker on the door and call it a day.\n\nOne time, during a rage fit over a production issue, he threw a metal holder containing a sharp industrial blade. It hit a coworker—fortunately, the injury wasn’t severe, but it was serious enough that it should have led to real consequences. Instead, behind closed doors, the injured employee was convinced to stay quiet, promised that “action would be taken.” Nothing happened.\n\nThat same injured employee weeks later asked for a break after eight hours of nonstop hard labor and hinted that he might speak up about what had happened to him if he didn’t at least get a few minutes to eat. The next day? He was fired.\n\nThe guy who threw the blade? Still works here, no consequences.\n\nAnd the man who was fired? One of the hardest-working, most respectable guys I’ve ever met. This one really gets to me.\n\nNow, let’s talk about one of the biggest food companies in the country. My company is pretty much the sole provider of all the product for them, (specific product not named for paranoia reasons) and there’s a strict rule in place: a specific banned chemical cannot be used in any production—not just in their products, but in any product we run, period.\n\nTo keep the contract, we get frequent audits. When that happens? A full-scale cover-up goes into motion. That banned chemical is hidden on the highest warehouse shelves, fake labels are created, and paperwork mentioning it is thrown out and replaced after. Employees in charge of this are explicitly told to make sure nothing with the chemical’s name is left visible.\n\nIf this information ever got out, I can guarantee that contract would be terminated immediately.\n\nThe deeper you go in corporate manufacturing, the more you realize—ethics are a PR stunt, safety is a technicality, and cover-ups are just business as usual.\n\nSorry for the long read, but if you made it this far, I seriously appreciate it. Just had to get some of this off my chest.",

Many of the benefits we already have and even took for granted are being eliminated one by one. It won’t stand once people realize how bad things get without them. \n\nI hope that people learn from the chaos and start pushing harder for their rights as laborers, if not for themselves then definitely for their fellows. This bullshit happened because we didn’t value our rights enough to bother protecting them, and in fact, we voted in an administration that actively threatened them. \n\nIf people do value their rights, than unions will have power again and we’ll finally be able to push for even more.",

      "text": "Apologies if this is the wrong subreddit for this. \n\nI work for a large corporate restaurant chain. I was hired in Texas earlier this year, where minimum wage for servers is $2.13 an hour, but transferred to a location in California a month ago, where minimum wage is $16 an hour. After transferring, the payroll system did not correct my hourly wage to $16, and the hours I have worked in California have all been paid out at $2.13/hr. \n\nThis impacts me greatly due to the restaurant taking a much larger percentage of my tips in California than they did in Texas, as well as California having a high income tax which Texas does not have. Cost of living is also more expensive here. Additionally, the restaurant in California schedules me fewer hours than my Texas location did. My paychecks due to these factors combined with the payroll error have been 1/5 of what I was making in Texas. \n\nI reached out to them immediately after receiving my first incorrect paystub 2 weeks ago. I have called them 8 times (only got someone on the phone twice), emailed 5 times, and had my general manager email them as well. I have received 2 more incorrect paystubs since then and only got one email back saying they are “researching the issue”. \n\nI have bills to pay and desperately need these paystubs to be corrected and paid out, especially because the California location schedules me for fewer hours than my Texas location did. \n\nIt’s been 2 weeks since my first email. How long should I give them to “research” before reporting a minimum wage violation to the state?",

As someone who typically works two part time jobs to diversify my income I want to warn other possible job seekers about All My Sons moving. \n\nThey will schedule you for 7am, the job can go until 6pm and they will pay you 5-7 hours for the day. The supervisors are adamant that their policy (which is in direct violation of federal labor laws) allows them to pay you whatever hours they want based on the estimate regardless of how long the job actually takes. Yet they hire you as an hourly employee not a contractor. \n\nDon't destroy your body for free. I would not recommend working for this company.",

      "text": "Hi all. I’m located in the mid-south and work in an Asian restaurant. I am a chef and salaried. My question is about how my salary works out. \nWe are paid by lunch and/or dinner shifts. For example: I make $200 if I work lunch and dinner, but only $100 if I work only either or. The same applies if I have to call out of a lunch or dinner shifts, too. Is this legal or not? I thought “salary” was meant to be paid monthly or weekly, no matter how many hours you work in the pay period?\n\nAnother question I have is about some of the immigrant staff. The owners have multiple locations and have multiple “employee houses” where many of the staff live rent free. Many of them do not have SS numbers. Is this legal in any way? Why would the owners go this route and not hire legitimate citizens? Is there some loophole?",

I get numbers, but LEAN makes me feel like a cow; i.e. if im not producing enough milk then idk ill get the chop or something else. People work hard, physically, for those in blue collar jobs. Don't really need some ass wipe screaming down at you when you are already busting ass and sweating your balls off while they're perfectly air conditioned in their office. It comes across pretentious and makes you feel like you have no dignity. I'm not some animal here, neither are others. I get my work done, and I bust ass. Sure there can be down time, and definitely cant tell me that an office worker doesn't have down time their selves. \n\nI support unions to an extent for this reason. I support businesses as well and understand the need to produce product, but not at the expense of another person's humanity. \n\nAm i the only one?",

I have JUST STARTED at Subway, just finishing my 2nd shift and I have to sometimes work hours after my shift ends to finish cleaning up for morning shift because theres so much. No big deal. Buuuuut we are required to clock out at 10:30pm(we close at 10). Manager says we can stretch it to 11pm if we have too, but get yelled at by the owner if we go farther. I understand, stretch it to 11, finally get done with work at 12 after manager decides to deal with the rest of the store cleaning tomorrow(She opens tomorrow too). This has to be a huge illegal red flag right? Owner hates us being on clock after 10:30. I even heard from my manager that she had to stay until 2 AM once just to get tasks done. Other employees share similar experiences and ARE TOLD TO GO OFF THE CLOCK  30 minutes after the shift ends regardless of when it is. What do I do? I just started so I'm not going to care about the few hours I have off the clock in pay, but I'm not going to just sit here and do nothing like how everyone else is. But at the same time I feel like I'm overreacting.\n\nAlso for more details I live within Wyoming and am 17 years old. Don't know if you need that but I am starving for info on what to do next.\n\nTLDR: My job I just started at makes me go off shift due to workload and doesn't pay me for it. My manager and fellow co workers all share similar experiences. What do I do?",

      "text": "They tell us new manufacturing jobs will bring forth a golden age of prosperity, and it could in about five years. But the availability of jobs is not the entire story. In the 1800s there were plenty of manufacturing and low skill jobs, but that alone didn't ensure worker success.\n\nAs a matter of fact, all it assured were sweatshops, Pullman towns, and the company store. There were no vacation days, there were no sick days, there was no health insurance -- safety regulations were a joke -- and job security nonexistent.\n\nIf you opened your mouth you were fired, and in many cases blackballed so you couldn't get a new job.\n\nUnions changed all that. They brought a living wage and job security. They battled and fought for benefits and ensured the dignity of the working men and women of the nation.\n\nNow Trump and his billionaire Republican friends are doing all they can to destroy the unions so they can return to the days of impoverished workers and slave-like wages. Yeah, manufacturing jobs (when and if they get here) can either be a boon to American families or a yolk around their necks; Republican or Democrat rule will determine which.\n\nRead this:\n\n\n\nTrump's toadies are peddling a dangerous new lie | Opinion\n\nOpinion by Thom Hartmann\n\nMay 07 •\n\n© provided by AlterNet\n\nTrump and his billionaire toadies like Howard Lutnik and Scott Bessent are peddling a dangerous lie to working-class Americans. They’re strutting around claiming their tariffs will bring back “good paying jobs” with “great benefits,” while actively undermining the very thing that made manufacturing jobs valuable to working people in the first place: unions. Let’s be crystal clear about what’s really happening: Without strong unions, bringing manufacturing back to America will simply create more sweatshop opportunities where desperate workers earn between $7.25 and $15 an hour with zero benefits and zero security. The only reason manufacturing jobs like my father had at a tool-and-die shop in the 1960s paid well enough to catapult a single-wage-earner family into the middle class was because they had a union — the Machinists’ Union, in my dad’s case — fighting relentlessly for their rights and dignity.\n\nMy father’s union job meant we owned a modest home, had reliable healthcare, and could attend college without crushing debt. The manufacturing jobs Trump promises? Starvation wages without healthcare while corporate profits soar and executives buy their third megayacht. The proof of their deception is written all over their actions: They’re already reconfiguring the Labor Department into an anti-worker weapon designed to crush any further unionization in America.\n\nJoe Biden was also working to revive American manufacturing — with actual success — but he made it absolutely clear that companies benefiting from his Inflation Reduction Act and CHIPS Act should welcome unions in exchange for government support. Trump and his GOP enablers want the opposite: docile workers grateful for poverty wages. While Republicans babble endlessly about “job creators,” they fundamentally misunderstand — or deliberately obscure — how a nation’s true wealth is actually generated. It’s not through Wall Street speculation or billionaire tax breaks. It’s through making things of value; the exact activity their donor class has eagerly shipped overseas for decades while pocketing the difference. There’s a profound economic reason to bring manufacturing home that Adam Smith laid out in 1776 and Alexander Hamilton amplified in 1791 when he presented his vision for turning America into a manufacturing powerhouse. It’s the fundamental principle behind Smith’s book “The Wealth of Nations” that I explain in detail in The Hidden History of Neoliberalism: How Reaganism Gutted America.\n\nSee more here:\n\nhttps://www.msn.com/en-us/news/opinion/trump-s-toadies-are-peddling-a-dangerous-new-lie-opinion/ar-AA1EkoH3?",

      "text": "# 'Infuriates me': MAGA senators turn on GOP over 'life and death' plan\n\nHow manty times have Trump/Musk, and the Republicans sworn they would never touch Medicaid funding? How many times have the reassured their constituents their medical care was sacrosanct, the hospitals and medical centers (particularly in rural and underserved areas) would not be driven out of business, and how many times have they tapped you on the head as if you were a child, and lied through their store-bought teeth?\n\nThen they silently went ahead with their insidious plans and wrote a bill that would do just the opposite of their public statements.\n\nMedicaid cuts will be the prime contributor to the Trump/Musk tax cuts -- the cuts that will make the obscenely rich even more so -- at the cost of leaving a great proportion of our citizenry with reduced healthcare for their families.\n\nNow that this scheme is out in the open, they have suddenly come to realize Americans will not stand for this. MAGA, Liberal, or Independent will not see their lives and the lives of their loved one sacrificed on the altars of the oligarchs and bled to feed the insatiable greed of the despots.\n\nSuddenly, they have come to see the fear in the eyes of those they have sworn to protect and have come to realize their jobs are in acute danger. So now Senators who have always stood behind the tyrant Trump are pretending to have experienced a 'come to Jesus' moment. They are pretending to fight for you, pretending to stand up to you while all the while hoping when the bill is passed, and the indescribable harm is done they can say,' We fought for you, we tried, but we lost' and we are stupid enough to accept their perfidy.\n\nTheir protestations now are all Bullshit!\n\nSee this if you can stomach the lies:\n\n'Infuriates me': MAGA senators turn on GOP over 'life and death' plan\n\nStory by Jennifer Bowers Bahney •\n\n© provided by RawStory\n\nTwo MAGA Republicans in the Senate are speaking out against potential changes to Medicaid being eyed by the House, as Speaker Mike Johnson (R-LA) vowed to pass President Donald Trump's spending bill by the new Fourth of July deadline.\n\nTop officials announced the new deadline on Monday after Johnson had originally set it for Memorial Day.\n\nSens. Bernie Moreno (R-OH) and Josh Hawley (R-MO) both warned the House to lay off Medicaid, particularly two proposals: one that would \"cut the federal government’s share of the costs in states that have expanded Medicaid,\" and the other that would \"cap Medicaid expansion spending.\" Both ideas amounted to “cutting benefits,\" Moreno told Semafor, adding, \"We don’t need to cut benefits. And it actually really infuriates me to hear people here talking about that, because it stresses people out. This is life and death for them.\"\n\nAccording to Semafor, the current framework for the GOP’s tax cut bill \"directs the House committee in charge of Medicaid to find $880 billion in savings over 10 years.\"\n\nEven still, the report described a \"growing consensus\" among GOP lawmakers about paring back their party’s pursuit of Medicaid savings. More than a dozen Republican senators could fight against Medicaid cuts, Semafor reported.\n\n\"There’s not 50 votes for any kind of cuts in benefits. That’s just a fact,\" Moreno said.\n\nPresident Donald Trump has repeatedly claimed he would not cut benefits, and he's told lawmakers to look elsewhere if they have to make cuts to his \"Big, Beautiful Bill.\" As it currently stands, the spending bill will \"raise the debt ceiling, extend 2017 tax cuts, provide additional tax cuts, supply hundreds of billions of dollars in border and defense funds and slash federal spending.\"\n\n\"Finding more than $1 trillion worth of spending cuts to help pay for the bill is sure to be the biggest headache, with moderates in both chambers insisting that Medicaid be preserved,\" Axios reported.\n\n[https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/politics/infuriates-me-maga-senators-turn-on-gop-over-life-and-death-plan/ar-AA1DRLq1](https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/politics/infuriates-me-maga-senators-turn-on-gop-over-life-and-death-plan/ar-AA1DRLq1)?",

In an interview with CNBC on Tuesday, Lutnick was grilled about how he planned to attract American employees to factory work amid President Donald Trump’s push for increased US manufacturing. Lutnick suggested community colleges as one place to find and train workers, before discussing his vision to see generations of Americans working in factories.\n\n“It's time to train people not to do the jobs of the past, but to do the great jobs of the future. This is the new model where you work in these kinds of plants for the rest of your life, and your kids work here and your grandkids work here,” he said. “We let the auto plants go overseas. Right now you should see an auto plant, it’s highly automated but the four, five thousand people who work there—they are trained to take care of those robotic arms, they are trained to keep the air conditioning system.” It came as Trump was branded 'insane' after a baffling comment outside the White House.\n\nCritics on social media slammed Lutnick’s comments, with some suggesting it was an outdated plan.\n\n“I want my children to aspire to more than working in a factory or ‘plant.’ Where will your children and grandchildren be working u/howardlutnick?” one X user wrote.\n\n“Factory jobs peaked in 1979 with 19 million jobs.

      "text": "# Trump's Conservative Manifesto, Project 2025, is comprised of hundreds of pages that will rescind Civil Rights and limit all our government protection. And one of the most insidious provisions of this document is to completely eliminate overtime pay for hourly workers. Overtime is now predicated on a forty hour work week. Under project 2025 that will change to a one hundred sixty hour work month. It sounds the same, but here is where the villainy creeps in. If a worker puts in five extra hours of overtime for three weeks the boss has only to cut his hours in the fourth month to twenty-five hours, thus assuring he still works one hundred sixty hours, but is not entitled to overtime pay.\n\nI told you it was insidious!\n\nThe right to overtime pay was won in 1938, but that is far from all the improvements unions secured for Americans. Minimum wage was a union achievement, as were child labor laws, paid vacations, sick leave, healthcare benefits, anti discrimination laws, and the right to strike were all won through the support of and encouragement Democrat Administrations and against the opposition of the GOP.\n\nAll this will change under a Republican Administration -- a heartless Trump administration -- and once those gains are lost they will never be recovered.\n\nSee this -- Boldface mine.\n\nWorkers Rights Won by Unions, From the 8-Hour Workday to Overtime Pay.\n\n\"Workers at American companies and institutions of higher learning are making headlines for strikes and unionizing efforts among employees, including Amazon, Starbucks, Rutgers University, HarperCollins, and Hollywood writers.\n\nAmid this so-called **union boom,** labor unions are seeing their highest approval ratings since the 1960s, with **Gen Z showing up as America’s most pro-union generation in** recent history. So it’s no wonder people are curious about what a union can do for them.\n\nThe overall proportion of unionized workers in the United States remains relatively low, with only one in every 10 workers in the country belonging to a union. But whether you're a union worker or not, you may benefit from policies for which unions have fought long and hard — and they continue to fight.\n\n**Labor organizing has helped secure everyday benefits** that many of us now take for granted. And these efforts have shown people what kind of protections they can hope to secure in the workplace.\n\nLet’s take a look at 10 examples:\n\n**1. An eight-hour workday, two-day weekend, and overtime pay**\n\nMost of us probably take the standard five-day workweek, eight-hour workday, and two-day weekend structure as a given. When we’re asked to work more than this we may even feel like our rights and livelihood are being infringed upon (of course, many workers take on the extra work anyway). The details of this standard schedule are the result of decades of activism.\n\nFirst, in 1884, the Federation of Organized Trades and Labor Unions passed a resolution that the workday be limited to eight hours. As Kim Kelly has written for Teen Vogue, thanks to robust labor organizing, including strikes by the Carpenters Union and United Mine Workers of America, the Fair Labor Act (FLSA) was finally enacted in 1938.\n\nAmong other provisions, the FLSA established a five-day workweek, thereby creating a two-day weekend. In 1940, thanks in part to a previously recognized demand from the Amalgamated Clothing Workers of America, Congress amended the FLSA to officially create a 40-hour workweek.\n\n**2. A minimum wage**\n\nNew Zealand was the first country to mandate a minimum wage, in 1894. The United States didn't follow suit until more than 40 years later. Women and organizations against child labor had actively campaigned for a minimum wage for those groups since the early 1900s, arguing that children were often doing similar work to adults but were paid much lower wages. By 1923, according to The Atlantic, 16 states and Washington, DC, passed laws enshrining minimum-wage protections specifically for women and children. But it wasn’t until the late 1930s that this also applied to men and non-unionized workers. Angered by the unjust wages and layoffs during the Great Depression, unemployed and union workers fought for fairer wages, and the FLSA was enacted to support FDR’s New Deal.\n\n**3. Child labor laws**\n\nRecently, lawmakers have weakened state child labor laws across the country. These regulatory moves are undoing social welfare legislation that has benefited the health and well-being of American workers. In 1900, almost 18% of all American workers were under 16. These children were primarily from lower-income families and often worked 12 hours or more, six days a week, in harsh and sometimes hazardous conditions.\n\nAs with the minimum wage, federal child labor laws were catalyzed by the Great Depression, though in prior decades there had been an especially strong push by women and labor unions for legislative bodies to pass legislation protecting children. The FLSA eventually set very specific limits on how many hours children could work outside of school, though agricultural work is still done under an entirely different set of rules, which has generated controversy.\n\n**4. Paid vacation and holidays**\n\nIn the wake of the Great Depression, unions started to push for paid time off, which they negotiated with employers. This effort set a standard for two-weeks paid vacation that extended to many non-union workers as well. In the 1970s, however, as unions lost popularity and influence, the European Union and other countries started to outpace the United States in requiring paid time off for workers.\n\nIn 2019, the Center for Economic and Policy Research released a study that found an estimated one in four US workers has no paid time off or paid vacation days whatsoever. The United States is alone among the 38 member countries in the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) in lacking a national vacation policy or mandated paid holidays.\n\nJoin a union, though, and your chances of getting paid vacation increase profoundly. A 2009 book from the Economic Policy Institute (EPI) found that, after 25 years, unionized employees get nearly 27% more vacation weeks than their non-unionized counterparts. According to the Department of Labor, these benefits are especially helpful for women, particularly women of color; those who belong to unions have greater access to paid time off and paid vacation.\n\n**5. Sick leave**\n\nAs with holidays and paid time off, union workers are more likely to have sick leave than non-union workers. According to the EPI, an estimated 86% of union workers have access to paid sick leave, while only 72% of non-union workers enjoy that benefit.\n\nComing out of the pandemic, paid sick leave has become a hot topic of discussion among employees and employers. Why is paid sick leave so beneficial? It reduces the spread of illness, with some research estimating that guaranteed paid sick leave would decrease flu rates by at least 5%. In addition, the reduced stress can help a person get better faster.\n\n**6. Worker health care**\n\nIf you’re part of a union, you probably enjoy better health care coverage than workers who aren’t unionized. As of 2019, two-thirds of non-union workers had health care compared with 94% of union workers, according to EPI. Why is this? There’s a long tradition of unions advocating for health care benefits, stretching back to the industrial revolution. As unions gained in popularity, they made efforts to ensure that their workers would continue to get paid despite sickness or injury. Although some union leaders initially opposed state health care because they believed it would decrease dependence on unions, they later fought for Social Security, in 1935, and Medicare, in 1965, and they continue to advocate for better health care for their workers today.\n\n**7. Antidiscrimination protections**\n\nUnions and women workers were at the helm of the Equal Pay Act, signed by President John F. Kennedy in 1963, prohibiting sex-based wage discrimination for women doing the same job as men.\n\nRegarding race, though, unions haven’t always been on the same page. Historically, some unions sought to exclude certain racial and ethnic groups, while others sought to protect them. However, by the era of the Civil Rights Movement, unions started to play a larger role in the fight for racial justice, through mobilizing members and political lobbying.\n\nThe Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act of 1965 both codified laws against racial discrimination, and were won, in part, thanks to political lobbying and support by the American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial Organization, or AFL-CIO — now the largest federation of unions in the United States. Today, labor unions continue to help people fight workplace discrimination.\n\n**8. Right to strike**\n\nStrikes are one of the most visible actions in which unionized workers engage, with university employees, Los Angeles teachers, Hollywood TV writers, and more recently taking to the picket lines. Strikes can help workers win greater protections and benefits, higher pay or fairer wages. For centuries, workers have gone on strike for better working conditions, but the actual right to strike is protected thanks to labor unions. The National Labor Relations Act of 1935, also called the Wagner Act, protects the right to strike and outlines guidelines by which strikes are deemed lawful. Strikes provide workers with necessary bargaining power to improve working conditions and pay.\n\n**9. Safety regulations or “worker’s comp”**\n\nUnions help ensure that members receive worker’s compensation should they become injured on the job, but union insistence on the strict adherence to safety practices has also helped decrease the need for this provision. Worker’s compensation is an especially critical issue for union workers, some of whom work in high-risk jobs, because injuries can result in a long leave and extra expenses. Worker's comp often helps cover medical expenses, not just wages. Unions also help address this issue by offering supplemental benefits, such as cash stipends or disability benefits, that non-union workers don’t often get. Some labor unions fought specifically for large-scale worker’s comp that directly related to issues stemming from the hazards of their particular occupation. A well-known example is the Black Lung Benefits Act of 1972, which was adopted thanks United Mine Workers, a miner’s union, and provides compensation to miners disabled by black lung disease (pneumoconiosis).\n\n**10. Protecting public education**\n\nSchooling and education may not be the first things that come to mind when you hear the word “union,” but our public education system and the protections and benefits afforded to teachers owe a lot to unions. After the National Education Association’s (NEA) founding in 1857, the union took a variety of progressive stances and later focused on a multitude of issues such as raising teacher salaries, ending child labor, educating emancipated enslaved persons, and helping Indigenous children subject to forced assimilation. As the Hechinger Report documents, the American Federation of Teachers, or AFT, founded in 1916, went on to fight for equal pay for women teachers, while the NEA fought for the racial integration of schools and to improve education for Black students.\n\n[https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/careersandeducation/workers-rights-won-by-unions-from-the-8-hour-workday-to-overtime-pay/ar-AA1ghkqK?ocid=msedgdhp&pc=HCTS&cvid=513d2691028440249396bf38678e4081&ei=413](https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/careersandeducation/workers-rights-won-by-unions-from-the-8-hour-workday-to-overtime-pay/ar-AA1ghkqK?ocid=msedgdhp&pc=HCTS&cvid=513d2691028440249396bf38678e4081&ei=413)",

The layoffs, which will affect organizers, national representatives, support staff and others, could take place as early as June.\n\nBut the union, which represents more than 800,000 federal staffers, vowed to continue fighting.\n\n“The President’s elimination of elective membership dues and the resulting layoffs are a setback, but they are not the end of AFGE - not by a longshot,” the union said in a statement. “We will not be deterred, silenced, or intimidated into submission.”\n\nThe downsizing was first reported by the Associated Press.\n\nAFGE, along with other federal employee unions, have been hobbled by an executive order Trump signed in March aimed at stripping collective bargaining rights from a sizable share of government employees across more than a dozen agencies. AFGE alone represents about 660,000 workers in the affected departments, according to its lawsuit challenging the order. The president said the action would strengthen national security, but a White House fact sheet also said the move was aimed at stopping federal unions who have “declared war on President Trump’s agenda.” It specifically cited “the largest Federal union,” which is “widely filing grievances to block Trump policies.”\n\nA federal judge paused Trump’s executive order late Friday afternoon in a lawsuit brought by the National Treasury Employees Union, the second largest federal workers’ union. However, the judge’s ruling will not affect enough workers represented by AFGE to reverse the union’s layoff plans, the AFGE spokesperson told CNN. The biggest financial blow to the unions stems from a March Office of Personnel Management guidance directing agencies to stop deducting union dues from employees’ paychecks. Payroll deductions are the main source of funding for unions. NTEU has already lost $2 million in dues revenue and warned it will soon be unable to recover, according to a court filing.\n\nAFGE has been preparing for such a move from the Trump administration, pushing members to sign up for its E-Dues system, where they can submit their dues directly to the union. However, the majority of members still use payroll deductions.\n\nAlthough AFGE has seen a surge in employees signing up for membership since Trump took office, the president’s drive to rapidly downsize the federal workforce has cost it members. More than 100,000 government employees have lost their jobs, with more reductions planned.\n\nThe union has taken the administration to court over several of Trump’s actions, including the firing of probationary workers and the executive order ending collective bargaining, and has also organized numerous protests nationwide.\n\n[https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/companies/largest-federal-employee-union-to-shed-more-than-half-its-staff-amid-trump-attacks/ar-AA1DFgNS](https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/companies/largest-federal-employee-union-to-shed-more-than-half-its-staff-amid-trump-attacks/ar-AA1DFgNS)?",

Companies are ejecting workers in the wake of Trump’s purported plan to use the levies to bring manufacturing jobs back to the country. The Volvo Group has announced it’s cutting 800 workers at its Volvo and Mack Truck plants in Pennsylvania, Virginia and Maryland.\n\n“Heavy-duty truck orders continue to be negatively affected by market uncertainty about freight rates and demand, possible regulatory changes, and the impact of tariffs,” a Volvo Group spokesperson told Reuters.\n\nPennsylvania Democratic state lawmaker Josh Siegel told ABC27 that Trump’s tariffs have been a “devastating blow to Lehigh Valley workers” in a region where Mack remains one of the region’s largest employers.\n\n“Workers are not just numbers—they are parents, neighbors, veterans, and skilled tradespeople who built America’s backbone,” Siegel said.\n\nEarlier this month Stellantis, which manufactures a variety of vehicles, announced it was laying off 900 employees at plants in Michigan and Indiana after the company paused production at some of its Canadian and Mexican assembly operations, according to a company memo obtained by CNN. Steelmaker Cleveland-Cliffs laid off more than 1,200 workers in Michigan and Minnesota in March, and General Motors announced earlier this month it would temporarily lay off 200 workers at a plant in Detroit.\n\nCalifornia Democratic Representative Ro Khanna claimed earlier this month that more than 4,100 factory workers had been laid off across the U.S. as Trump’s tariffs rattled markets.\n\nSome analysts have estimated that ultimately some 177,000 jobs in the U.S. would be cut after Trump announced his first round of tariffs February. Goldman Sachs noted last week in a report that the president’s tariffs would likely create about 100,000 manufacturing jobs, while also killing up to 500,000 jobs across all industries. Though Trump’s tariffs — paid for by American importers and their U.S. consumers — will make foreign products less competitive with domestic products, it will nevertheless continue to be difficult to compete with nations like China with its basement pay rates for workers, experts have noted. New plants in the U.S. are also expected to be highly automated with a reduced need for workers. In addition, business owners are reluctant to make a massive investment in a new plant, which will take several months to years to establish, given the unpredictable Trump.\n\nThe International Monetary Fund said Tuesday the global economy would likely decrease at an annual rate of 2.8 percent, including a 1.8 percent decline for the American economy as nations grapple with the impact of Trump’s tariffs. The UN agency warned the tariff increase and growing market uncertainty will likely result in a “significant slowdown” across most industries.\n\nhttps://www.msn.com/en-us/money/markets/trump-s-tariffs-driving-thousands-of-manufacturing-layoffs/ar-AA1Dqrdy?",

      "title": "Wrongfully Fired After Reporting Sexual Harassment — Need Volunteers May 6th (NYC) Tired of Being Silenced",
      "text": "Hey,NYC\n\nFirst off:\nI’m looking for volunteers to help me pass out flyers on Tuesday, May 6th, 2025, around 5:00 PM in front of Elm Wellness — 56 7th Avenue, New York, NY 10011.\nYou can stay as little as 5 minutes or up to an hour — whatever you’re comfortable with. You can also help by sharing, offering advice, or just showing support. These are requests, not demands. Any help is appreciated.\n\nI was wrongfully terminated after reporting sexual harassment, financial discrimination, and workplace misconduct. Since then, I’ve filed formal complaints and have been trying to raise awareness, even distributing flyers to inform the public.\n\nI turned to Reddit to try and get support — respectfully, privately, and in good faith. Before even posting publicly, I reached out to moderators of a support-related subreddit asking for advice and guidance. What I got instead was hostility.\n\nHere are just a few quotes from the responses I received:\n\n> “We started right out the gate banning for gatekeeping, politics, egregious violations of the civility rule and begging/offering/asking for money.”\n“If you had posted it we would have taken it down and slapped a ban on your account for this sub and you could have appealed in a year. Doesn’t matter what the GoFundMe is for, that is what we do.”\n\n\n\nAnd this:\n\n> “It’s like asking for handouts at an AA meeting.”\n\n\n\nThat was said to a single mom who had just lost her job for standing up to harassment.\n\nWhen I pushed back against how dismissive and cold that was, a second moderator jumped in — not to moderate — but to shut me down with:\n\n> “I say this AS the lone woman on this team AND as a rape survivor…”\n\n\n\nShe then closed the conversation and said the team was “opting to disengage.”\nI never asked her to share her trauma. I didn’t unload mine either. She used her experience to invalidate mine — and that isn’t solidarity, it’s emotional gatekeeping.\n\nOne of the responses also included this gem:\n\n> “This isn’t some Brooklyn hipster mutual aid circle.”\n\n\n\nSo now, workers in crisis are seen as scam artists or charity cases to be mocked?\n\nThis mindset is why victims stay silent. Why people don’t ask for help. Because even when you follow every rule, speak respectfully, and reach out the right way — you get dismissed, gaslit, and treated like a burden.\n\nBut I’m not going anywhere. I’m still here. And I’ll keep speaking out — online and offline — even if it’s uncomfortable for some.\n\nIf you’re in NYC and want to help me hand out flyers on May 6th — thank you.\nIf you can share this or just listen — thank you.\nIf all you can do is offer advice or kind words — that still matters.\n\n\nI’m just trying to survive and be heard. That shouldn’t be this hard.\n\nAnd if you’ve ever been shut down while seeking help — speak up. You’re not alone.\nWe don’t need permission to speak the truth.",

      "text": "Typically, my boss sends my paycheck through Zelle, but last Friday, he gave me a paper check. We only worked two days that week due to the hurricane, so my paycheck was $350. I mobile deposited it on Friday, and my bank made the funds available while it was pending. However, today (Monday), the check bounced, and the money was withdrawn from my account. \n\nI informed my supervisor (who is dating my boss), and she mentioned that his ex-wife is causing financial issues. She initially suggested I call the bank to re-process the check, but the bank couldn't do that. She then said she would write me another check, but after speaking with my boss, she told me he couldn't pay me until Wednesday and offered $100 cash to last until then. \n\nI asked if they would cover the overdraft fees from my bank, as I only had $10 in my account before the check bounced, leaving me at -$350. She said they wouldn't cover the fees and suggested I ask the bank to reverse the overdraft fees.\n\nIs this legal? Do I have any rights to be paid on time?\n\nFor context, I'm labeled an independent contractor selling vacation packages. They only hire addicts in sober living houses. I was hired last year while in sober living but now have my own apartment and have stayed sober. It seems like I shouldn't be classified as an independent contractor since they set my hours, pay ($400 base per week plus commission), and I rely on them for all of my income.\n\nIt also seems like they are misclassifying all of us as independent contractors and only hiring addicts because they know we don’t have the means to fight them in court. Most people I work with are felons so they’re just happy to have a job.\n\nI’ve read that if a check bounces, the employer is responsible for paying a day’s wages for each day until payment is made. Does this also apply to independent contractors? I don’t have a formal work contract, just my paychecks, and while I received a 1099 form last year, I lost it.\n\nMy friend suggested I threaten legal action if I’m not paid an additional daily rate for each day my paycheck is late, but I'm unsure how effective that would be without concrete information on Florida’s laws regarding independent contractors. She also suggested averaging a “daily rate” from my previous paychecks and giving an invoice to my employer. \n\nAny advice would be greatly appreciated!",

What’s even worse is that he’s told me that the main reason he’s even in the situation he’s in is because of the sanctions that the U.S. has put on Venezuela.

But above they make it out to be any inheritance or intergenerational gifting, period. I have been hearing the term for a while, and am now wondering if some economists like it specifically *because* it lumps together not only incomprehensible (billionare/centimillionaire) wealth & comfortable wealth, but also the far more typical situation of a parent helping their kid with some money for college or job training, people dying with a few thousand dollars and/or a maybe-still-under-mortgage house to leave to someone.\n\nI recognize this is more about class in general then labor in particular, but seemed relevant enough to post in this subreddit with its excellently class-conscious subscriber base. :-)",

      "text": "TLDR: Does the federal or Texas state government provide some kind of tax breaks or subsidies of some kind based on how many labor hours a business utilizes? Is there some other reason a commission-based employer would overhire to the detriment of all their employees?\n------\n\nI work as a hair stylist in a salon/barber shop in Austin, Texas with 8 chairs. I've been at this shop for 2 years now, and we were always consistently busy, up until the last few months. We all thought it was just a fluke and would pick up, but it hasn't. We all earn 45% commission on services, plus tips. So when there are no clients, we're not making any money. We had 7 stylists, and were all spending inordinate amounts of time sitting and waiting for customers every day, so management did the obvious thing (???) and hired another barber and stylist. We were already confused by this, when they hired ANOTHER stylist a couple weeks later. And then yet **A.N.O.T.H.E.R.RRRR** shortly thereafter! We now have 11 operators to our 8 chairs, and of course, each of our appointment books are pathetically sparse.\n\nI understand that this doesn't really cost the company more, because they don't pay us an hourly wage, but what I DON'T understand, is what benefit they receive from filling the shop with so many bored, and now impoverished, individuals.\n\nI asked the director if they were trying to push out the original stylists or something, because it doesn't make any business sense (unless all the new hires came with their own large clientele, but that was not the case). After much deflecting, she told us something along the lines of, \"The shop needs a certain number of labor hours in order to cover our expenses.\" But if 11 people are still doing the work of 7 (or less), how does higher labor hours = higher profitability? I also told her that the workload isn't enough to sustain their current labor hours, and that stylists are just going to leave and find better jobs (every one of us has been looking), and then they won't have the hours anyway. I don't understand.",

My job also requires alot of travel (often 1.5 to 2 hours of driving one way). The notification of a meal break reminder pops up on a work issued tablet, but obviously if I'm operating a vehicle I can't view the notification. At the end of the day, upon clocking out, the tablet will ask if I took a break (therfore giving me the option to say no). My employer is now stating they will write people up for not taking their break, and we aren't allowed to select no as an option. I am unsure about whether they are able to legally do so, but it's very frustrating because I want to finish my job instead of taking an unpaid break. Any advice? They are going to dock 30 mins of pay either way if i work 6+ hours, I was told if I want to work through it I should just eat the 30 mins, why should I? Why can't they eat the 30 minutes and just pay me for the fucking break they offer to clear themselves of any legal liability? They're only forcing this policy because of California and New York break policies, but as a national company, I feel they need to adjust policies accordingly.",

She called corporate and told her they couldn’t give it to her and told her to email someone else in corporate. However the kicker is that her branch of her job was informed of the requirement of this policy number over a week ago, and now with the weekend here we won’t hear from anyone. My mother is so distraught and it’s horrible to watch someone you love question whether or not they’ll even be able to entirely recover or pay their bills because the information required is buried in layers of bureaucracy. She’s so scared that she even tried canceling the surgery, but she didn’t go through with it because the surgeon told her she’d back in the hospital within a week or two.",

      "text": "# \n\nWhen push comes to shove, it's time to shove back.\n\nThe unions made this country what it is today and Republicans are hell bent to destroy them.. Regardless of lawful union contracts they are actively trying to rescind them and return workers back to the days of indentured servants.\n\nIt is time to fight back. It is time to threaten for a nationwide strike of federal employees, civil servants, and all union members across the country.\n\nWhen I say threats, I mean meaningful ones. Twenty four hours when most Tv stations are shut down. Twenty four hours with no police security for the House or Senate. And best of all, twenty four hours with no weather forecasts' for the entire airline industry.\n\nTwenty-four hours with draw bridges left in the open position, and twenty four hours with all tunnels closed.\n\nAs the rappers constantly ask,\" Know ah'm sayin'?'\n\nHey, what are they going to do, fire us?\n\nSee this report:\n\nFederal worker unions at risk: Trump's executive order and DOGE measures\n\nStory by Andrea Arlett Nabor Herrera • 1d •\n\nPresident Donald Trump issued an executive order aimed at weakening federal worker unions. This order aligns with the administration's ongoing efforts to curb the power of unions that challenge the president's agenda. By targeting these organizations, the administration seeks to reshape the landscape of federal employment and labor relations, potentially altering the balance of power between the government and its employees. The directive excludes approximately one million federal employees from collective bargaining rights, citing national security interests. This exclusion effectively dismantles the ability of their unions to negotiate on their behalf. The administration argues that these changes are necessary to protect the integrity of critical national security missions, preventing union actions that could disrupt operations in agencies like the FBI and CIA.\n\nHow does this impact on federal workers?\n\nThe order is expected to affect thousands of workers, stripping unions of their power to represent employees in legal disputes or negotiations. Union leaders fear this will severely impact their ability to defend workers' rights and ensure fair treatment. Without the protection of collective bargaining agreements, workers could face challenges in securing fair wages, benefits, and working conditions.\n\nResponse from union leaders\n\nUnion leaders, particularly from the American Federation of Government Employees (AFGE), plan to challenge the executive order in court. They argue that the order represents an overreach of executive power and violates workers' rights. This legal battle highlights the tension between the administration's policies and the rights of federal employees, setting the stage for a significant legal confrontation.\n\nLegal experts, such as Samuel R. Bagenstos from the University of Michigan, express concern over the legitimacy of the president's actions. They describe the order as a dramatic overreach of presidential authority, questioning its alignment with established legal frameworks. This perspective underscores the potential for legal challenges and the broader implications for executive power.\n\nSyndicates fear that the cancellation of collective bargaining agreements will not only erode their negotiating power but also harm their financial stability. Many unions rely on payroll deductions to fund their activities, and the elimination of collective bargaining rights would limit their ability to collect dues, further weakening their influence. This financial strain could have long-term consequences for the sustainability of union operations.\n\n://www.msn.com/en-us/news/politics/federal-worker-unions-at-risk-trump-s-executive-order-and-doge-measures/ar-AA1C18FW",

Anyway isn't this against the law? I was hired on at ft not pt but the way they breakdown my pay I get paid like a pt employee to which the explanation I was given is that it equals out to an extra 64$ for me by them doing 72 reg 8 ot but, at what fuckin cost? This is bs and I'm going to the labor board. That whole 72 and 8 bs is crazy considering I worked 4 extra hours this pay period which logically would put me at 84 hours 80 reg 4 ot but, I got paid for only 76!!?? How the fuck?? If anything it should have reflected on stub 72 reg 4 ot but, not this time just 76 reg 0 ot?? How, if you gimme 72 and 8 every pay then how did you get 76 and 0?? Do I have a legit beef?",

(All face to face conversation, no paper trail) Based on their approval, I elected to use the accrued time, Human Resources submitted my payroll, and I was paid accordingly.\n\nHowever, my employer is now requesting repayment of the overpaid amount (approximately $3,000), claiming that I was not actually eligible for the time used. This error was a result of HR’s incorrect confirmation, not any action or misrepresentation on my part. I feel that I acted in good faith and did my due diligence by checking with HR before using the time.\n\nCould someone please advise on my legal standing in this situation? Specifically, I would like to know if I am legally required to repay the overpayment and whether the employer could pursue legal action against me for this amount.\n\nI want to quit (solely due to this disrespect and how they are using intimidation to try to get me to pay), but of course have the worry over my head of a future lawsuit? I could just pay the 3k back AND quit - but that also doesn’t feel right for them to get my $ retroactively.",

He has embarrassed and emasculated them, and while they don't have the courage to stand up to him now, when his presidential protection is no longer in force they will turn on him like fish laid out in the sunshine.\n\nPatience, keep fighting, and we will endure.\n\n\n\nRead this:\n\n'Undertaken to punish': Judge blocks Kristi Noem from 'shredding' TSA bargaining deal and 'likely' violating workers' due process rights\n\nStory by Chris Perez • \n\nA federal judge in Seattle has thrown a legal wrench into Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem’s plans to blow up a union contract that protects Transportation Safety Administration (TSA) workers, saying she “afforded no notice or process” for staffers before “simply shredding the contractual promises” in a ruling this week. U.S. District Judge Marsha Pechman granted a preliminary injunction on Monday, siding with members of the American Federation of Government Employees, who are suing Noem and the Trump administration over its rescission of a seven-year collective bargaining agreement that the government signed off on last year.\n\nThe AFGE members requested injunctive relief to preserve that agreement after Noem issued a memo on Feb. 27 to cancel it within 90 days and terminate all pending grievances filed by the AFGE on behalf of TSA employees.\n\n“AFGE has demonstrated a strong likelihood that the Noem Determination constitutes impermissible retaliation against it for its unwillingness to acquiesce to the Trump Administration’s assault on federal workers,” wrote Pechman, a Bill Clinton appointee, in a 41-page ruling. “AFGE has shown the Noem Determination likely violates Due Process, having afforded no notice or process for AFGE and its members to work with DHS and TSA to resolve any disagreement before simply shredding the contractual promises of the CBA,” she said. “And AFGE has shown it is likely to succeed in showing the Noem Determination is arbitrary and capricious in violation of the Administrative Procedure Act, particularly given its complete disregard for the 2024 CBA and its mischaracterization of AFGE’s role.”\n\nPechman said AFGE’s lawyers “convincingly” argued that Noem’s directive violates the First and Fifth Amendments, along with having alleged ulterior motives.\n\n“The Noem Determination appears to have been undertaken to punish AFGE and its members because AFGE has chosen to push back against the Trump Administration’s attacks to federal employment in the courts,” Pechman charged. “The First Amendment protects against retaliation for engaging in litigation and public criticism of the government,” she said. “And the Noem Determination’s threadbare justification for termination of the CBA exposes the retaliatory nature of the decision.”\n\nIn its motion for the preliminary injunction, AFGE’s lawyers said Noem’s memorandum was “directly attacking AFGE” by name, contending that determinations on bargaining rights were “misplaced directives” that have “solely benefited” AFGE at the “expense” of transportation security officers (TSOs). “This targeted attack on AFGE came on the heels of AFGE’s public efforts to push back against the Trump Administration’s attacks on federal workers,” the motion said. “It is apparent, moreover, that the administration is both tracking and fixated on those who seek to enforce their rights in court.”\n\nAFGE National President Everett Kelley said in a statement Monday that Pechman’s decision was a “crucial victory” for both federal workers and the rule of law.\n\n“The preliminary injunction underscores the unconstitutional nature of DHS’s attack on TSA officers’ first amendment rights,” Kelley said. “We remain committed to ensuring our members’ rights and dignity are protected, and we will not back down from defending our members’ rights against unlawful union busting.”\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security has not responded to Law&Crime’s request for comment.\n\nThe post ‘Undertaken to punish’: Judge scolds and blocks Kristi Noem from ‘shredding’ TSA bargaining deal and for ‘likely’ violating workers’ due process rights first appeared on Law & Crime.\n\nhttps://www.msn.com/en-us/news/us/undertaken-to-punish-judge-blocks-kristi-noem-from-shredding-tsa-bargaining-deal-and-likely-violating-workers-due-process-rights/ar-AA1G66Zq?",

She is no longer welcome on the premises of (my work). If you see her, please know that she has severe bi-polar disorder and can potentially lead to a harmful encounter. (my work) will remain closed until the next person comes in.\n\nhe then blocked me and deleted all of his messages. i feel mostly hurt because i don’t have bi-polar and i think he is trying to make me seem crazy so that when he gets investigated he can blame it on a crazy employee. he’s also now switching everyone to w-2 instead of 10-99 which i believe is an attempt to cover his tracks just like him deleting all of his messages to me.",

      "text": "Lets just say in general we'll usually see maybe 150-200+ an hour for hiring one of these folks.\n\nLets just say a doctor gets paid hourly entry level maybe idk 60ish or whatever amounts to a low to mid 100-200k salary.\n\nWhat justifies the cost of plumbers, electricians, tradesmen, painters, mechanics, general labor, tradesmen, etc. to charge just as much if not more than the cost of a doctor?\n\nAdditionally, why would a handyman undercut the price of general licensed tradesmen? What risks are involved when using a handyman over the above?\n\nWhat are net and gross profit margins for tradesmen, etc. for the CEO at least?\n\nI assume there are insurance costs, and general overhead costs for running a business which might contribute to the higher cost over a handyman. And sure not all handyman do the same quality work. And maybe you'll find an independent sole proprietor single employee who can do it cheaper because he doesn't have the overhead a mid to large size company might have. But why not just charge 50-70 an hour versus 200?\n\nAnd lets be honest here, sometimes or even more often than not the licensed people will overcharge for an issue that might really only cost less than a hundred to fix. i.e. went to a mechanic who said they can't replace my shattered rear view driver side mirror, and that they'd have to replace the whole assembly. I just found the new mirror and replaced it myself because they wanted to charge nearly 600 dollars, when the glass was just easily bought for 5 bucks or so.\n\nIs it just a matter of its not worth their time? Are there companies out there that will do small fixes for things like that not just for cars, but other general household things where its just a small issue? I can see a higher volume for something like this, which would maybe make up for the money versus companies that charge way more and only want to deal with one time higher profit deals. But just curious what pushes the fee to 200+ an hour not including materials. How much of that goes to actually paying the specific employee? My guess is maybe 30-90+(i know electricians get paid way more depending hence the \"+\" but again highly varies within the trade) depending on experience and trade? depending on trade, some might not have other types of overhead that others have.\n\nNot hating on the tradesmen, i actually appreciate them but no one here can also deny that some of them have taken advantage of others. Just curious overall. I.e. a granite repair for a small nick maybe 1/4 the size of a dime will charge 150-200 an hour to repair it with applying resin and sanding, etc. Whereas a handyman might only charge 20-50 for his time. And yes, highly aware doctors will abuse insurance where they can too.",

Then re-opened a month later with a new owner and slightly different name.  This was all to avoid paying employees and vendors while the owners went on an extended vacation.\n\nI filed an unpaid wages dispute with the labor board, they ruled in my favor but it's been almost 3 years of them giving me more paperwork and nothing to show for it.  The amount owed to me is less than $1000, going to court isn't worth it. And it bothers me knowing that if an employee stole from the register, they'd be in jail, but these shady owners screw their entire staff and get off scot free.\n\nI'm sick of dealing with the labor board and back in that small town...  I'm looking for any advice to achieve the following goals:\n\n1) Damage the business, I'd love to see it shut down.\n\n2) Send the owners to jail.\n\n3) Get my money.\n\nI'm petty and willing to do anything (legal) to settle the score with these folks.",

      "text": "Right now with the Big Beautiful Bill, it will kick millions of people off of Medicaid if it passes. One thing I dont hear being talked about which is how many healthcare workers will lose their jobs. If tons of people lose their insurance for any reason, doctors will have less patients, and there's no way someone can afford to even see a doctor without insurance these days. Without insurance my routine blood draw would be $600+ not even including primary care visit. If this horrible bill becomes law, will tons of healthcare workers lose their jobs? I currently work in tech and my family has suggested returning to school to be a healthcare worker, but I personally am not confident about the future of healthcare because of this horrible bill",

They want to offload poverty and misery to migrant workers. These roles are deliberately kept as horrible, underpaid, and backbreaking as possible, so that the only people desperate enough to take them are the global poor.\n\nUnder neoliberal capitalism, which is the current system, immigration is used as a tool to suppress wages. A larger labour pools means employers can fill jobs for lower wages, and workers have less bargaining power.",

      "title": "My dad told me that unions don't offer job protection anymore. Is that true? ",
      "text": "My dad and I were having a talk about this today. We live in a small Midwestern college town in Missouri that has 6 manufacturing plants in the area. I don't work in any of them, but I work as a custodian for the town's public school district. One of them however, an independent company that makes medical supplies and is part of UAW Local 710 in Kansas City, had announced that they will be shutting down the plant by the end of 2025. The representatives from the company announced that the reason why for this is because it has plans to translate a portion of the plant's products to some of their other facilities in the country. So it sounds like to me that the plant has been on the decline for a while.\n\nMy dad went on to say that \"this proves that there's just no job protection in the unions anymore unless it's a big one\" which I disagree. I know for a fact that unions can offer job protection for their workers than non-union can. He also talked about a guy he heard of that left his job as a manager for a supermarket in our area to come work at the plant for more pay and said that it was foolish of him to do so since the plant is now closing down even though he just needed to provide more for his family.\n\nTo be clear, my dad is not an ass. He's very pro-union and is all for workers rights even though he's worked as a college dean his whole life. But is what he's saying for the most part true?",

Anyway, I got to talk to the guy about joining the union, and the response was less than great. Basically, I gotta ask the owner of the company if I can go union, for whatever reason. Then I can call the union and join. Now I can't really ask anyone else at the company about it because, well, this is their only union flagger. Now he's been there a while, I mean like the start of the company, and originally the whole thing was union, untill the slowly let people go over the years. Now they are cutting this one union flagger hours to make him quit. That parts the only part that's plain as day, is this company really, really does bot want anymore union flagger. Trying to see what y'all think here. I personally will be going union even if I have to leave this company after only working there two weeks. But I would like to stick around.",

Right wingers love to blame nameless faceless \"experts\" for all sorts of societal ills.  \n\nThe problem is there aren't any \"experts\" in our society who have the authority to decide where private sector jobs are located. Corporations sent those jobs overseas.\n\nWhich means rich people did that. The rich people who own and manage the corporations cited the \"experts\" (economists) who said what they wanted to hear when they paid politicians to change the laws so that the rich people could do what they wanted. And you guessed it, the work done by those \"experts\" (economists) was funded by the rich people who wanted to send jobs overseas. \n\nBehind every weasel (JD Vance) blaming the \"experts\" is a rich person (Peter Thiel) avoiding accountability.",

      "text": "Brothers and Sisters,\n\nMay 9th update - scroll to the bottom fore more details.\nMay 10th update - also at the bottom\n\nOne weekend I was out grabbing groceries when I spotted a couple cranes on the horizon. As a member of IUOE (International Union of Operating Engineers), that kind of thing catches your eye. I drove over, saw a new site going up, and took a few photos. Sent them to my local’s lead organizer - but forgot to drop a map pin. I got it to him later, but the whole thing felt clunky.\n\nThat’s when I realized: I could make this so much easier.\n\nI’ve spent over a decade building software for unions - membership systems, health & pension, training, and organizing platforms. So that night, I built [https://submitacrane.com](https://submitacrane.com/) which also answers on [https://siteintel.org](https://submitacrane.com/). It’s a simple tool: anyone can report a non-union job site (photos, location, company info), and it gets forwarded to the right union local.\n\nI started with IUOE and cranes partly because they’re easy to spot and partly because thats my union :), but I built the system to be extensible. If this tool gets traction, we can adapt it to support other trades, other types of sites, and workflows tailored to different locals.\n\nWe’re in a time where anti-union governments - (shoutout to Alberta, and much of the U.S. including the new oligarchs) -are doing everything they can to undermine workers. I wanted to build something that helps locals push back. This site is just one small way to do that.\n\nA few notes:\n\nThe site doesn’t store your photos - they get emailed and passed along.\n\nWe do use Google Analytics to understand traffic (basic stuff, no ad trackers).\n\nThis project is part of a bigger mission. My team builds and maintains a full suite of union focused software - but this tool is standalone, and it will always be free.   \n\nPlease feel free to send me any feedback or suggestions on the site.\n\nI hope it makes a difference out there...\n\nEdits:\n\nI've had a number of questions and feedback.  Thank you!\nIn solidarity,  \nu/Apprehensive_Ad5398\n\nMay 9th update:\n\nThere is a new host.  [https://siteintel.org](https://siteintel.org/).  This new site supports multiple union an their Canadian and US locals.  It is not crane specific.  \n\nThe site asks for your location for two things.  First, it will load the map based on where you are to share the site location, second it will auto populate the country and the state based on your location.  This will help people submit more easily.\n\nLocals are filtered by the selected country and state/province.  This will help reduce the volume of displayed locals.  The site supports locals that cover multiple states too, they will appear in both states.\n\nSubmissions are emailed to my team.  We then track down who at the appropriate local to forward them to and send them along.  We can then setup the system to email submissions directly to the appropriate email address of the organizer.  Contact me here of on the contact button if you'd like me to set that up.  I'll need the name, email address to send reports to and the logo you'd like to use.\n\nThere are a lot of unions and tens of thousands of locals.  I'm adding more one international at a time.  Please comment and DM me or submit a request via the side if you'd like me to prioritize yours.  Please include your name, email address to where the submissions will go and a Local and logo for your local.  If the email doesn't match your website, I will try to verify you're an actual representative of the local, so also include your offical contact information that I can reach you at.  I want to avoid collecting information and sending it random people.\n\nI have added both US and Canadian locals for:\nIUOE\nTeamsters\nUFCW\nIronworkers\nIBEW\n\nThis update also includes some new functionality to let locals give out targetted urls.  For example [https://siteintel.org/IUOE/955](https://submitacrane.com/IUOE/955) will automatically select my local.  [https://siteintel.org/IBT](https://submitacrane.com/IBT) will default to all Teamsters locals.  [https://siteintel.org/UFCW/266](https://submitacrane.com/UFCW/266) will link to the Delaware local. If the local has provided me with a logo, I've updated it to display at the top of the form, otherise it will display the international's logo.\n\nMay 10th\nThank you all for all the encouraging DMs and for sharing this site!  I appreciate the support in spreading the word about the site.\n\nMy awesome wife went out for the evening with her friends for a much needed girls night. The kids are fed and doing their thing, I jumped back in this evening.\n\nI've added four new unions:\nHealth Sciences Association of Alberta (you wanna privatize healthcare in Alberta UCP Government?  Fine, we're gonna organize all those crony owned businesses)\nIUPAT\nIBB\nSEIU\n\nSolidarity.",

Since I’m new and don’t want to buttheads with them yet and I also don’t talk politics at work, just curious if any of you would be able to help me understand their rationale. We would get tons of overtime in the winter being that we’re department of public works and the fact that trump has out right said he’s anti union and anti OT. So just curious of any thoughts.

Does the Union also demand some soft landing for those being laid off? Their severance packages are the lowest for those types of roles compared to the same roles in other industries and their skillsets are not very transferable to other verticals. Especially the engineer positions. Not to mention anyone at the senior level will find it impossible to transfer to a similar level in another company. \n\nI do agree Unions have a task to do and that is to optimize the lives of their members. My focus is on the collateral damage and the sentiment tied to it.\n\nhttps://www.seattletimes.com/business/boeing-aerospace/boeing-layoff-plan-suggests-deep-white-collar-job-cuts/\n\nThank you in advance for sharing.",

      "text": "So my job voted to unionize nearly a year ago. The union we went with was happy to have us join and was pretty understanding of our complaints. It’s been a long road with the feds involved as the company tried as hard as possible to fight it. Well, the contract is finalized and it’s awaiting ratification. If ratified We will have back pay for all conditions laid out in the new contract from the date they settled. \n\nHow this helped me instantly? Me and only the men from my team have been expected to come in and preform manual labor outside of our normal job requirements. Tomorrow is normally a day off for me. But I was still expected to come in for “extraordinary circumstances” along with all the other men on my team. My team is 50/50 men and women. Now, I’m paid salary based on 6 days a week. My job description is very narrow in its scope as I work an extremely specified field but with that has a lot of crossover knowledge and experience in a similar field. They wanted me and the other men on my team to come in and work for another department for 5 hours (hopefully) on our day off without pay. The kicker? That’s normally a voluntary job for bonus pay. But in “extraordinary circumstances” the company felt it within their right to force us to work for another department without pay. The regularly scheduled volunteers get their same bonus pay ($100 for 4-5 hours) but all the others forced in get nothing. So one of my assistants who does this job weekly gets $100 and the other four (and myself, their manager) get nothing. \n\nI brought this up with HR and they insisted it was within their company standards. And despite the contract we have saying we were a ___ technician, they could decide we also needed to do ___ responsibilities as well. As for the bonus, “are you asking we subtract that from his salary too to make it equal?” What an asinine response. \n\nSince the contract was signed with back pay (if ratified) I contacted the union negotiator and told him about this. He immediately contacted the employer and said it would be included in back pay. It turns out those “extraordinary circumstances” aren’t that extraordinary. \n\nGiven the nature of my job (we all live together) our work culture is very tight. I often help people out in different departments all the time. But the fact that a paid bonus wasn’t being given to the others doing the same job was asinine. I’ll always help those who need it. I’ll always help my friends. But this was some “more animals are more equal than others” bullshit. \n\nEdit: USA if it wasn’t obvious.",

      "text": "All over the internet people are giddy that the Federal workforce is facing elimination. They don't care what it does to our country, all they care about is that that savings can be passed on to the 1%. I seriously think these people are the product of siblings mating (i.e. Magats). Unions protect the rights of the worker. I can't understand why so many people are against workers having rights. I mean the alternative to collective bargaining would be a non-union workforce gets pushed too far and quit en masse.  Would that be better for companies? Unions can negotiate, unions can cause a little discomfort with a strike, but a mass-quitting could ruin a company. Like if the entire Federal workforce, and let's include USPS were to quit tomorrow, I am pretty sure the country would stop functioning. There's no short-term solution even if you used the military to fill all those vacancies. Imagine ads saying \"Wanted, temporary CIA agents, will train\". lol\n\nIt feels like cruelty. Anything at all that benefits the 99% in any way, half the country is vehemently against. The biggest thing that gets to me is beyond the cruelty, THEY think if they can just transfer the rest of the nation's wealth to the 1% that people like Musk will start showing up at certain doors with a million dollar check welcoming them to the 1%. Or maybe they're not that dumb, but they think they will be in the 1% at some point and all of this will benefit them. But they most likely won't. And all they will have done is made their own lives worse. Like all the people that voted for the guy who's in charge now (apparently his name is forbidden here in posts) who are now losing their jobs. They exercised their rights, and now they're filling out unemployment forms. I wonder if they're happy with what their votes got them.",

      "title": "Disappointed in Passive/Inactive Union at New Job - What Can I Do?",
      "text": "Hi all,\n\nFist off, all names and personal info have been changed here. I am a former member of the IWW as well as a former organizer with SEIU, AFT, and NNU, and now, after a career change many years ago, have finally landed a job represented by CWA. This is my first time on this side of the issue and I’ve been out of the labor movement for about ten years, so I’m very rusty.\n\nIn a lot of ways, it's great to be back, but I came into this job expecting, you know, a union job. I expected things to be SLIGHTLY adversarial, or at least for the union to have an active role in... something.\n\nThis unfortunately hasn't been the case and I'm wondering how to handle it.\n\nWe've been in contract negotiations for nearly a year now - our bargaining unit is fewer than 100 people, and in my mind there's no reason that good-faith bargaining should take that long for such a small bargaining unit. I've seen an entire hospital iron that shit out in 120 days. Additionally, the bargaining has been *completely confidentia*l other than occasional vague \"updates\" about what was discussed at bargaining meetings. In the most recent update, we were told that management needed one month to review the wage proposal and that we'd have a response \"by the end of July at the latest,\" but with two days left in the month, we have gotten no response - as far as I am concerned, one month to review a wage proposal is not bargaining in good faith, but this doesn't seem to be an issue to anyone with any control over the situation. There's a lot of other stuff that veers into \"workplace gossip,\" but suffice it to say that both people on the bargaining team, coworkers of mine - let's call them Dave and Jill - do not do particularly high quality or thorough work, though I'd never say that to management, of course. Dave is also both very friendly, at a personal level, with multiple people in upper management. Anyway, suffice it to say that at this point I have zero faith in their ability to fight for a fair contract.\n\nI also realized that none of the union postings, bulletin boards, etc at any job sites had been updated in years.\n\nNow obviously, I am the union, so I reached out to one of the staffers at our union, who is also on the bargaining team despite being employed by the union directly, let's call them Stephen. I explained my concerns and asking what I could to do be helpful. Stephen lamented that there had been so little contact with our workplace since the contract was won years ago - new employees don't go to union orientations, organizers don't visit job sites, and of course the expired postings. We agreed that I'd work on setting up new postings and bulleting boards, updating contact info for stewards and grievance officers, and trying to work to get the lines of communication back up and running. This was in April, and despite repeatedly asking, I have not been provided any new information to post by Dave, Jill, or Stephen.\n\nThis continues - my co-workers and I have had specific concerns about how our specific job site is being run, changing job descriptions, etc, and we've brought them up to both Dave and Stephen. Dave has not responded, but Stephen ended up proposing a meeting to discuss a few weeks ago. The meeting ended ended up being my coworkers and Stephen - Dave and Jill, despite saying they would attend, did not show up.\n\nOne thing that was noted during this meeting was that we are supposed to have a quarterly meeting between management and the union to address these kinds of issues, not doing so is a contract violation/potential grievance, and these meetings haven't been happening. Stephen said they'd reach out to their correspondent in management to get one set up by the end of July. This was about three weeks ago - again, we've got two days. I've asked Stephen for follow-up once a week so far and the best I've gotten is \"I haven't heard back from Management, also I learned that a ton of people have been erroneously purged from our membership roster and those people won't be able to attend the meeting, and also Dave isn't returning my calls but bargaining starts again next month so I hope to be able to talk to Dave again soon.\"\n\nAt this point it doesn't appear that anyone knows their ass from a hole in the ground, there's no sense of urgency anywhere in the process, I'm doing work well above my pay grade on an expired contract for 2024 wages, nobody is giving me a satisfactory solution to the problems I have brought up, and I have no idea what my next steps should be.\n\nI want my union to succeed and fight for all of us and I just can't figure out what the obstacle is to that happening, nor what's appropriate for me to do about it as a rank-and-file member.\n\nAny thoughts would be appreciated.",

And we’re calling on Air Canada to reach a fair, negotiated deal that pays flight attendants what they’re worth — for all the hours they work.\n\n**Supporting Messages**\n\n* The public’s behind the flight attendants, with 88% supporting their demands in a new Abacus poll.\n* Unions across the country voted unanimously on Sunday night to give Air Canada flight attendants our full backing.\n* The federal government’s order is a betrayal of all workers. The right to collective bargaining, including the right to strike, is guaranteed in the Charter, and backed up by the Supreme Court of Canada.\n\n**Important Note**\n\n* This is not an illegal strike, and **we don’t use that term**.

Most of the time it seems like people would like to not ever talk about the union.\n\nI try not to be overbearing and only bring it up when I get a good opportunity. Im rank and file myself not staff but im trying to get people more involved so we can strengthen our community. Once I started going to meetings I found a family I needed and a network of people that could help me stay employed.\n\nSo how often do you talk about union activities with your coworkers?

The same job that pays our mortgages is because of union. I’ve even gotten them to admit that if the economy was better overall, they accept lower pay. \n\nI’m blown away. They think unions have never gotten workers anything, and whenever our rep comes around they steer clear, too afraid to chat with them, but when they leave it’s gossip time. In my experience, the biggest anti-union people are just cowards who can only complain about the union because it’s a soft place to land. \n\nWe lost a vote to start a defense fund. It would’ve been $10 a month. It was voted down because we should never strike, that’s the unions problem and I laughed my way out of the meeting. I’m embarrassed by my coworkers.",

      "title": "\"If my union did its job, we should not have to strike\" -- time to tamp out these sorts of opinions from your shops and locals!",
      "text": "In attempt to refrain from being reductive and cynical about the almost anti-union. union member vibe many of us are experiencing (e.g. MAGA union voters, etc.) - which is also nothing new to this movement - what we need to commit to now, more than ever, is internal organizing. Many of us have read and use \"Secrets of a Successful Organizer\" and how we should not engage with the more hostile members but instead focus on moving up the disengaged to the supporter category. Part of that work is being frank and honest when speaking with our peers about the state of organized labour, and to then tap into their passions found elsewhere to bring people together to mount a campaign. Some of the disengaged, however, hold misinformed views of their union membership, or hold beliefs counter to our movement's collective action capacity. Many are cynical, and talks of organizing and political economy are the last thing they want to hear. Rightfully so, they want to show up to work, do their job, and go home. Many of us know that with attacks from corporations and government, that simply cannot happen. \n\nI am hypocrite writing this. We have attempted the necessary education to tamp out, contain, or counter the beliefs in our membership that undermine our efforts to organize with limited success. Of the beliefs we are tamping out is that striking is unnecessary, or unlawful, or the result of a union too incapable to bargain a fair contract. That belief stems from a blatant misunderstanding of what bargaining is, and what we are attempting to do is introduce the word 'strike' into our regular vocabulary. What is has done for us - with an outcome being our members are gung-ho whenever we need them to be as an aspiration - has already been so helpful. \n\n1. We have a weekly newsletter. We introduced a new section dedicated to monitoring job action across the globe. What it did for us is turned those in our union looking for inspiration into inspired activists, and it invited a conversation from those in our membership who are gobsmacked that we dare share this information. It has almost worked like a data point to gauge which shops need what attention, and to help us determine just how from the ground up we need talks of organized labour to be. \n\n2. It has allowed us to pivot from talks of business unionism (e.g. union membership = more money) into talks of political economy, charter rights, and worker rights. Of the positive and negative talks we've had with members, we are now better suited to talk about the big picture. \"Your labour creates all this value for your employer and society... \\[add piece about democracy, economics, or whatever you else you can think of\\]\". \n\n3. It has made us more proactive. Now when the time comes that we call for an impasse, or bargaining is breaking down, more of our members know what that means rather than us having to react to a series of questions like \"what is an impasse?\" or \"why won't the boss consider inflation in our raises?\". \n\n4. Our education, which has always talked about benefits, pensions, and essential parts of your compensation, now also talk about \"management rights\" and \"the right to strike\". We are now talking more like a union because we slowly broached these sorts of topics over time. \n\n5. We now know who are actual activist, supporter-type members are, and who are more disengaged and hostile, and frankly we learned some of our more involved members are in those categories. Members who liked being close to the union executives to benefit from their proximity to management. Now the ecosystem has changed, and they are struggling to find a place. Some are embracing the education, and others are checking-out, making room for new and engaged people. \n\nSome of us wear our union pride on our sleeves. We need to win people over, and remind people that they deserve better. People are complicated, and that aspiration is hard to meet when you are sitting in dizzying conversations with workers who are all but justifying our exploitation.",

      "text": "I recently saw an interview with Union leader [Chris Dols from FUN see here](https://youtu.be/Wnp8q6TPl88?si=VRt8gOBghi02S0Rr), in which he pointed out that being fired as a probationary employee, while generally easy, does actually require some reason or rational predicated upon the work performance of the individual employee.\n\nThis means that the en masse firings of federal union probationary workers is likely illegal, as in certainly against the union contract.\n\nI had not caught that point bc I tend to think of probationary period as 'the employers time' as it is easy on an individual level to fire someone, to just find or make up a reason of some sort. I suspect a lot of others might be thinking the same thing, hence the post here.\n\nIf you have been fired in one of these en masse firings of probationary employees, you can fight it by going to your union along these lines, the union may also be able to sue the people doing the illegal firings for damages.\n\nRelated to this is the recent mass email sent to federal employees demanding that they 'justify their job or risk being fired', this is also likely illegal, and certainly against union contract, but it is also dangerous as it provides them with information they can potentially use to justify a firing.\n\nits a fishing expedition to get that info.\n\nThe proper sort of response to give to these emails is something like:\n\n\"per union contract if you want to discuss my work performance, i request to have my union rep present. i look forward to hearing back from you with an individual appointment to discuss my work performance in the presence of my union rep. regards\"\n\nid also suggest that the union sue musk directly for threatening employees.\n\nremember folks, what they are doing is illegal, immoral, and they know it is. they are trying to intimidate people into compliance. You do not have to listen to them.\n\nat any rate, thats my read on this from a union and Labor perspective, that seem reasonable to folks?\n\n  \n**Edit (for the sake of clarity on whats going on with the email and threat, and to reaffirm that the judicial folks are also suggesting their members ignore the email and the threat):**   \n  \n\"The federal court system told staff on Saturday evening to ignore DOGE’s latest message, which demanded that federal employees submit a bulleted list documenting their recent activities.\n\nMultiple staffers across the judiciary, including federal judges, received the DOGE message on Saturday, sources told TPM. The message was sent from an Office of Personnel Management email address.....  \n  \n....In response, the judiciary’s Administrative Office sent a message addressed to all staff titled “OPM Email about Accomplishments.”\n\nThat message acknowledged that “some judges and judiciary staff” received the DOGE message, and told staffers that “we suggest that no action be taken.”\n\n“We will be communicating with OPM about this email,” the message reads.\n\nThe Saturday DOGE email marks another intrusion by the executive branch on the staid, closed-off world of the judicial branch. In this case, it featured the Trump administration telling judiciary employees — including federal judges — that they must report a list of five weekly accomplishments. Elon Musk said on social media that those who did not would face immediate removal, though the emails sent to federal workers did not go that far. It’s an absurd situation, and an example of the reckless approach that Trump and Musk have taken as they carry out a demolition job targeting wide swaths of the government. In this case, they have no legal authority over the judicial branch employees who received the messages.\"\n\n[Source here.](https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/politics/judicial-branch-instructs-employees-to-ignore-mass-doge-email/ar-AA1zCLum)",

      "text": "So a few weeks ago, I was terminated for failing a drug test (I know sounds like it's a cut and dry case) but let me explain.\n\nI had just finished a long 13hr shift and clocked out at 7:00AM on the dot and went out to my car to head home. I just remembered i forgot my water bottle, and It was cold out so I grabbed my jacket (which smelled of marijuana) and went back in to retrieve it, then came back out around 7:03AM. Thereafter I went home and came back the next day and they make me take a drug test, claiming they have probable cause since they could smell it on my jacket (which I agree to) fast forward a few days and I fail the drug test (since I do smoke on the weekends but never on the clock or at work obviously , always on my personal time on weekends). Therefore the substance will stay in you're system for weeks, even if you haven't smoked in weeks.\n\nI wasn't aware we are not allowed to indulge in a legal substance on my own time but here I am.\n\nHonestly I didn't think much of it and sort of accepted the situation at face value. I've already thankfully found a new job and am actually doing great.\n\nBut fast forward to today and my union rep Teamsters Local 14 called me and told me they want to file a grievance on my behalf and possibly go into arbitration (assuming the grievance doesn't work out). They told me that the company never told us we were unable to partake in marijuana on our own time therefore it was an unjust termination. I honestly never thought about it like that.\n\nI was told that if it goes to arbitration, then there is a likely chance that it could take up to 6 months or longer (which is perfectly fine by me since I already am gainfully employed anyway, and up until a few hours I figured it was a done deal and considered my termination final)\n\nJust curious if there might actually be a possibility for me to get my job back? I had been here for 3 years with a clean record.\n\nI work in Las Vegas Nevada in the warehouse industry. \n\nApologies if I'm in the wrong subreddit for this, If so let me know and I'll remove and move to the appropriate sub.\n\nThanks",

That funding is vital for the local stations across the country that employ thousands of Union members and provide vital emergency alerts, local news and more. We only have a few days to try and stop this bill and save thousands of jobs for our union siblings. \n\nHere are links with call tools to contact key Senators on the Appropriations Committee to tell them to Vote No on HR4. \n\nhttps://keepwvconnected.com/\n\nhttps://dontsilencealaska.com/\n\nhttps://downeastlifeline.com/\n\nPlease share these around. Please take a few minutes to call, theres a script provided in the call tools on each page. Stand in solidarity with our siblings and encourage your members, friends and family to do the same!",

      "text": "Hi guys. So I am currently a worker in a trade union. I just recently journeyed out. I like my job but what I really want to do is join the union ranks (like as a business agent or organizer or something) but I don't know the first thing about labor laws and things like that, at this point I only really know the tools. I try to make it to my local meetings as much as possible but oftentimes I am working in a completely different state. The union saved me when I was at my worst all thanks to one person who helped me get in and I really want to give back in a similar way by protecting workers and fighting for their rights...I feel like it is my calling but I also feel like I am too ignorant and far behind at this point (in my early 40s now) My question is, is there a class or something like that, possibly on the internet that I could do in my free time to try to learn more about the labor movement and laws surrounding it, things like Davis Bacon/prevailing wage, or national agreements, etc? Any help is appreciated.",

Your recognition that these services are a lifeline—not a luxury—resonates deeply with Alaskans who rely on them every day.\n\n>I’m writing to urge you to stand strong against the proposed Rescission Bill, which includes over $1 billion in cuts to the Corporation for Public Broadcasting (CPB). These cuts would devastate Alaska’s public media infrastructure, threatening emergency alert systems, educational programming, and Indigenous-language broadcasting across the state.\n\n>With 229 federally recognized tribes and many residents living in remote areas beyond the reach of broadband or cell service, Alaska depends on CPB-supported stations like KYUK (Yup’ik), KOTZ (Iñupiat), and KNBA (Anchorage, Native Voice One). These stations deliver weather alerts, cultural news, health updates, and early learning programming, such as Molly of Denali—often in the only language or format accessible to the community.\n\n>As you’ve rightly said, “What may seem like a frivolous expense to some has proven to be an invaluable resource that saves lives in Alaska.” That’s why cutting CPB now would be dangerous and short-sighted.\n\n>Public broadcasting in Alaska provides a return far beyond its modest cost—connecting families, preserving languages, supporting safety, and keeping remote villages informed when all other signals fail.\n\n>Please continue your strong leadership. I urge you to vote NO on the Rescission Bill and to help ensure your colleagues understand what’s at stake. Alaska cannot afford to lose this vital connection.\n\n>With deep appreciation,\n\n>\\[Your Full Name\\]\n\n>CWA - District 7\n\n>\\[Phone Number\\]\n\n>\\[Email Address\\]\n\n>",

      "text": "**California SB 399** basically says that discussing unions is 'political' and therefore mandatory meetings (either for or against) are prohibited. Correct me if I'm wrong, but this seems to benefit anti-unions much more than pro-union businesses.\n\nThe reason I say that is because US society is flooded with anti-union rhetoric everywhere. How else can unions defend themselves if they don't hold mandatory meetings? I see this as weakening the unions control in California.\n\n**What I am specifically talking about:**\n\n* (3) “Political matters” means matters relating to elections for political office, political parties, legislation, regulation, and the decision to join or support any political party or political or labor organization.\n\nAnd\n\n* (c) An employer, except as provided in subdivisions (g) and (h), shall not subject, or threaten to subject, an employee to discharge, discrimination, retaliation, or any other adverse action because the employee declines to attend an employer-sponsored meeting or affirmatively declines to participate in, receive, or listen to any communications with the employer or its agents or representatives, the purpose of which is to communicate the employer’s opinion about religious or political matters. An employee who is working at the time of the meeting and elects not to attend a meeting described in this subdivision shall continue to be paid while the meeting is held. \n\nBasically, anything union is now a 'political' matter. Which reading between the lines makes it prohibited to talk about either Pro or Anti union matters. I'm worried that in particular its going to hurt unions more than it will hurt the anti-union employers.\n\nI'm running for state Assembly, and would like to see Union Rights codified in our state constitution. I believe that Unions are absolutely essential to both civil and workers rights. That would include the right for Unions to hold these types of meetings. Would you all provide me feedback on these ideas? I want to gather as much info about the topic as possible.\n\nHere's the bill [https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billNavClient.xhtml?bill\\_id=202320240SB399](https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billNavClient.xhtml?bill_id=202320240SB399)",

Our contract is expiring this year and I just scheduled a proposal meeting with the group. The email explained that if this bill passes as-is, it would cut all Public Housing Operating Funds by 41%. He went on to ask that if these cuts are realized, would the Union be open to agree to a one year extension with a pay freeze at the current rates. Even if this occurs and we agree there is no guarantee that the authority won't be looking at layoffs.\n\nThese guys are all Trumpers and they gave me so much shit every time I would try to explain that this guy is  no fucking good for us. HE'S ELIMINATING TAXES ON OVERTIME!!  Last time I checked you need to be employed to earn OT so have fun with that guys. \n\nThis is only the tiniest tip of the shitberg that we are about to hit if this bill passes, so buckle up everyone",

The district itself is laughably corrupt. And yet we keep losing ground against them. I don't have the same platform they do with the press, and they are running with the story with out digging deeper. Frankly, I'm looking into a defamation lawsuit.

But I'm losing steam and hope and so are the members of my local.

They've tried and failed to bankrupt us, they've tried stupid ass schemes to get people terminated but found very limited success, now they're slowwwwwwwww walking grievances I guess to frustrate us into surrendering?\n\nIf I'm not just being conspiratorial, this massive wave of new hires is their attempt to dilute our solidarity from the inside by shifting the culture and hiring an overwhelming amount of people who are either union agnostic at best, so they won't speak up against them, or straight up pro-management and actively fight on managements behalf against US! Doing all of this will sow distrust, division, and we'll essentially end up busting ourselves. Another possibility is hiring pro-management people and \"coaching\" one or more of them to call for a union decertification vote.\n\nI HOPE I'm just being tinfoil hat on head man right now, but everything they do has some ulterior motive.

He's been out of work for a month at this point, unpaid. He was told that if the investigation came back unfounded he would get paid for all of his time that he's been out of work. \n\nProblem is, his managers and asshole. Doesn't like him one bit, And we think that this claim was made in bad faith and pushed by his manager. So we really don't have high hopes for the outcome. It did not go to the Justice center (as allegations and DSP work usually do) because it did not qualify. It stayed with the company's QA department. He answered some basic questions about his accused scenario like 2 weeks ago over the phone.\n\nHe was contacted this past Thursday to set up a meeting to go over the results And they mentioned that if you wanted to have his union rep there he could. He tried contacting the union rep 5 minutes after he hung up the phone with his supervisor. The union rep has not gotten back to him. And to add to it, he tried contacting this Union rep 2 months ago for a different matter because he felt like his manager was discriminating against him (he has a physical disability) and he never got back to him then either. \n\nThe meeting is tomorrow and he contacted his supervisor today to let them know that his Union rep has not responded and if they were going to move the meeting, and how else they could get in touch with his rep. His manager responded saying that HR would not move the meeting because they gave him 4 days and that they would tell him the grievance process In the meeting tomorrow, should it be necessary to file a grievance. \n\nMy husband expressed that he is not comfortable with this and that it didn't feel right. So far his manager has not responded back and we've got nothing but crickets. We discussed it, and he doesn't plan on going tomorrow without any kind of representation because he doesn't trust them. He truly thinks that they might find the investigation founded or even fire him. My fear though, is that if he does not attend or refuses to attend they may find it to be grounds to fire him. \n\nSo my question is, does his employer have the right to tell him that they won't move the meeting? Can they make him go to a meeting without his Union rep? They say it's a meeting to go over the results of the investigation. They did not imply any sort of disciplinary action, though he feels like he might face one. \n\nThank you in advance for any replies or help =)",

      "text": "I (30M) used to be part of the USW when I worked in manufacturing. The union was phenomenal for me and took the fight for me when I couldn't. When my company did me wrong, it was my union president who was there going \"Screw you. Treat your employees right.\" I also served as the first union steward in my building in almost 10years because nobody wanted to step up. I saw it as a leadership opportunity and took it. I was a steward for a little over a year before my work went sideways and the company restructured. \n\nWith that history, I'm still relatively new to how unions work but I know what they can do for me. And right now, I'm about to become part of a new manufacturing facility. They have no union present yet. I have been with the company maybe two-three weeks and I'm already seeing between the lines. Every powerpoint we have had have stated \"For Non-Union Hourly\" which tells me the paperwork is already there and if it's coming down from Corporate, that's a good thing right? \n\nI have already reached out to my old union president who told me that he wants me to be part of the organizing committee if he hears any word of folks wanting to unionize. I was told today by another coworker that he wants to join just from a pay standpoint. I have not done a ton of digging yet either into what all this would even entail or if I'd be in over my head. More than likely, I'd want to stay with the USW because corporate and our local manufacturing sector are mostly USW anyway.\n\nReasons I want to help organize are simple:  \nThe company isn't a year old yet (Nip them in the butt before they abuse the system)  \nWorker compensation, pay, etc.   \nBeing a voice for my fellow man as a leader on the floor  \nI have a gut feeling that we will unionize. The company is already at 1.5k+ estimated employees \n\nDue to NDA's, I can't elaborate much more on the work I'm doing other than it's in the solar industry. The plant is still being built with an ETA of almost 2026 before fully operational. They are still hiring folks left and right with barely enough ability to start folks working in the waves that they are. \n\nPlease share your thoughts and resources you may have. I'd like to hope and pray that I'm not crazy for wanting this for my company but also taking a leap of faith into something I hope will protect my career.",

My former employer settled with me about a month ago, hours before my court date. Their due date was July 24th, to meet the terms of the settlement agreement, the date of which came and went without any submissions to the NLRB, as required by law. The employer has basically done nothing to comply. No letters, no backpay, no anything.\n\nSo, now we’re in “Notice of Default” territory. I’ve asked the compliance person at the NLRB for an update, but I haven’t yet received one. Has anyone been in this situation before? What should I be doing to protect myself and the others who were involved? Could this be related to the federal government mixups?\n\nThank you in advance for your support.",

      "text": "I live and work in Michigan and am part of union for Police Authority officers (P.A. 330), for a private employer. We have approximately 130 members. Many of our top seniority officers work at various satellite locations that are away from the main campus. This includes our union president. These officers work for 2 weeks at the main campus, and then 2 weeks at their satellite locations, and continue with this rotation all year. The senior officers have discussed, and a vast majority want to end this rotation. The most senior officer will work the satellite location 40 hrs a week, and the 2nd most senior officer will cover days off and vacations. This is how it was 20 - 30 years ago and worked just fine. It was changed to the current schedule about 20 yrs ago and was done under the \"Management Rights - Scheduling Coverage\" section of our CBA. And no officers, or the union, questioned it back then. \n\nThe current problem is, is that our union president doesn't want to work at his satellite full time, as he doesn't like it there, THAT much. So, to avoid this change from happening, but not wanting to give up his satellite position altogether, he signed a \"secretive\" Letter of Understanding (LOU) over a year ago, stating that a change such as this is not part of \"Management Rights\" and needs to be part of the CBA stating that that no such scheduling changes can be made, and that the current rotation will now be part of the CBA. I say that this was a \"Secrete LOU\" in that other than the employers H.R. rep and the union president, knew of this LOU. The other members of the executive board, the bargaining officers, nor any other member was aware of this until our contract negotiations began in mid-June and it was finally disclosed by the employer to the bargaining committee that the union president had signed a LOU over a year ago in regard to this. The members that this affects, nearly 40 of the 130 members, of which a majority are totally against. Our President states that he has talked to the members that this affects and the majority agree with him, yet he cannot provide any names of those in agreement and refuses to say anything else about it. Our union v.p. has spoken to each member that this would affect, and a vast majority have signed that they are in disagreement with this LOA and the current rotation and which it to end. This will be submitted to the employer at the next bargaining session. \n\nWhat else can the members do, as this is NOT the first time that our union president as acted in his own interest and has done a \"back-door-deal.\" He has done several of them, and those are only the ones that the members have eventually found out about. Even this one took over a year before it was discovered. He runs the union as if it is his own personal social club, for his own likes/dislikes/career well-being. Is it time to file with the NLRB against him?",

I have been taking all of the required accommodation steps, and I have recently gotten an unpaid Intermittent Leave note from my doctor, to use for the remainder of my pregnancy for any pregnancy related issues, as little as exhaustion. Which been approved by my job. \n\nI have already used this to leave early a couple of times, and to call off once. As I’m nearing the end of my pregnancy it’s getting more and more difficult. I’m contemplating calling off today as I got basically zero sleep last night due to pregnancy insomnia to the point where I just feel sick from exhaustion today, but I’m always so scared they’ll find a way to fire me. Are they legally able to? \n\nI’ll add that we have a point system, and my points were high before I got my IL letter, so I’m scared they’ll think I’m taking advantage and find a way to screw me. \n\nEdit: Thank you everyone who has responded to me, I greatly appreciate it!",

      "text": "Hey fellow union workers,\n\nI’m a commercial truck driver, and when I was hired, the job requirements included an active CDL and a valid DOT medical card—nothing more. However, about two years ago, business slowed down, and my company decided to start hauling containers from the sea ports.\n\nFor this type of work, drivers need a TWIC card and a Sealink card. To incentivize us, the company initially offered an extra $50 per move (import/export) on top of our regular hourly contract rate. Two of us agreed to take on this work, myself included.\n\nA few months later, management decided to cut the extra pay down to $0. After several meetings, we managed to get it back to $25 per move, but that’s still only half of the original verbal agreement.\n\nNow, my Sealink card is about to expire, and I don’t want to renew it unless they restore the original pay. Since having a TWIC and Sealink was never a requirement when I was hired, nor is it in our contract, I’m wondering:\n\n1. Could there be any issues if I refuse to renew my Sealink card?\n\n\n2. If they terminate me over this, do I have a case to fight it?\n \n3. Add this to the contract.\n\n\nAny advice or similar experiences would be greatly appreciated. Thanks in advance!.\n\n\nI'm in New Jersey, Truck Driver",

What exactly does that mean in this context?\n\nWhere I'm from Employer Councils are, generally speaking, a positive thing. They are almost exclusively found in the public sector and it's essentially just a way for all the different unions representing different types of job classifications in their sectors to come together and negotiate with the various employers.For example in Ontario there's the College Employer Council and a direct result of that is the CAAT Pension Plan, a DB pension plan that all instructional employees whether part-time, full-time or casual get to participate in. Employer Councils are basically the closest thing we have to sectoral collective bargaining, which is something I am 100% behind. So I was quite shocked to hear that Trump wanted to implement something that I know to be a net positive for unions and workers. What am I missing here?",

      "text": "A few years ago I got a new job in the industry I went to college for. Almost immediately I heard rumors of my new workplace being in the very early stages of organizing. I attended almost every organizing committee meeting, participated as much as I was able and met most of my coworkers trying to get others to sign membership cards and vote yes! After we won I joined the bargaining committee. I've found myself enveloped in outside research about contracts and have become incredibly interested in the nuance of contract language. I look forward to every bargaining session or committee meeting we have.\n\nI envisioned myself continuing on the bargaining committee even after a contracted is voted in. I wanted to keep working in my industry and developing my skillset there. Unfortunately I can't take it anymore!! The environment created by unqualified, and frankly incompetent, supervisors is so unbearable I'm crying before leaving my apartment for work (and it makes me late sometimes...). I'm also realizing this is a job I don't want to continue in long term.\n\nI want to make a career shift and become a union rep. I've talked some with my rep about their job, and they seemed really excited I was asking these questions. Being employed by a union makes so much sense looking back on how I moved through my previous jobs-- continuedly checking in with coworkers about the issues in our workplaces, being the one to notify supervisors or HR of serious problems (which rarely got resolved, surprise!), I even brought my coworkers to a bar after work one night to write up a list of demands to improve our workplace.\n\nDoes anyone have any advice? Suggestions for what to put in a resume having absolutely no relevant employment? Maybe some skills or experiences I could highlight in a cover letter? Best or worst unions to work for? Where do I even begin???\n\nAdditionally, I understand almost all unions I would be employed at would require me to do political work like canvasing for politicians, some of which I would not want to support with my labor. How do ya'll grapple with that?",

      "text": "When push comes to shove, it's time to shove back.\n\nThe unions made this country what it is today and Republicans are hell bent to destroy them.. Regardless of lawful union contracts they are actively trying to rescind them and return workers back to the days of indentured servants.\n\nIt is time to fight back. It is time to threaten for a nationwide strike of federal employees, civil servants, and all union members across the country.\n\nWhen I say threats, I mean meaningful ones. Twenty four hours when most Tv stations are shut down. Twenty four hours with no police security for the House or Senate. And best of all, twenty four hours with no weather forecasts' for the entire airline industry.\n\nTwenty-four hours with  draw bridges left in the open position, and twenty four hours with all tunnels closed.\n\nAs the rappers constantly ask,\" Know ah'm sayin'?'\n\nHey, what are they going to do, fire us?\n\nSee this report:\n\n\n\nFederal worker unions at risk: Trump's executive order and DOGE measures\n\nStory by Andrea Arlett Nabor Herrera • 1d • \n\nPresident Donald Trump issued an executive order aimed at weakening federal worker unions. This order aligns with the administration's ongoing efforts to curb the power of unions that challenge the president's agenda. By targeting these organizations, the administration seeks to reshape the landscape of federal employment and labor relations, potentially altering the balance of power between the government and its employees. The directive excludes approximately one million federal employees from collective bargaining rights, citing national security interests. This exclusion effectively dismantles the ability of their unions to negotiate on their behalf. The administration argues that these changes are necessary to protect the integrity of critical national security missions, preventing union actions that could disrupt operations in agencies like the FBI and CIA.\n\nHow does this impact on federal workers?\n\nThe order is expected to affect thousands of workers, stripping unions of their power to represent employees in legal disputes or negotiations. Union leaders fear this will severely impact their ability to defend workers' rights and ensure fair treatment. Without the protection of collective bargaining agreements, workers could face challenges in securing fair wages, benefits, and working conditions.\n\nResponse from union leaders\n\nUnion leaders, particularly from the American Federation of Government Employees (AFGE), plan to challenge the executive order in court. They argue that the order represents an overreach of executive power and violates workers' rights. This legal battle highlights the tension between the administration's policies and the rights of federal employees, setting the stage for a significant legal confrontation.\n\nLegal experts, such as Samuel R. Bagenstos from the University of Michigan, express concern over the legitimacy of the president's actions. They describe the order as a dramatic overreach of presidential authority, questioning its alignment with established legal frameworks. This perspective underscores the potential for legal challenges and the broader implications for executive power.\n\nSyndicates fear that the cancellation of collective bargaining agreements will not only erode their negotiating power but also harm their financial stability. Many unions rely on payroll deductions to fund their activities, and the elimination of collective bargaining rights would limit their ability to collect dues, further weakening their influence. This financial strain could have long-term consequences for the sustainability of union operations.\n\n://www.msn.com/en-us/news/politics/federal-worker-unions-at-risk-trump-s-executive-order-and-doge-measures/ar-AA1C18FW",

      "text": "Long story short - I filed a grievance on an issue relating to the company not paying out promised wage increases in the contract we ratified a month ago. They slipped in a provision establishing a payscale for new employees under 4 years of employment. We were under the impression that this would apply to *new hires* and not current employees. The language is very ambiguous which they used to justify denying us raises. This affected nearly 40% of the employees.\n\nOur union filed a grievance over it and was stonewalled by the company. They demanded an actual employee file a grievance over it. The day before the cutoff to file, I stepped up and filed it. Management was very cordial at this time.\n\nThe day after filing I had my helper taken away from me. My workload was doubled. They made supervisors watch me the entire day and harangued on me for minor nitpicks they previously had no issue with. I had expected they were trying to find something to nail me with. Because of the massive workload they suddenly imposed on me, I didn't finish my Friday's work until 2 AM on Saturday.\n\n  \n*What I didn't expect* was that three different supervisors would sign written documents accusing me of time theft on that said Saturday. They specifically stated that they had a sit down with me over it on Monday (they didn't) and that I lied to them about the hours I worked (I did not).\n\nThere are only four things that result in instant termination with our contract and lying is one of them. After finishing work on Tuesday, they invited me into their office to discuss a 'safety issue'. There I was greeted by all the supervisors and upper management who proceeded to explain in detail all of the things I was doing wrong. I was accused of lying to my supervisors, when I denied this, our head manager kept repeating \"three supervisors signed documents saying you did\". They fired me on the spot and escorted me out of the building.\n\n  \nI immediately contacted my union steward, who didn't seem to really care. I get the feeling he was planning to sacrifice me to get the grievance filed. He stated we could file a grievance over this, but he mentioned this has happened before and those it happened to got their jobs back only to leave later after constant harassment. And unfortunately, at this point it's my word against theirs. \n\nWhat should I do? Is there any legal recourse I have or am I just fucked?",

      "text": "Hi everyone. I work for a mid-sized non-profit hospital system in Southern California. My colleagues voted to form a union a couple months ago, and we  just had our first negotiation session yesterday. I was voted in as 1 of 3 employee negotiators to work alongside our head negotiator who is a union employee. Our employer agreed to participate in 8 hour negotiation sessions w/ us 2-3x/month and our negotiation dates have been scheduled. The first hurdle we encountered in yesterday’s session  is our employer insisting that employee negotiators MUST use their PTO to cover their absence from work to participate in negotiation sessions. Our employer is categorically refusing to allow us to take “flex unpaid” status for negotiation dates to avoid using PTO . To be clear, the union is paying us our clinical rate for our time during negotiations , so we aren’t asking the employer to pay us. We simply want to not have to use our PTO to represent our colleagues during 8 hour long negotiation sessions. We went back and forth about this stupid PTO issue for 5 HOURS yesterday and they wouldn’t budge. \n\nWe countered their BS by stating that if they are unwilling to budge on the PTO issue, then we would need to modify the negotiation schedule so that sessions take place on weekday evenings after work  (5pm-ish) and/or on weekends so that the employee negotiators don’t have to use PTO. All the managers in the room were visibly uncomfortable by this counter because they don’t want to bring their assess in on nights and weekends for negotiations lol. The meeting ended with no resolution and  our employer’s lawyer saying that she would get back to us regarding our counter offer to change the negotiation schedule. \n\nSince we are a newly formed union, we don’t have a contract in place yet to protect us from this kind of crap, so my employer is playing hard ball and attempting to apply their standard  PTO policy to this negotiation context. My question is; in your experiences, is this kind of crap standard when negotiating a first contract? To me this situation seems so petty and almost punitive, especially since if our employer agreed to our request to allow us to take flex/unpaid status for negotiations, it won’t cost them a dime. If anyone has any insight on this matter or if any of you went through something similar as a newly formed union, I’d love to hear your insight. Thx!",

      "text": "Hey fellow union workers,\n\nI’m a commercial truck driver, and when I was hired, the job requirements included an active CDL and a valid DOT medical card—nothing more. However, about two years ago, business slowed down, and my company decided to start hauling containers from the sea ports.\n\nFor this type of work, drivers need a TWIC card and a Sealink card. To incentivize us, the company initially offered an extra $50 per move (import/export) on top of our regular hourly contract rate. Two of us agreed to take on this work, myself included.\n\nA few months later, management decided to cut the extra pay down to $0. After several meetings, we managed to get it back to $25 per move, but that’s still only half of the original verbal agreement.\n\nNow, my Sealink card is about to expire, and I don’t want to renew it unless they restore the original pay. Since having a TWIC and Sealink was never a requirement when I was hired, nor is it in our contract, I’m wondering:\n\n1. Could there be any issues if I refuse to renew my Sealink card?\n\n\n2. If they terminate me over this, do I have a case to fight it?\n\n\n\nAny advice or similar experiences would be greatly appreciated. Thanks in advance!.",

I reached out to AFSCME last year to see if we could possible unionize my sector of the city’s workers, and she said she would rather attempt to unionize ALL part-time workers for this municipality. The one problem, however, is that the city has put in place structural hurtles to prevent this sort of unionizing attempt. AFSCME wants to do a card-check election with at least a 2/3 majority vote but they need an up-to-date headcount. This is where the trouble starts. Even as a city employee, I don’t have access to a complete directory to all city workers. They also don’t post current employees lists online. So, does anyone have any experience navigating around these structural barriers or do you all know of any alternative routes to getting a PERB (for California public sector workers) card-check election? Thanks in advance for your help.",

The Employer hired lawyers to represent themselves at the table, and they took the Decision Maker out of the room. Because of this, negotiations have been slow. We asked for a $5 raise to 23. They proposed a 75 cent raise to 18.75 with a \"plan\" to get people to 23 after 9 years of employment. Our contract expires in a little over a month. People are tense. We need to get this done. We need a Decision Maker.  \n  \nSo last session we requested that the Decision Maker be present for all future sessions. The Employer promised us that they would \"let us know either way and if it's a No, then why\" through an email they'd send. They did not email us. We entered a room today that had no Decision Maker. But we were prepared. We read a powerful statement to them and then silently exited the room, all while the lawyers literally yelled and screamed at us.\n\nWe had an email queued up to send to members in event of this sort of thing. It's already out. Tomorrow, we're putting the statement up on the union board. We are not bargaining until a Decision Maker is in the room.   \n  \nFuck yeah.",

It’s been empowered by Trump, led unofficially by Elon Musk, and is **already firing thousands of federal workers**, **cutting funding to critical programs**, and **rewriting how the federal government functions**—all with **almost zero public accountability**.\n\nAnd yet Trump has **exempted DOGE from public disclosure rules**, claiming it's “efficient” and “transparent.” Musk claims DOGE is \"maximally transparent\" but that's bs.\n\nSo I’ve decided to help them with the transparency part. 😉\n\n# 💡 What’s in the Dossier?\n\n* Profiles of key DOGE personnel\n* Publicly available contact, employment, and background info (all legally obtained)\n* Data collected using platforms like RocketReach, ContactOut, and SignalHire, then run through OSINT automation tools\n* Packaged and published for maximum public visibility and accountability\n\nThis is **100% legal OSINT**, rooted in public interest law. I explicitly **condemn harassment or illegal use of this info**—this is about transparency, not targeting.\n\n# 🧱 Why I Need Your Help\n\nI’m not a journalist. Not a nonprofit. Just one person doing the research and taking the risks to bring this info to light. And it’s **a ton of work**.\n\nIf you support government transparency, stopping authoritarian power grabs, and holding dangerous actors accountable…\n\n**Please share:**\n\n* 📂 Dossier: [https://andrewlondre.com/polsint](https://andrewlondre.com/polsint)",

This isn’t just about one group or one issue—it’s about uniting as a nation to demand the change we deserve.\n\nOur goal is bold yet achievable: we aim to gather **11 million pledgees**—representing 3.5% of the U.S. population—to refuse to work until our collective demands are met. Why 11 million? History has shown that when just 3.5% of a population stands together in nonviolent action, real, lasting change is possible.\n\nWe are stronger as a united front, regardless of our backgrounds, professions, or beliefs. Whether you're a teacher, a factory worker, a student, or a small business owner, your labor is one of the most powerful tools you have to shape the future.\n\nThis movement is about solidarity, about reminding those in power that it’s the people who keep this country running—and it’s the people who demand a better, fairer future.\n\nSign the pledge today and help us reach the critical mass to stand together. When we hit 11 million, we strike—because together, we are unstoppable.\n\nThese are the demands laid out so far: Climate action. Universal healthcare. Racial justice. Reproductive rights. LGBTQIA+ rights. Living wage / raise the minimum wage. Immigration reform. Education reform. Gun safety. Tax the rich. Affordable housing. Disability rights. Welfare and child support reform. Voters rights. Constitutional convention. Paid family and medical leave. Criminal justice system reform. Workers’ rights. Permanent ceasefire in Gaza.",

      "text": "I accepted a Customer Service Representative position and signed the digital offer letter (8/11). Prior to signing (8/1), I notified the recruiter about a couple of pre-scheduled, medically necessary appointments and asked some questions about benefits. Recruiter replied (8/4), \"thanks, I'll notify the manager and team.\"\n\nA few days later, I was verbally told the company “decided to take the job in another direction.” HR then emailed saying they accepted my “decline” based on an earlier email (8/6) where I asked about compensation, even though I never formally declined the offer and had repeatedly confirmed my acceptance and start date.\n\nThe rescission happened (8/13) immediately after my benefits inquiry and accommodation notice (8/1)  [for two medically necessary appointments at 3pm, one in Aug and one in Sept]. The timing makes me wonder if the rescission was related to my benefits questions and accommodations notice.\n\nOutside of at-will employment, which we all know applies in the U.S.A., if a rescission is tied to medical accommodations or a protected class (disability), it could potentially violate employment laws. Timing matters: my rescission came immediately after notifying them of medical appointments and benefits questions, which could be seen as adverse action related to an accommodation request.\n\nWhat are your thoughts? The job doesn't begin until 8/26/25.",

I knew it would be expensive taking Ubers everyday but I'm good at budgeting and it was listed as hybrid, and I was about to be layed off so I had to make the decision to take the job. My previous job was fully remote and I've been working remote for years now.\n\nFrom the very first phone call I had with the recruiter all the way to the day I was offered the job I informed my supervisor and HR that I did not have a vehicle. They were fully aware and every interview and phone call I had before I signed my offer letter I was told that this was hybrid position, effective immediately and this is written on my offer letter as well. I was also told that there are promotion/advancement opportunities, this was important to me because I didn't want another dead end job and I asked them this question in all interviews. Supervisor also told me, \"since this a salary position I don't expect you to work 8 hour days at all because i don't work 8 hour days, you can come in whatever time you want and just try to do 5 hours, as long as your work gets done it's fine.\"\n\nThe job was significantly better in a lot of ways so I was excited. First week I started, supervisor switched up and said hybrid schedule will start after training. I didn't think anything of it. However there was no training at all. There are 3 other employees in this department and they are all overwhelmed and disorganized. Their idea of training was to have me watch their screen for 1 hour a day and then make me do the task by myself with no direction. This job works with c level executives, owners and major investors, so the tasks I was expected to complete are highly detailed and needed to be \"perfect\". I'm a fast learner, so I also brushed this off. Then on the second week we have this team meeting and it is said to me by the supervisor and another person on the team that there is no path of promotion at all. They both said, \"You will only be given more serious tasks such as contract negotiations or other legal matters\", and they want to know that I'm \"in it for the long haul\". I brushed this off too lol because deep down I knew I wasn't planning to stay at this job forever anyway. Now Monday of the third week, I went into the office of my supervisor and asked them when will the hybrid schedule start so that I can budget for my transportation and I plan to purchase a car soon. They told me \"well I want to make sure you are ready for a hybrid schedule, so I want you to just bring up this conversation to me every few weeks or so and I will see how I feel about it. But I want you to bring it up to me, and we will evaluate from there\". I brushed it off, then 3 days later it hit me that they have now lied multiple times about this. I immediately started applying to new jobs. (Fully remote only lol). Especially when I was completely honest and vulnerable about the layoffs at my previous job and the fact I don't have a car. Now today, they call me into office and said, \" I notice you are getting here at 9am and leave around 430 or 5, why is that\" I explained that the Ubers have a price surge at 8-9am and 4-6am, so it'll be like $20+ to get to work and same amount to get back home, so I'm trying to choose the best price according to the time frames. Then I said, this is why I asked you when I can start hybrid so that I can budget my finances accordingly. They say, \"well you going hybrid is conditional on you getting a car, if you can't give me a time frame of when you will get a car, then I can't give you a hybrid schedule date\". I looked at them in silence, it took everything in me not to curse them out, because this was now the 4th time they have straight up lied to me about this. I said ok I will get here earlier from now on. I didn't raise my voice at all. Then they say, \"I feel like you are upset, why are you upset?\", with a big grin on their face. I didn't give them a reaction at all, I said, \"I would like for you to continue with your points please.\" \n\nThen they said, \"well I have received a comment about you being on your phone too.\" My issue with this is, training was nonexistent. So whenever I was on my phone, it was because the people who are supposed to be training, gave me no work to do, and or they were taking literal hours to respond to me becuase they are so caught up laughing and talking or doing their own thing. Mind you we all are in cubicles together. Unless I physically stood up from desk and called them by name, they would ignore me. I told the supervisor this as well. Then they said, \"well I will just give you more work then\". Then they went on about how I can come to them about anything blah blah blah. \n\nThere are other issues that I won't get into because it's so stupid, but there were some other issues as to why the people on my team were having issues with me, mainly due to everyone else in the office finding me atttactive, complimenting me everyday etc. lots of jealousy going on. And they made snide remarks about it to my face. I already knew the people on my team didn't like me from day 1 and I know it was them who brought up all this crap to the supervisor. \n\nAlso, the president of the company works in office everyday and their office is right next to our cubicles. They do not speak to us at all, I myself have greeted them and they wouldn't even look at me and the other team members would say hello or bye when they walked by and the president said absolutely nothing and wouldn't even look at them. They try to laugh it off and make jokes about them being cold but I feel it's extremely disrespectful and disgusting to be treated like a peasant who isn't worth speaking to. \n\n\nSo after my conversation with them, I went to my desk, grabbed my purse and went home. I sent them resignation letter via email. I feel so much better. I feel like they took advantage of the fact that I was in a really bad situation with my previous job going through layoffs, I'm the youngest person in the office and or on this specific team, and I feel like they really tried to play me. If they could lie to me about my work schedule then I know it would get worse. \n\nAlso, one of the people on the team plans on leaving this job in a few months due to burnout. And the person I replaced left the position and went to HR lol so yea I learned alot from this experience.",

You know the ones, they're posted for weeks or months, you apply with a perfectly tailored resume, and then... nothing. Radio silence. Or worse, you find out they already had an internal candidate lined up.\n\nI've been in recruiting for 8 years and I get why companies sometimes need to post jobs they're not actively filling (budget approvals, internal processes, compliance requirements), but the impact on job seekers is brutal. People are spending hours crafting applications for positions that don't actually exist.\n\nLast week I saw a **\"Senior Marketing Manager\"** role that's been posted on three different job boards for 4 months. Same company, same exact description, same \"urgently hiring\" tag. It's exhausting for everyone involved.\n\nThe worst part? It's making job seekers question everything. Did I not get a response because I'm not qualified, or because the job was never real to begin with?\n\n**How are you dealing with ghost job postings? Have you found ways to spot them before wasting your time? And how is this affecting your job search motivation?**\n\n*I'm curious to hear your experiences and any strategies you've developed to navigate this mess.*",

And kaya ako nag apply sa pangalawang job is kasi sabi ng friends ko na nandun is wala daw silang ganon, hindi required or if you like, mag voluntary contribute ka. Kaya lang yung sa account na natanggap ako, may mandatory contributions pala sila like SSS/PAG IBIG/PHILHEALTH.\n\nNow, wala pa kasi sa plan ko mag resign kasi super stable na ng job ko ngayon, although I am planning pero not now. But— nasasayangan din ako sa opportunity sa pangalawa kasi maganda dun.\n\nKung schedule lang pag uusapan, kayang kaya naman. Yung concern ko lang talaga po is possible ba na may mangyayaring sabit in terms sa contributions? Or what should I doooo? \n\n\nSalamat po!",

She tells me that I have to tell my employer that I have epilepsy, even though I am not legally obligated to tell her. \n\nThis unnecessary argument started with me telling her that I didn’t get the apprenticeship that I applied for, even though they really liked me and my performance. I said that it was not nice of them to leave me waiting for 2 weeks straight even though the employer said she would send me an email „next week“. \nAfter two weeks I finally send her an email (I didn’t feel like waiting anymore) and asked if I got one of the places that they had. I then got an email were the employer said that she has people who are better suited for the apprenticeship/job.\nI get it, it is what it is, but I was just really annoyed that she didn’t tell me earlier. \n\nI texted my bestie today and told her that I didn’t get in and that it was not nice of the employer to tell me earlier. She started talking about it as if the same thing happened to her (it didn’t) and it kinda pissed me off. She started saying that I have to tell my employer that I have epilepsy, even though I don’t have to, unless it physically disables me. My epilepsy does not disable me in any kind of way. \nShe then suddenly said that I could get sued if I get an seizure and get hurt from it…it doesn’t make sense!!! Why would my employer sue me for my epilepsy. I would be insured under them and not self-insured. So I don’t get why the heck she is saying that. I researched it and oh?  Guess what, nope I can’t get sued for it, but she doesn’t shuts up about it. \n\nI am currently working at a restaurant and I had two „big“ seizures and the ambulance got called, even tho I didn’t need it. Back then my employer didn’t know that I have epilepsy and guess what I didn’t get sued. So I don’t get from where she has that information. \nI do have some small „seizures“ sometimes, but it doesn’t disable me, I can still talk, walk and all that other stuff.\n\nSorry english is not my first language, I am from Germany and sorry for the rant.",

      "text": "Hi all, looking for blunt feedback. I’m exploring a Career Residency for people between jobs (recent grads, laid-off folks, or anyone struggling to land a role) who don’t want a resume gap and need structure.\n\nImportant upfront: This is not employment (no wages/benefits). It’s a clearly labeled fellowship/residency with verification of participation and deliverables.\n\nWhat it is:\n\n* Full-time or part-time residency (you can list: *“Fellow - \\[Program Name\\] Career Residency (Full-time)”*), clearly marked as a fellowship.\n* Daily structure: standups, focus blocks, weekly demos; small squads; realistic deadlines.\n* Real projects for nonprofits or open-source (code PRs, data dashboards, marketing briefs, ops SOPs) so you ship clickable artifacts.\n* Job-search blocks every day (targeted apps, outreach/accountability, mock interviews) + light workshops.\n* Join/leave anytime; remote-first. Optional in-person days if/when space allows.\n* Verification: letter of participation + links to public artifacts. No pay stubs or “employment verification.”\n\nWho this might help:\n\n* Recent grads who want portfolio pieces + structure.\n* Laid-off/transitioning pros who want momentum and accountability.\n* Students who want to strengthen their résumé with real deliverables.\n\nReality-check questions (please be honest):\n\n1. Would you try this for a month while job hunting? Why/why not?\n2. What would make it feel legit vs scammy (specifics, please)?\n3. Which parts matter most: structure, artifacts/portfolio, coaching, networking, or quiet workspace?\n4. What’s a fair monthly price for remote-only? \\[$49–$99\\] \\[$100–$149\\] \\[$150–$249\\] \\[Nope\\] And for in-person access (desk a few days/week)? \\[$149–$199\\] \\[$200–$299\\] \\[$300–$399\\] \\[Nope\\]\n5. Any red flags in how you’d present it on a résumé? How would you word it?\n6. (Optional) What city are you in, and how many hours/week would you commit?",

He said the resturant is open until 2pm. Is this a good sign or bad sign? Should I call again tomorrow? Idk. I’ve been trying to get a job before 6 months and I am fretting about this a bit.",

And kaya ako nag apply sa pangalawang job is kasi sabi ng friends ko na nandun is wala daw silang ganon, hindi required or if you like, mag voluntary contribute ka. Kaya lang yung sa account na natanggap ako, may mandatory contributions pala sila like SSS/PAG IBIG/PHILHEALTH.\n\nNow, wala pa kasi sa plan ko mag resign kasi super stable na ng job ko ngayon, although I am planning pero not now. But— nasasayangan din ako sa opportunity sa pangalawa kasi maganda dun.\n\nKung schedule lang pag uusapan, kayang kaya naman. Yung concern ko lang talaga po is possible ba na may mangyayaring sabit in terms sa contributions? Or what should I doooo?\n\nSalamat po!",

      "text": "After being laid off, which happens every summer because I am an education-support worker for a contractor paid by my city, I was considering not returning to that job.  I read through the first reference below which says \n\n*\" Did you know that if you voluntarily quit your job without just cause, you will not be paid* [*regular benefits*](https://www.canada.ca/en/services/benefits/ei/ei-regular-benefit.html)*?* \n\n*A number of circumstances for quitting are considered just cause* \n\n*You are justified voluntarily leaving your job in the following situations if, considering all the circumstances, quitting your job was the only reasonable alternative in your case: working conditions that endanger your health or safety\"* \n\n*\\[there are 13 other \"circumstances\" listed re. \"just cause\"; this is from the first reference/link\\]*\n\nSince I had been assaulted twice at work, there were three shootings within 10 blocks, I had worked close to someone, who was possibly psychotic, throwing knives around and a provincial Ministry or Labour Provincial Offences Officer had ordered my employer to provide a \"workplace violence risk assessment\" and my former employer failed to do so, I informed my employer that I wasn't returning. \n\nService Canada informed me that I may be ineligible for benefits if I quit after being laid off, so I gave them some verbal information. I had been keeping notes of messages and emails I had sent to my supervisor and others in management. I had 12 examples of how my work was not safe, which seemed more than enough \"just cause\" to quit my job and receive EI benefits. The workers at Service Canada seem very kind and friendly.\n\nI was told it would be another 20 days for an Employment Insurance Commission employee to evaluate my claim. When that person contacted me, they didn't see the three documents I had uploaded or the first ROE which said that I was laid off. They only noticed the second ROE, which said that I had quit. They showed no concern for my claim of \"just cause\" for quitting. They told me that I required a doctor's note stating that my work had negative impacts on my health. I contacted a free legal advice clinic and was told \"it's great that you looked at the Employment Insurance Act, but policies are different; I advise you to get a doctor's note or you're probably not going to receive EI benefits.\" \n\nSo much for \"safety\" and \"just cause\"...\n\nI'm planning on requesting a doctor's note, which is a possibility because of several pre-existing health conditions which were magnified by my dangerous work, but I'm just wondering how much value the Employment Insurance Commission puts on workers' safety? What has to happen to me for violence in my workplace to reach the threshold of \"just cause\"? Do I have to be stabbed to quit my job and receive EI? Do I have to have my head cracked open? Does there have to be any blood? \n\nI know that policies of government sometimes conflict with laws, and that there are multiple appeal processes, but when government policies ignore laws, that's when lawyers and judges get involved. It seems that governments know that their policies are \"illegal\", but they ignore those laws anyway and fight in court until the plantiff gives up. The law clinic I spoke with said they don't deal with government policy. I decided to email my member of parliament, my member of provincial parliament, my city councilor, the federal minister of employment and the prime minister. I included two newspapers in the email. \n\nI'm not planning a lawsuit, but thought I'd give you some info and hopefully we can make a change. If I had lied and said I was returning in September, I would have received EI with no questions asked, but because I was honest, I was denied benefits. The issue of worker safety at all levels of government seems to be completely lacking. The provincial offences officer told me that they only require minimum standards regarding worker safety. Why are they not setting a better example for employers who often ignore all safety standards?\n\nQuitting your job and EI [https://www.canada.ca/en/employment-social-development/programs/ei/ei-list/quit-job.html](https://www.canada.ca/en/employment-social-development/programs/ei/ei-list/quit-job.html)\n\nEmployment Insurance Act [https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/e-5.6/](https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/e-5.6/)\n\nDigest of Benefit Entitlement Principles, the Employment Insurance Commission  [Digest of Benefit Entitlement Principles - Chapter 6 - Section 8 - Canada.ca](https://www.canada.ca/en/employment-social-development/programs/ei/ei-list/reports/digest/chapter-6/checklist.html#aduties)",

I joined back for 3 months, but unfortunately, his cancer relapsed, and I had to leave my job again to care for him. I eventually lost him, and now it’s been almost a 12-month gap in my career. I’ve been upskilling myself during this time and am now transitioning into Oracle HCM Functional Consulting (Core HR, Absence, Payroll, HDL/HSDL). But I’m facing challenges because most companies are asking for prior Oracle HCM consulting experience.\n\nHas anyone here faced a similar career break + transition? How can I position myself better to get opportunities? Any advice on how to approach recruiters/companies with my situation would mean a lot. Thanks in advance 🙏",

      "title": "Am I reasonable to decline promotion with the offered raise?",
      "text": "Background:\n-have a bachelors and masters degree, but in fields pretty unrelated to current industry\n\n-have worked in this role at this org for ~4.5 years\n\n-support type role on a team\n\n-great industry\n\n-my compensation year over year has been very fair, and my current salary is fair given the workload and the specificity of the work\n\n-I've received great reviews each year (earned exceeds expectations the last two annual reviews), along with fair salary raises and pretty much a maxed out bonus each time.\n\n-I'm HAPPY at my current role. I prioritize work-life balance over most everything else, and this job I have it down to a T, with a lot of autonomy in day to day duties, and the trust of a great director (I don't have a manager I report to).\n\nThe org has been trying to promote me for probably 2 years, and so far I’ve declined. The promoted role wasn’t something I was super interested in at the time. Rather, I was trying to get a new role created that I and my director thought would fill much needed gaps. That’s likely not going to happen, for various reasons. I’ve accepted that. This spring after conversing with our VP, I said I would like to start talks on the promotion. This was met with enthusiasm on all parts, because the role I'd be taking is filled by someone who is not working out.\n\nA few weeks later the VP via text told me to expect a 10% salary bump plus higher bonus %. I said I was looking for 15-18% bump since I’m VERY familiar with the workload and the demands of the new role, since I support those currently doing it and I know the territories I'd be expected to take over. VP said he’d see what he could do. After that, it was taking weeks to get a written formal offer from HR; I attributed that to just corporate red tape. My director was keeping me in the loop as to where it was in the pipeline (HR approval, VP approval, etc), as well as working with me to start the job posting for my replacement. My role HAS to be filled, as the team cannot function efficiently without it.\n\nI got a call day before yesterday with my director who finally had the written offer details to share with me, and he prefaced it by saying he knew I would be displeased. I was, and a little shocked - offer was a 4% bump in salary. I flat out told my director no go. Yes, the bonus % is higher as expected but base salary is more important for me. My team kills it every year with performance, but I have no idea what new economic calamity could occur that would render the higher bonus I feel they’re dangling in front of me moot. I’m not willing to risk it. My director understood.\n\nPretty shortly after that my VP called and was very supportive of my decision to decline. Like my director, he’s a solid guy. But then the EVP of my VP wanted to discuss the promotion with me. I was very upfront with him and he did put a good spin on things (I'd be eligible for another merit raise on the normal schedule, at a higher percentage; the potential maxed out bonus would ultimately put my total compensation where I want the base salary to be, the company sees a great future with me, etc). I told him I would circle back with my director after some reflection.\n\nUltimately I'm 99% sure I'm not moving from my current position for the promotion at the salary they're offering. I would be content to be in my current role for a good while longer. I enjoy the supporting role, and I know I'm valued because if I couldn't do everything my job entails, the team would suffer. I’m also cognizant of the perks of this job - working remotely being the highest, along with the good synergy of the team. \n\nI’ll circle back with my director tomorrow to reiterate that based on how things have progressed and what was communicated to me, I’m fine with turning down the promotion and staying where I’m at. The VP says I’m in a good position with leverage, and he says he believes they’ll be in for a surprise if they post the role to outside applicants and get feedback on the salary they want to offer. But, obviously, while I don’t believe I’m being unreasonable, I’m interested in outside opinions.\n\nThanks all!",

      "text": "Location: Ohio & New York  \nSalary exempt or non-exempt? Hourly? Per diem or commission? Salary & Hourly  \n*What is the single employment law question?* How common is it in the USA for schools & employers to falsely classify/claim their students & employers as being disabled when it is not true? (The followup questions would be: How to obtain (financial) reparations for lost income?  \nHave you done a minimum amount of research yourself? Yes. Gathering more data points\n\n\\---------\n\nI am saying that there is a specific scenario where where a school and/or employer—can be both private and/or public—will hire and enroll an individual and then claim the individual has some sort of disability in some way. Let’s say that the school/employer are claiming that the student/employee in their system is intellectually disabled/developmentally delayed (ID/DD). \n\nAs you may already know, there’s many tax incentives for doing this. Companies get kickbacks since there’s a quota, schools get funding from specific sources, employees can be paid less (since they’re being written off as less competent), work screwups can be blamed on the employee (since they’re “supposed to be stupid & not know what’s going on”), and it’s easy to manipulate an underresourced & deliberately uninformed/misinformed student/employee since they’re literally living on signficantly less money/resources than their counterparts. You’re literally feeding them sht & keeping them in the dark, a slumdog millionaire manouever where the decision to cripple someone in a misguided attempt to generate funding redirects/misguided misunderstood karma is now proving itself to be patently obvious.\n\nOther instances demonstrate deliberate malicious manipulations & bad actors:\n\nFor example, the student/employee is told to seek unemployment assistance within the state govt despite not being a resident of the state by the school (this is a known fact), being told that they qualify for SSI to offset the stolen pay, not being given refunds/reimbursements/equal pay for what their peers qualify for at school/work since they’re told that the govt will pay their SSI (which they don’t receive), being told that no school omsbudsman exists at the school when asking to discuss grade dispute when it’s not true, being told that they cannot work more than 1 job despite not being paid a living wage (despite this not being true & other colleagues not being treated the same way), being told they cannot organize and/discuss salary, etc.\n\nThe obvious issue here is that the student-employee is neither mentally retarded nor is there any official documentation of this. If anything, it’s malicious systematic activity. It’s clear that the institutions are creating outputs & manipulating situations to produce specific outcomes—at the harm/expense of selected subjects.\n\nI assume it’s easier for them to manipulate an out of state student-employee since they don’t have the knowledge or support systems that an in-state local would have (more guillable too). Although, in this case, similar/same situations occur.\n\nHow common is this type of fraud?",

Do I stay with my company, which is an 'upstart' of approximately 25 employees, limited benefits, no retirement savings plan, BUT offers flexibility to work from home, take vacation when I need it... OR is it now time to get licensed as an agent, drum.up my own business and take the cap off my income?

Is this legal even if I have already signed a quitclaim before. I don't want to sign the new quitclaim and I have not but the amount that they credited for my final pay is the updated amount which is way less than the first quoted final pay.

      "text": "**Italy. Hi everyone,**  \nI'm Italian and I wanted to share how I'm feeling lately: I'm exhausted from working in consulting. For being in my second year, the pay isn’t bad — I’ve reached a gross salary of €35k — but honestly, even if they offered me €60k, it wouldn’t make a difference.\n\nConsulting has worn me out: tight deadlines, toxic coworkers, constant pressure… I really want to get out.  \nDo you have any advice?\n\nThe only thing I liked was the full remote policy, but they’re removing that starting this September. So, doing the math, it’s just not worth it anymore with my current salary.\n\nI’d really like to work for a company that’s *not* in consulting. I have three degrees: a Bachelor's in Sociology, a Master’s in Economics, and another Master’s in Data Science. Currently, I work in the field of **Business Intelligence witch PowerBi,Qlik and Microstrategy**.\n\nI'm looking for a more dynamic company. I’d also be very open to relocating abroad, but I’m not sure where to go.\n\nHave any of you been through something similar? How did you make the switch? Do you know if companies are hiring people with a profile like mine?",

      "text": "Hi im an engineering field worker. Previously I was an intern at company A(lets just call it that as I dont want to share the company name) where it was quiet a bad internship. Many factors actually one of it was during that time, I was doing my diploma and barely have any working exprience in that sector of company. Long story short, I was a bad intern as i lack skills. Now before you judge i just want to clarify it was during post covid thus I was very desperate, I was able to get the internship from someone inside and no interview was conducted. \n\nMy question is, if i return to that company but this time through my own application(which i know the jobscope now) do you think that the company will instantly reject me because they might have my record previously or would they give a chance?\n\nThanks.",

The candidate had recently been let go from a failed start-up and had been unemployed for nearly 2 months.  However, during the debrief the employer explained to the candidate that in every respect of the requirement, their skills and experience perfectly matched the needs of the role and they had interviewed extremely well.  \n\nThe final decision of successful candidates had been based on the gut feeling of an adjudicator who did not meet any of the candidates. \n\nThere is never any certainty when somebody applies for a role and it is entirely the prerogative of the employer to pick the person who best meets their expectations so nobody has the right to expect an offer purely because of their own personal circumstances. \n\nHowever, from a moral and ethical position was the companies decision to turn down the candidate who was unemployed entirely fair and reasonable if indeed they were a good match for the role and were perfectly capable of fulfilling the outcomes required?",
