      "text": "I saw the FOX rankings of top quarterbacks and noticed they seem to rank Mahomes above Peyton Manning, even though Peyton has five MVPs. To me, football should be the one sport where MVP awards carry more weight than playoff results, since itâs not a series format. In the other major sports, if youâre the MVP on the best team and still lose, thatâs usually seen as a legitimate knock on your careerâbecause itâs rare and often reflects underperformance.\n\nBut in a one-game format like the NFL or March Madness, luck can play a huge role. The best team doesnât always win, and that randomness is part of what makes football so thrilling to watch. Still, I donât think a playoff loss should count heavily against a playerâs legacyâespecially in cases like when Mike Vanderjagt missed an easy kick that kept Peyton from a potential Super Bowl run. In other sports, a single play like that usually doesnât end a championship bidâyouâd have to lose two or three games for that to happen.",

      "title": "[OC] How the Seattle Seahawks Ruined Defensive Football For a Decade",
      "text": "**I. Intro**\n\nWarning : this is a long ass post, with some meandering, but I promise you, there is a point to all of this. Thereâs been a lot of talk in the early part of this year about the down trend in scoring. This isnât really anything new - this has been the trend ever since 2022. Right now, it doesnât seem like the next innovation on the offensive side of the ball is coming this year. Theyâre still getting their asses kicked, and donât seem to have gotten closer to countering the defensive trends that really kicked off in 2022. \nWith this comes talk of, whose fault is it? Is the QB play bad? Is it cover 2? Itâs gotta be the OLs, right? Coaching? [I think thereâs a pretty undeniable correlation here](https://operations.nfl.com/gameday/analytics/stats-articles/how-defensive-schemes-are-shaping-the-nfls-passing-game-in-2024/), and itâs whatâs been in the mainstream discussion since 2022. Spoilers : the two deep safety alignment (which often will mistakenly get called cover 2, thanks Chris Collinsworth) has undeniably played a large factor, in my opinion the biggest factor, in the beatdown defenses have been giving to offenses the past three years\n\n\nBut really, I think to explain why this has happened, we have to examine the 2010s to see how we got here. Because really, these defensive trends are just a reaction to the offensive trends that were annihilating NFL defenses and leading to record yardage/scoring throughout the mid/late 2010s.. And those trends were a reaction to the defensive trends at the time, so on and so forth, but really, the more I think about the 2010s, the more I stop and think : What the fuck were defensive coaches and Front Offices thinking?!\n\n\n**II. The Seahawks Ruin Defensive Football for the Next Decade**\n\nStarting around 2011, we had the beginnings of what became known as the Legion of Boom. They were pretty good, donât ask me how I know. Primarily built around FS Earl Thomas, CB Richard Sherman, and SS Kam Chancellor (along with some other good players such as CBs Brandon Browner, Walter Thurmond) the Seattle Seahawks dominated the league defensively from 2012-2014, and were able to bring Seattle itâs first SB. Allegedly, I donât remember a Superbowl being played that year.\n\n\nâ¦ And in doing so, they set defenses back for approximately a decade. The thing about those Seahawks is they were very simple defensively. For their front, they ran a 4-3 hybrid front that combined two gap and one gap concepts - unlike most 4-3 defensive fronts, they utilized a 5 technique DE to the strong side of the formation to two gap and help stop the run. For Seattle, this was Red Bryant, a 6â4â 320 pound mammoth who was the dictionary definition of a run stuffing, 3-4 DE rather than the typical 4-3 DEs who were lighter and expected to rush the passer. This front helped protect their all-pro/pro bowl level ILBs Bobby Wagner and KJ Wright, who were smaller, lighter, and faster than many typical ILBs at the time and excelled in coverage.\nBut as a lot of people probably know, itâs not the front that the LOB was known for schematically - it was their cover 3 defense on the back end. Cover 3 is a pretty good defense. Despite the trend to two high safety pre-snap alignments today, [cover 3 is still the most common cover call in the league](https://x.com/fball_insights/status/1841182351428370850) - every team utilizes it to some degree. Why is this? Itâs just overall a very reliable, safe, and balanced call, where there arenât a lot of calls an offense can make leaving you going âoh shit this is going for 6â. It allows you to have a safety walked up in the box - in Seattleâs case, this was the Eater of Worlds, Destroyer of Run Games Kam Chancellor, who looked a little bit more like a LB than a safety at 6â3â and 230 pounds. The advent and wide spread adoption of pattern matching - which the Seahawks mastered - helps you play fundamentally sound football against some of the traditional weaknesses cover 3 has - unlike what Madden told you, 4 verts doesnât always beat cover 3.\n\nThe simple explanation of pattern matching - which really dates back to Nick Saban with the Browns in the 90s - is essentially, following a list of rules, defenders man up on receivers depending on the offensive play call - this is in contrast to the traditional âspot droppingâ many think of when they hear zone - where a player is keeping his eyes on a QB and dropping to a landmark to cover. As I alluded to, this was developed by Nick Saban after his 1994 season with the Browns - where they faced a dilemma. A split safety defense, or two deep safety defense, was strong against the pass and the west coast offenses of the 90s in particular. Single high safety defenses - with that second safety in the box - stopped the run. \n\n\nNick Saban, DC for the Cleveland Browns under Bill Belichick, felt the Browns didnât have the talent to run a cover 1 defensive scheme, so cover 3 was their solution to stop the run. The Browns defense was best in the league that year - a league low 204 points allowed. They finished 11-5. If I remember correctly, it was one of the best in league history at that point in time. They lost to the Pittsburgh Steelers three times that year, by a combined score of 26-63.\n\n\nThe problem the Browns ran into is that they had to go to a single high safety defense to stop the Steelers run game, which meant cover 3, but in doing so, the Steelers would run 4 verts and torch them. Simple concept â 4 players running deep, 3 deep defenders in zone coverage = your toast. Play cover 3 and get killed in the air - or play a split safety defense and get gashed by the run, they had no answer. The result was cover 3 rip/liz, what Iâm pretty sure is the earliest concept of pattern matching we know of. Hereâs how it works vs. a 2x2 offense running 4 verts:\n\n1.\tFlat defender covers #2 man to man (slot or TE) if he goes vertical\n2.\tCB has #1 man to man if he goes vertical\n3.\tHook defender covers #3 if #1 and #2 go vertical (in a 2x2 alignment this typically means a LB covering a RB in the flats)\n\nThis has you manned up on 4 vertical threats, and lets the FS choose where he needs to help. This is just the beginning of pattern matching, which is used all throughout the league today out of different coverages with many different rules to combat dozens of different passing concepts, like cover 3 mable to defend 4 verts from a 3x1 by splitting the field into cover 3 on one side and man on the other, but Iâve already gotten side tracked on this topic too much.\n\n\nAll of this is to say, the Seattle Seahawks were able to play a scheme that was well balanced vs. the run and pass and could play fundamentally sound football vs. the passing concepts of the time. They didnât really disguise much - outside of the fact that cover 1 and cover 3 looks the same pre-snap (more on this later, maybe) - they just lined up and said âweâre better than you, you know what weâre going to do, and weâre going to beat youâ. And it worked. You couldnât run the ball - not with guys like Red Bryant, KJ Wright, Bobby Wagner and Kam Chancellor in the box. Youâre not beating them deep - not when you have the fastest, rangiest FS in the league in Earl Thomas and Richard Sherman who could play the cover 3 man match to perfection - not to mention an elite pass rush featuring Cliff Avril and Michael Bennet - they dared you to throw underneath, and trusted the speed and sure tackling to prevent any YAC. Forcing you to take these slow, methodical marches down the field amplified any mistakes you made â taking a sack, offensive holding, turning the ball over were back breakers â and the Seahawks were a great ball hawking defense.\n\n\nSomething else to mention as a key part of their success - and this is probably relevant later to offensive production exploding - the Seahawks basically realized that you could pretty much hold on every play, and refs wouldnât call it, not wanting to throw a flag every play. This was very smart gamesmanship IMO, and I donât mean to say it to discredit them at all - but after 2013 the league passed the LOB rule, which didnât really change anything in the rulebook, but made it a bigger point of emphasis. The result was a significant increase in defensive holding calls - from 181 in 2013 to 235 in 2014 - this number didnât fall back to under 200 again until 2020 (which also had a record year in DPI). Defensive holding has also trended down in recent years, to 186 last season.\n\n\nAs we all know, the league is a copy cat league, and the race was on. Everyone wanted to be the next LOB, and single high safety defenses became the de-facto in the league - after two high safety defenses such as the Tampa 2 had been used all throughout the 2000s to combat the resurging west cost offensive concepts and quick game passing QBs like Peyton Manning and Tom Brady excelled at. Beyond that, teams wanted the next Richard Sherman, Earl Thomas, Kam Chancellor and it heavily influenced defensive drafting as a result. Whereas 6â3â used to be seen as a detriment for a corner, it was now sought after. Safeties who could play in the box and cover man to man were desired. Everyone wanted a highly athletic, elite cover FS with range to be their deep man.\n\n\nThis was further cemented when the 2015 Broncos, AKA No Fly Zone, AKA the greatest defense to ever live dominated the 15-1 Panthers and MVP Cam Netwon in SB50, the best Superbowl ever. The 2015 Broncos were fundamentally a pretty similar defense to the LOB, and I feel the differences are rather superficial. They played a lot of cover 3 man match as a base defense. They differed from the LOB in that they ran an aggressive, one gap 3-4 front. Whereas the Seahawks ran cover 1 to mix things up, the Broncos used it more heavily. The Broncos liked to green dog blitz out of cover 1 - where if a TE/RB stays into block, his man rushes the passer. But fundamentally, they were both single high safety, middle of the field closed defenses that didnât hide what they were doing - just lined up and said âIâm better than youâ. And it also worked for the Broncos, who had the leagueâs best pass rusher and future HoFer in Von Miller with HoFer Demarcus Ware lining up across from him, two high end iDL in Derek Wolfe/Malik Jackson, two great ILBs Brandon Marshall/Danny Trevathan, dominant man corners Aqib Talib/Chris Harris/Bradley Roby, and two safeties in Darian Stewart and TJ Ward who fit the prototypical deep safety/box safety combo.\n\n\nSo really, it wasnât just enough that teams wanted the next Richard Sherman, Earl Thomas - teams wanted two book end pass rushers. They wanted ILBs covering side line to sideline who could cover TEs down the seam and run with RBs on wheel routes. They wanted to have three starting material corners who could man up every week. A penetrating iDL that pressured the QB. You might be noticing thereâs a problem here.\n\n\nI distinctly remember feeling something was off when Stanley Jean Baptise was a highly rated prospect. You probably donât know who that is. Itâs ok, he wasnât good. His appeal was being 6â3â and 215 pounds in a time when everyone wanted the next Richard Sherman. His downside was well, he couldnât really play corner. The Saints drafted him in the 2nd round in the 2014 draft, and cut him early the following year after he got torched early in the season. He bounced around on teams practice squads following that. He recorded one tackle in his NFL career, and thatâs it.\n\n\nSo, hereâs the thing. These two defenses worked so well, and are all time great defenses, because they were just flat out better than everyone. They were stacked at every level of the field. It didnât matter if you knew the plays and route combos that would theoretically work against them, they were still going to win. These defenses arenât exactly easy to execute. Cover 1 in particular. With all of the WR talent today and 11 personnel, you need three corners who can cover man to play cover 1. You need a superb talent at FS to cover the post. Your SS needs to be able to a) fit the run b) cover man to man and c) be comfortable covering the hole or dropping into flats. You better be able to pressure the QB with a 4 man rush - because you arenât blitzing a lot.\n\n\nSo we get back to the question that led to me rambling about all this : what the fuck were teams across the league thinking when they all decided they were going to live out of a single high safety defense and that was their blue print? How did practically every front office, DC think that the way to build their defense was to get all the talent at every position and just win games forever? That theyâd get away without disguising anything schematically? It felt like Vic Fangio was the sole curmudgeon running a two high defense, refusing to bend the knee.\n\n\nSo now the trend of the league is this : everyone is living out of single high defenses, and running heavy cover 1 and 3. Nobody is really trying to hide their coverages. Everyone wants to be a team with a 4 man rush. Surprisingly, GMs find out that no, you canât just get all pro talent at every defensive position and destroy offenses. We have bland, predictable defenses that requires high level talent, being ran by teams all across the league, the majority of whom are very much not the LOB/NFZ. This should send alarm bells. You could see passing yardage starting to go up around 2015 - you had guys like Russell Wilson, who was very, very happy to fire up a moonball anytime he saw cover 1 - but weâre only really getting started.\n\n\n**III. The Offenses Strike Back**\n\n\nIf I had to point to the beginning of these defenses getting taken to the woodshed - itâs probably the 2017 Rams with Sean McVay. Hereâs another weakness of cover 3 : deep crossing routes off of PA pass. This wasnât a new idea : defenses had just learned how to have a fighting chance of this passing concept out of 12 and 21 personnel - which is what the west coast offense, who ran this passing concept, liked to run it out of. They dealt with this by having the deep defenders exchanging routes based off of pre/post snap reads : this is hard to describe in words, but it works. What McVay did was a lot of 11 personnel, 2x2 sets with tight WR splits - oftentimes aligning a WR in a typical TE split. Instead of checking into cover 3 match like you would with a typical 2x2 formation - teams would play cover 3 zone. You prevent the deep safeties and corners from exchanging routes by occupying them vertically with the outside receivers. Your inside receivers run deep crossers - defenses are forced to cover the crossers with the ILBs - who are getting sucked up by the play action. If youâve ever heard of a Robot technique, where a LB reads PA, flys up into the LOS, and then suddenly turns around and runs full sprint down the middle of the field, itâs because of this. Itâs called a Robot technique but itâs really more of a âoh fuckâ drop to me. The ILBs are taught to turn and look for crossing routes and chase them down so itâs a 20 yard gain instead of a TD.\n\n\nThis wasnât entirely brand new or anything, but the Rams ran it so often and executed it at such a high level and it carved up defenses that year. The passing concept perfectly complimented what was a new take on the Shanahan wide zone running scheme at that point in the NFL - which was running it exclusively out of 11 personnel, forcing defenses into nickel packages and emphasizing blocking by your WRs. Another wrinkle is the Rams start abusing pre-snap motion to figure out if itâs man or zone, even forcing defenses to audible into coverages they want.\n\n\n2017 was great and all, but 2018 someone by the name of Patrick Mahomes came along - and the Chiefs had a guy named Tyreek Hill and Andy Reid decided this idea of deep crossing routes looked appealing, and the Chiefs absolutely broke defenses. They had a video game offense where you had guys running wide open 20 yards down the field multiple times a game - Patrick Mahomes only ever needed to even read one side of the field to have one of the most dominant seasons in history, in his first year starting. Beyond Mahomes ability to throw these 20 yard deep crossing routes, even if you pressured him he had a tremendous ability to get out of the pocket and chemistry with his WRs who ran scramble drills at a high level, further stressing defenses deep down the sidelines. And now a new trend is born, where instead of teams trying to find a Brady/Manning type of pocket passer, they want the guy with a strong arm who excels at playing out of structure and generating explosive plays.\n\n\nThe book on beating defenses across the league is pretty much written at this point. Itâs never been easier for QBs in the league - seriously, 2017-2021 was Madden on rookie mode. Young QBs are hitting the ground running : you have Watson, Mahomes, Allen, Jackson, Murray all enter the league in a span of three years, these guys all excel at playing out of structure, with everyone playing the same defense across the league and not hiding at it, you really donât have to go through many post snap reads, you have passing concepts carving up defenses while your QB only has to read one side of the field, you have teams who want to rush 4 but arenât nearly talented enough to simultaneously generate pressure and be disciplined in their rush lanes, keeping QBs in the pocket. You have the most athletic QBs in history, with WR talent at an all time him, who WANT to get out of the pocket and oh shit, guess what? These single high safety defenses are exploitable own the deep sideline, which is oh so coincidentally the area of the field that a QB escaping the pocket running a scramble drill will absolutely shred. Guys see cover 1 and they know their chucking it down field and either getting a bomb, an incompletion, or a spot of the foul DPI.\n\nI realize this is probably simplifying a bit about the offensive innovation during this time period, and there were other factors in play â RPOs, read option, QB draws being an obvious example. Unfortunately, I ainât getting paid to write all of this, Iâm just a guy who started writing down my stream of consciousness thoughts on the shitter at work. But I do have to emphasize how badly these deep crossing routes were carving up defenses at the time â Chiefs and Rams being chief among them.\n\n\n**IV. Thankfully, DCs Eventually Have a Moment of Clarity**\n\n\nJust like the Rams began the downfall of the single high defense - you really canât talk about the trend to two high without mentioning them. This time, in a way Rams fans probably donât want to hear. See, two high didnât really start becoming adopted in 2021, and became defacto in 2022. But in 2018, Vic Fangio, still churning along as Chicago Bears DC with his two high safety scheme that mixes in cover 3/4/6 - gives the Rams the absolute fits, holding them to just 6 points - and Bill Bellichick takes notice. Beyond having coverage calls to combat these deep crossers - Jared Goff ends up struggling mightily reading the coverage the Bears are in - as Vic Fangio doesnât give it away pre-snap. Fangio almost always aligns both his safeties deep - and rolls a safety down after the snap when he plays a cover 1 or 3 defense.\n\n\nBelichick and Brian Flores take note of this, and ends up coaching one of the best SB performances in history - first I want to acknowledge they used a 5-1 front to shut down the Rams bread and butter outside zone run - but I want to focus on the coverage here. The Patriots, who have always been a cover 0/1 heavy team, play a lot of quarters on early down, play two deep safeties pre alignment, and disguise their coverages all game. They also do an extremely clever tactic - knowing that Goff and McVay utilize the headset communication very heavily, they show a defensive look, wait until 15 seconds on the play clock, and switch to a different look. The Rams get shut out all night.\n\n\nFangio gets a job as the HC of the Denver Broncos the following season - and brings Brandon Staley, an OLB coach, along with him. McVay specifically seeks out Staley, a Fangio disciple in 2020 to replace Wade Phillipâs as his DC, because of how the Fangio defense was giving his offense fits. The 2020 Rams go on to have the best defense in the highest scoring year in league history - utilizing two high safety looks and heavy quarters coverage. The Fangio led Broncos, despite being on a losing streak of some amount of games to the Kansas City Chiefs that Iâm definitely not hiding - consistently play Patrick Mahomes better than any team in the league and make him look mortal, with CBs picked up off the streets. Suddenly, teams across the league realize there might be something to these two high safety defenses - now everyone is hiring guys who has sat in the same room as Vic Fangio one time to be their DC, and the two high safety defense returns, once gone, but never forgotten. By 2022, two high is the new standard.\n\n\nâ¦ And it works. Some people will try and argue that itâs not the two high safety defense - teams still run a lot of cover 3 - which they now do out of two high safety looks, rolling a safety down after the snap. Some guys will say itâs not that because teams donât run cover 2 often - kinda true, but the idea that it was ever cover 2 is bad information being repeated by guys like Chris Collinsworth who confuse cover 2 with two high safeties - two high safeties is just a pre-snap alignment, not the post snap coverage, and in fact teams very often run cover 4/cover 6 when they go with a two deep alignment. You have QBs who came up in a league where post snap movement wasnât a thing. You have vets who hadnât dealt with these concepts for over a decade.\n\n\nThe way to beat these defenses through the air (running the ball isnât as simple as an idea as people think today, IMO) is through good pocket presence, reading defenses post snap, going through progressions, knowing when and where receivers are going to be open and throwing them open - and it often requires throwing into the middle of the field - after weâve spent the previous 5 or so years where playing out of structure was the highly coveted, sought after traits from QB prospects. We have guys like Russell Wilson and Deshaun Watson put up all pro numbers while never throwing down the middle of the field, making their money deep down the sideline - and theyâre suddenly faced with defenses that are telling them to do the thing theyâve never done in their career. You have guys like Patrick Mahomes and Josh Allen handle this gracefully and still be the best of the best - partly because of raw talent, partly because theyâve got enough experience and are smart enough to adjust, but all in all it leads to a continuously downward trend in passing and scoring the past 3 seasons.\n\n\nWhile all this is happening on the coverage front, DCs have become menaces cooking up pressure looks - you end up seeing last years Vikings, who are paradoxically the most cover 0/1 man blitz team in the league and also the team most likely to drop 8 into coverage. You have them lining up 9 guys on the LoS with no idea who is coming, who is dropping, how many are coming - you end up now with teams like the Vikings and Broncos blitzing over half the time, and not just 5 man blitzes, but sending the house. Even when they drop guys into coverage, OL have no idea who the hell to block and you ensure 1 on 1 match ups for your rushers. Stunts and twists have never been more dialed in. Guys like Patrick Mahomes, who grew up on abusing undisciplined rush lanes by 4 man rushes have no idea where the hell a player is about to be, and finally! After some amount of years that I definitely do not remember, the Broncos beat the Chiefs in a game where that Kermit voiced asshole spends half the day trying to bail out of the pocket just to run into a blitzing DB or running into his own blockers.\n\n\nToday, you have the Broncos opening up a game against Aaron fucking Rodgers of all people with an all out blitz and get a sack of the first play of the game. What the fuck? How many times in his life do you think Aaron Rodgers saw an all out blitz on the first play of the game?\n\n\nI donât know why it took DCs across the league like 5 years to realize you can basically get free pressure by showing double mug pressure looks - I remember the Mike Zimmer-Vikings doing this in like, 2017 with Kendricks/Barr to success.\n\n\n[Hereâs](https://x.com/Nate_Tice/status/1840846131871564035) a cool clip this past week where the Packers are showing a double mug look, Aaron Jones goes up to the A gap to meet the mug - Quay Walker points this out to the slot defender, drops into the coverage, and you get a Packers DB separating Sam Darnoldâs soul from his body. How do you even deal with this?\n\n\n**V. What The Hell Do We Do Now?**\n\n\nHonestly man I got nothing. Itâs been 3 years and it seems like offenses arenât any closer to dealing with this problem. Unlike last time around, defenses are winning off of scheming and creativity, not talent. The Broncos have a top defense in the league - despite having just one 1st round pick in the lineup. Not that guys like Zach Allen and Jonathon Cooper arenât ballers, but they arenât household names either. Personally, I wholeheartedly welcome this change. The league is much more fun because of it. DCs have rediscovered the concept of the oldest play in the book - deception - and you have guys like Brian Flores and Vance Joseph acting like maniacs. It forces QBs and offenses to be smarter, and more disciplined, punishing poor fundamentals.\n\n\nThereâs a lot of solutions that get floated, but I donât think theyâre obvious. The most common is âthe run game is coming back!â Modern rule sets, evolution of the passing game still heavily favors passing the ball. Thereâs also just so many variables that make building around a run game difficult. First, even though two high safeties are weak to the run on paper, it isnât always true in practice - a lot of these safeties these days are good at coming down from the box and making a tackle after the snap. Quarters coverage can actually be sound against the run by letting you walk your safeties up closer to the LoS - kinda like 9 in the box. Thereâs been the development of the gap and a half defense - a defense that takes advantage of the athletic, penetrating DL of today but allows them to cover more gaps similar to a two gapping defense. Speaking of those DL - even though rushing the passer has been the premium, a lot arenât giving up anything vs. the run - look at Aaron Donald. Finally, whether itâs talent pool, lack of development at the college/NFL level - DL are just flat out better than OL these days, and you canât run without an OL.\n\n\nSome people say that this will make the QB position less important, and this is a good thing. I donât really think thatâs the case. I think weâve most likely just ended back at square one, where teams are going to try to get the Manning/Brady, elite football IQ, good processing QBs who can play in the pocket. Of recent draftees, that best describes CJ Stroud. As we found out throughout the late 00s and most of the 2010s, scouting those qualities is no easy feat. But even then, defenses are faster, more athletic, more creative, and more complex than the comparatively vanilla defenses Brady/Manning faced in their prime.\n\nI also want to make it clear, that guys like Mahomes, Allen, Jackson feels like Pandoraâs box â itâs not going to go away. Teams are going to continue to want guys who can play out of structure and generate chunk plays. I know this Sunday Iâm going to turn on a Cardinals game and see Kyle Murray do his patented âtoddler running away from his parentsâ scramble, dodging 15 different defenders and throwing a 40 yard bomb to MHJ. Lamar Jacksonâs running threat is still the primary driver in a rushing offense thatâs just gashed teams two weeks in a row. But QBs are going to learn how to play the position again at a NFL level again. What does this mean for someone like Caleb Williams, someone Iâm a huge fan of? I donât know â I feel like Williams probably tears up the league pretty early on five years ago â but he was highly touted, and his out of structure playmaking ability played a big part in that â I can see a world where it takes him a year or two to really develop.\n\n\nI think the 2018 era still has a lasting effect on how teams are valuing positions today that hasnât quite swung around. Teams like the Chiefs and Rams invested heavily into skill talent and it paid out. The WR market has been insane in FA - guys like Jerry Jeudy are making 17.5 million a year - thatâs what some all pro players make at other positions. How is that justifiable for a guy who is, at best, a mediocre WR2? With the passing game being heavily de-emphasized? Tee Higgins is going to get like 28 million a year next year - 4 million a year more than Patrick Surtain, a corner is who orders of magnitude above him. When you have more WR talent than any other position coming in every year, smart teams are going to stop paying all but the top tier receivers, draft, save a ton of money that can go elsewhere.\n\n\nAnyway, this has gone on way longer than I expected, I was going to include more clips, stats, sources, definitions etc etc but Iâd basically be writing a book at that point so if thereâs any questions about anything in here feel free to ask.\n\n\n**TLDR; Defensive Coordinators, what the fuck were you thinking last decade?**\n\n**TLDR2 since that wasn't an actual TLDR; Teams decide they want to copy the LOB blueprint - which wins with little deception, and A LOT of talent. They mostly get the part with the no deception right, but not the talent part right. This plays out very badly for defenses across the league, and for a few years offenses and fantasy football players are very, very happy**",

      "title": "The Pro Football HOF has snubbed one of the greatest players of this millennia because he is a specialist - again.",
      "text": "For those who did not see, the PFHOF trimmed down the list from [167 players](https://www.nfl.com/news/167-modern-era-players-nominated-for-pro-football-hall-of-fame-class-of-2025) to [50 finalists](https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/news/2025-pro-football-hall-of-fame-eli-manning-among-50-modern-era-candidates-to-be-considered-for-induction/) this week.\n\n  \nA glaring cut? Shane Lechler. \n\n\n\nThere were a few other specialists on the list of note; Pat McAfee, Jeff Feagles, Brian Moorman, and Jason Hanson. If these guys played a position that was not centered around kicking a ball, they would be shoe-ins for the Hall. Them being snubbed is a travesty. And yet, none of those players have the case Lechler does.\n\n  \nLechler is widely regarded as the premier punter of his era (2000s). Gil Brandt regarded him as [the greatest punter of all time.](https://www.houstonchronicle.com/sports/texas-sports-nation/texans/article/Why-punter-Shane-Lechler-belongs-in-the-Pro-13740848.php) Pat McAfee predicted he would be a first ballot HOF (and should have been). JJ Watt claimed Lechler was \"the greatest punter to walk the earth.\" Legendary Chargers punter Mike Scifres said in the late 2000s that he believed Lechler was the greatest to ever do it. These are extremely knowledgeable football people with extremely high views on Lechler.\n\n  \nMuch of the advanced metrics around punting started in the early 2010s. For much of Lechler's career, all we have is traditional stats. For what it is worth, Lech has the the career highest YPA ever (47.6). His knock is that his net was lower, but this is contextual. PFF punting grades date back to 2013. There have been fewer than 10 seasons with a punting grade above 90. Despite having just 4 seasons in this timeframe, Lechler hit that mark in 2013.\n\n  \nIf we look at the accolades, the list is [long](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shane_Lechler)*.* 9 all pro selections, all decade team selection in the 2000s and 2010s. NFL 100 anniversary team. Tom Brady is one of the greatest players to ever play the game and has fewer all-pro selections than Lecher. A little apples-to-oranges but please understand the underlying point.\n\n  \nThe HOF likes to talk about how it isn't just the numbers but the legacy a guy leaves. Can the story of football be told without this guy? Well, can the story of punting be told without mentioning Shane Lechler? Only a fool would think no.  He has the longevity with 18 years. He has the numbers. He has the honors. He has the legacy left on the game. What more did Lechler need to do?\n\n  \nIt is anti-punter bias. That is all it has ever been. The HOF voters are crusty old white guys who sit on their figurative high horses mangling their own logic to fit in whoever they want and leave out who they don't. They do not like punters and only allowed one when the pressure became so great they had no choice. Guy was closer to the grave than his playing retirement when they finally gave him the jacket he had earned. The voters have no shame.\n\n  \nPut Lechler in the HOF. It is now 2 seasons past due.",

      "title": "The Worst Loss For Every Football Team.",
      "text": "I felt like this would be a fun post to make. Talking about what I consider the worst losses in every teams history. Feel free to correct me if you feel I got it wrong. So without further ado, letâs get to the comedy and pain.\n\n**NFC East**\n\n* Giants: Starting off with my team to get it out of the way. The Giants have some pretty bad losses, Super Bowl 35, both Miracles At The Meadowlands.  But the one that still keeps up Giants fans is hands down the 2008 Divisional Round, the only time in my life where my team was actually the best team in the league. Unfortunately, our WR1 decided to shoot himself a couple days before the game, and it demoralized the whole team. Thus we got blown out by the Eagles. We beat the Cards and Steelers in the regular season, and I know for a fact that if Plax hadnât shot himself we would have won this game and won back to back super bowls. Thankfully we made it back in 2011 but this will always to me be the worst loss because it would have been the only time I got to see my team win back to back titles.\n* Eagles: The Eagles have some pretty bad losses as well. Losing both Super Bowl 39 and 57. But considering they eventually got revenge on both teams I think those two losses have lessened a bit. But the loss that they definitely havenât moved on from is the 2002 NFC Championship Game. The last game to be played in Veterans Stadium, the home of the Eagles for three decades. And in their final game played there, they got blown the fuck out by the Buccaneers. But the play that sticks with Eagles fans to this day is when Ronde Barber intercepted Donovan McNabb and returned it for a touchdown. And that was the last memory Eagles fans have in Veterans stadium. This game is the perfect summary of Andy Reid's time in Philly.\n* Cowboys: The Cowboys, being one of the most storied franchises in sports, reasonably have a lot of options to choose from. Thereâs the 1978 Super Bowl against the Steelers with Jackie Smithâs drop, The Catch in the 1981 NFCCG that ended their reign of dominance. But Iâm gonna go with a more recent option. The only time the Cowboys legitimately had a shot of making the Super Bowl post their 90s dynasty, the 2014 Divisional Round, with the infamous Dez no catch. This was the best shot the Cowboys had of making it back to the Super Bowl. And to make it even worse, it was Tony Romoâs last chance to make it as well, as his body finally gave out in 2015.\n* Commanders: Gonna be honest, the Commies donât have many big heartbreaking losses. I had to dig deep for this one. So the one Iâm going with is the Monday Night Massacre, where they got destroyed 59 to 28 by Philly. The Eagles score 4 touchdowns in the first quarter alone. It remains to this day one of the worst blowout losses in Commies history.\n\n**NFC West**\n\n* 49ers: HOO BOY there were so many options for me to pick, or more accurately, so many super bowls. But Iâm gonna go a different route for this one. If thereâs one game I think did the most damage to the 49ers, itâs the 2013 NFCCG. This was the height of the Seahawks-Niners rivalry, and also a damn great football game. Whoever won this game would inevitably go on to win the Super Bowl. And sure enough the Niners lost. It solidified the Seahawks as the team of the early 2010s. Think about it, when people think of great teams around this period of time, itâs the Seahawks that they think of not the Niners. Despite the Niners from 2011-2013 having one of the most talented rosters of the 21st century.\n* Seahawks: And speaking of the Seahawks, you know what this one is. Itâs an answer so obvious that you donât even need me to say it. I will say that if they had won Super Bowl 49, itâd be interesting to see what the timeline for Seattle would have looked like.\n* Cardinals: Another one I didn't even need to think about. I made a post about the 08 Cardinals a couple weeks ago so check that out if you want a more detailed answer. But Super Bowl 43 is the game that lives on in the nightmares of Cardinals fans. They got hit with not 1, but 2 of the greatest plays of all time. Would have been an amazing cinderella story that we'd still be talking about if they managed to pull off the win but, twas not to be.\n* Rams: Man this was a super tough one to decide. There are two games in particular that are fighting in my mind for which is worse. Super Bowls 36 and 53, both to the Patriots. And while Rams fans may argue for 53, I'm gonna go with 36. The game that ended the Greatest Show On Turf and the potential dynasty the Rams could have had. If they had won this game, they could have avoided the decade worth of misery they would be thrust into after this.\n\n**NFC South**\n\n* Buccaneers: Very much a similar situation as the Rams where there's two options fighting for the pick in my mind. The 1999 NFC Championship Game and the 2021 Divisional Round. If they had won the latter they would have undoubtedly won the Super Bowl for a second year in a row. But I'm taking the 99 NFCCG. Everyone remembers the 02 Buccs but the 99 Buccs were just as great. They held the Rams to their lowest score for that entire season. Then late in the game, Bert Emmanuel caught a pass that would have put them in great scoring position to win, but the refs said he didn't catch it. This one is very close but I'm going with this one because it would have been quite the accomplishment beating the Rams that year. I'm not sure if they would have beaten the Titans but they would have been no slouch in the Super Bowl.\n* Panthers: There's really only one answer to choose here. While Super Bowl 38 definitely still stings for Panthers fans, its Super Bowl 50 that created the situation they're in right now. This was their best shot to win the Super Bowl, they had by far the best team in the nfl. They were better in almost every category than the Broncos. But the most damage this game did is that this is what people remember Cam Newton for, the play where he didn't jump on the fumble. You can debate whether thats fair or not but the truth is that they never recovered from it.\n* Saints: Once again, only one answer for me to choose, the 2018 NFCCG. This might be a hot take but I consider this to be Drew Brees' best year in the league. The fact that this man carried the Saints so hard for so long should put him in the HOF just for that feat. I remember all the talks going into the playoffs about how everyone thought for sure this would be his year. But then we got perhaps the worst referee moment of the last 10 years. You all know the one, I don't need to say it.\n* Falcons: You know what it is already\n\n**NFC North**\n\n* Bears: The Bears have some pretty bad losses, for instance there's the hail mary from last season. Or there's Super Bowl 41. But nah, there's one that still sits with Bears fans. The double doink. This one is bad more for how ridiculous the entire exchange. The Bears already have a pretty bad habit of losing in the dumbest ways, but it doesn't get anymore stupid than that.\n* Packers: There were many options to pick from but there's only one loss that still lives in the minds of Packers fans nearly a decade later. The 2014 NFCCG. This remains one of the worst 4th quarter collapses I've ever seen. Russell Wilson had 4 turnovers in this game, the entire Seahawks team was failing for most of the game. Literally everything that had to go wrong for the Packers to lose this game happened. And what makes it even worse is that this was the best Packers team during Aaron Rodgers tenure as quarterback, even better than the 2010 team. The defense which has always been GB's problem was actually good this season.\n* Vikings: Alright Imma be real, there were so many options here to choose from that I had like four that for any other team would have been the easy number 1. There's the four super bowls, there's Favres interception, there's the 2015 missed FG. But nah, sometimes the best answer is the easiest one. In 1998 the Vikings had their best season in franchise history, with an absolutely loaded offense with Cris Carter and Randy Moss. They made it to the NFCCG where they'd play the Falcons in a pretty tight game. And in a chance to ice the game at 27-20, Gary Anderson missed the field goal. Sucks that this defined his career.\n* Lions: I could be real petty and just put down the whole 0-16 season but nah I'm not gonna do that. Instead I'm gonna say the 2014 wild card game against the Cowboys. This was by far the best chance they had during the Matthew Stafford Era to win a playoff game. And well... the refs just fucked them over. Interesting that the entire 2014 playoffs had each team get hit with a cursed moment. Thankfully the Lions have rebuilt very well and are currently one of the leagues best.\n\n**AFC East**\n\n* Dolphins: The Dolphins haven't had a lot of success since Marino left. So what better to pick than the game that sent him off? The 1999 Divisional round against Jacksonville. They lost this game 62-7. Jesus... I really don't have any more words to describe this. And so Dan Marino would end his career as arguably the greatest player to never win the super bowl. And the goddamn dolphins couldn't even give him a good send off.\n* Bills: Very much a similar scenario to the Vikings where there's like four that would be the number 1 for any other team. But come on, you guys all know what it is. Super Bowl 25, the Bills get a drive going late in the game to win it. They get to the 40 and send out Scott Norwood to kick the field goal. And just like that... the boulder went tumbling all the way back down the hill.\n* Jets: Gonna be real, the Jets don't really have any big losses. They just kinda suck. There was that run they had in 2010 that they lost to the Steelers but I don't see that as a big terrible loss, just a game where they got beat. So for this one I'm gonna go with the 1998 AFCCG against the Broncos. You may just think the Jets got demolished but... no. They got out to a 10-0 lead in the third quarter... and then they got demolished. They gave up 23 unanswered points to give the Broncos the win. IMO this is the closest the Jets have come to getting back to the Super Bowl since Joe Namath. Bill Parcells has called this game the worst loss of his career.\n* Patriots: 18-1 lol\n\n**AFC West**\n\n* Raiders: The Raiders have struggled... like a lot since their Super Bowl run in 2002. But if there was any game that has defined the Raiders in the modern day, its the Tuck Rule game. Charles Woodson hits Tom Brady and the ball comes out, giving the Raiders possession. About half an hour goes by with officials scrambling around trying to figure out what to do. Then Walt Coleman comes out and says its an incomplete pass. They've been stuck with bad fortune ever since this game.\n* Chargers: I didn't even need to think about this for a minute. Its the 2006 divisional round. The only time the Chargers had the best team in the league. This was by far the best shot they had at winning it all. And if they had won this game, they might still be in San Diego. The fatal wound in this game though was the Marlon Mcree fumble. If that hadn't happened, the Chargers probably would have won and beaten both the Colts and the Bears.\n* Chiefs: The Chiefs haven't had much success until relatively recently so there's three options for me to choose from, the 2018 AFCCG, Super Bowl 55 and Super Bowl 59. This might be the most controversial pick so far but I'm going with the 2018 AFCCG. The feat of being the team to beat the Patriots and end their dynasty? Oh man we'd never hear the end of it. You could argue that this loss worked out for them since they got Spagnoulo after this but I say this is the worst because this game was just so winnable unlike both Super Bowl losses. God... we could have gotten a Chiefs vs Saints Super Bowl, would have been one for the ages.\n* Broncos: Yeah the Broncos have lost a lot of Super Bowls, but I wouldn't call any of those the worst loss. For this one I'm going with the Mile High Miracle. In the last few seconds of regulation, Flacco hit Jacoby Jones on the sideline and he scores a touchdown, sending what should have been a sure fire win into double overtime. You could argue that the 2013 Super Bowl loss is worse because of the records they set, but I'd argue the team they had in 2012 was actually better. If they had won this game there's a pretty good shot they win the Super Bowl.\n\n**AFC South**\n\n* Texans: Texans are kind of in the same spot as the Jets where they don't have many big losses... they just kinda suck. So for this one I'm going with the 2019 Divisional round. In the second quarter they were up 24-0 and then proceeded to give up 51 points to the Chiefs, in the game that essentially began the Chiefs dynasty. So thanks Houston, you ruined everything for everyone.\n* Jaguars: The Jaguars have been pummeled by three teams in particular, the Titans, Chiefs and Patriots. There was an old article that described Jacksonville where they finally get something going but then they run into a dynasty and slam into the wall. And yeah I think thats accurate. And nowhere is that more apparent than the 2017 NFCCG. While some may argue they were better in 99, I disagree. Plus I think beating the Pats in 2017 would have been a much better victory.\n* Colts: Peyton Manning's tenure with the Colts brought plenty of heartbreak, but the one that still sits with Colts fans is the 2005 divisional round. This remains one of the biggest upsets in NFL history. The best team the Colts have had in their franchise history, lost due to a shoe tackle by Captain Fat Fuck. No question if they had won this game they would have easily won the Super Bowl that year. And what makes it even more bizarre is that they won the following year with a far weaker team.\n* Titans: Didn't need to think hard about this one. The best Titans season by a massive landslide is 1999. They pulled off the Music City Miracle against the bills and were the only team to beat the Jags that season. They played the Rams in Super Bowl 34, which to this day is still one of the greatest football games ever played. Down by a touchdown and looking to tie the game, Steve McNair pulls off a miracle play to get the Titans in scoring range. Then on the next play, McNair slings it to Kevin Dyson and he's tackled on the one yard line by Mike Jones.\n\n**AFC North**\n\n* Ravens: The Ravens have had their fair share of heartbreak in the past couple years but for this one I'm going with the 2011 AFCCG. This team was undoubtedly better than the one they had the following year. With just a few seconds left, Lee Evans failed to catch what would have been a sure fire touchdown, and then Billy Cundiff missed the field goal to tie the game.\n* Bengals: Alright so here's a hot take, the worst loss in Bengals history is not Super Bowl 56, its Super Bowl 23. They came within a few minutes of beating the 49ers. But then Joe Montana had the most iconic drive of his career to win, sending the Bengals home for a second time. History would look back far more kindly on them if Cincinnati had won this game, that team they had in the 80s has more or less been forgotten in the grand scheme of things. This sent the Bengals on a downward spiral for the next 30 years. They didn't recover until Joe Burrow arrived.\n* Browns: Once again I could be real petty and just put the Hue Jackson era here, but I'm not gonna do that. I'm gonna go with the 2002 Wild Card Round, against the Steelers. Up until recently, this was the only time the Browns had made the playoffs after returning to the nfl. And what makes it worse is that they actually held a lead in this game of 24-7. And then the Browns being the Browns, blew this game in the most Browns way possible. Like I said this was their only playoff game until 2020, where after 18 years they finally got revenge on the Steelers for this loss in one of the funniest games ever.\n* Steelers: Speaking of the Steelers, I'm going with their loss to Jacksonville in the 2017 Divisional Round. The consensus amongst journalists at the time was that this would be an easy wash for Pittsburgh, and that they were looking to rematch New England. Well they didn't even get that far. This in my opinion closed their super bowl window that the Steelers still haven't managed to open back up. Ever since then they've gotten bounced in the wild card round every year.\n\nHoo boy this took a lot out of me, I'm tired now. Feel free to tell me if I got some right or wrong, I'm sure this will be a contentious post. And if I made you mad for bringing up old wounds, well then I've done my job.\n\nEdit: Ok so the Bears one I definitely got wrong, fair enough. I guess I forgot about that the Packers had to play the Bears to even get into the playoffs in 2010. \n\nEdit 2: Damn I really thought I nailed the Steelers pick but I guess not. I wouldnât have thought Tim Tebow would have traumatized yâall that bad.",

The Redskins used the play during their playoff game against the 49ers and it flopped.\n\nThen, just before Super Bowl VI in January 1972, Nixon called Miami Dolphins head coach Don Shula and recommended a specific passing play: a downfield throw to wide receiver Paul Warfield.

The deal secures Fox's future in San Antonio through the 2029-30 season.\n\nUpdate via Shams Instagram: The max deal has no player option in the final year and secures De'Aaron Fox's future in San Antonio through the 2029-30 season, after a trade deadline deal moved the one-time All-Star and one-time All-NBA guard from the Sacramento Kings to the Spurs.\n\nFox and Rich Paul were able to navigate a trade to his preferred destination of San Antonio in February and then secure this long-term lucrative extension months later.\n\nFox is just one of two players to average 20 points, 5 assists and 1 steal in each of the last six seasons, along with Luka Doncic, and he is just one of four players with 10,000 points, 3,000 assists and 700 steals since entering the NBA in 2017-18, along with James Harden, Russell Westbrook and Jokic.\n\nSource: \n\n1. https://www.espn.com/contributor/shams-charania/0cc3a2c84e3d2\n\n2. https://www.instagram.com/p/DM8aL1fSItZ/?igsh=MTlsbWN0aTczMTY4Zw==",

      "text": "Source: https://frontofficesports.com/fox-skip-bayless-others-sued-on-14-counts-sexual-battery/\n\n> A former Fox Sports hairstylist alleged in a lawsuit that a network executive used âhis position to sexually harass women,â as well as that Skip Bayless touched her inappropriately and propositioned her for sex. \n\n> Noushin Faraji, who says she worked at Fox Sports from 2012 through last August, made a series of troublesome allegations in the 42-page lawsuit obtained by Front Office Sports. Fox, Fox Sports, FS1, FS2, FOX Sports EVP Charlie Dixon, Bayless and FS1 host Joy Taylor are listed as defendants in the lawsuit filed on Friday.\n\n> In the suit filed in Los Angeles, Faraji alleges that Dixon, the head of content for FS1, grabbed her buttocks at a birthday party in West Hollywood. When she relayed the encounter to Taylor, the Fox host allegedly told her to âget over it,â according to the suit.\n\n> After starting work on the Undisputed morning show starring Bayless, the suit alleges that he began giving Faraji âlingering hugs and kisses on the cheek while putting his body against hers and pressing against her breasts.â The single mother alleges she repeatedly told Bayless she was not interested in him and did not âdate at workâ. She also claims she told Bayless she was suffering from ovarian cancer, after developing issues with her left ovary, in an effort to halt his advances.\n\n> As the suit alleges: âApproximately one week later, Mr. Bayless made another advance at Ms. Faraji. Ms. Faraji responded: âSkip, stop, you have a wife.â Mr. Bayless responded: âArenât you Muslim? Doesnât your dad have three to four wives?â Ms. Faraji responded that her father was dead, and when Mr. Bayless looked taken aback, she made an excuse to leave.â\n\n> During her time at Fox, Faraji alleges she made multiple complaints to the Human Resources and Employee Relations departments.",

      "text": "Source: https://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/16/opinion/sports-nba-mlb-leagues-streaming-fan.html\n\nKey quotes:\n\nâFor most of my life, sports was one of the most accessible forms of entertainment in America. You turned on the TV, flipped to the game and cheered or booed â with your family, your neighborhood, your city. Being a fan was simple. It was community.â\n\nâThis community is dying, because some of its shared moments are disappearing. Take the N.B.A. playoffs. Wanted to watch the Denver Nuggets? \n\nYou needed to shell out at least $8.99 a month for NBA TV â unless you happened to live in Denver, in which case you had to spend an additional $20 a month for a regional basketball streaming subscription.â\n\nâFor decades, our national sports leagues â the National Football League, the National Basketball Association, Major League Baseball, the National Hockey League â operated more like civic institutions. \n\nThese organizations may have always chased the mighty dollar, but they also wanted their sports to last. \n\nAnd as such, they cared about strengthening such powerful intangibles as local pride, generational fandom and public ritual. Tradition was good business. Community built loyalty. Loyalty built value.\n\nThen came the streaming wars. Starting in the early 2010s, live sports events were one of the last types of programming that guaranteed hundreds of thousands if not millions of real-time viewers, and the leagues began to be flooded with requests from streamers, such as Amazon Prime, Peacock and Max, begging for a piece of the pie. \n\nAt the same time, the leagues were looking for a way to raise the cash required to invest in the lucrative opportunities offered by overseas expansion. \n\nAnd thatâs when the business of sustaining sports in America took a back seat, and our countryâs sports leagues stopped acting like caretakers and started thinking like asset managers.\n\nThe result is that dozens if not hundreds of games that make up Americaâs national pastimes are being sliced and diced and sold off to the highest bidder â be that a cable giant, or a streaming upstart, or a regional sports network or a subscription app. \n\nGames jump from one service to another with so little notice or apparent logic that even some of the biggest superfans struggle to track whatâs available where.â",

The network eventually purchased the brand from Brenkus, who hosted more than 1,800 segments of the popular show.\n\n>The showâs concept was a simple one. The goal was largely to explain why or how things in the sports world were possible. Sometimes it was something serious like, âWhat makes Tyreek Hill the fastest player in the NFL?â\n\n>Other times the subject matter was far lighter, like how eating champion Joey Chestnut is physically able to put down as many hot dogs as he is.\n\n>Regardless, the episodes were always entertaining whenever they popped up.\n\n>Brenkus brought back his show in recent years on his own platform. He [had been open](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtu4x0ZlW30&ab_channel=MarcellusWiley%E2%80%98DatDudeTV%E2%80%99) about his fight with depression, too, and he shared a story with Marcellus Wiley in 2023 where he said he tried to commit suicide but his dog saved him.\n\n>Plenty in the sports media world paid tribute to Brenkus on social media on Sunday night after the announcement.\n\nHe was 53 years old (few days away from his 54th birthday)\n\nJohn also held AMA on Reddit (not on this sub), in the past - [link](https://np.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/6bxer5/im_john_brenkus_hostcreator_of_espns_sport/)",

      "text": "https://sports.yahoo.com/nba/article/mavericks-delete-hype-video-that-fans-thought-blurred-out-luka-doncic-musician-takes-responsibility-230744214.html\n\n> Hours after a Dallas Mavericks hype video went viral for all of the wrong reasons, the musician who made it is taking the fall.\n\n> Dallas rapper Dorrough Music, who wrote and performed a song for the Mavericks in a video released Friday, has apologized for the apparent choice to blur out former guard Luka DonÄiÄ. As Mavericks highlights played during the song, the video blurred out a few players with Dallas' colors and logo.\n\n> Although none of the players who were censored out were DonÄiÄ, the video stung for Dallas fans who were already sensitive about the recent trade that sent DonÄiÄ to the Los Angeles Lakers. The Mavericks later deleted the video.\n\n> In a social media statement, Dorrough clarified that other former players, not DonÄiÄ, were the ones who were blacked out.\n\n> \"As a lifelong Mavericks fan and someone who takes great pride in the game of basketball, I would never be part of anything intended to remove, censor, or disrespect Luka DonÄiÄ,\" Dorrough said in the statement. \"The video was produced by my team with the intention of energizing and uniting Mavericks fans, and there was never any intent to erase any player's contributions to the franchise.\"\n\n> As for DonÄiÄ: \"Luka is, and always will be, a part of Mavericks history. I have nothing but respect for him and everything he had done for this franchise,\" Dorrough said.\n\n> Local outlet WFAA tracked down the original clips and found that the censored players were Quentin Grimes and Maxi Kleber, not DonÄiÄ. Grimes was sent to the Philadelphia 76ers in a trade earlier this month, while Kleber went to the Lakers as part of the DonÄiÄ trade. However, both players were visible at other parts of the video.\n\n> Even removed, the video struck a nerve for fans in Dallas, who have felt betrayed not only by the trade, but by the Mavericks' attempts to seemingly erase DonÄiÄ from the franchise's history. In the weeks since the trade, Mavs fans have been vocal about their displeasure with the franchise and with general manager Nico Harrison, who organized the trade.",

But Durantâs on a run of bad choices. First KD picked Brooklyn, and the Nets had to trade Jarrett Allen because KD and Kyrie Irving insisted on signing DeAndre Jordan. Disaster. Then he picked Phoenix. After one year, both he and Devin Booker wanted Deandre Ayton to get traded, which resulted in Jusuf Nurkic. And Durant admitted to Vincent Goodwill of Yahoo Sports that he pushed for the Bradley Beal acquisition. Another big mess. Maybe the best thing for Durant is not getting what he wants.\n\nIn fact, Durant has already been denied by his top choices. There were rumblings at the trade deadline KD wanted to land with the Celtics or Knicks. New Yorkâs interest reportedly isnât mutual anymore. Bostonâs cap sheet and trajectory make that scenario highly unlikely.\n\n  \n[https://sports.yahoo.com/nba/article/kevin-durant-trade-destinations-which-wild-card-teams-might-want-to-roll-the-dice-on-a-deal-for-kd-134127536.html](https://sports.yahoo.com/nba/article/kevin-durant-trade-destinations-which-wild-card-teams-might-want-to-roll-the-dice-on-a-deal-for-kd-134127536.html)",

Former Raptors center Jontay Porter was banned from the league and pled guilty to a felony in federal court for manipulating his performance to help a group of bettors win their prop bets on him. Terry Rozier and Malik Beasley are also under federal investigations related to sports gambling.\n\n> A spokesperson for the NBPA said the union would be open to creating more limitations around prop betting if it helped diminish the amount of abuse that players receive related to betting.\n\n> âNBA players compete at the highest level with the utmost integrity and are concerned that prop bets have become an increasingly alarming source of player harassment, both online and in person,â an NBPA spokesperson said. âIf tighter regulations can help minimize that abuse, then we support taking a closer look at them.â\n\n> The NBA has deals with DraftKings and FanDuel as its official sports betting partners. The two sportsbooks also have similar deals with other professional sports leagues.\n\n> Michael Porter Jr., the brother of Jontay Porter, recently discussed the temptation NBA players can sometimes face to manipulate their performances to benefit others.\n\n> âThink about it, you get mad at these dudes that do the sports betting, but think about it, if you could get all your homies rich by telling them, âYo, bet $10,000 on my under. This one game Iâm going to act like Iâve got an injury, and Iâm going to sit out,â â Porter said on a podcast. âIâm going to come out after three minutes. And they all get a little bag because you did it one game. That is so not OK, but some people probably think like that. They come from nothing and all their homies have nothing. Theyâre like, âBro, if I come out of this game after three minutes and yâall hit on my under, weâre all getting a little bag.ââ\n\n> He then added, âThe whole sports gambling entity, itâs bad and itâs only going to get worse.

      "text": "[Details](https://frontofficesports.com/inside-inside-the-nba-transition-to-espn/): \n\n>ThereÂ *will*Â be an extensive postgame show, say sources. ESPNâs goal is to let the postgame segment run as long as it does now on TNT.Â  \n\n>*Inside the NBA*Â will lead ESPNâs pregame and halftime programming. The show will air live during ABC/ESPNâs biggest events, including the NBA Finals, conference finals, and NBA playoffs. Theyâll also be featured on opening week, Christmas Day, all ABC games after Jan. 1, and the final week of the season. ESPNâs ownÂ *NBA Countdown*Â will survive, but it will be strictly second-string.  \n\n>The cast is expected to stay together. WithÂ [OâNeal signing a long-term extension](https://frontofficesports.com/shaquille-oneal-tnt-agree-shaq-contract-extension-worth-15m-year/)Â paying him more than $15 million a year, the Beatles of Basketball TV are all under contract. All four will remain TNT employees, but theyâre all expected to report for duty when the show is licensed to ESPN. The show will continue to be produced in the same Atlanta studio with the same behind-the-scenes crew.  \n\n>On Monday, Barkley toldÂ [Dan Patrick](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPB1-DT3b0Q)Â that he expects to only work two seasons of the seven years left on his monster,Â 10-year, $210 million contract. âIf they start trying to work me too much between ESPN and TNT, Iâm just going to walk on home,â he said. Barkley is Barkley. Heâs been talking about retirement for 10 years. But what do you know?  \n\n>The devil is in the details when it comes to scheduling. ESPN will have to juggle its various shows and linear/digital media platforms to giveÂ *Inside the NBA*Â the high profile it deserves. For instance, if a featured NBA game is on ESPN, then postgame coverage probably just rolls over intoÂ *Inside the NBA*. But if the game airs on ABC, the broadcast network will likely shift into local news, so it'll require some channel changing to ESPN/ESPN2. \n\n>Thereâs also the question of how the show will coexist alongside Scott Van Peltâs midnightÂ *SportsCenter*. WillÂ *Inside the NBA*Â air on ESPN2 alongside Van PeltâsÂ *SC*Â on ESPNâs primary channel? Or will it start on ESPN, then shift to ESPN2 once Van Pelt goes on-air? That will be discussed after the Finals.",

I am aware that I am probably not the first person to draw this comparison, but either way I think itâs interesting enough to share, and I love merging my two favorite sports.\n\n* Both teams won their last trophies a long time ago and cling to them because they have nothing else.\n   * England's 1966 World Cup\n   * Knicks 1973 Championship\n* Every year both fanbases are famous for claiming every year to be âtheir yearâ to ultimately lead to disappointment.\n   * Unironically though this season really is the Knickâs year with how open the east is.\n   * England is pretty famous for the whole âItâs coming home thingâ and with Tuchel in charge a World Cup win is not out of the question. \n* Both teams/fans are fairly hated by fans outside of their own teams in the rest of the sport. \n* Both teams are historic and considered to be pretty iconic/storied regardless of their lack of success\n* They both have iconic stadiums that are highly respected in the sport\n   * MSG and Wembley\n* The media is always talking about both teams and is very harsh and scrutinizes failures. Players and coaches are immediately placed under a huge amount of pressure from the media just from being part of the team. \n* Both teams semi-recently got rid of their coach/managers that brought them the most success they have seen in a very long time, but just couldnât ever get all the way\n   * Southgate leaving after losing two Euro finals \n   * Knicks just fired Thibs after making the Conference finals for the first time in decades. \n* Both of the womenâs teams have actually had success recently but sadly people care way less because they are women\n   * England women won back to back Euros\n   * NY Liberty won the championship last year (I know they are more of a brooklyn nets team but Iâm still considering them to fit my narrative)\n\nI donât know, I thought this was pretty interesting. You could probably make more of these types of comparisons if you look hard enough. This really made me realize that the Knicks should make their own \"its coming home song\" since it fits well with us. \n\nAnyway, England could do well at the World Cup in 2026 and the Knicks are gonna be a big team this coming season too. Itâll be nice to see if both teams can finally end their droughts and the many years of hurt.",

      "text": "In Europe, all professional footballers play in front of an audience of 10,000 spectators or more, a figure that varies according to the club, some European clubs have a stadium with 80,000 seats, others a little less, everything depends on the clubâs income. NBA players play in front of a rich audience who sometimes literally do not care to sit there, they really have no atmosphere, you do not feel the passion in the public that during a game of Real Madrid for example, where the fans will sing their guts the anthem of the club, hand in hand, 80,000 fans make the trip just for you, small child, parents, old person all there for the club, the players, they honor you with songs, jump for you, cry out with all their guts after a purpose. \n\nThe streets of Paris, for example, when PSG win a final in a competition, the city is no longer just a city, but a festive carnival where fireworks explode from everywhere, cries of joy are heard on every street corner, there is no more border between unknown, we embrace each other, we sing together all night. \n\nNow my question is, would NBA players be able to handle the pressure of 50,000 fans honoring you like I mentioned? In fact there was a Serbian player during an interview or he had been asked a question about how the atmosphere was? He said that he played in Serbia, and the fans there in Serbia literally had nothing to do with the fans you find in the NBA?\n\n\n\nI await your answers.",

I broke that rule here and there, but playstyle and the player's character were my main aspects for the most part.  \nI welcome corrections  of course!\n\n**Nikola Jokic: Dimitar Berbatov**. Low-key personality, the quiet genius. Donât rely on physicality, but masters of spacial awareness and timing.\n\n**Luka Doncic:Eden Hazard** \\- Uncoachable raw genius, generational talent, and if they are in the mood, absolutely unplayable. They might just not always feel like it. Notorious for getting out of shape too.Â \n\n**Victor Wembanyama::Lamine Yamal** \\- already GOAT-potential and it doesnât make sense how young they are. Itâs already obvious that the only thing stopping them can be injuries or some unforeseen mental collapse.Â \n\n**Ja Morant:Ousmane Dembele** \\- freakish athletic and technical gifts, but have already been hindered significantly by being an idiot off-court.Â \n\n**Steph Curry:AndrÃ©s Iniesta** (or Luka Modric, or Andrea Pirlo) - they donât need to be bigger or stronger, they will just dismantle you before you could even get close to them.\n\n**Kyrie Irving:Neymar Jr** \\- smooth, dribbler-freak, stylish. Highlight-generating machines.\n\n**Giannis:Yaya TourÃ©** \\-Â  this is a tricky one, just like Lebron. Iâd say prime Yaya TourÃ©. Mega powerful and fast freight-trains. Strong on both ends of the court.Â \n\n**Shaq: Didier Drogba** \\- Physically mega-dominant, and famously clutch players.\n\n**Charles Barkley:Wayne Rooney** \\- power and strength defies their size, and on their day, unstoppable for even the largest defenders. Both emotional and impulsive, but big characters (Barkley is a bigger character, but Rooney is a funny bloke too).Â \n\n**Michael Jordan:Thierry Henry** \\- I KNOOW that Jordan is the GOAT and Henry isnât (though he isnât too far from it tbh), but stylistically, there just isnât a better match IMO. Elegant, technically near perfect, and freak athletes on top that were just too fast and too strong to be stopped in their primes.Â \n\n**Lebron:Gareth Bale+Kevin De Bruyne** combo - this is a tricky one, because Lebron is much more physically dominant than De Bruyne, and is also a much better passer than Bale. But their combo would be a decent shot.Â \n\n**Kobe Bryant:Cristiano Ronaldo -** Ronaldo is as mamba-mentality as it gets. Both are legends, but famously critiqued for selfishness and being determined stat-padders.Â \n\n**Kareem Abdul-Jabbar:PelÃ©** \\- record scorers, top-tier accolades, and in most peopleâs GOAT top3, but many argue that said accolades are overhyped, as they were collected during times when either competition was low or their contribution/role was questionable.Â \n\n**Magic Johnson:Zinedine Zidane** \\- Elegant, technical masters, but also physically imposing and powerful. Arguably, Johnson was a much more consistent player throughout the seasons than Zidane, who famously turned up when it really mattered, and even then, often just with a clutch moment, rather than a whole-game performance. Still, he won everything there was to win, and produced a historical moment in almost every trophy-run he participated in.Â \n\n**Dennis Rodman:Gennaro Gattuso** or **Casemiro** \\- not amazing at offense, but they will relentlessly bully the living soul out of you for the entirety of the match. They would do all that, often without getting sent off too.\n\n**Draymond Greene:Sergio Ramos** \\- Equally large d\\*\\*\\*kheads and dirty players, but core parts and contributors of historical teams. Ramos arguably has the greater legacy, although I think Greene was a much better defender in his prime than Ramos was at any point.",

      "text": "This is something that has bugged me for years. So much in NBA discourse you hear the comments of âno one wants to watch that small market teamâ, âthat star needs to go to a big marketâ, etc. \n\nMaybe Iâm just not as plugged into NFL media, but I just never see any conversation at all around the market an NFL team is in. Iâve seen tons of comments that âThe NBA doesnât want a Thunder/Pacers finals because itâs too small markers and no one will watchâ, but the Chiefs played the Bengals in the Super Bowl a few years ago and it was one of the most watched Super Bowls of all time. No one talked about it being two small markets. \n\nI guess fundamentally I just donât understand why the city a team plays in matters so much to NBA fandom and the NBA in general. Is it a marketing issue? Or does the average NBA fan just not like watching basketball as much as the average NFL fan likes watching football, and only cares about their team?",

      "text": "SI cover: https://imgur.com/a/FS7ua\n\nMY LIFE IN A BUSH LEAGUE\n\nby Wilt Chamberlain\n\n--\n\nOh, man, this is going to be better than psychiatry. In the first place, I am much too big to get comfortable on that crazy couch. In the second place, I am all fired up about speaking for myself this one time and have it come out the way I said it. I have a sort of special, savage reason for all this: there are a lot of people out there who will be surprised that I can write, because they are usually astounded that I can even talk.\n\nI know this is true, because I get the old routine all the time. I stopped getting angry about it years and years ago, but it still drives all my friends crazy. Whenever we're standing around togetherâman, I mean any placeâcrowds of people come up and just stare at us. Then someone will nudge one of my pals slightly and say, \"Hey, who duh big guy?\" or, \"So that's old Wilt the Stilt, huh? How tall is he, really?\" they say. And then, \"Will you ask him can I have his autograph for my kid?\" And then my friends sort of sidle away from meâthey want to stand clear to show everybody I'm not on a leash or anything like thatâand they say. \"Come on. Wilt can talk, you know. He's a real human, man. How come you don't ask him yourself?\" Then, once they get over that hurdle, people are always a little disappointed I don't say, \"duuuhhhhhh.\" And that, in part, is what this story is all about. This is life inside a giant, baby. I know that how I feel is not too important.\n\nAll right. What is important is what has happened to make me feel the way I do and all of the psychological hammering and tugging and pulling that got me into this frame of mind. This is more than life inside a giant. This is the story of my life inside professional basketballâthe greatest game ever played, a game that suffers from being bush when it doesn't want to be bush, a game that may always be bush unless some basic changes are made. And when we get to the end of this chapter, the part where they say, \"Tune in next week,\" or the end of the story, where they say, \"Can this poor monster from Philadelphia really find happiness?\" You'll know just how it feels to be Goliath. How it feels to be seven feet and 1.06 inches tall with no place to hide. After all, you remember in the Old Testament that David had all the best of it, right? Nobody even thought to say or even ask how Goliath must have felt just sort of standing around there. Goliath didn't get any of the good lines, you know?\n\nThe timing of my story is important for three reasons.\n\nReason No. 1: I'm at the top of this game and I'm thinking of retiring. I will be perfectly honest and say I'm thinking of not retiring, too. But I have now racked up all the all-time scoring and playing recordsâall the ones that countâand what else is there? Final standings at the end of this season: Chamberlain leads the scoring, with 2,534 points, for the sixth year in a row. Chamberlain shoots 2,081 and hits 1,063 for a .510 average. or 34.7 points a game. And that's in 73 games: I didn't play them all. See what I mean? Man, I have fulfilled everything I wanted in pro basket-ball except winning the NBA title. And I can't do that all by myself, right?\n\nMoney has nothing to do with the way I feel. I have been investing my money under smart counseling for years. And even though my accountant, Alan Levitt, calls me every single day from Philadelphia and says something like \"Run for the hills, baby, we're broke.\" It is still not critical.\n\nI also have a sore stomach. Because of my size it is more sore stomach than you ever heard of. My doctor, Stanley Lorber, is considered the best internist in Philadelphia, and he can't find out what's wrong with it. But he gets a real kick out of examining me, and he uses me as a subject for lecturing his students. I think pretty soon I am going to start charging him. Ike Richman, part owner of the Philadelphia 76ers, feels so bad about my stomachache that he got real desperate last week and said. \"I know. Let's go to a hypnotist.\" Man, a hypnotistâwho, me? I thought I'd put Ike off, so I said. \"Man, how much will you pay me to go and get hypnotized? A hundred dollars an hour?\" And Ike said he'd do it. Anything to get me feeling back in shape. That's the kind of guy he is. But no matter what we do it keeps getting worse instead of better, and my health is going to figure big in my future. This is my summer of decision.\n\nReason No. 2: I'm thinking of doing a lot of things other than playing basketball. I am thinking of living my own life, for one thing. I could take life easier and manage my apartment house properties and my nightclub in Harlem and the six corporations I'm tied up inâand be a business executive in a size-IS collar, button-down oxford-cloth shin and the biggest hotdamn gray flannel suit you ever saw in your whole life. I have all kinds of other offers, including a role in a civil rights movie based on the new book Look Away. I could go into boxing. And don't think for a minute I couldn't be heavyweight champion of the world. You hear me out there. Sonny Liston? You don't believe me? Look at that picture on the cover again, baby. I am also consideringâbut not too seriouslyâstanding offers to enter professional baseball or football. But we've got to face it. I would fall with one hell of a crash on a football kid (even though it might take more than one guy to bring me down). And while I might be hot stuff catching high ones in the outfield, even the wildest pitcher in baseball would murder me at home plate because I have got such a big strike zone.\n\nReason No. 3: Finally. I am tired of being a villain. It is not the role I had in mind when I entered this sport. I don't feel like a villain, and I don't think like a villain. And there are girls out there who insist I don't exactly look mean, either, you know? Never mind the mustache and beard, man. My mother thinks it looks awful, but the overall vote is in favor of it. And I think I have spotted a trend away from that sort of thing. Villainy, I mean. In the old-time days there was no sympathy for the big guys. Remember Bluto, the big, fat one in the Popeye cartoons? And he would always grab old Olive Oyl and run off with her, and Popeye would eat all that crazy (ugh) spinach and then kick the hell out of Bluto? Well, Bluto is pretty much out of it now. And take the case of Frankenstein's monster. He used to be a real heller and now even he has been gentled up on TV.\n\nThen, finally, there is a new kindly hero: the Jolly Green Giant. It's a trend, you see? Now, I don't exactly see myself as the Jolly Bronze GiantâI don't dig that leafy little costume, for one thingâbut you get the theme. Boy, I don't know. How does a guy get to be a villain in the first place? Not all at once. I promise you. It is a cumulative series of little thingsâlike little jabs from sportswritersâthat have a way of adding up over the years to make the total picture of a bad guy. They have a way of slowly filling in an image that seems to stick in people's minds. I don't know of any athlete in the world who has had to prove himself so many times. Over and over again, fighting off the image. give you an example: \"That Wilt. He just stands there and dunks the ball,\" says one writer. So I work hard and perfect a jump shot. \"That Wilt. He shouldn't fade away from the basket when he's shooting the jumper.\" they say. So I try some other shots. And I concentrate on defense. \"That Wilt,\" they say this time. \"He just plays one end of the court.\"\n\nSo I dash around and hustle down to the other end of the court. \"He's hogging all the action.\" So I try more team play, and I feed the ball off like mad. \"That Wilt,\" they say, fresh out of criticism. \"He's a fink.\" Man, how can I win? Look: I know I'm getting well paid for this sort of jazz, and everybody shrugs and says, \"Well, old Wilt can laugh all the way while he's walking to the bank.\" Actually, it's better than that. I can laugh all the way while driving to the bank in my 527.000 baby-lavender Bentley Continental convertible. But that doesn't help the hurt piled up inside. Let me put it another way: I get paid big money for playing basketball, and I play it. But I do not get paid big money for being hounded and instigated and called a lot of things I am not, right? In a funny way, name-calling is one of the key things that makes professional basketball a bush-league affair when it doesn't have toâit shouldn't âbe that way at all. You don't see that sort of thing in other sports. Does the owner of the New York Giants say bad things about Jimmy Brown because Jimmy plays for the Cleveland Browns? Never. Big-league owners know that inter-league sniping gives the whole game a bad name. And the fans expect better conduct. You won't hear Al Lopez calling Mickey Mantle a bum. Unfortunately, the fans don't always get such conduct in pro basketball.\n\nI ask you: Where else but in professional basketball do you get 1) owners, 2) players and 3) coaches all knocking each other? How can Ned Irish of the New York Knicks say \"I wouldn't have Wilt on my team?\" Never mind Ned's personal feelings about me: how he might feel personally doesn't matter. But in sniping at meâor at anybodyâcan he be helping the NBA? He's knocking it down. It creates a strictly bush atmosphere. And when this sort of thing happens you start to wonder if the people involved really want to improve basketball or maybe just get their names in the papers. They have money and what they really want is fame. I guess. I think some NBA owners regard having their own basketball team as sort of like an executive yo-yo: you know, like a toy. They like the idea of really owning something in sports and maybe they can't afford a whole football team. (It's nice to have something to kick around at the country club. \"Yeah, man, as I was telling my team the other day.. ..\")\n\nAll of which is fine. Man, I don't care what these people spend their money on. But don't forget, they're trading in the lives of real people here. How about Franklin Mieuli, who owned about 10% of the San Francisco 49ers, and he had a hold of that little piece of action and then he got the Owners' hots. So when Eddie Gottlieb sold his share of the Warriors, Mieuli dashed right over and bought it all up, and now here he is, really able to get in there and mix it up. Frankly, I doubt if Mieuli knows very much about basketball. But he wants to speak up about it, and now that he is an owner, now he can. Oh, man! And what do you get in situations like this in the league? I'll tell you what you get: I was sitting in my apartment in San Francisco one night looking out at the view, and a newspaper reporter knocked at my door. He said something cheery like. \"Hello. You have now been traded. Goodbye.\" And do you think the owner had the courtesy to even talk to me about it? Hah. (In this case, though, I figured something was coming up. Some time before, Gottlieb had talked to me and kind of asked how I'd like going back to Philadelphia to play. And I was honest and warned him that if they signed me it would have to be with the understanding that it might be my last season.\n\nHow about Barry Kramer coming in for practice one day, and about the time he gets down to his undershorts someone says something like: \"By the way, man, don't bother undressing any further. You don't play for us anymore.\" Just like that. And Wayne Hightower. He walked into the locker room in New York: \"Hightower? Oh. yeah. Hightower. You've been traded to Baltimore.\"\n\nIt's the old yo-yo. Like the owners have a little game of their own going that we don't know anything about. You know, a secret league where they say. \"Look. I'll give you two forwards and a regulation basketball and a couple of rolls of tape for a big center and a pair of sneakers.\" And what about the image to the public? Oh man, never mind the image. And if that isn't bush, baby, I don't know what is.\n\nNow. I don't want to sound like rhythm and blues. You don't have to set this story to music. But there is a reason this action has such a crazy impact in basketball that it does not have in other sports. Look, we all know there must be trades and player cuts and drafts. We all know there must be owner wheeling and dealing. Fine. All sports wheel and deal. And we don't even want to know all the owners' business. You follow me? But basketball is a kind of special case because the players get so close to each other playing this game. The game demands close, instinctive relationships. We're more sensitive about teammates than, say, linebackers, who are bought and sold by the pound like hamburger. Basketball players build strong friendships and respect on and off the court.\n\nSo we understand the owners have to deal. But it doesn't have to be this bush. They could call the players in and let them know what's cooking. I don't mean ask the players' opinion. But at least let them know, see? And then you wouldn't have those kids out there all jumpy and not playing 100 % basketball. In football and baseball also most of the trading is done in the off season, and by the time the regular season comes around the shock has worn off. The top players, all the ones I know who are serious about this game, are all trying to improve it, to get the bush image out of it. But, man, it's tough.\n\nThat's just the beginning. Let me take you inside a secret practice session of the Philadelphia 76ers and we'll see how this grabs you: We're divided up into two squads for scrimmaging. We're inside Convention Hall and it is big and dark and cold and empty, and when the ball slaps into your hands it makes a ringing, hollow sound up against the ceiling. We're wearing a sort of catch-me-come-kiss-me collection of bits and pieces of old uniforms, and we look like the orphans' picnic. Coach Dolph Schayes is trying to teach us basketball fundamentals (and I think we'll agree right here that it is a little late for shut sort of thing. If we don't know the fundamentals by now. we're all dead). Suddenly, on a fast break or a play under the basket. Dolph sees something none of us can see. He stops everything. \"All right.- he will bark. \"Yellow team take three laps around the court.\" And off we goâfive big, hulking, grown-up menâloping around the basketball court like a bunch of junior high school kids. Our technical practice on play patterns has been interrupted for this punishment, and the pace of our game has been thrown off. This is Schayes's way of spanking us. Then we get back to work and get a furious scrimmage going and a nice sort of rhythm starts to take shape. \"Wait! Hold it,\" says Schayes. \"Blue team take three laps around the court.\n\nThere we go again. Everything stops. And the secret in all this is that the blue team hasn't done anything wrong. Dolph is just so soft-hearted that he's been thinking about it for a few minutes and has decided that they ought to do it, too. And any punishment value of the laps is nullified, right? It's almost the same thing in actual league play. Schayes is so tender-hearted that someone sitting on the bench can look over at him with those big wet eyes, and he'll put them into the gameâeven if the man replaced is having a big night. You see? In the dressing room one day a couple of weeks ago, Dolph came up with another idea. \"We've got to fake those fouls more,\" he said. \"Let's throw up our hands and stagger backwards and really make it look real to the referee.\" \"But. Coach,\" said Dave Gambee, \"This only works if you're a good actor. A lot of us can't pull it off. We just don't look innocent.\" \"All right.\" says Schayes. \"I guess we'd better play it straight. But fake them when you can, huh?\"\n\nNow. whatever you do, don't get me wrong, there is a hardcore moral hidden away in here, baby, and it goes right down to one of the really fundamental things that is wrong with professional basketball. The coaching system is right out of bushville. It's one of those things that went wrong with the system years ago. Here is a guy who has played long and well and faithfully. And he comes up with a bad knee or something like that and the owners say. \"Well. we've got to do something nice for good old Whoever.\" So what do they do? They make a coach out of him, and next season he suddenly turns up coaching his old cronies, the guys he used to play with. And playing the game does not necessarily qualify a man to coach it, right? Take Dolph. Here is a genuinely good guy. He is tall, handsome: he dresses well, he is soft-spoken and he is nice to the wife and kids. And right now that makes him almost too nice a guy to coach a bunch of hardened basketball professionals. Schayes knows all the plays and strategies wellâand if he had any legs left he could run themâbut he has a tough time passing this information on to the players.\n\nMeanwhile, here are the NBA owners, with diamond rings on their little fingers and cigars in their mouths, and they want winners. \"Do what you have to do, coach, but boot me home a winner. Don't talk to me about personality problem\", \"Coach, just show me that big box score. Don't come to me with the song and dance about a tired team.\", \"I know the season is too long, but what the hell, baby, win, win, win.\" A gentle, soft-hearted coach against this kind of background is like a little old lamb in there with the hungry lions. Schayes, for one, has that woolly look, and there are plenty of others. We could have won at least seven or eight more games than we did this season with fierce eat'em-up coaching.\n\nThere are examples of this through the association. I'm not in a position to comment on the Detroit situation: man, I've got enough problems of my own. But here it is again: they take Dave DeBusschere, a second-year man in basketball, and they make him a coach. It's a waste of Dave's talents and worse than that: it's bush, baby. Pro basketball has created a lot of jumpy coaches. The poor guys, it's a wonder some of them don't sort of fall off the bench and maybe foam at the mouth a little. I promise you that some coaches in this association get word that they've lost one player and picked up twoâor some combination like thatâand they're absolutely dumbfounded. And very, very few of them can speak up or talk back.\n\nThe word was all around the league that when Paul Seymour was coach at St. Louis he protested about some owner moves and he got fired. And Seymour, baby, was a very very good coach. A real loss to the game. On the old Warriors. Neil Johnston came up late or something like that, and Gottlieb made him a coach. Another one of those things out of sympathy. In our first year togetherâit was 1960. I think-we had a good year and took second to Boston. And I don't think this was a reflection of Neil's coaching so much as that we just had a great team, you understand?\n\nThen when the second year came along we lost to the Syracuse Nationals in the semifinals of the playoffsâand then Neil was dismissed, and he kind of lashed out and made some very unfair statements. He made out like Wilt Chamberlain was a prima donna and he couldn't talk to me. And as I remember the two years with Johnston we had one disagreement. Just one. But I guess he had to blame losing his job on somebody instead of his coaching. It all weaves into this image we've got. Since professional basketball began, owners have been hiring the wrong kind of coachesâthen firing them for not winning. There are enough ex-coaches around to form their own Old Cats League or something.\n\nTake Owner Ben Kerner of the St. Louis Hawks: he is known around the league for the ability to tire a coach before the coach can get the laces tied up on his sneakers. Cincinnati eased Charley Wolf out because he didn't produce a winner right away. In San Francisco, Bob Feerick decided he wasn't ready for coaching, and he got out of it gracefully by becoming general manager. But, you know, what do the owners expectâthat maybe there will be nine winners in the season? And if not. what is the remedy: Firing eight coaches? Sometimes that seems to be the idea around here.\n\nGood college coaches arc usually too smart to come into the professional ranks. They take one look at this snake pit, and they say. \"Who me? Man, are you kidding me?\" Happily, this system doesn't go flat across the board in the NBA. The owners who have a feeling for a coach will go out and buy him a good team and give him the chance to build it into a powerhouse, and they leave him alone. Know what I mean? I mean, look at the Boston Celtics and Auerbach. You know the real key reason why they are so good as a team? Man. those guys have been together for an average of nine years now. They're so close they're like Siamese sextuplets. How about me? Would I coach if they asked me? I happen to think I would make a pretty good coach. But don't ask me.\n\nThat Red Auerbach. Now, isn't he too much? With that cigar and the look like he would snap you in half. I mean mean. But what a guy. I can remember the first time we metâand maybe you don't know this, but he was my coach at one time. It was back in 1953 and I was a high school freshman then. Maybe about ... oh, 6 feet 10 1/2 or so ... I had been playing a lot of basketball already against some pretty tough older players, and I thought I was pretty hot stuff. And Haskell Cohen, the public relations guy for the NBAâman, he was really looking into the futureâhad spotted me down at Overbrook High in Philadelphia. And he got me a summer job bell-hopping at Kutsher's resort up in the Catskills. It was a sort of breeding ground for future professionals. Haskell was looking beyond high school and college, I guess. So I turned up on the circuit carrying suitcases and waiting on tables and sort of standing around all bones and eyeballs and teeth. Every summer resort up there had its own basketball team made up of college kids who needed jobs for the summer. They worked a little and played a little. And who was the coach at Kutsher's? The man with the cigar.\n\nLooking back on it. I think maybe it was my attitude that first touched off Auerbach. You know, I wasn't exactly the most modest kid in town, and I had a lot of moves for a high school (rattle playing with the big boys. And when Red would call practice he would sort of talk to me in that voice that catches you right here, right between the ribs. He especially didn't like the way I played defense.\n\n\"Don't you think, Chamberlain,\" Red would growl. \"that it might be sort of a good idea to defense your man from in from of him instead of behind him? What the hell are you doing back there?\" But I went on defensing from behind the guys, reaching around with my arms to get the ball, waiting to fall on them when they wheeled around to shoot.\n\n\"We are going to play Shawanga Lodge next.\" said Red, looking through me. \"And you are going to have to defense B. H. Born. I think it only fair to tell you, Chamberlain, that B. H. Born has just made All-America from the University of Kansas. And I think it only fair to tell you that B. H. Born is going to make chopped chicken liver out of you.\" So we played Shawanga.\n\nAt the half-time break I had scored 30-some points and Born had scored exactly two. And I came ambling back into the dressing room and flopped myself down on the training table and folded my arms behind my head. I was whistling. you know, doe de doo de doo, and sort of looking side-wise at old Red while he looked back at me with a steely stare. Finally he grinned a little trace of a grin at me. \"Now about the second half.\" he said. Then, \"Now, Mr Chamberlain, may I please have your attention for a moment?\" Suddenly we understood each other. Red and I. And I learned to play defense on both sides; I play it a lot in front now. After that. Red would let me serve him drinks and cigars in his room when he was up all night playing poker, and he later got me aside to talk about future schooling. \"Why don't you go to Harvard. kid?\" he said. \"And then I'll be able to pick you off in the territorial draft for the Celtics.\" But other forces were already at work, a bunch of things that would change my entire life. After that summer, life began to get tougher.\n\nFrom that summer when I was a gangly kid I looked forward to playing professional basketball. I mean, hot dam, all that glamour. World travel and like that. Big money and cheering crowds and beautiful girls sort of jammed all around the dressing-room door. Now, there is a boyhood dream gone to pieces.\n\nPro basketball is traveling, all right. But not from country to country or even city to city. It is traveling from locker room to locker room. And dressing rooms all seem to have that same stale smell about them after a while. It is sweat and sneakers and soaking wet uniforms and wrinkled clothes, and there is the steady hiss of showers. Listen, you kids out there. Listen, Lew Alcindor, for one. Defeat and victory all smell exactly the same in a pro basketball dressing room alter a while. You get so you don't feel elation. You just feel beat. And there is no crowd of beautiful girls waiting outside a dressing room door- -nor much time for dating, anyway. Last week I was sitting all lonely in the Sheraton Hotel in Philadelphiaâthe rooms there arc like little bitty boxes âand pawing through the stuff in my bag. I came up with the phone number of this girlâI mean, she is a dish--and called her for a date. When the phone started ringing I suddenly remembered that I hadn't called her in like, four years. And what would I say if her husband answered the phone? (It turned out she wasn't married. Whew. But it also turned out that she had another date that night. See what I mean?)\n\nWhat I'm telling youâyou, Alcindor, and all you long-armed kids out thereâis that basketball burns you out. And if you make it in the pros you had better save your money and be ready to retire at any hour. It can all end like snapping your fingers. Pro basketball burns you faster because you play a faster game than anybody else and pretty soonâzap! You start to lose your desire. It isn't always playing the game that gets to you âthe real pros love the game and, man, they love to play itâit is some of the hush things that will finally nail you. They have nailed me. And sometimes I don't want to retire tomorrow: I want to retire yesterday. You follow me?\n\nLet me put it this way: You can play baseball until you're 45 (if you can stand the lack of real action and that 162-game season) and you can play football until you're pretty well up there, too. But not basketball. The saddest thing about this is that there are some remedies close at hand for all this. Put them all together and they don't spell mother, baby. They spell money.\n\nPro basketball is still the most exciting thing going on. But it is sadly overexposed. Man, by the end of the season the public has got basketball up to here. Since it got going good, the game has been dominated by some owners who have got big money worries and little reserves. Know what I mean? They're forced to be competitive and too businesslike about this game, and they can't let up and relax for long enough to give it the help it needs. In the National Football League the owners can go first class all the way and not worry about the right-now revenue. Can the owners look for a long-term, five-year gain in basketball? Why in five years many of them won't be around.\n\nI'm in my seventh year and I guess I'm lucky to have held all of me together this long. It's at the point now where I lose eight to 12 pounds during each game, and sometime my stomach hurls so bad out there under the basket that I sort of have to lean on the guy guarding me and gasp to catch my breath. I used to drink a half gallon of milk right alter every game and about seven other quarts of milk during the day. But now Dr. Lorber has got me cut down to one bottle of milk a day and has me on a diet so bland that it doesn't even have hot dogs on it.\n\nMan, I have lived on hot dogs for years. So now I sit in the locker room after coming off the floor, and I start to polish out a quart of ginger ale or Seven-Up, and Ike RichmanâIke is a very dramatic small guyâcomes in and sort or staggers backward and slaps his hand to his forehead. \"That stuff will kill you!\" Ike says. Will you for once stay on your diet?\"' And he snatches the bottle away from me and splashes it on his hands and the floor and all over my bare feet. \"Look here.\" he says rubbing his hands \"This stuff is so strong it will clean my hands. No wonder you've got a sore stomach. What am I going to do with you?\"\n\nWell, honest, Ike, I don't know what you're going to do with me or what I am going to do with you. But whatever it is, you'll be the first to know.\n\nFirst I am going to get well, I don't know, maybe I'll go to the Mayo Clinic - if they've got a bed out there big enough for me and get this stomach all fixed up. Then I will go back to my apartment and sit there and play my electric guitar (I don't play melodies too well, but I can chord like crazy!) until it drives the neighbors out of their minds. I will put on my Day-O! hat (you know \"Day-O! Daylight come and me wanna go home\") and my dark shades and take my conga drum and go over in Central Park and sit there and play it and figure out the future.\n\nI've gotten psychologically punchy over the years I've played basketball. People have been snatching and pulling at me since I was little ... well, since I was a kid, not a little kid. I've been stared at, laughed at, insulted, investigated and generally turned inside out.\n\nMan, the FBI grabbed me while I was still in Overbrook High School in Philadelphia, and word was getting around that I was getting some pretty fabulous offers from colleges around the country. Like tens of thousands of dollars under the table and hidden away in caves and secret funds. Offers of big cars and like that. There I was, still a young, impressionable boy who didn't want to do anything in the world but just plain play basketball. And they were on me like I was the biggest criminal in the country. From that day on, basketball got better, but my life got tougher.",

      "title": "New Owner Syndrome is Real",
      "text": "In the past 4 years, we've seen 3 large-scale examples of new owner syndrome â where a brand new ownership group (or individual) acquires a team and then makes a trade that arguably sets their franchise back. \n\nThe 3 major examples that come to mind are:\n\n1) The AROD ownership group pushing for the Gobert Trade (although obviously the Glen Taylor drama means they don't have the same influence, they were reported to be a large reason the team traded for Gobert). Although this move did improve the team in the short-term, I would argue that in the future it will be viewed as a 1 step forward, 2 steps backwards move that shortened their window.\n\n2) Matt Ishbia trading for Beal, self-explanatory.\n\n3) Dumont trading Luka for Davis, Christie and a first.\n\n\n\nTheir seems to be a lot of similarities around these types of decisions â for example:\n\n1) They usually involve a short-sighted view of asset management.\n\n2) They often involve an over-reliance on \"internal statistical models\", which is part of the public record for scenarios 1 and 3.\n\n3) They typically involve an owner or ownership group overemphasize the importance of addressing some singular \"problem\" that they have assign too much significance too. For example, Minnesota felt a need to address their \"interior defense issue\" after their series with Memphis, when the series was actually very competitive and their core was young. The suns felt a desperation to replace CP3's waning production due to his age so much that they decided that they should trade for a contract that was notably considered bloated at the time (and that contained a no-trade clause). The Mavericks felt a need to address their best player's \"lack of work ethic\" and \"culture fit\" despite the fact that that player was already performing at the level of a generational talent regardless of whatever \"character flaws\" they supposedly believed he had. All 3 of these scenarios involve a level of desperation to address a problem that they likely believed to be more detrimental than it actually was.\n\n4) They typically involve owners making poor basketball talent evaluations. The AROD group believed Gobert was so good based on their understanding of impact statistics that came from baseball background that they could trade their entire asset collection for him. Ishbia  believed that Beal's talent next to Booker and KD would be so overwhelming that it would resolve all fit issues. The Mavericks made an evaluation that Luka Doncic's impact on winning wasn't as large as it seemed. \n\n\n\nHow should these transactions be viewed next to each other? What other similarities do people see?\n\nAnd who will be next? Will the ownership group that eventually acquires the Celtics immediately turn around and trade Jayson Tatum? Will new owners ever learn?",

      "title": "99% Of The Time, The Answer Is: Shoot It! Why shooting should be at the epicenter of every player's offseason development.",
      "text": "For seven years, I worked with NBA clients who hired me to help them shoot the basketball better; itâs a pretty simple job description.\n\nThis piece offers an inside look at how it's rare for a player to be able to significantly change aspects of their game, besides shooting, once they reach the NBA.\n\nAlmost every player who reaches the NBA has been the best player on every team theyâve played for. However, the NBA is a filtration system, and you never know how much the jump in speed and athleticism from college to the NBA will impact a player.\n\nShooting is the lynchpin skill within the filtration system; it can either unlock a playerâs game, allowing them to stay and thrive in the league, or filter them out.\n\nAt the beginning of the off-season, I would tell every client the same thing:\n\nOur top priority is to establish foundational mechanics that will enable them to elevate their shooting ability to the highest possible level. If we do that, there will be two distinct benefits:\n\n**Simplify:**Â *The confidence and skill to take and make more shots will allow for more opportunities, better reads, and fewer turnovers.*\n\n**Unlock:**Â *The better they shoot it, the more space it will open up for them and others; itâs pretty simple math: shoot it better, and the closeouts have to get more aggressive.*\n\nThe more a player canÂ *simplify*Â their reads through elevated shooting, the more itÂ *unlocks*Â their thought process to see space as 360 degrees instead of only downhill. This perspective shift from downhill to 360 maximizes the available space on the court for them.\n\n# Their Game, Not Yours:\n\nOne of the most important lessons I learned during my time working with NBA players is that you can only have a minimal impact on how a player perceives their game. You might be able to move the needle by 10-15%, but no more.\n\nTheyâve reached the top of the food chain playingÂ *their game*. Trying to get them to play a different type of game initially is a foolâs mission.\n\nIâve found that improving a playerâs shooting is the quickest way to influence their game. Most players have significant opportunities for growth in this area, so better shooting can significantly boost their overall performance. After achieving this small win together, it opens up the opportunity for honest conversations about how they view their game within not only their team but the larger NBA ecosystem.\n\n# Cash Rules Everything:\n\nHe who has the gold makes the rules.\n\nOnly one type of event has the potential to shift a playerâs game outside this 10-15% window: A change at the top.\n\n* New Head Coach.\n* New GM/President.\n* Changing teams, which results in both a new Head Coach and GM/President.\n\nThis change in leadership determines the person who pays or plays them, aka whose primary opinion matters. Only a few players' games are immune to a change at the top affecting the way they play; they are the top-of-the-food-chain players, such as LeBron, Luka, and Giannis, among others.\n\nI have had three former NBA clients undergo leadership changes. Below is a look at their synergy breakdown of âPlay Typesâ from a three-season sample size surrounding these regime changes:\n\n*Numbers Represent % of Playerâs Action:*\n\n# Player A:\n\nYears 1 & 2: Same GM and coach.\n\nYear 3: New team, aka new GM and coach\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/61a4owg1imff1.jpg?width=1179&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=eac1ac9e9c199cc7aed6da1eed332859e2a42998\n\n# Player B:\n\nYear 1: Same coach as the previous year.\n\nYear 2: New Coach\n\nYear 3: New team, aka new GM and coach\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/9wxvqpa2imff1.jpg?width=1179&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=82762b8b901878cc589ca3e19adc2d89fbabd433\n\n# Player C:\n\nYear 1: Traded in the offseason between Year 1 & 2.\n\nYears 2 & 3: New team, aka new GM and coach\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/f50dfwx2imff1.jpg?width=1179&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b3c2a94df8a2d1cede912cf98ce8112872777772\n\nThe only event that moved these players outside the NBAâs version of the Overton Window was a change at the top. Each of the three players played different positions on the court and held variousÂ *statuses*Â within their teams and the leagueâs hierarchy: role player, starter, and All-NBA.\n\nThis is why shooting must be the epicenter of every off-season. Whether youâre the center of the wheel or just a spoke, your primary actions can always change. However, one thing that wonât change is that the better a player shoots the ball, the more effective they will be at everything else on the court.\n\nShooting is never out of style, like florals in spring or black in the winter; itâs a classic, not a trend.\n\n# Downhill vs. 360 Degrees:\n\nPlayers who do not consistently trust their shot often view space as only downhill, regardless of the defense's coverage. This compresses the court for themselves and their teammates and, worst of all, can prevent them from playing in rhythm and on balance.\n\nCompression of space is important, but the deadliest sin in basketball is the lack of movement in rhythm and balance. To produce the magic needed to shoot a basketball from 25 feet away through an 18-inch ring suspended 10 feet in the air, the body and the basketball must work as a team, operating in rhythm and on balance the entire time.\n\nThis isnât football, where you have to get your body from Point A â B before someone tackles you; basketball is a game of skill in which you must link power from your body to the basketball kinetically. (Read more about my definition of skill here)\n\nBetter shooting â More shots made â More out-of-control closeouts.\n\nIf shooting is the first solution, then great shot preparation footwork is a non-negotiable on every catch. This made a few things possible:\n\n* Rhythm + Balance on shot.\n* Story Telling Pump Fakes.\n* Commanded high hip closeouts, which will lead to easy Catch â Go reads.\n\nSpace is always 360 on the court, and there is no league in the world where this concept is more important than the NBA.\n\nMost NBA players grow up as athletic outliers who can blow up any angle, so space is always downhill for them.\n\nWhen youâre an athletic outlier, a missed shot read during a closeout, PnR, or DHO will likely still result in finishes or fouls due to athletic superiority. But not in the NBA; players look at their athletic equals every night.\n\nWhen considering a playerâs off-season development plan, there is only one place to start: the epicenter of the game, shooting the basketball.\n\nImproving a playerâs shooting is the quickest path to more playing time, and it creates a domino effect that leads to advantageous opportunities on the court.\n\nShooting will augment any coachâs system regardless of the level; itâs the look that never goes out of style.",

      "text": "For the non soccer fans, the FA cup is a knockout tournament participated by all teams in English football. This includes the big professional EPL clubs as well as semi-pro and amateur teams. Lots are drawn and then there's something like 12-14 rounds of knockout games before a champion is crowned. Every year, upsets are pulled off where a team defeats their opponents several rungs above them. Most other countries would have a similar tournament with similar narratives taking place.\n\nMost recently, Tamworth, a semi pro team which members included a plumber, a bricklayer, and a Zara retail worker, held Tottenham Hotspur 0-0 before finally losing in extra time. The value of the team Tottenham fielded is in the hundreds of millions. Correct me if I'm wrong, but for context it would be like if a team in a local recreation league took the Clippers to overtime in a competitive game.\n\nIf such a competition existed for American basketball, how realistically could this happen? Is the gulf of talent between a NBA team and a good amateur team just too big? Is basketball just a very different sort of game? Does the concept of a \"good amateur team\" even make sense, or is a player typically just outside of the nba and g-league talent pool most likely playing pro ball overseas? What if say college teams were included in this tournament as well? Curious to know everyone's thoughts.",

Some players who many donât consider all timers by any stretch but for a specific period, were absolutely phenomenal. You could use years, or you could be a bit more niche, like for some more football examples, âWorld Cup Ochoaâ, â Origi in the last 10 minutesâ.\n\nAre there some good pulls for NBA equivalents. Iâve heard about like 2017 curry and all that but those are all time players anyway. Im talking maybe a player I havenât heard of or paid much attention to, but ripped it apart for a period. Like I have for example heard of linsanity which I think is an example more akin to what Iâm looking for.\n\nUpdate: wow this got a lotttt of comments, Iâm gonna do my best to watch all of the suggestions but probably gonna start with names I havenât heard before, and will try reply to comments haha",

The smaller the market, the more challenging it is to stoke appeal beyond it, even as a changing media landscape alters the way fans consume sports.\n\n>Itâs possible that the N.B.A. finals will feature two of the smallest markets if the Thunder beat the Minnesota Timberwolves and the Indiana Pacers beat the New York Knicks in the current round. The Thunder and the Pacers are teams with a lot of talent but not many big names.\n\n>There was a time when the N.B.A. was built on dynasties. The Chicago Bulls won six championships with Michael Jordan. The Lakers have 17 and the Celtics 18, many of them coming in clusters.\n\n>Then came the LeBron James era of the N.B.A. finals.\n\n>From 2011 to 2018, every championship round featured Mr. James. He won two titles in four years with the Miami Heat, one against an upstart Oklahoma City team. He won one in four years in Cleveland, bumping up each time against the Stephen Curry-led Warriors, who won three. The teams left out of those dynasties looked enviously at the National Football League, where success was less concentrated.\n\n>To achieve that parity, the N.B.A. has increased incentives over the last decade for players to stay with the teams that drafted them by allowing them to make far more money with those teams. The leagueâs current collective bargaining agreement with its players, signed in 2023, stipulates penalties that limit the team-building moves that franchises can make if they spend too much, even beyond the tax that had already been imposed on big spenders.\n\n>âItâs not necessarily artificial parity, where we keep moving the chips around and saying we want to go into every season and make sure every team has an equal chance,â the leagueâs commissioner, Adam Silver, said in September. âYou want each team to be in a position where if, well managed, theyâre in a position to compete.â\n\n>But that also means the best teams may have players who are less familiar to casual fans, since viewers arenât seeing the same players on the biggest stages year after year. When the Warriors and Cavaliers played each other in the finals, the games averaged nearly 20 million viewers. Last yearâs finals averaged 11.3 million. This yearâs winner will be the seventh new champion in the past seven years.",

Iâm not sure if a run down is possible, but which teams are good now and which players who were drafted in recent years are suddenly superstars?\n\napologies for the hard to answer question, it just feels like an alternate reality league compared to what i was used to, where shit teams are now good and literally everyone has changed teams lol.\n\nedit: Thanks for the serious answers, like i said i know itâs an odd question.

      "text": "> The Dallas Mavericks are making major changes in their health and performance group for the third consecutive offseason, as general manager Nico Harrison dismissed head athletic trainer Dionne Calhoun and athletic performance director Keith Belton, among others, sources told ESPN on Wednesday.\n\n> Calhoun spent 21 seasons in Dallas and was promoted to the head athletic trainer role in 2019. He was one of the final holdovers from the staff of former Mavs director of health and performance Casey Smith, who was fired in August 2023 and hired by the New York Knicks as the vice president of sports medicine last summer.\n\n> Harris hired Belton, a former NFL fullback who had been the director of football performance at UCLA, last summer after firing longtime Mavs athletic performance director Jeremy Holsopple.\n\n> As ESPN reported in April, Belton did not have the certifications from the National Strength and Conditioning Association that the NBA's collective bargaining agreement states are required to be employed as a strength coach for a team.\n\n> Sources told ESPN that there was significant tension between Belton and first-year director of health and performance Johann Bilsborough, who remains employed by the Mavericks. According to multiple team sources, the organization's human relations department investigated a loud, heated verbal confrontation that occurred at the team's practice facility between Belton and Bilsborough.\n\n> That argument stemmed from a disagreement regarding the treatment of Dallas center Dereck Lively II, who went through an intense return-to-play workout under Belton's supervision a day before a CT scan revealed that the big man had a stress fracture in his right ankle, an injury that sidelined him for three months.\n\n> Harrison declined to comment.\n\nSource: https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/45044142/sources-mavericks-fire-head-athletic-trainer-strength-coach",

      "title": "road teams are 5-0 in round two so far -- and that may be part of a larger trend of a decline in homecourt advantage",
      "text": "Teams with home-court advantage tend to win the majority of their playoff series. But we also have to remember that home teams are generally the better of the two (based on regular season record).\n\nSo how valuable is the concept of home-court advantage in a vacuum? It's potentially less valuable than it's ever been before.\n\nAs fans, we tend to complain that the constant \"flopping\" and free-throw hunting is ruining the product. But by and large, free throws are a lower percentage of points than they used to be back in the [older days](https://www.basketball-reference.com/leagues/NBA_stats_per_game.html). The percentage of points that come via the three pointers have dramatically increased in their stead.\n\nWhy is this relevant? Because researchers have posited that \"home-court advantage\" in a game is largely reliant on a preference from referees (who may be biased by the fans' pressure). And referees play a larger role in determining free throws than three pointers. The theory goes: if refs can't affect the outcomes of games as much as they did in the past -- then roaring fans can't affect the outcomes of games as much -- and then home-court can't affect the outcomes of games as much.\n\nIf this theory is true -- then we'd expect the results of home-court advantage to have lessened over the last few years. Recent studies have appeared to confirm the concept. As cited [here](https://sports.yahoo.com/fact-or-fiction-is-home-court-advantage-in-the-nbas-regular-season-dead-194958543.html#:~:text=Home%2Dcourt%20advantage%20has%20declined,of%20the%20past%20five%20years.), home teams are winning less often than they used to, down from about 60% to 54%.\n\nMoreover, we have to remember that \"home-court advantage\" in the NBA isn't the same as \"home-field advantage\" in a sport like football. If you're in the NFL and you're the top seed, your opponent has to come into your stadium and win on your turf in the big game. Singular. Game. You have home-field advantage for 1 (of 1) matchups. 100% of the time.\n\nIn the NBA, as we know, series are played out over the course of a 7-game series. You get 2 games at home, 2 games on the road, back to home, back to the road, and back to home for the \"decisive\" game 7. So you're not getting home-court advantage 100% of the time -- you're getting it 4/7 times -- 57% of the time.\n\nIf that. After all, not every series is actually going a full 7 games. In fact, the stats [here](https://www.nbcsportsboston.com/nba/nba-playoffs-game-7-history-statistics/609963/#:~:text=Postseason%20history%20says%20the%20Finals,38%20Game%207s%20(28.8%25) suggest that NBA playoff series only reach Game 7 in about 25% of all pairings.\n\nSo to summarize... if you work hard during the regular season... if you fight tooth and nail to secure a higher seed... you're rewarded with home-court advantage in one extra game (which gives you about a 4-5% better chance of winning that game), in a series that has about a 25% chance of reaching that game in the first place.\n\nShould any of this be a concern? Maybe not. The playoffs have been fun and competitive this year. That said, the decline of home-court advantage may be contributing to the regular season malaise. Franchises have been load managing and coasting in the regular season in order to keep their stars fresh -- but also doing it with the underlying knowledge that home-court advantage is not *that* powerful.",

I've always thought this to be quite a simple but elegant system as players need to be consistently better than both their teammates and their opposition, and they need to play in as many games as possible.\n\nSince it's the offseason, and I wanted to practice coding, I thought it would be fun to apply this game-by-game approach to the NBA, and see if NBA Brownlow Medallists would be materially different to the winners of the MVP award.\n\n**Approach**\n\nOf course there's no way I could get umpire votes, and given the discourse around Scott Foster et. al. it might be for the best, so I scored each player's performance in each game according to the following rules:\n\n* 'points': 1.00,\n* 'assists': 2.25,\n* 'blocks': 3.00,\n* 'steals': 2.00,\n* 'fieldGoalsAttempted': -0.70,\n* 'fieldGoalsMade': 2.00,\n* 'threePointersMade': 0.75,\n* 'freeThrowsAttempted': -0.30,\n* 'freeThrowsMade': 0.60,\n* 'reboundsDefensive': 1.00,\n* 'reboundsOffensive': 1.25,\n* 'turnovers': -1.00,\n* 'plusMinusPoints': 0.30\n* WIN\\_MULTIPLIER = 1.25\n\n*plusMinusPoints referes to box +/-,*Â *and WIN\\_MULTIPLIER is applied to the 'raw' total score of all players on the winning team of a game*\n\nFor each game, the player (across both teams) with the highest score received three votes, the second highest score two votes, and third highest score one vote. The player with the most votes each season was awarded the Brownlow Medal.\n\n**Results**\n\nFull results are below (I only included 1976 - present because I'm not sure how the data file treats players pre-merger).\n\nIn general the Medal is typically always won by an all-time great. This makes sense as basketball teams have much fewer players than an AFL side and are usually constructed to support the best player's style, meaning they can consistently poll votes most games. However, players having outstanding seasons, and iron men that play in almost every game each season also regularly crack the top five.\n\nWhile the Medallist and the MVP overlap in many seasons they're not congruent. My approach, of course, overlooks many intangibles that don't show up in the stat sheet that could may impact an MVP voter, it also standardises the impact of certain statistics - perhaps it's wrong to say all field goals/assists/blocks etc. are made equal. However, it also removes any sentimentality that might be present in NBA MVP award voting such as season storylines, outsized individual highlights, or voter fatigue.\n\nA few interesting insights and superlatives to call out from the results:\n\n*Most common Brownlow Medallist:*\n\n1.Â Â Â Â Â LeBron James - 8\n\n2.Â Â Â Â Â Michael Jordan - 6\n\n3.Â Â Â Â Â = Nikola Jokic, = Larry Bird, = Kareem Abdul-Jabbar\\* - 4 (KAJ has some pre-1976 too)\n\n*Most successful individual polling seasons:*\n\n1.Â Â Â Â Â = LeBron James 2010, 2009, = Michael Jordan 1988 - 207 votes\n\n2.Â Â Â Â Â = Shaquille O'Neal 2000, = Michael Jordan 1989 - 206 votes\n\n3.Â Â Â Â Â Hakeem Olajuwon 1993 - 201 votes\n\n*Closest Brownlow Medal race:*\n\n2019 - James Harden (175 votes) beating Giannis Antetokounmpo (174 votes) by a single vote\n\n*Key differences between MVP and Brownlow Medal winners:*\n\n* Embiid, Westbrook, DRose, Kobe, Dirk, Nash, AI, Barkley, Walton all have won MVP but not the Brownlow\n* Chris Paul (2008) is the only player to win the Brownlow without ever having won MVP\n* Lebron has the biggest disparity between MVPs won (4) and Brownlows won (8)\n\nIf you found this interesting, you'd like to see more detailed results, different scoring weights, or anything else then please let me know, it'd be great to tell my girlfriend I'm not the only one that's fascinated by obscure and unnecessary sporting analysis.\n\nNBA player data file

Football uses things like Goals and assists, the NFL uses total yards, interceptions Hockey also uses goals and assists.\n\nWhy does basketball prefer things like PPG over Total Points, advanced stats like BPM or EPM over EW?\n\nIt's great to average a high number of stats per game, but it's objectively more important to accumulate more stats total by the end of the season because your averages don't matter in games you don't play.\n\nAveraging 30/10/10 and playing 50 games is much worse than averaging 27/7/7 and playing 70 games, despite rate stats saying that the guy who put up 30 is better across the board, with even some advanced stats preferring the extra box score production per game instead of taking into account games played.\n\nFor me, players don't produce when they don't play, so ultimately, your averages are meaningless if you end up having fewer stats by the end of the year.",

Essentially my question is, how good are Jokic and Doncic, and what potential do they have?\n\nI've seen some critics saying that Lebron has never been in a team and been second best, which they're saying is the case now after the Doncic <-> AD trade, so I was wondering whether he actually is that good, and if he has the potential to become one of the best OAT.\n\nAlso, more interestingly I saw some website which collects bball stats showing how Jokic has like 6 of the top 10 best seasons of all time under his belt, according to their metrics, and considering that 30/20/20 game I believe it was, he seems to be ridiculous. Is he actually that good, and if so what's stopping him from being considered the GOAT?\n\nApologies for my ignorance, just am very curious as to how good those 2 guys are.",

Tim Duncan- Model professional, fundamentally sound and relate to him as an introverted dude. Also surprisingly we share the same birthdayâ¦ All time favourite Centre and player.\n\n2. Dirk Nowitzki- Great ambassador for the game, had one of the best runs in 2011. \nMy best NBA 2K my player career was on 2k15 when I created a Dirk and Dream (Hakeem) hybrid big. Numero uno PF preference wise.\n\n3. LeBron James- Face of the league for most of my time watching. Probably the best ever. No1 SF.\n\n4. Steph Curry- Most electrifying player to watch. Best highlight reel too. Favourite at the Point.\n\n5. Kobe Bryant- Relate to his competitiveness, his aptitude for linguistics and heâs a soccer/football fan too lol  Iconic player and my favourite 2 guard.\n\n6. Nikola Jokic- Best player currently and I was on the bandwagon before it was cool almost a decade agoâ¦ My 2nd fave center after Duncan.\n\n7. Steve Nash- 2nd favourite PG and a likeable guy in general. An offensive maestro.\n\n8. Kevin Durant: Slim Reaper. 2nd favourite SF. Fun to use in the games and to watch live.\n\n9. Giannis Antetekumpo: Cool dude and a real freak of nature on the court. 2nd best of this new era. 2nd favourite PF.\n\n10. Dwyane Wade: Between Harden and Flash for 2nd favourite SG. Flash over the beard I guessâ¦",

He looked lost, poor and a shadow of his former prime. Real Madrid played some really bad football and performed very poorly.\n\nYet, after the initial nightmarish months, Mbappe is now back to the top again, scoring numerous goals, regaining his form, and just knocked out Manchester City with a hat trick.\n\nEven the best of the best athletes need time to adjust and adapt to a new environment, especially Luka's trade was such a big shock and heartbreak for himself.  I am not saying he will 100% go back to his prime, but at least give him time and don't overreact over a small sample size.",

      "text": "As someone from Europe, used to watching football games where games are played 45x2 and there are not timeouts watching NBA games live is close to impossible. Most of the game is made up of breaks where we're either watching commercials, old highlights or the arena show (does anyone actually like that arena show, it's awful). How do people get through live NBA games, for the most part I watch games (celtic games) after they've been played so I can skip the play breaks.   \n  \nAnyways, how do people feel about the breaks?

      "text": "[Source](https://frontofficesports.com/lebron-jamess-growing-amazon-ties-could-lead-to-prime-role/)\n\n>Where thereâs smoke, thereâs fire between LeBron James and Amazon. The growing business relationship between the basketball superstar and the nationâs largest retailer could lead to King James eventually joining Prime Videoâs upcoming coverage of the NBA, sources tellÂ *Front Office Sports*.\n\n>The 40-year-old James humorously teased retirement in a new âWhatâs Next?â commercial for Prime Day 2025 from July 8â11. James (who drew rave reviews for his costarring role in the 2015 comedyÂ *Trainwreck*) collaborated closely with Prime on creating the 60-second commercial, from brainstorming comedic bits to picking Phil Collins hit âIn the Air Tonightâ for his lounge-singer spoof.\n\n>While James recently feuded with ESPNâsÂ Stephen A. Smith, the four-time champion effusively praised Primeâs NBA talent hires for the 2025â26 season, including Nash, his old Heat running mate Dwyane Wade, Dirk Nowitzki, and Candace Parker.Â \n\n>While the four-time MVP didnât name-check anybody in an interview withÂ *The Hollywood Reporter*, heâs previously criticized NBA media personalities onÂ ESPN and TNTÂ for being too negative about the league they cover.Â Â \n\n>Primeâs new NBA team comprises people who âknow the game and appreciate the game and talk about the game in such a positive manner,â James toldÂ *THR*. âSo, I think Amazon Prime Video, theyâre going to do a great job showcasing our sport; \\[the talent\\] love(s) our sport. Great intellect, great commentary, great insight â I really look forward to that. And like I said, those guys that have signed up for it, theyâre going to do great things.â\n\n>Only James knows when he will hang up his sneakers after 22 seasons with The Association. He has aÂ $52.2 millionÂ player option for the â25 season. If not this year then next, there will be âhugeâ interest among the leagueâs media partnersâPrime, NBC Sports, and ESPNâwhen he calls it a career, predicts Alex Flanagan, the former sports anchor and sideline reporter turned vice president of broadcasting at The Montag Group.\n\n>Prime, NBC, and ESPN would be âcompelledâ to talk to James, say my sources. âThatâs a meeting you have to take just to see what he wants to do,â said one executive who declined to be named. But ESPN might have the toughest recruitment given the bad blood between James and Smith. James physically confronted Smith in March over comments about his son Bronny. Smith toldÂ Rolling StoneÂ thereâs still hard-feelings. âI donât like him, and he donât like me,â said Smith.\n\n>Other factors are at work here, too. Flanagan tells me Tom Bradyâs monster, 10-year, $375 million deal to call NFL games for Fox Sports has effectively reset the industry. It also opened the eyes of some superstars about the lucrative opportunity in sports media. Even the GOAT himselfâMichael Jordanâis coming to TV as a âspecial contributorâ to NBCâs NBA coverage this season (However, a source toldÂ *FOS*Â that reports of MJâsÂ $40 millionÂ annual payday are false).\n\n>James might want to nail down one of the most lucrative NBA TV jobs before Steph Curry, the 37-year-old Warriors superstar, follows him into retirement. Curryâs Dubs teammateÂ Draymond GreenÂ also views media âas a big part of his future,â agent Josh Pyatt of WME told me in January.\n\n>âI would compare him to Tom Brady in football. I think LeBron has shown a much larger interest than Tom Brady did in the media from an early point in his career,â Flanagan says. âGosh, to have a legacy like that. Can you imagine having an NBA broadcast with Michael Jordan and LeBron James?â",

      "text": "As someone coming from European football, Iâve seen similar issues that are happening in the NBA. In European football, we implemented post-game referee performance reviews, and itâs been a game-changer. Referees who miss critical calls or make questionable decisions are held accountable, and those who repeatedly fail to meet the standard get the boot.\n\nThe current system in the NBA is flawed. Itâs disrespectful and demotivating to players when referees make decisions that directly impact the outcome of a game. In some cases, it can even be career-ending. Itâs frustrating that coaches often fear speaking up about refereeing because theyâre worried that future games might be officiated even more harshly.\n\nReferees have one primary responsibility: ensuring player safety and maintaining the integrity of the game. Itâs crucial that they do this with fairness and consistency. Independent post-game reviews would help ensure that referees are held accountable for their performance and that players and coaches can trust the process. The integrity of the game depends on it.",

Luckily, the Celtics got luck on their side and the stretch to end the season has them matching up against a few teams that'll be purposely tanking. Between now and the next ranking the Celtics will face off against the Kings, Suns, Spurs, Grizzlies, Heat, Suns again, and the Wizards. Then to end the regular season, they'll face off against the Knicks, Magic, and Hornets twice in a row. It's been a season of ups and downs, and constant rest and coasting for the Celtics at times. Just stay healthy these next couple weeks. \t|\n3\t|\t[](/CLE) Cavaliers\t|\t-1\t|\t57-14\t|\tThe Cavs went 3-4 since the last power rankings, but you know itâs a great season when you have fans worried about the fact that weâve lost so many in a row that weâre now only 57-14 with a 5 game lead for the #1 seed. Weâre seem to be somewhat in coasting mode with guys constantly getting nights off for rest, but thatâs not why weâre losing. We canât shoot right now, weâre barely holding on to the #1 3p% for a team on the season despite having the league worst 3p% in the month of March.. Hopefully this west coast road trip can be left in the past and this team can ramp back up heading into the playoffs, as itâs been a season of long highs and brief lows. If the next high can begin around April 19th, that would be ideal.\t|\n4\t|\t[](/HOU) Rockets\t|\t+6\t|\t46-26\t|\t\t|\n5\t|\t[](/DEN) Nuggets\t|\t--\t|\t45-27\t|\t\t|\n6\t|\t[](/GSW) Warriors\t|\t+2\t|\t41-30\t|\tCurry has a pelvic contusion with no structural damage but did not travel with the team or play against the Hawks. With 5 more games on this 6 game road trip remaining and the Wolves and Clippers not losing much the Warriors hope to avoid the play in is dwindling if Curry remains out. Luckily the upcoming schedule doesn't get REALLY juicy until Memphis on 4/1 with MIA, NOP, and SAS coming up before that game. \t|\n7\t|\t[](/LAL) Lakers\t|\t-3\t|\t43-27\t|\t\t|\n8\t|\t[](/NYK) Knicks\t|\t-2\t|\t44-26\t|\tThe Knicks fanbase is starting to seriously grumble about Thibs as coach. In the past it was solely the more negative echo chambers on reddit and twitter, but I've started hearing it brought up in conversations around the city. I'm not really sure if there's a deeper level to it all, or if it really makes a difference as far as decision-making, but it's happening. Seems like there's a hard cap on what this team can do right now. \t|\n9\t|\t[](/IND) Pacers\t|\t+4\t|\t41-29\t|\tYou will be forgiven if you need to catch your breath- the Pacers haven't played a normal game in what seems like ages. Late-game theatrics have taken over Indiana, but, unlike in last year's playoffs, they seem to have risen up to the moment. Whether it's executing a 4-verts-style play to hit a game-winning 4-point play, or forcing multiple turnovers in a span of seconds to get to overtime, the Pacers have managed to snatch victory from the jaws of defeat more times over the last two weeks than some teams do in an entire season. \t|\n11\t|\t[](/LAC) Clippers\t|\t+3\t|\t40-31\t|\tBoth Harden and Kawhi seemed to have turned the gears back on, however the Clippers cannot seem to make any movement in the traffic jam that is the Western Conference playoff picture. Since the start of March, both Harden and Kawhi have averaged around 25 PPG on field goal percentages that look more like the old them. Ivica Zubac has genuinely been one of the, if not the most consistent center in the league this season, he isn't the prettiest candidate for Most Improved but goddamn does he deserve a look. The additions of Bogdan and Ben Simmons to the offense has helped take the load off of the old guard a ton, and now Norman is starting to find his place again after being out. We have been fully healthy for a stretch of games for the first time in a while, and all this to remain in 7th in the West. My ass hurts, my eyes are getting tired, I just want out of this jam as soon as possible.\t|\n11\t|\t[](/MEM) Grizzlies\t|\t-4\t|\t43-28\t|\tThings have gone from bad to worse. Ja is out now with a hamstring injury. Brandon Clarke done for the season for the second straight year. Rookies are hitting a wall, and we can't beat any good teams. Taylor Jenkins' seat should be on fire at this point, with the only thing saving him from unemployement would be a second round playoff appearance. Tough conversations are going to have to be had about the future of this team, specifically with its star in Ja Morant playing in only 62% available games in his career at this point. Now, it's not the time to panic. The team has shown an offensive gear in this season that is the best in the league. They have a DPOY candidate leading their defense. The team must start ramping up to playoff intensity, and if they don't this team will look very different next year.\t|\n12\t|\t[](/MIN) TWolves\t|\t-1\t|\t41-31\t|\tWhat a difference a couple of games mean. Entering last week wolves were riding a nice win streak and optimism was in the air. Then they drop a couple of games to the Pacers and Pels and vibes were dead. Cut to friday night against NOLA, Wolves start Joe Ingles to honor his autistic son who was in attendance and blow the doors of the opponent. Vibes are high and there is optimism the Wolves can still squeak out of the play in and secure the 6th seed.\t|\n13\t|\t[](/MIL) Bucks\t|\t-4\t|\t40-30\t|\tThe Bucks have had the 2nd best defense in the league since the All-Star Break (behind only Golden State), but the offense has been struggling -- ranking 18th since the break. Both of those rankings can largely be attributed to the addition of Kyle Kuzma, who's been a terrific defender, but is very inefficient on offense. Can Doc Rivers figure out how to improve the offense before the playoffs? Probably not. But perhaps someone may at least convince him to start running sets that make sense in the 4th quarter.  \t|\n14\t|\t[](/DET) Pistons\t|\t-2\t|\t40-32\t|\tI think we'll ultimately pull out the 6 seed in the East, but you are going to likely see our 4.5 win lead over the Hawks evaporate really quickly over the next week and change. Losses to teams like the injured Mavs and the Wizards shouldn't happen when you are making a playoff push. Losing THJ to an ankle injury vs Dallas is going to hurt more than people expect. Hopefully he's back soon. A couple more wins triples our win total from last year.\t|\n15\t|\t[](/ATL) Hawks\t|\t+1\t|\t35-36\t|\tDread it, run from it, 0.500 arrives all the same. The Hawks are a game away from their ancestral 0.500 record after going 5-2 since the last ranking. The schedule was very soft over this stretch (PHI x2, CHA x2) and the Brooklyn loss is rather infuriating in hindsight, but 5-2 is still a good stretch. Trae's been playing efficiently, Dyson's continuing to steal every Hawks fan's heart, Zach is out here making a late push for ROTY, and Onyeka has shaken up the conversation regarding the long term option at the 5 due to his continued good play. The return of Caris LeVert from injury has helped with adding creation to bench units and alongside Trae, and Georges Niang can't miss recently. The Hawks have the 6th easiest schedule remaining, with only 3 games against teams above 0.500. The 6 seed is likely out of reach with Detroit 5.5 games ahead (although they do have the 2nd hardest remaining SOS), so the Hawks are probably going to be in the play-in for the 4th straight season. The race for the 7th seed will likely come down to the last week, with the Hawks and Magic playing two games that week.\t|\n16\t|\t[](/SAC) Kings\t|\t-1\t|\t35-35\t|\t\t|\n17\t|\t[](/PHX) Suns\t|\t--\t|\t34-37\t|\tThe Suns are actuallyâ¦ fun to watch? This looks like an actual team, not a collection of cosplayers. Itâs all come from one simple change: playing the young, athletic, and tenacious players instead of all âglass cannonsâ. The starting lineup that has put us on this winning streak includes two rookies and a two-way player. Yet, it looks better than anything weâve seen in the past two years. Dunn and Oso are shining in their major minutes and Collin Gillespie is playing like heâs been on the team for years. Even Cody Martin has been a surprising contributor as a defensive wing. Most importantly, their energy has rubbed off on the entire team, showing life weâve not seen in years. That it took Bud this long to even attempt this change is damning, but letâs B+. Perhaps this new form may be enough to at least carry us into the playoffs, making this season only mostly an embarrassment instead of a complete one. And regardless of what happens this offseason, there is the start of a new, youthful foundation. Something to add onto instead of replacing. BREAK OUT THE HOPIUM!\t|\n18\t|\t[](/ORL) Magic\t|\t--\t|\t33-38\t|\tWith the 6th seed probably too far away now, it's looking like a fight against the Hawks for home court in a play-in matchup and eventually a spanking against the Cavs or Celtics for the Magic. Paolo and Franz are too competitve to allow this team to end up in the lottery and March has surprisingly seen much better shooting out of the rest of the roster. Cory Joseph being inserted into the lineup due to a toe injury to Cole Anthony has done wonders for offensive flow, hopefully Mosley and Weltman understand the assignment this summer.\t|\n19\t|\t[](/CHI) Bulls\t|\t+2\t|\t31-40\t|\t\t|\n20\t|\t[](/POR) Trail Blazers\t|\t--\t|\t32-40\t|\t\t|\n21\t|\t[](/SAS) Spurs\t|\t+2\t|\t31-39\t|\tStephon Castle for ROTY, Sandro Mamukelashvili for MVP of the last quarter of the season, and the Spurs might be making a push for the play-in?? The boys in Silver and Black sit 2.5 games back of the Suns and Mavs (technically just the Suns right now) for the last spot in the play-in coming into the last weeks of the season. They're doing it on the back of the league's best offense over the last several weeks, but counteract that with having the league's worst defense over that same stretch (at least until they held the tanking Raptors to 89 points last night)--somewhere, George Gervin's 70s Spurs and David Thompson's 70s Nuggets are smiling. The team's got a murder's row of a schedule coming up, but you can't deny that the Spurs are fun to watch. The boys have @DET, @CLE, BOS, GSW, ORL, @DEN, CLE and @POR over the next two weeks.\t|\n22\t|\t[](/DAL) Mavericks\t|\t--\t|\t34-37\t|\tThe last three games against Philly, Indiana, and Detroit have been a competitive few games, and it is no coincidence that those are the first three games that PJ Washington played since a two week absence. Things are still bleak in Dallas, but the play-in hopes continue to exist for an injury-plagued Mavs team.\t|\n23\t|\t[](/MIA) Heat\t|\t-4\t|\t30-41\t|\tThe Heat have finally broken their 10 game losing streak however this season is looking cooked. There were some close losses in that losing streak but it's been awhile since we've had a losing streak this bad. Kel'el Ware is looking good and he's receiving quality minutes ever since Jovic was lost for possibly the season to injury. Now we're getting ready for Jimmy Butler to come back to Miami with the Warriors and all the fun that it brings along as well. Maybe we'll get lucky and Maple Jordan will give us some more of those big performances that saw us kill the losing streak. \t|\n24\t|\t[](/TOR) Raptors\t|\t--\t|\t24-47\t|\tThis season keeps rolling forward. Nothing new to note, Ja'Kobe looks good, Shead looks athletic, and the team for the most part has played opponenents tough. Excluding the blowout vs San Antonio. Second to last write up, and by the end we'll hopefully have scored some good lottery odds. \t|\n25\t|\t[](/BKN) Nets\t|\t+1\t|\t23-48\t|\tChoo choo. The tank train chugs along. The Nets are a weird team in that they have a terrible roster but a coach who wants to win with it. But no matter how hard he tries, the team simply can't hang in crunch time when other teams lock in. At this point, a top 5 pick is what we're looking for but hopefully an ethical tank will get the basketball gods to bounce the lottery balls our way.  \t|\n26\t|\t[](/PHI) 76ers\t|\t-1\t|\t23-48\t|\tGrimes is good! If there's anything positive to be pulled from this season (and believe me, it's difficult), it's been positive to see just how much some of these young players have grown. Grimes and Edwards especially with their increased playing/starting time, and McCain showed a lot of promise in his limited time with the team as well. While the team may not be able to move off of the PG contract so easily this offseason (if that's the direction they choose), it should be nice to take some solace in the fact that there are a few young players on the team who look ready to take the next step. With a (hopefully) young stud draft pick to add to the team, the Sixers might finally look to actually be younger in the 25-26 season. For nowâ¦ we wait. \t|\n27\t|\t[](/NOP) Pelicans\t|\t--\t|\t19-53\t|\tTrey Murphy is now out for the season. Believe it or not, Zion Williamson is the Pelicans survivor for the war of attrition. DPOY candidate Dyson Daniels was right. The arena is built on cursed ground.\t|\n28\t|\t[](/CHA) Hornets\t|\t--\t|\t18-53\t|\t\t|\n29\t|\t[](/WAS) Wizards\t|\t+1\t|\t15-55\t|\tDespite providing the playbook on how to beat the Denver Nuggets, the Wizards have finally reached the point in the season where we get 1-2 quarters to determine if it is going to be a competitive game before shutting things down. It is a blessing in one way as it allows for much tighter windows for the young players to shine. It is a curse because you slowly begin to tell yourself, \"Colby Jones is the future of the franchise, oh my god he is so good\" when he might be a name forgotten after the summer.  The rest of the season is set to be a slog, filled with blowout nights, Chris Miller talking about how many kids he has on the broadcast and maybe the occassional upset victory. Maybe if Alex Sarr was in a better narrative position to realistically compete for the Rookie of the Year award -- which he should be, things would feel a little bit different. Instead, all of the attention is fully onto draft night. You really can't go wrong with whoever you want to put at 30 when it comes to the NBA right now -- with Utah, Charlotte and Washington all having legitimate claims of being the team that sucks the most ass in the NBA.\t|\n30\t|\t[](/UTA) Jazz\t|\t-1\t|\t16-56\t|\tAs Bob Green, former Montana Tech University football coach, once said: \"It's kind of like watching your Mother-in-Law go off a cliff in a Cadillac, you've got mixed feelings\". That's been the story of Jazz-fans this season. For the first time in our franchise history, we have embraced the tank. It has turned lifelong fans into fair-weather fans. It's odd rooting for your favorite team to lose games. Something I've never experienced in my 27 years of rooting for the Jazz. However, the last 10 games of the seaon is where the money is made. The Jazz face just 1 other tanking team, Charlotte, whereas Washington faces 4 other tanking teams for a total of 6 games of their remaining 12 in the season. Utah has never had the best odds at drafting #1, and has never drafted #1. I think that this is the year that changes. In other news, rook Isaiah Collier has continued a strong playmaking. In fact, Collier is 19 assists away from breaking the Utah Jazz record for most assists in a season by a rookie, surpassing the great John Stockton. We must continue to root for losses for just a little while longer, Jazz fans!\t|",

      "title": "What's your favorite proposal to strengthen home-court advantage in the playoffs (and thus make the regular season matter more)?",
      "text": "Yesterday, we highlighted the fact that [home-court advantage](https://old.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/1kh1nsk/road_teams_are_50_in_round_two_so_far_and_that/) has been steadily on the decline in the NBA (for reasons described in that post). \n\nWe've seen that illustrated in the second round -- where road teams have gone 6-1 so far -- but also over a larger sample size over the last decade. These playoffs have been a lot of fun so it's hard to complain about them, but it's fair to wonder if the league should consider strengthening seeding and home-court advantage in some way. After all, the NBA already has a problem with teams coasting through the regular season -- and that could get worse if teams cared about home-court even less than they do now.\n\nThere have been a few proposals floated around, but I'll save my favorite for last.\n\n---\n\n**proposal 1: allowing top seeds to pick their opponent**\n\nThe idea that the top seed can pick any conference opponent they want has been championed by several pundits including Kevin O'Connor from yahoo. Surely, that would be a slight extra advantage for the top seeds. They can pick a team suffering from injuries -- or a team that they feel like they match up well against. There's also the fun and narrative factor at play when an opponent gets \"called out.\"\n\nThe reason that I do **not** love this idea though is the unintended consequences. Even if you protect the top 4 seeds (from being called out), you essentially make the difference between the seeds 5, 6, 7, and 8 irrelevant. If our goal is to make seeding matter *more*, then it should apply across the board and not just at the top.\n\n---\n\n**proposal 2: adding extra home games for higher seeds**\n\nRight now, the top seed has home-court advantage -- but really only in Game 7, which amounts to 57% of the series in total. And based on historical data, we only see that decisive Game 7 in about [25%](https://www.nbcsportsboston.com/nba/nba-playoffs-game-7-history-statistics/609963/#:~:text=Postseason%20history%20says%20the%20Finals,38%20Game%207s%20(28.8%25) of all playoff series anyway. It's not as strong of an edge as it is for sports like football.\n\nIf want to strengthen the advantage of a top seed, we could go the most extreme and give them home-court advantage for the ENTIRE series. That'd certainly make the seeding matter, huh? But surely, we may be going too far there. Fans (and ticket-hungry owners) of the lower seeded teams may riot.\n\nA potential compromise would be to give the top seed the home-court for 5/7 games -- 71% of the time. The top seed's schedule would look like this:\n\nGame 1: home\n\nGame 2: home\n\nGame 3: away\n\nGame 4: home\n\nGame 5: home\n\nGame 6: away\n\nGame 7: home\n\nPersonally, I'd be willing to debate this change, but it's probably too extreme for traditional fans. Moreover, it may be too extreme of an edge -- particularly in certain cases. Even if you advocate for this system, you may want to make exceptions for the 4/5 matchup or for the Finals. Sports is supposed to be a true meritocracy, so we don't want home-court advantage to be *too* hard to overcome.\n\nSo how do we strengthen home-court without sacrificing much in terms of history or game flow?\n\n---\n\n**proposal 3: giving the home team the ball to start quarters 2-3-4**\n\nFinally, we arrive on my favorite proposal. \n\nFor the playoffs, the home team starts each quarter (after the first) with possession.\n\nWhat does that mean exactly? Let's take a step back. In basketball, we have an opening tip-off that's basically ceremonial. Whoever loses the tip-off gets possession to start the next quarter, and the teams rotate. As a result, you get possession at the start of the quarter 2 out of 4 times. Perfectly even. But if we want seeding to matter more, we can't make it \"even.\" We have to try and increase the benefit of home-court advantage in small ways.\n\nIn this proposed scenario, we'd keep the opening tip-off (which will now actually matter), and then after that, give the home team the possession to start Quarter 2, Quarter 3, Quarter 4. Instead of starting with possession in 2 (of 4) quarters it may be 3 or 4.\n\nI imagine most NBA fans wouldn't even notice the difference. It wouldn't affect the flow of the game. But statistically, it would be meaningful. That extra 1 or 2 possessions would project as an extra 1 or 2 points per game. It'd give the home team more of a baked-in edge. It'd make having home-court matter more. And consequently, it'd make the regular season matter more.",

      "text": "My immediate answer is that it's very unlikely to happen because basketball is a much more intense sport than baseball with more contact. It's a colossal risk to sign a player long term.\n\nBut what about Patrick Mahomes? Football is more intense than basketball yet he signed a 20 year contract. Sure it's not 700+ million like Soto or Ohtani but 45m a year is really good. Only [14 NBA players](https://www.basketball-reference.com/contracts/players.html) are making over 45m this season.\n\nSo what do you think? Will/can Wemby sign a long term extension with the Spurs? Can there be a player so essential to a franchise that a Magic Johnson-esque 25 year contract would be reasonable?\n\nEdit: Guys the CBA can always change. So an extension of this question is will there ever be a push to change the CBA to allow for longer contracts.",

European football club competitions usually go from august to may, with only 2-3 months of downtime, which still can feel like a bit of a drag. But clearly, that's nothing compared to the NBA, which straight up pauses for half a year. On the other hand, while the season is on, the schedule is absolutely and unreasonably brutal. Back to back games? Shit, european football clubs are making a fuss if they don't get at least 48 hours of regeneration. For most midtable clubs, having one game a week is the norm, and having two games a week is considered a high load.\n\nSo I really don't get it, help me make it make sense. Why doesn't the nba space it season out more, so it's less harsh on the athletes and entertainment and revenue can be generated more continously throughout the year?",

It could quickly become a reality. NBA executives have contacted their counterparts at QSI (Qatar Sports Investments),Â [PSG](https://www.leparisien.fr/sports/football/psg/)Â 's main shareholder , to propose creating aÂ [basketball](https://www.leparisien.fr/sports/basket/)Â franchise in Paris. \"We have expressed interest,\" a PSG spokesperson said, confirming the American association's approach.\n\n>This contact confirms the NBA's desire to develop a championship in Europe as quickly as possible. The Spanish website \"Sportico\" recently mentioned the creation of a championship by 2026-2027 with around ten teams. Eleven cities spread across seven countries are reportedly in favor: Madrid, Barcelona, ââMunich, Berlin, London, Manchesterâwhere the \"NBA Game\" is expected to be held in 2026 after several editions in the French capitalâMilan, Rome, Istanbul, Athens, and Paris.\n\n>These destinations are no coincidence. The NBA wants to establish itself in cities where popular, financially powerful football clubs are located, and which, above all, are world-renowned brands, with which it could partner. This is the case for City in Manchester, Bayern in Munich, Real Madrid, and PSG in Paris.\n\n>Paris Basket buyout or creation of a new club?\n\n>According to our information, several options have been proposed to the Qataris. Either an outright purchase of an existing Parisianâor Parisianâteam, or the creation of a new team, independent of PSG, in partnership with other players. QSI does not rule out either of these possibilities.\n\n>For the first scenario, all eyes are logically turning to Paris Basketball. Created in 2018 by two Americans, themselves former NBA executives, by paying off HyÃ¨res-Toulon's debt, the capital's basketball club is playing this season in the Euroleague, the most renowned basketball competition in Europe today, and is on track to qualify for the final stages. Coincidentally - or not - Ãric Schwartz, owner of the Parisian club, is exceptionally present in Europe at the moment...\n\n>In December, during an interview, David Kahn, the president of the PBB, was also enthusiastic about the idea of ââseeing the NBA land with its \"project\" in Europe. \"It will be huge. Adam (Â Silver, the NBA bossÂ ) and I are friends, we will see each other in January (Â on the sidelines of the Spurs-Pacers games at the Accor ArenaÂ ).\"\n\n>Adam Silver and Nasser Al-KhelaÃ¯fi met at the Parc des Princes\n\n>In just a few years, Paris Basketball has developed its brand and attracted an ever-growing audience. The club, which has benefited since 2024 from a modern arena that meets the demanding Euroleague specifications with the Adidas Arena, regularly plays in front of 8,000 spectators. It can also relocate matches to the Accor Arena, with its 16,000 seats, for big-name matches. When contacted, Paris Basket declined to comment on this hot topic.\n\n>The other option being considered is to create an entity independent of PSG, with other investors. The NBA is suggesting that PSG associate its name with the NBA. Arctos, a 12.5% ââshareholder in the club and in which basketball player Kevin Durant has a stake, likely shares this view. The American investment fund is seeking to develop the PSG brand across the Atlantic. It is leveraging several levers: the Club World Cup, held this summer in the United States, and the prolific partnership with Jordan Brand.\n\n>The logo of the greatest basketball player of all time is worth its weight in gold: it's a gateway to all the world's markets. It's also the best label for associating PSG with the NBA. The commercial prospects are immense and global. Adam Silver, NBA boss, and Nasser Al-KhelaÃ¯fi were able to discuss the subject on January 22 at the Parc des Princes, during the PSG-Manchester City match, which was played the same week as the two \"NBA Paris Games\" with Victor Wembanyama's Spurs, himself present at the Parc des Princes as a PSG fan.\n\n>This NBA expansion project on the old continentâafter having already established a semi-closed championship on the African continent with the BALâis expected to make major progress quickly. \"Â [The NBA will report](https://www.leparisien.fr/sports/basket/cest-ce-dont-nous-revons-mais-pourquoi-larrivee-de-la-nba-en-europe-ce-nest-pas-gagne-26-01-2025-HYZ6GKMVPZG65O5LXSXRCL2UV4.php)Â this week on its exploration of the idea of ââa new men's basketball league in Europe, in partnership with FIBA ââ(the International Basketball Federation), at the meeting of governors (franchise owners),\" the powerful American league recently announced.

      "title": "Fixing the NBA Draft: A New Auction System That Stops Tanking and Adds Strategy",
      "text": "**Fixing the NBA Draft: A New Auction System That Stops Tanking and Adds Strategy**\n\n**TLDR: Auction Draft System that rewards bad teams with draft points that accumulate over years. Teams Bid on players with draft points. Reduces marginal benefit of tanking and luck factor in value of picks while still giving bad teams opportunities to improve**\n\nThis season has been one of the worst in recent memory when it comes to blatant tanking. We have teams like the Raptors, Utah, and the Sixers openly resting players, not playing them many minutes, and just straight-up sitting veterans to intentionally lose games.\n\nMost people understand that this is terrible for the league and it's terrible for fans of teams like the Nets and other organizations like the Bulls, Nets, Toronto, and Portland who want to maximize their tank odds but don't want to be at the end of the table and continue losing and rest guys.\n\nEveryone has a different way to come up with a way to stop tanking, but here is a radical new idea that I came up with. Maybe it's been used in other leagues; I haven't seen it. The idea would be to overhaul the draft system so the draft is no longer done in order but similar to an auction-style draft that some of you guys who play fantasy football might be familiar with.\n\n\n**How It Works**\n\nInstead of a traditional lottery, teams get draft points based on where they finished the previous season.\n\nThe worst teams still get the most points, but it's weighted so that itâs not an extreme advantageâjust enough to give rebuilding teams help without making tanking the meta.\n\nThere would be some way to order who gets to put up a player for auction, perhaps in order of who finished last the year prior, but when they're up for auction, teams bid their draft points for the right to pick them.\n\nTeams can trade draft points just like draft picks, so rebuilding teams could stockpile points or contenders could use them in trade packages.\n\n\n**Proposed Point System**\n\nRather than assigning flat draft odds, we use an exponential ranking system to determine draft points. This means:\n\nThe worst teams get the most points, but the difference between the bottom teams isn't massive, preventing extreme tanking.\n\nThe drop-off is smoothâmid-tier teams get a reasonable number of points, and playoff teams get very few.\n\n**Hereâs an example. The exact point values can be customized or changed to fit whatever idea the league comes up with.**\n\n| Rank | Draft Points |\n|------|--------------|\n| 1    | 1498         |\n| 2    | 1492         |\n| 3    | 1481         |\n| 4    | 1467         |\n| 5    | 1449         |\n| 6    | 1426         |\n| 7    | 1399         |\n| 8    | 1368         |\n| 9    | 1333         |\n| 10   | 1294         |\n| 11   | 1251         |\n| 12   | 1204         |\n| 13   | 1152         |\n| 14   | 1097         |\n| 15   | 1037         |\n| 16   | 973          |\n| 17   | 905          |\n| 18   | 833          |\n| 19   | 757          |\n| 20   | 677          |\n| 21   | 593          |\n| 22   | 504          |\n| 23   | 412          |\n| 24   | 315          |\n| 25   | 214          |\n| 26   | 193          |\n| 27   | 108          |\n| 28   | 98           |\n| 29   | 75           |\n| 30   | 50           |\n\n\n**Why This Could Work**\n\n*Tanking is way less valuable but still useful as a tool for rebuilding* â No more guaranteed top picks for bottom-feeder teams, and the marginal decrease isn't as significant as it is now, but you do accumulate additional draft points that you can use to draft players.\n\n*More strategic draft-day trades* â A team could stockpile points one year, then blow it all to move up and grab a generational talent.\nBetter for mid-tier teams â If a team finishes 9th or 10th, they actually have a chance to move up instead of just being stuck in no-manâs-land.\n*More trade flexibility* â Draft points become another valuable asset that can be moved in deals.\n\n*More strategy for teams* â Now developing young players and potentially trading them for draft points is useful. Finding players that are worth less for their draft points is good.\n\n*Reduces variability in draft positioning due to tiers* â Drop-off in tiers in the order of the players in a draft isn't as important because you can reflect that drop-off based upon how many draft points you give up.\n\n*Reduces variability between draft classes* â Right now, tanking in a stacked draft year (like 2023 with Wemby) is way more beneficial than tanking in a weak draft year (like 2013). With the auction system, teams can carry over points and bid aggressively in stronger draft classes, meaning no single draft year is disproportionately more valuable than another.\n\n*It could make the draft extremely exciting* â Imagine watching a draft where Cooper Flagg is up for auction and your team is bidding on them, not knowing who's going to win, as opposed to it being set in stone that the order of the picks will be and who likely will be taken with each pick.\n\n\n**Effects that this may have on draft strategy**\n\nYears where there's a generational talent coming up, teams might hoard draft picks to try and bid up on that talent.\n\nThere's still an incentive for bad teams to tank or to rebuild by accumulating additional draft points, but they don't have to cash those draft points in on a particular year.\n\nTypical auction draft strategies will come into play. Who puts what player up and in what order will affect the bidding.\n\nThere can be different bidding strategies, such as studs and duds.\n\nEach player will have an effective value in draft points. When players are making trades, you can trade draft points to quantify how much a team thinks a player is worth in draft points.\n\nThis removes the variability when you're trading for players. For example, when you trade for a 1st-round pick from another team, you're essentially hoping that that team fails or succeeds. Now that is a bet on that team's potential future success, but there's a strategy in that. But now you get to quantify what value you want to receive for a player without any variability.\n\n\n**Negatives of This System**\n\n*It's more complicated than a traditional draft order* â Casual fans may not understand what is happening and may be turned off by that.\n\n*It reduces the luck factor* â For better or worse, some teams are kind of hopeless and they just need luck to win a lottery pick and get a generational talent. It's in the interest of the league to have some aspect of luck so some teams at the bottom don't stay bad forever.\n\n*It could lead to an extremely imbalanced league* â For example, in this year, if a team like Oklahoma City were to stack a bunch of draft picks, they could theoretically add a young rookie like Cooper Flagg to their team and become an absolute dynasty.\n\n*The draft might take too long* â Anybody who's been in an auction draft knows that they can take a while, so this is risk. \n\n*You may have to structure the points in a way that it doesn't disincentivize making the playoffs* - As well as if your team that's in the playoffs it doesn't disincentivize dropping your seeding to accumulate more points- I don't want any drop-off in the points that might create these types of negative incentives to either not make the playoffs or to, if you're in the playoffs, to drop rank.\n\n*It'd be very difficult to institute such a drastic change at any point* - How would you make the switch to this format? It's possible but seems difficult. You'd have to have this change occur at some point in the future but enough time for teams to adjust for it and then considering teams have traded out picks seven years into the future it might have to be that far out into the future. \n\n*Teams May Still Tank* - Teams may still tank to get the small marginal benefit of moving down slots. Teams may still not try to make the playoffs to get more points. If you flatten the points too much then bad teams don't have a good way to improve. So we may still be stuck in the same situation. I still think it'd be good because it removes the luck around draft order. \n\n**Conclusion**\n\nWhat do you guys think? I think this could be a fun idea, but it would be very difficult to implement considering what the existing format is. Doubt that it would ever happen, but if you're reading this NBA, feel free to use the idea, but just give me credit, okay?",

First, there were threats on Ohio athletes, and now two high-profile Ohio professional athletes have been suspended by Major League Baseball as part of a âsports betting investigation,ââ DeWine said.\n\nâThe harm to athletes and the integrity of the game is clear, and the benefits are not worth the harm.

I call on the Casino Control Commission to correct this problem and remove all prop bets from the Ohio marketplace,â he said.\n\n[Source](https://www.richlandsource.com/2025/07/31/dewine-calls-on-casino-control-commission-to-remove-prop-bets/)",

      "text": "Kikuchi made a post on X two hours ago accusing Nikkan Sports, one of the biggest sports media in Japan, of lying to him and using him for their article on Shohei.\n\n[https://x.com/Yuseikikuchi16/status/1835943720518287425](https://x.com/Yuseikikuchi16/status/1835943720518287425)\n\nAccording to Kikuchi, someone from Nikkan Sports came to the US to interview him saying that they were doing a spread on their newspaper on Kikuchi. He didn't wanna just have a talk with someone who came all the way from Japan for him at the stadium, so he took the person to breakfast and talked to them for 2 hours and drove them back to the stadium on the day of a game for which he was supposed to start. Today he claimed that he found out that the \"special article\" about him was part of their weekly article on Shohei, a graduate of Hanamaki Higashi High School where Kikuchi also went to high school (please note that Kikuchi and Shohei's time at the high school didn't overlap as Kikuchi graduated before Shohei entered the HS). \n\nKikuchi says in his X post that he only talked about Shohei for about a minute during the 2-hour interview. He says that he is used to this kind of method employed on him. I guessed he is meaning to say that he is used to being used by media for his connection with Shohei because articles on Shohei gets clicks. Kikuchi says that trust is something you build over time and that he was reminded about the importance of players having their own platform not only to promote themselves so people will get to know him, but also \"protect\" themselves. Kikuchi ended his post with a note that there is no blame to be put on Shohei about this and he does want to play alongside of him wearing the Samurai Japan uniform.\n\n  \nIf what Kikuchi is saying is true, that he was lied to about the true intention of the interview, shame on Nikkan Sports for lying to Kikuchi and telling him that they were writing a special article on him when they were actually doing the interview for their article on Shohei. I reeky hope this is misunderstanding for Kikuchi's sake and there is a 6 page long spread about Kikuchi appearing on the newspaper tomorrow, because if not, Nikkan Sports needs to apologize for treating him in such a cruel way.",

      "text": "#TL;DR: We are no longer accepting content from X/Twitter with immediate effect. This will include both links and screenshots.\n\nDue to recent events and the rapid deterioration of the user experience, we have made the decision to ban all X/Twitter content from the r/baseball subreddit. We feel confident that breaking news and other share-worthy content can be found in other places with a better experience for users who come to r/baseball to browse as well as those who are hardcore users. This decision was not taken lightly as the discussion regarding X/Twitter has been going on for months, [our poll earlier this week](https://sh.reddit.com/r/baseball/comments/1i6l2mj/meta_poll_regarding_the_use_of_twitterx_on/) had thousands of users vote (over 70% in favor of a ban), and we have received tons of feedback directly from users through that poll and modmail.\n\nWhile we acknowledge that lots of our content currently comes from X, the origination of that content is often widespread. This includes sports media giants like ESPN to baseball-specific sites like MLBTR. We encourage all users who share content on this subreddit to find this original content and share it directly including articles, media, and breaking news.\n\nWe appreciate all the feedback we have been provided over the last few days and believe this is the correct decision based on what we have received. We encourage you to continue providing feedback over the next several weeks and months to help ensure we are getting the right content to r/baseball.\n\n---\n#Frequently Asked Questions\n##What is happening with MLB and the teams?\n* We've been in contact with the social media teams and they are working through their strategies. We expect to see lots of action very soon.\n\n##What about my favorite journalist or newsbreaker who only posts to X/Twitter?\n* We have been reaching out to top content producers and asking where their content can be found outside of Twitter. We encourage you all to do so as well.\n* Jeff Passan shared with us directly that all of his content can be found on a new Breaking News feed on ESPN. [Here is the feed](https://www.espn.com/contributor/jeff-passan). He confirmed with us that he does not have a Bluesky at this time.\n* Baseball journalists are flocking to other sites like Bluesky everyday. The list is growing by the hour and many of the journalists have places where their content outside of social media (like Passan's above feed).\n* Sites like MLBTR and MLB.com post breaking news directly to their site and we strongly encourage the use of these two sites and others like them.\n\n##Why aren't screenshots allowed?\n* Banning X/Twitter but still allowing the content in another form doesn't drive action from the larger baseball community (i.e. no motivation for anyone to change their behavior).\n* The ability to create a high quality fake of a tweet is too easy right now. We have had many instances of fake screenshots (that resulted in bans) even before this rule and we believe this would increase.\n* Our rules currently do not allow for screenshots or screen recordings and we felt the continuity of that rule made more sense rather than changing that rule completely.\n\n##What happens if I forget and try to post a link to X/Twitter?\n* We will be utilizing automod to help encourage finding that content elsewhere. You should get a message immediately from automod suggesting ways to alter or change your post to align with the rules of r/baseball.\n* We also plan to enhance our Posting Guidelines to help you BEFORE you hit submit to help save time and effort.\n\n##How much content has come from X/Twitter?\n* In 2024, X/Twitter content tracked at approximately 20% with larger spikes around the trade deadline (max of 35% during 1 week).\n\n##What if I don't have Bluesky but want to start using it? Can I find the same content?\n* Many users on Bluesky have created \"[Starter Packs](https://bsky.social/about/blog/06-26-2024-starter-packs)\" which suggest accounts to follow. There are many good Starter Packs and [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/baseball/comments/1i90wm4/meta_rbaseball_will_no_longer_permit_the_posting/m8y1pd5/) we have linked several that cover a wide range of the baseball industry.\n* You can [follow us on Bluesky](https://bsky.app/profile/baseballreddit.bsky.social) and we can help you find profiles to follow.\n\n##What if this is awful and we all hate it?\n* If this doesn't go as planned, we will change to make it right. Please continue to tell us how you feel in the coming weeks and months.",

      "text": "Iâve always been curious about why the MLB Draft feels way more hit-or-miss than the NFL or NBA drafts. Obviously, baseballâs farm system makes things more complicated, and player development takes longer, but it seems like even first-round picks have a much higher chance of not panning out compared to other sports.\n\nIs it just the sheer number of rounds and prospects? The difficulty of projecting high school players versus college players? The fact that minor league development can be so unpredictable? It feels like in football and basketball, if youâre a top pick, thereâs a decent chance youâll at least be a solid pro. But in baseball, you see first-rounders fizzle out all the time, while late-round picks can turn into superstars.\n\nWould love to hear thoughts from people who follow the draft closelyâwhat makes scouting and drafting in baseball such a crapshoot?",

Jokic, SGA, Tatum, LeBron, Giannis, and more could argue theyâre the best on any given night. \n\nIn the NFL, Iâm not even sure who is considered the best in the game right now. Mahomes had a meh year, Burrow couldnât even lead the Bengals to the playoffs, and Jalen Hurts is not respected on that level. \n\nI donât know much about hockey, maybe Mcdavid challenges Judge here?\n\nYes, Ohtani exists, but this year he hasnât pitched yet and he is simply not hitting at Judgeâs level.",

The physicality of football may make it more physically taxing, but even Deion was of the opinion that baseball was the harder sport. Weâve also seen more 2-way football players, as the skills are more transferable from position to position. Being a great outfielder and hitter doesnât mean youâd be any good at pitching, but if youâre a good WR, you could probably hold your own at CB, even if youâd be bad at the NFL level.\n\nEdit: Iâm not trying to compare the players. Ohtani has won multiple MVPs at the top of his sport, Hunter has been a great college player, but heâs not close to being in that realm yet.",

      "text": "I've never really watched baseball. It was all about football, hockey and basketball. The problem with that is every summer after the Stanley cup finals I have no more sports to watch until the fall. So this season I decided to give watching baseball a shot and so far, I've been loving it. I figured I'd share some things I've noticed as a new fan following baseball for the first time.\n\n1. I love the legends and lore. The fact that all the parks are different in terms of shape and size is so cool to me. Seeing a video on my feed about it is actually what piqued my interest in staring to watch baseball. It gives the game character, it makes traveling to play other teams mean more than a change of fans and weather.\n2. I love the culture of bench clearing and the managers being on field. In hockey the players get to fight but in baseball the management gets so come out and cuss out the refs before getting thrown out, it's great. Gets me and it seems like the players, fired up like a hockey fight does.\n3. I don't love how serious certain things are taken. This seems like its mostly about the announcers and fans though. Too many things are seen as \"disrespectful\". Why was it so wrong to bring a broom out on the broadcast after the jays swept the Yankees? Why would flipping a bat ever be something to be mad about? Seems foreign to me, I love seeing the showboating and trash talk.\n4. I had no idea teams used so many pitchers. I understand that it's to keep guy's arms from wearing out, but It's a bit of a bummer that you don't get to see your favorite pitcher as often as you do your favorite position players. I wish I could see Kikuchi more.\n5. I love how many games there are. One thing I always loved about hockey and basketball was that it had so many more games than football. Baseball has even more. (5.5) It seems like that also makes wins (and losses) a little less important. Something interesting I noticed was that once a team starts to lose bad they kind of \"give up\" and they stop using their good pitchers and everyone looks like they are just trying to get home and rest up for the next one. In football there's a \"leave it all on the field\" attitude that I was used to. It was weird to see a team \"give up\" but I understand why. You have a better chance to win tomorrow if you don't burn yourself out on a blowout game today.\n6. I love the tension that can build in baseball. When the bases get loaded. When there's a chance at a come back walk off win. When the ball is flying out and you're waiting to see if it's a homerun.\n7. I love the fact that there is series all year long. It was something I was used to only seeing in the post season. I think it's a much better gauge on which team is \"better\" rather than just a few games or less throughout a season, spread out over multiple months.\n8. I don't know why robo umps aren't already a thing. It was cool to see the ABS used at the all star game and it seems like much fairer way to call a game. Hopefully in a few years it can be used for every call. It doesn't feel good to win or lose due to bad calls.\n9. I like that there's no time clock. It's cool to not have that restriction. I like the idea of a team being able to stay out and score for as long as they can hit.\n10. Home jerseys are white?!\n11. Wtf do you mean baseball go farther in the day time?\n12. I love that they got big bodies in the sport. Watching players like Alejandro Kirk gets me hyped. It's like watching the defensive lineman catch an interception and run down the field whenever he gets on base. It's great.\n13. I still cannot comprehend how pitchers can make pitches move so much in the air. It was so cool the first time I saw a batter flinch like they were about to get hit only for it to be a strike. It doesn't come across on TV as much but you can really tell by the batter's reaction.\n14. I still can't comprehend for batters can hit those pitches. It's so crazy how they can tell if it's going to be a strike or a ball while also knowing where to swing at it. Seems like it would be impossible but they do it with a surprising amount of consistency.\n15. There are a lot of different stats and some of them are kind of confusing to understand. I still don't get what OPS is I just know that the closer it is to .300 the better. (Apparently I was thinking about batting average...)\n\nAnyway that's just some things I've picked up in my short time of following baseball this season. It's a really cool sport and I'm glad I gave it a shot this year after thinking it was \"too boring\" my whole life. I went to my first MLB game earlier this month to see the Angels get beat by the Blue Jays, it was a blast. I can't wait to see more.",

      "text": "Hello all!\n\nIâm visiting Spokane from the UK, and as part of my trip I thought Iâd check out a baseball game as itâs a sport that Iâve always had a passing interest in - perhaps itâs my inner fan of The Warriors movie. I booked tickets to see the Spokane Indians play the Eugene Emeralds at Avista Stadium in Spokane. It wasnât much money, and I figured that at the very least Iâd see the fireworks afterwards even if I didnât enjoy the game.\n\nWhat I experienced was a wonderfully enjoyable and wholesome time. Apparently the game was pretty slow by usual standards, but I found it exhilarating. Baseball seemed quite complex on the surface, but with the help of my friend and his family explaining the rules I found myself getting really immersed into the experience and feeling some of the highs and lows as the match played out. Even though the Indians lost I was absolutely blown away by the experience, and the fireworks afterwards were just phenomenal. Americans know how to get down when it comes to sports, and the ceremonies and traditions run deep in a way that you should be proud of. \n\nI even managed to buy a jersey. Itâll be very comfortable in summer!\n\nI think what made the experience so great was the atmosphere. Mascots, enthusiastic fans of all ages, the slight but present risk of getting your head smushed by an errant ball, demoralising chants from the fans, perfectly mild weather and the glow of enjoying a new sport all came together in such a phenomenally peaceful and calming yet exciting way. I am used to the atmosphere of English football matches - the tension in the air at those games is always palpable, and years of football hooliganism and the culture surrounding the âfirmsâ has meant that there have always been some quite strict measures in place to prevent violence. Fans of the teams are segregated for one, and you can see cross sections of society get absolutely blue in the face at complete strangers when their team loses. I have heard stories of fans of my local team (grown men, mind you) throwing glass bottles at children who support the opposing team, and I must say that I was expecting some of this from the crowd. Nothing even close happened. Iâm sure it goes in at some games, and Iâm sure tensions and emotions run high as they do with every sport, but everyone was friendly, courteous and seemed to be enjoying themselves.\n\nIf anyone has any suggestions for matches that I can stream Iâd love to hear it, even if I have to pay. Once I recover a bit more from a recent injury Iâm going to contact my local team and see about playing with them. I absolutely loved my experience and I want to do it again!",

Part of it (at least IMO) is because he didn't end up getting traded to a contender at the deadline.\n\nThat got me wondering, what are some other 40 home run seasons in recent memory that might make you say \"oh yeah, I forgot that he hit 40+ bombs that year\"?",

      "title": "What if the Dodgers never left Brooklyn? An alternate timeline thought experiment I've been working on.",
      "text": "This got asked in an alternate history sub the other day and I've spent... way too long working on it. I figured it'd get enjoyed much more over here.\n\n**1954** *A very large hat tip to /u/oogieball and /u/onlyhalfrobot for pointing out a major fly in the ointment that we'll resolve here.* The Eisenhower Administration sets up an early version of what would, in the Johnson Administration, become the Department of Housing and Urban Development, and tap Robert Moses to help run it. This takes him out of New York City politics for the rest of the 1950s.\n\n**1955**: The Dodgers are fresh off winning their first World Series. Walter O'Malley is interested in a new stadium. While the city of Los Angeles makes a strong pitch to lure the Dodgers out west, he manages to use that as leverage to get funding for a new, domed stadium he's been dreaming of. The DodgerDome will open in 1958 and quickly be dubbed the 8th Wonder of the World. Most of the stadiums that open in the 60s and 70s will draw inspiration from it (no concrete multi-purpose donuts in this timeline). LA pivots, courting both the Giants and the Senators. However, both leagues put finding a second team in the same league that will *also* move to California as a condition of any move to Los Angeles, and there are no other suitable candidates. For now, both teams stay put, though they each begin looking at alternatives.\n\n**1960**: The Giants attendance continues to plummet, as the Yankees are as popular as ever and the Dodgers, fresh off another World Series championship and drawing tremendous crowds in their new stadium, push the Giants squarely in to third string status in New York. To make matters worse, the Polo Grounds are in serious disrepair. Horace Stoneham has been unable to convince any other National League owners to move to California, so he decides to move to Minneapolis, where the Giants minor league team is located, along with a much more modern stadium. The Giants will find reasonable success in Minnesota, and Willie Mays remains popular there to this day. By the late 60s, they've also adopted Paul Bunyan and Babe the Blue Ox as mascots; when CityConnect uniforms are rolled out, the Giants are lumberjack themed. **A few people have raised concerns that waiting until 1960 is a bit too long for Stoneham and the Giants. I concur - we'll bring that back to 1958, maybe 1957 at the earliest.**\n\n**1961**: Meanwhile, Senators owner Calvin Griffith has been exploring options as well. He had inquired about Minneapolis but was blocked by the Giants, and has been heavily courted by Houston, which has begun construction of the HoustonDome, modeled after the DodgerDome. Los Angeles has also continued to be in contact. He had been in discussion of such a move with Arnold Johnson, owner of the A's, who had moved to Kansas City only a few years prior and still weren't drawing all that well. The plan is that the A's will move to San Francisco while the Senators go to LA; Griffith is still hammering out details on a stadium deal with LA, and is trying to wring every concession he can from the city. However, when Johnson dies in early 1960, Charlie Finley buys the Athletics and quickly enters into a deal with the city of Los Angeles. San Francisco offers Griffith the deal they were going to give the A's. Griffith is livid and refuses to move to San Francisco. Finley refuses to stay in Kansas City or to take the San Fran deal. The American League reaches an agreement wherein Finley gets to move the A's to LA, Griffith moves the Senators to Houston and receives additional funds from the sale of an expansion franchise that will be located in Washington to replace the Senators, and a second expansion franchise is located in San Francisco under more or less the terms of the deal that Johnson had negotiated. Griffith renames his team the Cowboys, though they're quickly renamed the Rockets due to the growing fascination with the space program located in the Houston area. The San Francisco team takes the name of the Seals, and taps Joe DiMaggio as their first manager to stir up local interest. Finley keeps the Athletics name.\n\n*A very big tip of the cap here to /u/SuperCareer5230 , who brings up the Continental Leauge - a proposed third Major League at about this time which would have established teams in several major markets that lacked AL and NL teams, and operated as a third Major League. It was proposed by William Shea, immediately after the Dodgers and Giants left for California. In this timeline, it still exists, and is represented in Denver, Houston, Dallas, Atlanta, San Francisco, Los Angeles, Buffalo and Toronto. Finley is one of the investors, and has the Los Angeles franchise.*\n\n*When he manages to acquire the A's, he announces his plan to move them to Los Angeles, where he already has a preliminary stadium agreement in place pending the creation of the Continental League. The AL says \"No, not unless another team goes with you.\" Griffith says \"Over my dead body!\" Finley says \"Listen, it's my team, and they're playing in LA next year. They're either an American League team or a Continental League team, but the players are under contract and I'm paying them.\" The AL is going to be a team short and MLB's anti-trust exemption is about to get challenged. Griffith threatens to sue LA, Finley, and the AL over breach of contract on deals he was in regarding the move. The AL says \"Cal, please just go to San Fran.\" He says no. Finley says \"Well, I'll throw you guys a rope. I've got a friend who's ready to go on the SF franchise for the Continental League. He'd buy in to the American League. Why don't you expand?\" The AL thinks about it and says... ok. Griffith is even angrier because now he can't go to California at all. The AL says \"Fine. Pick anywhere else that's still available.\" He takes Houston but still wants to sue Finley. The settlement is that they'll also sell an expansion slot for Washington to replace the Senators, with Griffith getting those funds to make up for losing LA.*\n\nUltimately, Finley and Los Angeles are a match made in heaven. He's a natural showman and is able to use Los Angeles as a gigantic stage. While the A's are moribund in the early 1960s, Finley focuses on promotions and putting on a show in LA and still draws record crowds even for a bad team; as the they start developing stars in the latter part of the decade and build a dynasty in the early 1970s, winning three World Series, they draw even more. When free agency dawns, the A's have the resources to be a major player, retaining their stars and bringing in even more.\n\nThe Rockets, for their part, also do extremely will in Houston, far better than they did in Washington, with young slugger Harmon Killebrew leading the way early. They don't have the immediate success the A's do, but they'll have several runs of being a competitive team over the next few decades, with a few World Series appearances and a championship or two to show for it.\n\nAs for our expansion teams, both struggle. The San Francisco team at least develops a sizable fanbase early and becomes quite popular, though they're a bit second-fiddle to the A's in California. The Senators are *bad* and don't draw particularly well at all.\n\n**1962**: The National League quickly follows suit. Part of the deal Finley struck with Los Angeles allows a second Los Angeles franchise to use the stadiium for five years. The NL places one team in Los Angeles, naming them the Angels, and the second in San Diego, the Padres. Seeking a similar boost the DiMaggio gave the Seals, the Padres reach out to recently retired Ted Williams to manage the team. As with the AL expansion teams, we see some immediate struggles - expansion teams with no free agency were in BAD shape.\n\n**1968**: The Braves move to Atlanta a few years later than the original timeline, due to some delays with what will become Braves Stadium, which in this timeline is a domed stadium that never hosts the Falcons. Additional funding is needed to build two stadiums, and the Falcons' is built first. But this is basically the same as the original timeline Braves... with the one exception that Eddie Mathews does *not* end up playing for the team in all three cities. Little oddities all over the place.\n\n**1969**: A second round of expansion. The Montreal Expos join the National League, as do the Texas Rangers, based in Dallas - Houston has been a major success in the American League and the NL wants a counterpart franchise. In the American League, Seattle gets the Pilots, and Toronto gets the Blue Jays - and notably, all four teams have domed stadiums here as well. The Pilots never leave Seattle. Kansas City is considered during this round, but due to their very short tenure as a Major League city and the presence of a domed stadium in Toronto, they're passed up for now.\n\n**1975**: The Orioles, despite four World Series trips and two rings in the past decade, consistently finish in the bottom half of the AL in attendance. Memorial Stadium is considered particularly undesirable - one of the few stadiums being used for both baseball *and* football, it is not domed and feels outdated. The city of Baltimore has been unwilling to provide funding for a new stadium. The team moves to Denver, which provides the new stadium they seek, becoming the Denver Mountaineers. That works out great for them - they've got a very competitive team, a new stadium and a market that is ready for a baseball team. Jim Palmer *doesn't* win the next two Cy Youngs (sorry, Jim), but the really good Baltimore pitching is still really good, and three run homers are easier to come by in Denver.\n\n**1976**: Hot on the Orioles heels, the second iteration of the Washington Senators bolt for Milwaukee, which has unveiled a revolutionary new design - a retractable roof stadium that teams throughout the league envy. It kicks off a new wave of stadium renovations and new stadium builds. They rename themselves the Brewers. It's a middling success - great fanbase, lousy team. They eventually get the wheels on, though, and have a good run in the late 80s and early 90s.\n\n**1983**: In the aftermath of the 1981 strike, MLB expands once again. The American League returns to Kansas City with the Royals - the Cardinals have been holding up expansion to Kansas City for several years but agree in exchange for a number of key concessions, finally. They also add a new team in Jacksonville, the Jaguars. The National League adds a team in Phoenix, the Firebirds. The NL also puts a replacement team in Baltimore, the Ravens. After losing the Orioles, Baltimore took steps to replace Memorial Stadium with a retractable roof baseball stadium at Camden Yards, as well as building a new stadium for the NFL's Colts to insure they wouldn't leave town.\n\nRealistically, we probably have another round of expansion around 1998-2000ish (similar to our timeline), but I'm not sold on where those teams go yet. If you got through **all of the above** and want to make some suggestions, go for it! Right now, I'm leaning towards Vancouver for the NL (the Mounties?) and Albuquerque for the AL (the Dukes?), with Montreal also relocatin at about the same time (Likely still to Washington, but possibly to Florida, which at this point only has Jacksonville). And if it's Albuquerque, I imagine they'd be a prime candidate for a move around 2025ish (which is, of course, likely to Las Vegas).\n\n\n---\n\nSome random oddities with this timeline!\n\n* Neither Willie Mays nor Hank Aaron ever get that Homecoming story arc at the end of their careers (Willie with the Mets, Hank with the Brewers in the original timeline).\n* Eddie Mathews doesn't end up playing for the Braves in all three cities.\n* Bill Buckner is still remembered by Cubs and Dodgers fans (he had 2700 hits!), and Red Sox fans remember him as being on the team that won it all in 1986 against the Phillies.\n* On the other hand, Cubs fans have *never* heard of Steve Bartman.\n* Tom Seaver ends up on the Phillies in this timeline, forming a duo with Steve Carlton in the '70s. The 1970s Phillies are *really* good and win two World Series. They don't win in 1980, though. (I'm a Mets fan. Yes, I absolutely hate all of this, but it's probably the most likely outcome)\n* I absolutely love the idea that the Minnesota Giants would have Lumberjack-themed CityConnect uniforms. Just as a palate cleanser for that last one.\n* The 2000 movie *Frequency* starring Dennis Quaid never gets made. \n* The 2002 movie *The Rookie* starring Dennis Quaid also never gets made. I'm not dunking on the guy, I actually like both of these. But we've got no Mets and no Rays.\n* Since the Pilots aren't a weird historical footnote, *Ball Four* by Jim Bouton probably never gains cult classic status. So you've probably never heard of Jim Bouton. (Side note, if you've *actually* never heard of Jim Bouton or *Ball Four*, give it a read this winter. We're getting recursive in here now)\n* Casey Stengel is remembered as a Hall of Fame manager for the Yankees, but we don't get any sort of \"Crazy/funny grandpa\" energy from his years with the Mets. He doesn't manage again after the 1960 World Series.\n* Cal Ripken in Denver for his full career? Over-under on 600 homers?\n* The Colts staying in Baltimore is one of the funniest things I ran in to while writing this, just as the natural evolution of all the other dominos. However, the original Cleveland Browns *do* still end up moving, and Indianapolis *does* end up getting a team in some sort of deckchair shuffling... my guess is that maybe the *NFL* Jacksonville Jaguars end up not existing in this timeline, that franchise is given to Indianapolis in 1995, and Cleveland then moves to Jacksonville in 1996 after Jacksonville misses out on an expansion team the prior year?",

      "text": "**Hey Sportsfans** â it's time for **Week 18** of\nr/baseball Power Rankings: Please enjoy this abnormal week as we all rest for our personal All-Star Break. \n\nThis week -- for the fourth year in a row -- we ranked the 30 MLB teams based off how much we liked them in an attempt to identify, in an unserious manner, the collective voter bias.\n\nWe do this for four reasons:\n\n* It's fun and it's time for a break\n\n* To give the proper ranks a higher chance to shake up\n\n* Ranking based off a mere 3 games would otherwise be a waste of time\n\n* To identify our \"bias\" and see how it changes year to year.\n\n*If you take this overly seriously you will be asked to sit in the corner.*\n________________________________\n\n**TRANSPARENCY**: [This link](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1wCMM-tVJi2wm-jplK6DIhyhh3UzO-rraVGoN14Fa-WI/edit?usp=sharing) will show you who voted each team where and has added neat statistics!\n\n\n____________________________\n\nThe delta change refers to last year's bias vote.\n_______________________________________\n\nIf something is a little messed up, feel free to ~~pester me~~ let me know.\n\nTotal Votes: **28** of 30.\n\n______________________________________\n\\#||Team|Î|Comment|Record\n--: |:--| :-- | :--: | :--: | :--\n**1**|[Detroit Tigers](#f/det)|**Tigers**|**+9**| Pretty simple for the 2nd and 3rd spots: grew up listening and watching Vin Scully call Dodger games and Wrigley Field is an annual summer homestand visit.  |**60-40**\n**2**|[Seattle Mariners](#f/sea)|**Mariners**|**0**| BIG DUMPER IS YOUR HOME RUN DERBY CHAMPION! That plus a series victory against the Astros has made for a nice week. *Next up: 3 vs. Milwaukee Beers, 4 @ Angles* |**53-46**\n**3**|[Milwaukee Brewers](#f/mil)|**Brewers**|**+3**|  |**59-40**\n**4**|[Baltimore Orioles](#f/bal)|**Orioles**|**-3**| Bias week is always fun and gives us an opportunity to show everyone who we really despise. It could be for a myriad of reasons or just one simple thing. My hatred of the Yankees peaked in 1996 when Jeffrey Maier reached over the fence and stole a ball for a home run, which in turn changed the series against the Orioles. The Orioles team that year was insane and possibly was their best chance to win a World Series since 1983. Yet one stupid kid ruined it all. F the Yankees. |**44-54**\n**5**|[Chicago Cubs](#f/chc)|**Cubs**|**+10???**| The Brewers stealing the Cardinal's devil magic is an extremely annoying bit. |**59-40**\n**6**|[Cincinnati Reds](#f/cin)|**Reds**|**+7**| So I just recently rewatched Airbud on my flight back home from vacation, there wasnât many things to do for the 3 hours in the air so I just found a random movie and watched it, and it was Airbud. Then, just out of nowhere, I saw in the recommendations that there is another Airbud movie where he plays baseball. Like what? How? Okay so I added that to my watchlist and then more recommendations popped up, and I shit you not after counting, there are **14** Airbud movies. About halfway through they just stop being about Airbud and become about Airbudâs puppies, and that series continues for like 5 movies. That includes movies where they go skiing, meet Santa Claus, and GO TO SPACE. And trust me, the lore goes pretty hard. The first sequel, Golden Receiver, has Buddy play football and also has main antagonists be Russian kidnappers. This is already a huge shift in the lore, as we now know Buddy is a multi-sport animal. He is proficient in more than one sport. Now big things happen in the next movie World Pup, where Buddy plays soccer and, more importantly, fathers a litter of puppies with a dog named Molly. This is what sets up the next phase of the franchise, it was set up all the way back here. By the time of Seventh Inning Fetch and Spikes Back, Buddy is getting involved with kidnapping plots and DNA experiments as scientists attempt to clone Buddy, now remember this, itâs important for later write this part down. See what these films are doing are reinforcing the idea that Buddy is more than just a talented dog, heâs a genetically superior being. Buddy is a literal super being. With Spikes Back, Buddy plays volleyball while foiling a jewel heist, showcasing the dual roles he now fills as both sports star and dog detective. This is called character layering. Now after Buddy retires from sports, the next phase of the franchise begins with Air Buddies in 2006. Budderball, B-Dawg, Buddha, Mudbud, and Rosebud all become the main characters, and now the dogs can all speak aloud. Now this isnât explained, but we can infer that possibly it was evolutionary speech activation due to our knowledge of Buddy being targeted for DNA and cloning experiments. I told you that part would be important. This is what we have to assume based on existing evidence. From this point on in the franchise, the Buddies become adventurers, encountering talking animals, ancient artifacts, ghosts, aliens, and magical beings all over the planet. The lore of this franchise confirms that everything our government has tried to hide from us exists. Aliens, the existence of magic, and ghosts and all types of inter dimensional beings, all confirmed within the Air Buddies franchise. Trust me, we can go deeper. I havenât even gotten into the sub franchise within the sub franchise. Santa Paws (yes these franchises are connected) confirms the existence of Santa Claus and alternate parallel realities and the fact that the Christmas spirit is a quantifiable energy source. The Air Bud Cinematic Universe is essentially a blueprint for a unified theory of magic, sports, and canine cosmology. I have now spent the entire all star break watching all 14 Airbud movies because baseball is on a break. Fuck all of you.   |**52-48**\n**7**|[San Diego Padres](#f/sdp)|**Padres**|**-4**| On my soapbox for all-star break rankings: I'm going to genuinely miss the current city connects we have. I really hope they keep it fun and colorful, rather than some throwback, or a low-effort jersey, like the Padres in black and white. I really hope Ethan Salas turns into the franchise catcher. He's had some injury setbacks since reaching AA, he's only 19 so there's plenty of time. I just never remember the Padres having a good catcher in my time as a fan. Also, it seems like the Pads always have a grand 'ol time when playing the Nats.  |**54-45**\n**8**|[Arizona Diamondbacks](#f/ari)|**D-Backs**|**-3**| I can't speak for all D-backs fans, but I find myself in this weird spot where I realistically don't think this team has the pitching (especially the bullpen) to make the playoffs, let alone make noise in the playoffs, but I am still rooting for the players because they want to right the ship and win. Geno might be the biggest trade piece at the deadline, but he has thus far refused to make himself available because he keeps propelling the team to wins. I am resigned to whatever happens, I guess, but I wish the team would rip the bandage off if we're going to have to be sellers.  |**50-50**\n**9**|[Pittsburgh Pirates](#f/pit)|**Pirates**|**-1**| In the Great Billionaire Retribution of 2034, Bob Nutting will be one of the first against the wall.   |**39-61**\n**10**|[Cleveland Guardians](#f/cle)|**Guardians**|**-6**| My top five: Guardians because duh, Reds because Ohio, Cubs because of family connections, Nationals because I worked at a camp in the DC area for three years, Rockies because I like purple. My bottom five: Astros because they managed to embrace and deny cheating at the same time, Red Sox because you don't forget your first sports heartbreak, Cardinals because the best fans in baseball thing is stupid, Giants because their fans act like Bitchgarner is the GOAT when he just got hot at the best possible time one October, and Yankees for obvious reasons. |**48-50**\n**11**|[Tampa Bay Rays](#f/tbr)|**Rays**|**0**| [real](https://imgur.com/pxliJkm) |**52-48**\n**12**|[Colorado Rockies](#f/col)|**Rockies**|**+2**| Part of me thought about ranking the Rockies 30th, because that describes how I feel about this season pretty well. But they've been competitive these last two months or so, have played some fun games, the guys seem to still be trying, etc. And there's not a chance that my bias would allow me to rank anyone but the Dodgers at 30.  |**24-75**\n**13**|[Minnesota Twins](#f/min)|**Twins**|**0**| These are the gladdest of possible words:   \"Correa to Clemens to France.\"   A trio of Twinkies and fleetest of birds,   \"Correa and Clemens and France.\"   Okay...so their fielding is hardly sublime,   They can't ever get the ball 'round them in time,   Our first baseman's surname just happens to rhyme,   With \"Tinker to Evers to Chance.\" |**48-51**\n**14**|[Toronto Blue Jays](#f/tor)|**Blue Jays**|**-7**| My son came early this week. He's currently on my chest while I watch Toronto on the way to sweeping the Giants and extending our 1st place lead. I will raise this boy to cheer on the Blue Jays and hate the Yankees like a good human being. |**58-41**\n**15**|[Los Angeles Angels](#f/laa) |**Angels**|**+3**| Red Sox and Yankees are the Family Guy cutaway of Jake and Maggie Gyllenhaal. |**49-50**\n**16**|[Washington Nationals](#f/wsh)|**Nationals**|**+1**| Bias week allowed me to really reflect on my baseball fandom and it's interesting to see how I've become a more avid baseball watcher as an adult but at the same time I've grown less passionate about the sport? Of course the 5 straight losing seasons has done a number on my Natitude, but I think experiencing the lows on some tough seasons with a lot more knowledge about how the franchise as a whole is doing has given me a new perspective I didn't have as a kid. The losses don't bother me nearly as much as they used to and I don't get as elated with wins anymore. Maybe that's because we're not playing \"meaningful\" baseball at the bottom of the standings but maybe that's just life, ya know? Baseball hatred is definitely a nurture over nature thing though because I did not care about other teams growing up, but as an adult I've learned who the opps are for sure. |**39-60**\n**17**|[Oakland Athletics](#f/oak)|**Athletics**|**-1**| Brent Rooker may not have won the Home Run Derby, but he won All-Star weekend in my heart. Shorted two balls and outed over inches, Rooker still launched 17 home runs in the derby. Rooker also pinch hit a three-run home run in the All-Star game, and added two more in the first ever All-Star swing off. On top of that, Rooker had another common W in response to a \"fan\" upset over media showing Rooker feeding one of his children during the derby, \"Yes, it was necessary to feed my 11 month old child her night time bottle at like 9:00 pm. Thank you for asking.\" My favorite Brent Rooker baseball card comes from 2024 Topps Series 1 and Sapphire. The play that made the card was Rooker's first MLB walk off Home Run from May 12th, 2023 against the Texas Rangers. It features Rooker celebrating with the helmet toss coming to home plate with \"Oakland\" across his chest. |**42-59**\n**18**|[Kansas City Royals](#f/kcr)|**Royals**|**-9**|  |**48-52**\n**19**|[Texas Rangers](#f/tex)|**Rangers**|**+3**| Back to being a .500 ball club, neat even though it only took 7 tries but they finally won a game to get them to a .500 record. Will be interesting to see how the 2nd half goes, the offense seems to be finally fidning its groove but the pitching is still needing to hold it together. |**50-50**\n**20**|[New York Mets](#f/nym)|**Mets**|**+3**| Please don't make me tell you who I rooted for in the 2009 World Series. I was 14 and had never met a Philadelphian in my life, while simultaneously having to deal with a high school full of stereotypical Staten Island Yankees fans. |**56-44**\n**21**|[Chicago White Sox](#f/cws)|**White Sox**|**+4**| SWEEP WATCH is officially over. The White Sox swept the Pirates in the first series after the break, so they can at least get that monkey off their back. Luis Robert Jr. is showing signs of life in a hope to finally get traded off this team. It would just be nice to watch something resembling good baseball in the second half. |**35-65**\n**22**|[Atlanta Braves](#f/atl)|**Braves**|**-2**| The Braves have been painful to watch. Sure, we've had some injuries, but that excuse only goes so far. But hey, it could be worse. We could be Mets fans, waiting for the inevitable late summer collapse. It has happened so many times that the term âMettingâ was suggested to me by ChatGPT when I asked it to summarize the 2025 MLB season so far. Or even worse, we could be Astros fans. Clinging to their trash-can title and backed by the most insufferable fanbase in sports (yes, worse than Philly). The Braves are underachieving, but at least we're not them. Now please, win some games before I start following Banana Ball instead. The Party Animals at least look like they are having fun. |**43-55**\n**Tied-22**|[Miami Marlins](#f/mia)|**Marlins**|**-4**| Some of these rankings probably need a little context. Rangers: Iâve lived in Texas over 20 years and grew up going to probably well over 100 of their AAA games- watched a ton of those guys come up. Itâs fun rooting for familiar faces. Athletics: Best color scheme in baseball, Moneyball was a great read, every Oaklander Iâve met has ruled, and Iâve always had a soft spot for underdogs. Orioles: Hate Baltimore. Blue Jays: Hate Canada. Rays: Iâm a Miami boy, soooooâ¦ Braves: Self-explanatory. Astros: I live among these people now. Scandal or not, my feelings were set long before trash cans entered the chat. That fanbase is abrasive- fight me. As for the break itself: I threw a Home Run Derby party, got rocked in my menâs softball league (still had a blast), stayed up for the ASG (Kyle Stowers hitting a bomb in the swing-off was chefâs kiss), hit up an AUSL softball game in Round Rock, watched Stowers again ascend to godhood against the Royals, played catch on the beach with my wife and daughters, and capped it all with a Blue Wahoos game in Pensacola. Elite week for bat-and-ball sports in my life. |**46-52**\n**24**|[Philadelphia Phillies](#f/phi)|**Phillies**|**0**| Last year my worst nightmare happened as the Phillies lost to the Mets in the postseason as fairly heavy favorites. Interestingly enough, I still don't have nearly the same hatred I do for this team's current stars compared to the mid-late 2000s teams, even though the Phillies beat them in the important games then. Chalk that up to the purer feelings of hatred in my childhood self. I will say I do hate Edwin Diaz and it brings me joy every time he struggles on the mound against the Phillies. If anything, I'm most upset at Devin Williams for collapsing against them in Game 3. Regardless, my hatred for the Mets is still way stronger than any other team in any other sport, and I don't see that changing any time soon. |**56-43**\n**25**|[San Francisco Giants](#f/sfg)|**Giants**|**-4**| Many of my ranks reflect some standard Giants fan thinking, but, when it gets into the more ambiguous teams, you'll find some weirdness. Like, I'll always support the Pirates because they were my first team, and the Orioles were my Aunt's, the Braves because I loved Maddux, etc. The A's regularly held down the 2nd or 3rd spot, but FJF. The Cardinals, for example, are largelt disliked by older Giants fans but I struggle to care when they've been crushed in every Pac Bell playoff series. Some teamss like the Mets, Marlins, and Angels are punished for similar reasons. The middle ranks are largely filled with teams I rarely think about at all. LET'S GO GIANTS! |**52-48**\n**26**|[St. Louis Cardinals](#f/stl)|**Cardinals**|**+2**| See baseball should be about fun. Friends and fun. If you're not having fun, there's no reason to watch. Like, we all gotta stop complaining all the time. Just as a society you know? Positivity is just a small step away for all of us. Is your team bad? Sure. So is mine though and we could just have fun and be friends and watch ball. After all, wasn't that the whole point of the game in the first place? Idk man, it's just my two cents. Go about your life however you see fit and all that, but let's just likeâ¦ have fun ya know? Like for half a season let's all just have fun. No complaining. Unless your a fan of like a handful of teams whose owners just don't care, then yeah you can complain about them, but like still come have fun with the rest of us. Just because your owner is bad, doesn't mean you personally shouldn't have fun. Just please let's have fun. |**51-49**\n**27**|[Los Angeles Dodgers](#f/lad)|**Dodgers**|**-1**| I don't know what's happening anymore. The dodgers are having a stretch of games where they are negative? It's nice to look at the Rockies for a comparison to keep things in perspective, but even they were winning this week. Whatever, it's the bias vote so I'm keeping the dodgers number 1. I'm sure we'll be near the bottom this week if not in last. I want the early April Dodgers back, I want mookie back to form, and I want to launch our defense into the Sun.  |**58-42**\n**28**|[Boston Red Sox](#f/bos)|**Red Sox**|**-1**| Please just win enough games into the ASB so that we buy. |**54-47**\n**29**|[Houston Astros](#f/hou)|**Astros**|**0**| [FTR](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WIgG9HY-nzA&t=3s) & keep booing, it just fuels the little guy |**57-42**\n**30**|[New York Yankees](#f/nyy)|**Yankees**|**0**| If you vote the Astros ahead of the Yankees this week, you have what John Mulaney's dad described as \"the moral backbone of a chocolate eclair\". Oh well, 30 is only three spots away from 27. |**55-44**",

      "title": "I've seen the argument many times that the NFL with a cap/floor system gets a higher percentage of revenue as player compensation than MLB. This is objectively false.",
      "text": "With the crazy amount of cap/floor threads recently, I've seen it thrown out multiple times that the NFL has a guaranteed 48% share of revenue going to the players while MLB is around 45-46%, so a cap/floor system gives more money to the players.  This is wrong for a number of reasons.  \n\nFirst the NFL.  \n\nThe NFL CBA says the cap/floor is set so players are guaranteed 48.8% of revenue.   \n\nIn 2023, the NFL had a total of $20.24 billion in revenue.  \n\nIf you add up the salary cap numbers for each team, add in the $70 million per team allocated for player benefits, and add in the $88.245 million for total player playoff pay, it comes to a total of $9.412 billion in total player compensation.  \n\nEDIT: I left out equalization pay, which is supposed to bring the players up to 48.8% share... this was $393.8 million in 2023.  Added it in to total player compensation for the below calculation.  \n\n**That comes to a 48.5% share of total NFL revenue as player compensation in 2023.**  It doesn't equal 48.8% because some NFL revenue is excluded from the share.  \n\nNow for MLB.  \n\nIn 2023, MLB had $11.6 billion in total revenue.  \n\nAdding up the luxury tax salary, which includes player benefits like the NFL split (many people exclude this and is why they get such a low percentage), the total comes to $5.586 billion in total player compensation.  **That is 48.2% revenue share for the players for MLB in 2023... slightly below the NFL number.**  \n\nBut wait, there's more.  \n\nI didn't include playoff shares.  The player pool of playoff shares in 2023 was $107.8 million.  **Adding in playoff shares, MLB revenue share for players in 2023 was 49.1%.**  \n\nBut wait, there's more.  \n\nThe NFL includes drafted players with their rookie contracts and signing bonuses.  That wasn't included in the MLB number.  The total signing bonus pool for the MLB draft in 2023 was $307.3 million.  **Adding in draft signing bonuses, MLB revenue share for players in 2023 was 51.7%.**  \n\nBut wait, there's more.  \n\nThere's also international amateur signing bonuses.  The NFL doesn't have a direct comparison because all talent is brought in through the draft.  In 2023, the amateur signing bonus pool for the league was $166.8 million.  **Adding in international amateur signing bonuses, MLB revenue share for players in 2023 was 53.2%.**  \n\nBut wait, there's more.  \n\nNFL revenue share includes players on the practice squad.  Basically, if you're employed as a professional football player by an NFL team, your compensation is included in the cap.  The equivalent to this in MLB is the minor leagues.  We know the minimum minor league salary at each level, plus the number of players in each system at each level, but not every player makes the minimum so it's difficult to get an exact number on total minor league salaries, but for the entire league is would be between $120-180 million.  **Adding in minor league player salaries, MLB revenue share for players in 2023 was between 54.2-54.8%.  We'll split the different and go with 54.5%**   \n\nThat means when you look at total player compensation between MLB and NFL compared to revenue in 2023, **the NFL came to 48.5% while MLB was 54.5%.  NBA and NHL also have 50% split of revenue in their numbers, but I'm not familiar enough with those leagues to figure out how it works in practice.**  \n\nThis is why the players are adamantly against a cap and floor system.  Currently MLB players get a much higher share of the revenue as total player compensation than the other 3 big NA leagues that have a cap/floor.",

      "text": "I'm just curious what celebrities are big baseball fans. Would love to see them talking about baseball. I know Geddy Lee is a huge Jays fan, season ticket holder, been a fan for decades. I also know Tom Delonge is a huge San Diego Padres fan. But I'm curious what celebrities you know of that are big fans and any video content of them discussing baseball just purely as a fan. I like seeing celebrities not doing pressers and just being themselves, so casually seeing them just talking about the game and not themselves or how their celebrity interfaces with it is always enjoyable. Kind of like seeing Ryan Reynolds and Rob McElhenney talking about football and Wrexham. They're fans of their own team and just love to talk about it.",

      "text": "I'm referring to the rise of those large multiuse stadiums that were built for both football and baseball.\n\nTypical features of multiuse stadiums:\n\n* circular shape of the stadium\n* astroturf fields\n* often had brutalist architecture of exposed concrete skeletons\n* perfectly curved outfield walls; often blue in color (departing from traditional green)\n* in suburban environments far from the center of the city with large parking lots surrounding\n* lack of a view (like a city skyline) behind the outfield wall due to the large upper-tier seating that blocked it\n\nPrior to this, ballparks often had uneven outfield walls, were angular instead of curved, and you could see views of the city buildings behind it. It was these quirky aspects of baseball that gave each park its own identity and character.\n\nThen, Oriole Park in 1992 changed all of this of combining a retro look and feel with modern amenities. They're also often back to being located near the city center instead of the suburbs, as MLB ballparks usually were in the beginning.\n\nSince then, baseball specific parks have followed this blueprint of \"neo-retro\": Petco Park, Oracle Park, PNC Park, etc. Also what has returned -- ads on the outfield walls. If you look at baseball parks pre-1960s, the outfield walls were covered with ads. Partly because they needed them for funding then. Multiuse stadiums came with trying to make the outfield walls \"cleaner\" in both symmetry and lack of ads. They began coming back with the rise of neo-retro stadiums.\n\nI'm personally glad we got away from the multiuse ballpark era and moved towards the neo-retro style.\n\n[Veterans Stadium; opened 1971](https://preview.redd.it/sn8ngc526gwd1.jpg?width=1330&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=33b3205d6783b150fff9db2f52cec45331b58845)\n\n[Houston Astrodome; opened 1965](https://preview.redd.it/bg7ns4d36gwd1.jpg?width=1600&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d20986a3d7c3b6a5e92a81432a3d19b73cb2de4f)\n\n[San Diego Stadium; opened 1967](https://preview.redd.it/cw2xq1c46gwd1.jpg?width=400&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=836782b7ec7e60b714f33c45c29fc13a89664ead)\n\n[Orioles Park; opened 1992](https://preview.redd.it/nc4j1s0g6gwd1.jpg?width=2208&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ca590a1c22bc5a77d098c824a3951a8666a9c47e)\n\n[Oracle Park; opened 2000](https://preview.redd.it/vpjpv1mh6gwd1.jpg?width=1920&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=0bd6b6f480eaa8967d7097c06b3c7deba5822b08)\n\n[Petco Park; opened 2004](https://preview.redd.it/l4g3shqj6gwd1.jpg?width=800&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=0b4dfe983dfa75829b3a0ec5409f6bb38567fdbf)",

      "title": "The Greenberg Line: Should the BBWAA care about it any longer?",
      "text": "In recent years, [thanks in large part to Jay Jaffe](https://blogs.fangraphs.com/joe-mauer-and-the-rule-of-2000/), there has been discussions regarding the \"Rule of 2,000\" and how it affects Hall of Fame voting. Basically, it is the unspoken standard that position players who do not get 2,000 career hits will not get into the Hall of Fame, and this is made apparent with the fact that the BBWAA has not elected a single player post-expansion that had less than 2,000 hits, as well as only ten that had any playing time between integration and expansion. Thankfully though, things have started to change. The VC recently picked Minnie Minoso and Dick Allen, both of whom did not get to 2,000, for the Hall, and the BBWAA has been making progress as well, with Andruw Jones and Chase Utley set to be the first players elected by them without 2,000 hits; in doing so, it will allow for similar-profile position players like Evan Longoria to also make the cut. This led me to think about the next barrier that I think needs to be broken: the Greenberg Line.\n\nFor those unaware, the Greenberg Line (not to be confused with the football betting line) refers to Hank Greenberg, the popular first baseman for the Tigers whose brief stint in 1947 with the Pirates made him qualify as one of the ten aforementioned players. Greenberg was known for hitting for power, but a chance at having 400 career home runs was dashed due to him serving in World War II. He eventually ended his career with 331 home runs, and since then, it has been a benchmark for how many home runs a first baseman is \"supposed to have\" in order to get into Cooperstown. To this day, almost seventy years after he was inducted, Greenberg still has the lowest home run count of any live-ball era first baseman in the Hall.\n\nOf course, all of this fits under the general stereotype for first basemen: that they are bulky men who can't properly field and are expected to only be allowed to slug if they want to be productive. But anyone who has watched baseball for a while knows that it is just that: a stereotype. Pretty much every position player has them: center fielders are nimble five-tool players, third basemen are a poor man's shortstop, second basemen are light-hitting team captains, etc. And these pre-conceived notions of what a position should look like can, and should, be broken. It wasn't that long ago that shortstops were expected to be literally short, as well as excellent, agile defenders, but players like Cal Ripkin Jr. and Alex Rodriguez eventually showed that the position could be occupied by more bulky, power-hitting players. And while the rise of all-time sluggers at first base like Mark McGwire and Albert Pujols has certainly not helped the conversation, the fact of the matter is that the stereotype should probably have already been broken.\n\nKeith Hernandez was never a big power hitter, to put it mildly, as he never had a 20-homer season and ultimately finished with 162 overall. But his biggest claim to fame (aside from allegedly spitting at Newman and Kramer) is that he was the best defensive first baseman of all time. Advanced stats back up these claims, and he was rewarded for this with more Gold Gloves than any other first baseman. Every single other player with the most Gold Gloves at their respective position - a list that includes Brooks Robinson, Willie Mays, and Roberto Clemente - is in the Hall of Fame. And just because Hernandez wasn't a power hitter doesn't mean he was a bad hitter, far from it; he also has two Silver Sluggers and a batting title, winning an MVP for the latter campaign, for crying out loud. And with over 60 WAR in his career, plus a continued visible presence in baseball thanks to his broadcasting career, it's a wonder that he hasn't gotten\n\nSpeaking of batting champions, what about John Olerud? He was a solid first baseman for a decade and a half, known for facing adversity amidst a traumatic head injury and having far more home run power than Hernandez, even though he just barely cracked 50 WAR. Olerud unfortunately never got the due he was owed during his career, and that carried over to his home run total of 255. But that really shouldn't matter. Outside of Dave Stieb and maybe Carlos Delgado, Olerud should be the most-considered Blue Jays player for the Hall. And on a side note, the Blue Jays need more reps overall; they don't deserve to have their only rep (not counting Doc) be a freaking rapist, good Lord.\n\nLastly, let's look at Will Clark. He has similar advanced numbers to Olerud, but was also on the cusp of surpassing the Greenberg Line himself and was fresh off of a successful 2000 campaign with the Cardinals. Had he continued for a couple more seasons he would have absolutely gotten there, but he chose to walk away from the game to spend more time with his family, finishing up with 284 home runs overall. And like, if we're going to consider fellow Giants legend Buster Posey a future first-ballot pick after he too chose to walk away for the same reasons, then surely we should do the same for Clark. Especially since Posey's counting stats, even by catcher standards, are significantly weaker than most other candidates (though he makes up for it in the advanced department).\n\nAnyway, I'm done rambling. TL;DR, first basemen have not gotten their due, and I say it's time for the voters to change their biases and stereotypes accordingly. Thoughts?",

Metro also just makes more sense for a lot of cases (i.e. Twin Cities)\n\n\\-For the sake of simplicity and for the majority of cases, I just list the main city in the metro when referring to a metro (for example, I'll simply list 'Denver' when referring to the Denver-Aurora-Centennial MSA)\n\n\\-To my knowledge, the Bay Area is the only case where I combined 2 MSAs and treated them as one (San Francisco and San Jose) due to proximity and culture\n\nObservations:\n\n\\-The only change from 2024 to 2025 was that Sacramento gained an (interim) MLB team.\n\n\\-Green Bay is still the smallest metro area with at least one Big 4 team while Riverside (Inland Empire) is the largest metro without one. If you were to lump Riverside in with Los Angeles (like I did with the Bay Area), then Austin would be the largest metro without a Big 4 team.\n\n\\-Denver is the smallest metro area with at least one Big 4 team from every league. Houston is the largest metro area that doesn't have at least one Big 4 team from every league.\n\nTools:\n\n\\-Venn Diagram through Venny:\n\n    Oliveros, J.C. (2007-2015) Venny.

      "text": "Hello guys, \nHope you have a wonderful saturday. it is my first season of watching baseball , i watched some Pre season Highlights, read Something about the World Baseball Classic and of course, the mlb. I knew the rules from some kind of video a few years ago, heard that playclock is a thing and Something like this. But it is very hard for me to get a better knowledge of players currently being topstars e.g.\n\nAs someone who watches soccer since childhood and amercan football for over 10 years now, it is not the only sport, but it is way harder for me to get deeper in Playerknowledge. \n\nSorry if my english is not the best, im from germany and felt in Love with the beautiful mind game between Pitcher and Hitter. \n\nEnjoy the games this weekend and have a good time.\n\nAll the best from germany :)",

In football it's Brady. In tennis it's Djokovic (maybe you can say Federer or Nadal, but proply not). Is there a consensus GOAT in baseball? \n\nIn basketball we have LeBron knocking on Jordan's door, and some people say that his longevity will eventually allow him to surpass MJ. \n\nQuestion is: is Ohtani currently on pace to be the GOAT baseball player or is this just recency bias? What would he need to do over the next... 7-8 years to cement that status? I know baseball doesn't really weigh world series wins as much in these convos. \n\nJust super curious as Ohtani just had one of the craziest seasons ever. Will his career be hurt by the fact that he started later than many others? He's already 30 and didn't really get going until he was 24, whereas people like Bonds or even Griffey started at 19-21.\n\nI'm fascinated by this stuff so interested in what people who are more knowledgeable than me think.",

While researching one venue, I came across an early (1911) descriptor of the \"Hit This Sign to Win X\" ploy at the park.  This one was a Bull Durham Tobacco sign which offered players $50 (about $1,000 now). I began wondering how old the idea behind these was.  I found some similar Bull Durham signs in the northeast in 1909, but was curious if anyone knows of any earlier.",

As a parallel, I'd love to see the likelihood of winning based on how many runs you allow. And yes, they are 99% independent variables, unlike in, say, pro football, where more time on defense means less time on offence. Each team gets 27 outs on both sides; this never changes. With the DH and elimination of a pitcher hitting, the only variable that could influence both is player A's outs above average vs. offensive production, and typically that's only a minor consideration, often in late innings. Typically you roll out the lineup each night that gives you the best chance of a W.\n\nFor finance types, Consider runs scoed the \"gross revenue\" side of a P&L, with pitching and defence being the \"direct expenses and SG&A\" side of the P&L.\n\nWhy, you may ask? I'm a Royals fan (also an O's fan, but that's another story) and love to be a masochist when thinking about \"if only we had scored 2 runs instead of 1 tonight: we'd be in extra innings instead of looking at another damn 2-1 loss\".",

There are many hockey fans (including me) and players who are trans (even if not at the NHL level), and this is 100% relevant to the current state of hockey and how much itâs backpedaled from âHockey is for Everyone.â \n\nEven if itâs not personally relevant to you, imo itâs still important not to ignore how the NHL is tied to and influences/is influenced by current politics, especially the politics of professional sports - however one might feel about it.",

      "text": "Hi all\n\nAs mentioned in the title, I like football (soccer for americans) more than ice hockey, but every year for the World Cup I watch the games of my national team. It's that time of the year again where I'm always reading on social media âthis NHL star is probably out of the playoffs and could be playing in the World Cupâ. Every year I think to myself why the World Championships take place at the same time as the NHL playoffs. I have come up with the following solution:\n\nWhy doesn't the World Cup take place every 3 or 4 years like the Football World Cup and in exchange you come to an agreement with the NHL that no NHL games will take place during the World Cup? The advantage would be that all the top stars would be there and the World Cup would become more attractive because it doesn't take place every year. As a football fan, the World Cup is the best event and I think that's also because the World Cup only takes place every four years. I think if the World Cup took place every year, the euphoria would be much less.\n\nI guess I'm not the first one with this suggestion, so the question is: Why is this not possible in ice hockey?",

      "title": "[Offseason Post] I rotted my brain with a bunch of hockey romance novels and I have to talk about it",
      "text": "This year I got to go to my first NHL game. I took a train up to Seattle to watch the Leafs play, and knowing I had a long trip ahead of me, my partner (on a lark) bought me a book called Puck and Prejudice. I wasnât expecting anything good, judging entirely by the cover - but my curiosity and my boredom got the better of me, and the experience sent me down a rabbit hole of sports romance novels. \n\nSince this isnât a writing subreddit, much less a romance novel subreddit, so Iâm going to keep things really simple. Iâll provide a short summary, then answer three questions:\n\n* Does the author know anything about hockey?\n\n* Did I have fun reading it? \n\n* Does the author dunk on the Leafs at any point during the book? \n\n\n**Puck & Prejudice** by Lia Riley \n\nTucker, an NHL goalie for the fictional Austin Royals (get it? Like Jane Austen? Get it?) is recovering from cancer treatments in the UK. He gets into a car crash, which sends him through a timewarp to regency-era England, where he meets Elizabeth, a girl who dreams of one day becoming a widow - and getting to do whatever she wants. These two, plus Jane Austen for some reason, decide they should get married, then find a way to send Tucker back to the future, so Elizabeth can live out her dreams of being a wealthy widow. Hijinks ensue. \n\n* *Does the author know anything about hockey?*\nNo, not even a little bit. \nGretzkyâs 50 goals in 39 games is misattributed as 39 goals in 50 games\nShe refers to the third period as âthe third quarterâ \nThe goalie protagonist of Puck and Prejudice is shown on the front cover wearing a skaterâs gear\nI donât think hockey really adds anything to this book. He could have been a football player, a pilot, a male model. It only serves to give Tucker pointless reference points like âshe hit him like a slapshotâ. It feels like some cynical attempt to cash in on some rising fad? Are hockey romances a fad now? My not-hockey-watching partner did buy this book, so I guess the grift worked. \n\n* *Did I have fun reading it?* \nI was thoroughly entertained by this book. Itâs not good, not even remotely, but it is really absurd. A lot of the romantic dialogue made me laugh. The hockey analogies were forced and belabored, but not as forced and belabored as the synonyms the author chose to use for her main charactersâ privates. \nThe dialogue switches between Elizabethâs perspective, which is written with this faux Romantic-era sophistication, and Tucker, whose inner monologue is more comparable to Letterkenny than Pride & Prejudice. At no point is any of it good. \nIt is smutty. Iâm starting to understand that these books are just a socially acceptable way to consume pornography in public. \n\n* *Does the author dunk on the Leafs at some point in the book?* \nTucker eventually travels back to the contemporary era, rejoins his team, and shuts out the Leafs 3-0. This is the most realistic part of the book for me, because if ever there were a goal to beat cancer and then time travel to the 1800s and then come back, they fucking would shut out the Leafs. Theyâd probably do it in a game 7.\n\n**Heated Rivalry** by Rachel Reid\n\nOkay, so after the religious experience of Puck & Prejudice, I wondered if the problem was that I donât really like heterosexual romance novels. So I tried this one, which is actually quite well loved in MLM romance communities. \nIt follows two rival skaters, Shane & Ilya, who play for the Montreal not-Canadiens and the Boston Legally-Distinct-Bruins respectively. Itâs an enemies-to-lovers set-up as they grow, overcome some of their own trauma, and fall for one another romantically. \n\n* *Does the author know anything about hockey?*\nYes actually! I didnât notice any details that were incorrect, the book has a really good grasp both of hockey and hockey culture (your queer protagonists being afraid of coming out, the NHL awards always hiring some B-tier Canadian rock band, etc.)\nThe authorâs photo in the back of the book shows her wearing a Habs jersey (they win 2 cups in this book, for the record, which is remarkable restraint. She even let Boston have one. If I wrote a hockey romance book you best believe the Leafs will have a dynasty) \nI have a sneaking suspicion one of the main characters is modeled after Nick Suzuki, based on appearance, ethnicity, and playing center for Montreal. Iâm not accusing anyone of anything, though. \n\n* *Did I have fun reading it?* \nI liked this so much Iâm almost embarrassed. I even read the sequel that follows, The Long Game. \nThe main characters work really well together, both in the growing tension towards the beginning of the novel and in the tender moments in the latter half. I also appreciate that the charactersâ queerness is handled with a degree of depth and care, which is often not the case for queer romances. \nFair warning to anyone that wants to read this: it has a *lot* of MLM erotic content. Even more than the previous book in this list (but I liked it this time, so itâs okay, thatâs how this works). A good chunk of the book is uhâ¦guys being pals, shall we say. \n\n* *Does the author dunk on the Leafs at some point in the book?* \nShane and Ilya scored the same number of goals their rookie year- 67. Itâs subtle, but Iâm going to count it. \n\n**Pucking Around** by Emily Rath\n\nRachel Price is a physical therapist for the Jacksonville Rays (donât give Gary Bettman any ideas). She is not like other girls, no - sheâs self-obsessed and willing to lose her medical license to date three (3) hockey players - the insecure clingy one, the golden retriever, and the hard-to-get aloof one. \n\n* *Does the author know anything about hockey?*\nActually yes, or she faked it well (ba dum tss?) I didnât notice any totally incorrect things in regard to the sport. Iâm pretty sure physical therapists arenât supposed to sleep with their clients, but Iâm the only person on Reddit who isnât a doctor so I canât say for certain. \n\n* *Did I have fun reading it?*\nNo, no I did not. This book is about 700 pages, and it really didnât need to be. Itâs a hockey book, itâs not like you need to do any world building, itâs just an exploration of how many different places at an ice rink your main characters can hook up in (a lot, apparently). None of the characters are likable, particularly your female main character. Itâs also not really a polyam book so much as it is a self-absorbed monogamous fantasy, which really took me out of it as a poly person. \n\n* *Does the author dunk on the Leafs at some point?*\nI think the Leafs are the only thing Rachel doesnât screw in this book, so thatâs something. \n\nMy only previous exposure to this subgenre was the âKrack My Backâ thing a few years ago, where a bunch of Tiktok girlbosses were leaving a ton of sexual comments on photos of Alex Wennberg and other Kraken players - which was gross. I didnât get it then, and I donât get it now, but it was at least anâ¦educational experience to see what these are all about. That, or itâs rotted my brain to the point that reading smut with hockey references is âeducationalâ for me now. Of the ones I read, the only one I can seriously recommend is Heated Rivalry and its follow-up. I will definitely be reading the inevitable sequel to Puck & Prejudice, though, because I have to know how absurd that premise can get. \n\nThank you for letting me scream into the void, go Leafs go, may the offseason end soon.",

      "text": "**Context:**:  Antony is widely regarded as perhaps the worst signing by Manchester United in the 21st Century. He was signed for â¬100M ($111M). For 2 and a half years, Antony had more yellow cards (10) than goals+assists (8) in 62 Premier League games. Antony was relentlessly targeted for roasting (r/soccer, /r/soccercirclejerk, social media) due to how catastrophically bad he was. \n\nWhen Antony joined the Spanish midtable club Real Betis, most people thought it was good riddance. But he has genuinely been phenomenal and a major reason why Real Betis reached their 1st ever European Final in interational tournaments & may even finish top 5 in Spanish La Liga to qualify for Champions League (the most prestigious cup tournament in soccer).\n\nAntony is having the greatest redemption story in football currently. Even people who once ridiculed Antony are now unironically supporting him. Antony going from a joke to a universally beloved player who's actually great is no small feat\n\n---\n\nAs the title says: \n\nWhat players went from being a scrub/meme to genuinely beloved for actually performing well (like Antony in soccer)?",

      "text": "In the past few days I've seen a lot of conversation about the pressure of playing in Toronto, and furstration from Leafs fans about the way it's discussed. Dangle (who I know is extreme but I think reflects the general idea a lot of people have) went into detail saying that it's bullshit, it doesn't make a difference, and you can't have it both ways where they're under insane pressure but also their building is silent. \n\nPersonally, I think it's crazy to say the pressure isn't enormous. They have by far the biggest fanbase and alongside the Habs the most hardcore. Dangle says this mentality is insulting to the Bruins for example who have hardcore fans. Sure-they certainly do. At the end of one of their worst seasons in 30 years they had a dozen reporters at their breakdown day. The Leafs will be lucky if it's less than 50. The scale is not at all the same. But at the same time, it's not like the other examples, the Yankees or the Lakers, exactly because those are international largely casual fanbases whose players can disregard the hardcore fans because of the sheer size. You also don't have national media companies paying a third of a billion dollars just to broadcast their games alone basically. \n\nThe other example he gives is the Knicks. That is the one good comparison, but he says they're an example of a team that's big and stays crazy in comparison to polite leafs fans. Knick's fans were notorious for being quiet for the decades that they sucked-they're sort of in their early Leafs arc but if they have the same failures the Leafs have it'll end up in the same spot. The reality is the Leafs have the worst of both worlds: an enormous fanbase and massive media interest that does add a ton more pressure than most markets in most sports, and an insane cost of entry into the actual arena that makes it much quieter than say Edmonton. \n\nUltimately it's crazy to discount the day to day impact the pressure has. I get being annoyed at being called noise-but that doesn't mean the impact isn't real. And it's not only the Leafs. The Habs have historically been the same away when it comes to media pressure. There are plenty of guys that have been chased away for the same reason. \n\nEdits: \n\n1. For all of the people citing European football as an example of why this is bullshit feel free to ask any Man U fan of the last 20 years, any Liverpool fan from the 15 years before that, or any Spurs, Valencia, Roma, Rangers, Dortmund, both Milans, or Marsaille fans (or any of the other countless very good teams that regularly make Champions league but never win their domestic leagues) about teams that do pretty well all year and then blow it when it counts and what people there say about their players and pressure\n\n2. I don't want this to be taken as fans should be blames or change their behvaior. I think fans largely have every right to be furious, to boo, to throw jereys etc. I'm just saying it's silly to say that that stuff doesn't have an impact.",

      "text": "[This undated handout photo shows Mykhailo Ivanov in Winnipeg. The 42-year-old immigrated to Winnipeg a little over two years ago to flee the war in Ukraine. THE CANADIAN PRESS\\/HO-Mykhailo Ivanov \\*MANDATORY CREDIT\\*](https://preview.redd.it/4nhzaupm2t0f1.jpg?width=960&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=0b07ca1fb0c2a8ed925b54901af15f2a2f65d8f5)\n\n  \nTORONTO â Mykhailo Ivanov never thought he'd become a diehard hockey fan.\n\nThe 42-year-old had immigrated to Winnipeg a little over two years ago to escape the war in Ukraine. He didnât know much about hockey, he said, but after he was given tickets to a Jets game he fell in love with the sport â and the community that comes with it.\n\nâI like that kind of emotion and support from other fans, from the people nearby you,â he said in a phone interview. âIt's an important part of my life now.â\n\n\"It decreases or even erases those boundaries, those limits newcomers normally face.â\n\nAs three Canadian teams fight their way through the NHL playoffs, fans across the country are cheering from the sidelines, including those who newly call Canada home.\n\nSome immigrants say that just as hockey is a part of Canadian identity, celebrating the sport during playoff season helps them become part of it, too.\n\nChristine Munsch said when she and her husband first moved to Toronto from France about 18 months ago, they tried watching football and basketball to help them adjust to Canadian life. But it was hockey that had them hooked, she said.\n\n\"We knew it was a big part of Canadian culture,\" she said in a phone interview. \"I was really amazed by the quality of skating and this balance between well-done choreography and a sometimes violent game.\"\n\nMunsch added that she was surprised by the hockey fans' sportsmanship. In Europe, rival soccer fans are strictly separated in the stands, she said, but at hockey games the fans all sit together in good spirits, even amid playoff tensions. There's friendship in the sport, she said.\n\n\"When people learned that we were hockey fans, they really paid more attention to us, and we got integrated a lot easier,\" said Munsch, adding that she and her husband often watch playoff hockey games with friends and neighbours.\n\nNow, Munsch said they never miss a match and they closely follow all the teams. They really like the Edmonton Oilers, she said, but the Toronto Maple Leafs are their favourite.\n\nShe even has her own little Carlton bear, the Leafs' mascot.\n\n\"Sometimes when I watch a game, I take him with me,\" she said.\n\nMeanwhile, as the Jets make their own bid for the Stanley Cup, the atmosphere in Winnipeg feels âlike a permanent holiday,â Ivanov said, as fans cheer on the streets and Jets flags wave all over the city.\n\nIvanov now has a collection of several Jets jerseys, and he also has friends from a fan club to talk all things hockey. They even make posters before playoff games that say, âGo Jets go!â\n\nThe sport has helped him become part of Winnipegâs community, he said, and it \"completely changed\" his life.\n\nâYou feel more integrated into Canadian society, you feel at home. You donât feel like an immigrant,â said Ivanov. âYou feel more Canadian, more local. It helps a lot.â\n\nFor Munsch, as soon as the Leafs clinched home advantage, she and her husband quickly bought tickets for the first round showdown against the Ottawa Senators. They sat in the upper level of Scotiabank Arena, she said, because \"that's where I was told the real fans are.\"\n\nBut Munsch isn't just a fan. On game days, when she tells people she has to rush home to catch the puck drop on TV, they tell her the same thing every time.\n\nâThey say, âYouâre a real Canadian.ââ\n\nThis report by The Canadian Press was first published May 14, 2025.\n\nRianna Lim, The Canadian Press\n\n[https://www.lakelandtoday.ca/national-news/you-feel-at-home-playoff-hockey-helps-newcomers-feel-more-canadian-10661738](https://www.lakelandtoday.ca/national-news/you-feel-at-home-playoff-hockey-helps-newcomers-feel-more-canadian-10661738)",

      "text": "Just wondering why has it been so long since a player that fits the Lindros and Lemieux mold as a big player 6â4â who can score and utterly dominate a game has shown up at the draft?\n\nSure the game is faster and more skilled more than ever but Mario today would still be dominant and good for 2-3 points almost every night I would think.\n\nMaybe just evolution?",

Canadian fans, while unlike European ultras, are really loud too. The loudest atmospheres in Canada I've seen were in MontrÃ©al, Edmonton and weirdly a few CHL games. It really feels like a war zone. They celebrate on the streets after the game and destroy the town if they lose (which I don't really condone haha). \n\nAn example is the Four Nations matches. Atmosphere was electric in MontrÃ©al. Boston wasn't as great as I expected, although it was kind of loud and the end. \n\nWhy are games in the United States so quiet? I've been to a few NHL games and one AHL game. I hear clapping sometimes. Cheering when a goal is scored. \"Let's go (team name)\" chants. But there seems to be no passion. Why is this?",

      "title": "Best Non-NHL Hockey Towns in the US?",
      "text": "I figured I start this thread for fun. Common on the internet and other places in the US, people will debate which town is a hockey town in America. Usually it's an NHL city and usually Detroit and Boston are the big two that people mention. People will also make cases for the Twin Cities, Chicago, St. Louis, Philly and even LA and Tampa. \n\nWhile this is fun, this got me thinking, what are so smaller towns that are big hockey towns in the US? Basically size doesn't matter just no NHL team. They can have NCAA, AHL, ECHL, FPHL, Major-Juniors, etc or no team at all. \n\nSome of the ones I say are:\n\nBangor, Maine: U-Maine nearby helps. Seems like a lot of people love hockey and play in the area. Bruins also have a huge following and almost rival the Pats for following. \n\nPortland, Maine: Like Bangor both bigger in population and the amount of people that seem to love hockey. People love the newer ECHL team in the city and people love the Bruins and U Maine hockey. Hockey seems to be the sport that the best athletes tend to play in the city. \n\nI've been told between Portland, Bangor, Lewiston and a few of the other cities that there is a large Maine High School and it's following and popularity rivals high school football in other states. I've been told the High School championship is a huge deal.\n\nDover, New Hampshire- Small town with a really nice rink and hockey facility. Some of the best Ice I have ever skated on. It seems like both local travel hockey as well as UNH and the Bruins have a strong following.\n\nManchester, New Hampshire's Suburbs- I feel like in Downtown you will meet a Bruins fan and maybe a UNH fan but for the most part it's a Pats/Red Sox town. Out in the suburbs I saw a ton of hockey while there in February a few years ago. Lots of Bruins flags, nets in driveways, people playing pond hockey at parks. I've been told youth hockey has a huge presence in the area. Like Maine, High School hockey throughout New Hampshire has a great following.\n\nAlbany-Troy-Schenectady (the Capital Region of NY)- I visited for the first time recently. I was very impressed with how big hockey was in the area. Lots of Rangers merch everywhere, some Sabres and even a bit of Devils and Islanders merch too. I've been told Baseball and Football are probably bigger but hockey is a close three and probably the most popular youth/amateur sport in the area (besides skiiing/snowboarding). Youth hockey is huge. There are two NCAA D1 programs with huge followings. Almost every smaller college and even community college has an ACHA or CHF club hockey team that often has a following itself. Both airports have hockey rinks on their grounds, pond hockey is big and there are a few independent hockey gear stores that are able to exist even with Pure Hockey and the Rinks having pro shops. Even the play it again sports in the area sells new hockey gear and does skate sharpening. \n\nHonorable Mentions:\n\nThe North Towns of Buffalo- Buffalo itself is no doubt a Bills town and the Bills Mafia is insane. While the Bills are no doubt popular in the North Towns, the Sabres are a very close second and maybe first. At the amateur level hockey is the most played sport. Hockey is very followed at all levels. The NHL, the AHL (many people get the streaming package to watch the Ameriks) and even the ECHL (many choose an ECHL team, often based on one a friend or relative played for), the CHL, the USHL and even the NAHL. High school hockey is huge as is AAA Midgets and Bantam. \nI feel like in Buffalo proper you are more likely to meet people that are casual Sabres fans/hockey fans or people that never even got into hockey and just like the Bills. As where in the North Towns hockey is huge. I've been told that people even watch the playoffs and Stanley cup final in high numbers even the Sabres aren't in it. I've been told the South Towns also have a good following but never been.\n\nCharlestown, Mass- Technically Charlestown is part of Boston but it doesn't act like it. It's kind of it's own thing. People from Charlestown will often say they are from Charlestown rather than Boston. This one square mile neighborhood of pure concrete and brick might be the best urban hockey neighborhood in all of the US. It has produced several NHL players including Jack O'Callahan, Jimmy Vesey and the Bruin's own Matty Grzelcyk as well as a few others. Also countless players have reached the AHL, ECHL the old IHL and the American Central Hockey League. As well as plenty of NCAA alumni and CHL (juniors) alumni. The neighborhood has two outdoor roller hockey rinks which see frequent use and one Ice Rink.",

And given that his normal dynasty series is* [getting a revisit](https://ftnfantasy.com/nfl/nfl-dynasty-series-2025-introduction)*, that hope might be rewarded.*\n* *Hockey Reference and Wikipedia have all the information I needed in an easily-enough-accessible way, which allowed me to compile my list.*\n* *I'm a Sean McIndoe addict, so I'm bound to get lots of tidbits and writing style from him.Â  Though knowing what I can and canât reference will be complicated as The Athletic is paywalled.*\n\n# Introduction\n\nThe ultimate goal of every NHL season is to win the Stanley Cup.Â  Weâre constantly told by players, pundits, and fellow fans alike that anything less than that is worthless.\n\nHowever, thereâs something of a mathematical problem this presents, given that there are 32 teams in the league with only one Cup to go around every year.Â  Thus, you might say that NHL seasons have a 96.9% failure rate.Â  You can have a good team, you can have a *great* team, you can even have one of the best teams ever.Â  But at the end of the day, itâs possible, nay, more likely than not, that you will fail one of the four tests the Stanley Cup playoffs dish your way in the spring.\n\nSo, naturally, what you want to do is be at or near the top of the league for many years, not just one.Â  If you do that, thereâs no way you wonât win the Cup at least *one* of those years, [right](https://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/wp-content/uploads/migration/2014/06/14/00000169-0cf2-dbbe-a16f-4ef2e9e80000.jpg?w=879)?Â  [Right](https://ftw.usatoday.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/90/2014/05/850826265.gif)?Â  â¦[Right](https://i.cbc.ca/1.6822262.1682457915!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpeg_gen/derivatives/original_1180/tm-vancouver-riot.jpeg?im=Resize%3D1180)!?\n\nHuh.Â  I guess it doesnât *always* work out that way.Â  Sometimes, a team is good enough, and comes close enough to winning the Cup so many times, and yet always finds a way to lose.Â  Sometimes, they donât just lose, they [make little kids cry](https://youtu.be/noHtzhLOpqg?si=ofA_SBcOHbnvv0du) from the way they lose.\n\nAnd thatâs what my analysis is about.Â  I discuss teams which make you shake your head, or cry, or scream, or all of the above at once, at the thought that they just couldnât manage to go the distance and lift the greatest trophy in sports.Â  âNext yearâ came, went, rinsed and repeated, but the ending of the story was the same: heartbreak.\n\nTodayâs NHL has some fertile ground for heartbreak dynasties.Â  Thereâs been something approaching a consistent group of teams at the top during the 2020s, so several clubs have gotten multiple real-seeming bites at the apple.Â  But there have been only six Cups to go around this decade, and whatâs more, only four franchises have hogged them, with both Florida-based teams taking turns repeating as champions.Â  If you root for a good team which *isnât* one of those four, well, youâve been in for some sad times.\n\nThis yearâs playoffs felt fairly repetitive, with both conference final pairings being rematches from the previous two seasons.Â  In fact, of the last six teams standing in the tournament, five of them already had active heartbreak dynasties by my systemâs reckoning.Â  You can make an educated guess at who that sixth team was.\n\n# Heartbreak Points\n\nOkay, but what is a âheartbreak dynastyâ anyway?Â  Itâs a series of seasons in which a franchise accumulates at least 500 heartbreak points.Â  And what are heartbreak points?\n\nItâs a long answer- the fuller methodology is given in my [original introduction](https://www.reddit.com/r/hockey/comments/1duxwd3/nhl_heartbreak_dynasties_part_1_introduction/) to the series.Â  But the short explanation is this: 31 teams did not win the Stanley Cup this past year, so in one sense we can say that they all failed.Â  But, clearly not every fanbase is *equally* disappointed, or gutted, or heartbroken, that their team did not win.Â  The Edmonton Oilers, who were only two wins away from lifting the trophy, and the San Jose Sharks, who were 44 regular-season points away from even making the playoffs, are clearly not the same.Â  How close you came to winning it all certainly matters, but itâs not the only relevant factor either.Â  The Winnipeg Jets may not have made it to the Cup Final, but they were the best team in the regular season, so that has to be considered.Â  And while the Vegas Golden Knights might have lost a tough series to Edmonton in Round 2, they won the Cup two years ago, so nobody outside of Vegas will feel too badly for them.\n\nSo, each season where a team does not win the Stanley Cup has a chance to earn heartbreak points; how many you earn varies according to numerous different factors.Â  Again, I break everything down in the original introduction (and in a comment under it), but hereâs the gist.\n\nThe first source of heartbreak points is the regular season.Â  You get points for every standings point you recorded above league average (so adjusting for three-point games), and also if you had a positive SRS (goal differential per game, adjusted for strength of schedule).Â  No team ever earns heartbreak points, though; you're never *happy* not to win the Stanley Cup, afterall.\n\nThe second source is the playoffs, and here there are multiple factors which come into play:\n\n* As common sense would have it, the round you lost in is the most important factor.Â  The farther you made it into the tournament while still walking out empty-handed, the more points you earn.Â  However, the system is designed so that the round isn't the end of the story.Â  A loss in a later round can be as bad, or worse than a loss in an earlier round, depending on the circumstances.\n* If you get upset by a team which finished below you in the standings, you get more points.Â  If you lost to a team which finished ahead of you, you get fewer points from other sources.Â  The 1982 Canucks might have lost in the Finals, but everyone and their mother knew theyâd lose to the dynasty Islanders, so thereâs only so much heartbreak which can result from that.\n* Apart from your opponent, the length of the series also matters.Â  A 7-game series loss will almost always make you feel like you could have easily won, but a shorter series will often result in a resigned feeling that you simply lost to a better team.\n* Heartbreak tends to come when a game comes down to the wire, leaving you on the edge of your seat, only to be crushed at the end.Â  The system recognizes this, giving a bonus for every loss in the series that occurred in overtime or a one-goal game (with slight changes to the definitions of those terms), with special attention to the loss that actually eliminated a team.\n* Another classic mark of heartbreak is having a game, or even a series, right in your grasp, and letting it slip away.Â  My system accounts for this as well.Â  You get a bonus if you led in the series you lost in.Â  You also get a bonus if you led in any *games* you lost, with a special emphasis if it's a game which could have clinched you the series.Â Â \n* Home losses are inherently more depressing than road losses.Â  When you lose on the road, the attention is on the winning team and their ruckus fans, and the plight of the losing team and *their* fans may be out of sight, out of mind.Â  But when a team loses at home, there is no hiding.Â  The miserable fans are all around, and set the mood of the scene.Â  You get camera shots of kids crying, [women holding back tears](https://youtu.be/elfUeflPA-o?si=zsv7jJtFjd0lKVbd&t=32), fans leaving the rink like a pack of sardines, or- if things are getting *really* ugly- even [fans throwing things on the ice](https://thehockeynews.com/nhl/toronto-maple-leafs/latest-news/you-feel-their-disappointment-maple-leafs-react-to-fans-throwing-jerseys-and-debris-on-the-ice-after-game-7-elimination).Â  With all that said, there's a bonus for heartbreak points for every game you lose at home, and moreso if it was the game that eliminated you.\n\nFinally, we have to account for cases where a fanbase has a Stanley Cup to wipe their tears with.Â  Like I said up top, when the Golden Knights lost their second-round series, not too many people outside Vegas felt too badly for them, because they won the Cup just two years ago.Â  This effect can also happen retroactively; the Capitalsâ losses in 2016 and 2017 were brutal at the time, but less so given that a championship immediately followed them.Â  My system accounts for this by imposing a heartbreak point penalty for seasons surrounding a Stanley Cup.Â  The year before or after a Cup gets a 512-point penalty, which is enough to eliminate each season in NHL history except one.Â  2 years removed from a Cup, and you get a 256-point penalty, still enough to wipe out most losses.Â  The penalty keeps getting halves until 10 years out, where itâs reduced to only one point.Â  The penalty can only reduce your season to zero, as again, negative heartbreak points are impossible.\n\n# Constructing a Heartbreak Dynasty\n\nNow we know how to measure individual seasons, but how, then, do we make heartbreak *dynasties* out of this?\n\nThe crucial concept I use is called a âstrike yearâ.Â  I get into more detail about this in my introductory post, but the gist is that Iâm looking for a franchise which performed at a consistent level throughout the dynasty.Â  Not necessarily contender level, but they should at least be consistently competitive.Â  Otherwise, the run loses itâs character of heartbreak, and turns more into something else.Â  Knowles also developed the concept of an âanti-dynastyâ, or a historically bad stretch of years, but thatâs not what weâre after.Â  So, a strike year is a year where conditions are not met which I set to measure this degree of competitiveness.Â  In todayâs NHL, a strike year will almost always map out to missing the playoffs, but in past eras where making the playoffs was easier, it was more complicated than that.\n\nWith that in mind, a heartbreak dynasty is a stretch of consecutive seasons which fulfill all of these conditions:\n\n1. They must add up to at least 500 heartbreak points.\n2. They must not start, or end with a strike season.\n3. They must not contain two consecutive strike seasons.\n4. They must not contain three strikes in a span of six seasons.\n\n# 2024-25 Overview\n\nThe reason I have to re-introduce this series is because since I started it, another season has happened which will tweak the list a little.Â  Here is what\n\n|Team|RS Points|PO Points|Cup Penalty|Total|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|Edmonton|53|167|0|219|\n|Winnipeg|155|65|0|219|\n|Toronto|87|102|0|189|\n|Washington|113|73|8|177|\n|Dallas|94|71|0|165|\n|Carolina|57|79|0|136|\n|Los Angeles|83|51|0|133|\n|Minnesota|21|32|0|53|\n|Ottawa|29|22|0|52|\n|St. Louis|37|31|16|51|\n|New Jersey|21|18|0|39|\n|Tampa Bay|103|28|96|35|\n|Montreal|3|11|0|14|\n|Colorado|74|61|128|7|\n|Columbus\\*|5|0|0|5|\n|Rangers\\*|1|0|0|1|\n|Vegas|109|75|256|0|\n\nA few takeaways from these numbers:\n\n* They emphasize that being a Canadian fan is a little rough right now, with the top three(!) teams all residing north of the border.\n* The Oilers, who made it to the Cup Final, take the top spot, but only by 0.2 points over the top regular-season team in Winnipeg.Â  Yes, losing in the Final is no fun, but there are enough other considerations taken into account that this isnât an insurmountable âadvantageâ over one's brethren in misery from the same year.Â  In the post-lockout era, the top heartbreak team post-penalty has been the losing finalist 10 out of 20 seasons, with an even split through the rest of the rounds (three conference-final losers, four second-round losers, and yes, three *first*\\-round losses that, given all the context, were worse than everything else).\n* Before Cup penalties are taken into account, all four second-round losers come out ahead of both conference-final losers.Â  Not only did every home team (i.e. better regular-season record team) lose in the second round, but the *way* they lost those series was worse.Â  Especially in Torontoâs case-- losing another Game 7 at home after being in a crushing position early in Game 3-- which is what vaults them near the top of the list.\n* 218 points for the top-two teams is relatively low.Â  In the cap era, the 2025 Oilers and Jets only come out to 23rd and 24th overall.\n* Overall, there was a somewhat low number of points in pain doled out this postseason.Â  Only 1,490 points are on the record of playoff losers, taking past Cups into account.Â  By comparison, thereâs 1,793 points for 2024 playoff losers, 1,900 for 2023, and 1,550 for 2022.Â  I had the sensation of being somewhat underwhelmed by the playoffs for the most part, and these numbers bear that out a bit.Â  While there were no sweeps these playoffs, there were lots of five-gamers, two of which happened in the conference finals.Â  While there were three Game 7s-- two of them classics-- they were all in the early rounds, and those were also the only three elimination games that series winners had to pull out.\n* That asterisk next to the Rangers and Blue Jackets is because they incurred a âstrikeâ this season.Â  If the Rangers suffer another strike next season, their dynasty will be considered ended in 2024. But if they suffer more non-stricken heartbreak, the three-quarters of a point they earned this year will be added to their then-continuing dynasty.  In the Blue Jackets' case, their 2025 will never be part of a dynasty, as one cannot start with a strike.\n\n# The Revealed List\n\n[Where I left off](https://www.reddit.com/r/hockey/comments/1janvg4/nhl_heartbreak_dynasties_part_6_lots_of/) before the playoffs started, I had covered a total of 18 heartbreak dynasties, ranked from 43 to 26.\n\nAfter 2025, no new dynasties were minted, and two teams which had the chance to add to their dynasty (the Rangers and the Islanders) failed to do so.Â  Two other teams-- the Jets and the Wild-- did pile on more pain, and Iâll wait until future installments to reveal their new home on the list.Â  However, I wonât go all the way back to the beginning of the list.Â  Instead, Iâll review the teams Iâve discussed (minus the Jets and Wild) here, and then weâll get on with the top 27 in my next post.\n\nIn the comment section, Iâll post a screenshot which shows all of these teams with their points and rankings in each of the Variations I introduced in [part 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/hockey/comments/1ebgqo2/nhl_heartbreak_dynasties_part_2_nos_4341/) last year.\n\n**43. Vancouver Canucks, 1992-1995 (508 points)**\n\n**42. Pittsburgh Penguins, 1993-2001 (520 points)**\n\n**41. Nashville Predators, 2004-2012 (537 points)**\n\n**40. New York Rangers, 1978-1992 (540 points)**\n\n**39. Toronto Maple Leafs, 1993-1995 (550 points)**\n\n**38. St. Louis Blues, 1968-1972 (571 points)**\n\n**37. Calgary Flames, 2004-2011 (577 points)**\n\n**36. Quebec Nordiques, 1982-1987 (578 points)**\n\n**35. Los Angeles Kings, 1989-1993 (597 points)**\n\n**34. Los Angeles Kings, 1974-1982 (597 points)**\n\n**33. Atlanta/Calgary Flames, 1975-1988 (600 points)**\n\n**32.

Minnesota North Stars, 1980-1986 (638 points)**\n\n***28. \\*New York Rangers, 2020-2024 (675 points)***\n\n\\[The asterisks represent that the Islanders and Rangers can still continue their dynasties.Â  The italics represent that the Rangersâ placement on the list is âprovisionalâ.Â  If they win the Stanley Cup in 2026, they will exit the dynasty list because of the Cup penalties which would be applied to previous seasons.\\]",

And what about Slovenia, what is the gap between PogaÄar and Kopitar? (I assume that DonÄiÄ has far bigger salary than any of these two.

      "text": "Hey guys, how's it going?\n\nI would like the NHL community to think of some team names for my dream NHL team in Oakland, California. I know that the California Golden Seals didn't last that long, but I think we should give Oakland one more chance to have a successful team in Oakland.\n\nReason 1: There are a bunch of young people, such as Gen Z, moving to Oakland. Gen Z has changed the world of sports as well, and they might enjoy the Oakland NHL team.\n\nReason 2: The city is really diverse, and I would love to get more of the Black community, Latino community, LGBTQ+ community, etc, to enjoy some ice hockey in Oakland and other ice hockey teams as well.\n\nReason 3: Oakland's also a short drive from San Jose, which is the closest city with an NHL team, known as the San Jose Sharks. The Oakland team could have a big rivalry with the Sharks.\n\nReason 4: They do have a suitable arena that looks appropriate for an NHL team. They do have retractable seating. They were going to have an Indoor Football League known as the Oakland Panthers in that arena but due to the COVID-19 pandemic, they debuted in the SAP Arena in San Jose as the Bay Area Panthers. I do imagine that the arena can support an NHL team because the dimensions of an IFL turf are the same size as an NHL ice rink. So I'm guessing that the arena's retractable seating still exists since they were going to have an IFL team? We'll see.\n\nOakland doesn't have any major professional sports teams as of right now, and I want Oakland to be the next successful sports culture city in a city of historic diversity history!\n\nThank you,\nBeanieLynx",

      "text": "Today the Hockeyallsvenskan (HA, Swedish second tier) final starts, and itâll be a BO7 bout between DjurgÃ¥rden (DIF) and AIK, the top two Stockholm clubs in the Swedish hockey system. The winner gains promotion to the Swedish Hockey League (SHL, top tier) to replace Modo who were relegated a few weeks back, guaranteeing a Stockholm presence in the SHL next season after three season without it.\n\nThis is a fierce, hateful rivalry that mostly manifests in football (soccer), with hockey coming in as a strong second. Both teams share a home arena, so all games will be played there, but as the police canât guarantee the safety, only home fans will be allowed, chanting in unison throughout the games sadly unopposed by away fans. This final will probably be more followed than the championship final, but I feel thatâs the case every year, Stockholm derby or not.\n\nThe tale of the tape reads like this:\n\n**DjurgÃ¥rden**\n\nSwedish championships: 16 (1st)  \nTop flight seasons: 74  \nPosition in the âmarathon standingsâ (points tally of all top flight seasons): 5th  \nLatest season in the SHL: 2021/2022\n\n**AIK**\n\nSwedish championships: 7 (6th)  \nTop flight seasons: 70  \nPosition in the âmarathon standingsâ (points tally of all top flight seasons): 12th  \nLatest season in the SHL: 2013/2014\n\nH2H\n\nAll time:  \n147 games  \nDIF 78 wins  \nAIK 55 wins  \n14 draws  \n501-415 goal difference for DIF\n\nPlayoffs (all in the top tier):  \n1922 QF (DIF 1-0 in games)  \n1934 R16 (AIK 1-0)  \n1951 League Final (not national championship status) (DIF 2-0)  \n1967 QF (DIF 2-0)  \n1984 Final (AIK 3-0)  \n1988 QF (AIK 2-1)  \n1989 QF (DIF 2-0)  \n1997 QF (AIK 3-1)  \n2014 Pro/rel series, round robin (1-1 in games, DjurgÃ¥rden promoted, AIK relegated)\n\nThis regular season:  \nAIK 3-1 in games  \nDIF placed 1st, AIK 5th in the standings.",

      "text": "I'm honestly not sure if any do at all. But I'm sure one or two might. But especially the AHL, I'm surprised more AHL teams don't have local broadcast on a local affiliate channel of games and have more free streaming with ads options to watch. \n\nSame with the ECHL, I'm surprised this isn't more common especially for ECHL teams in lower population states (Idaho, South Dakota, West Virginia, Maine, South Carolina, etc) as a great way to grow the game locally and attract more fans. It give the game both more players and the franchises more following. I know hockey is big in Maine but when I was up in Bangor, we had no way of watching the Mariners. Many people are Bruins & U-Maine fans but the Mainers are closer but you can't watch. (At least they have U Maine).\n\nOr if the entire state of Idaho had access to the Steelheads that would be awesome for the game. Idaho has cold weather and I know around Boise and Sun Valley hockey is a strong niche sport. But imagine if everywhere could follow the game.\n\nI have met people from South Carolina and people I know following the Carolina Panthers and usually college football. They usually attend local minor baseball games in the summer. But many I meet have no idea that South Carolina has two Double A hockey teams!\n\nBefore anyone says anything. I am well aware that AHL TV and FloHockey exist but let's face it only diehard fans are typically subscribing. It would be cool if there was a cheaper and easier way to watch.",

      "text": "Iâm a huge sports guy, first, I got into basketball, than baseball, than football, and now Iâm getting into hockey. I think a big part of the joy I get in watching sports is just seeing how the careers of individual players pan out. LeBron has 20 all stars, Babe Ruth has like a quintillion rings, Brady has 5x FMVPs, but I was always very stumped when it came to evaluating the careers of hockey players.\n\nTake a guy like Tyler Seguin. He is spoken so highly of, and he was a second overall pick. His departure from Boston was so extremely messy that you still hear about it often to this day. Heâs had like 4 or 5 seasons where either he was a point per game guy or was almost a point per game guy. I was always shocked when looking at his hockey reference pageâ¦ 1 time cup winnerâ¦ and that was it? How was a guy whose only career accolade was winning a stanley cup so highly touted in this generation? And then I saw that he finished sixth in Hart voting in his first year in Dallas, and I was completely perplexed. He was one of the best players in the league, yet was never an All Star?\n\nIt made less sense when I went back in NHL history and saw more household name legends with little All Stars. Yzerman had 5 100+ point seasons and was an All Star one time, for one of his more âmediocreâ seasons (79 points). Teemu Selanne was like a cheat code out there and was only in 4. Auston Matthews is a superstar and has only been in 2. Draisaitl is the same deal. Patrick Kane is hailed as one of the greatest players of all time and has crazy accolades but was only in 4 as well even though the Blackhawks dynasty lasted almost 6 seasons. You get my point.\n\nBut, I thought I had my question answered when I saw âASGâ not included in their accolades. So that would make Tyler Seguin, someone I hear so much about, not just Stanley Cup champion Tyler Seguin, but six time All-Star Stanley Cup champion Tyler Seguin. It adds a lot of legitimacy to a playerâs career to say they were All-Stars. But does it? Because with the hockey fans Iâve talked to, they say it doesnât matter. Does it have the same ring if I say âone time All-Star Frank Vatranoâ like it would be if I said, say, âone time All-Star DâAngelo Russellâ? Sorry if this became convoluted. This is just confusing to me how hockey has such minimalistic awards compared to other sports.",

Hell, I donât even know that many players in the NHL and the ones I do know is very few (Connor Bedard, Auston Matthews, the Hughes brothers) but I only really know about them through social media\n\nCan I just be a general follower of the NHL without following a specific team? Or would it be better to follow a team\n\nEdit: I should say that I feel itâs rare to be a fan of the league but no set team, because (at least with football over here in the UK) you should follow a specific team and itâs usually where youâre from or if you have a connection to that team like if your family lives there - I donât have a connection to any NHL team",

      "text": "Iâm curious what this sub thinks Iâll give a short case for each options\n\n1. Switzerland\n\nPros: Continuous improvement in international tournaments, more NHL players than in the 90s and early 2000s. Domestic league is getting stronger with higher attendance each year. Sport is relevant in the country. Very rich country.\n\nCons: Amount of NHL players has stagnated since the 2010s, have not made much of a breakthrough in junior tournaments, including getting relegated last year in u18. Recent drafts have been pretty weak.\n\n2. Germany\n\nPros: Improving results in international tournaments having won an Olympic medal and a world championship medal. Very marketable players such as stutzle and Draisaitl that could inspire new players. Highest average attendance in Europe for domestic league and league quality improving. Currently good high end talent but not a lot of depth. Seems to be gaining a bit of traction. Very high population.\n\nCons: Has to compete against football, amount of NHL players has stalled out. Very regional sport with a few hotbeds. Okay performance at youth tournaments, pipeline isnât looking super strong. Canât be stated enough that football (soccer) absolutely dominates the media cycle in Germany.\n\n3. Slovakia\n\nPros: It seems like Hockey is extremely popular in Slovakia. According to Google trends Slovakia searches for Ice hockey more than anywhere on average. Decorated history competing with Czechoslovakia and also great results in the early 2000s. Great rivalry with Czechia, Junior teams have been performing extremely well as of late. They have been going in upward trajectory as of late in terms of players drafted. Bronze medal might help from last Olympics.\n\nCons: Corruption, wayyyy less NHL players than in the past. In the early 2000s Slovakia had as many as 40 nhl players now they average around 10 in the 2020s. Tons of players seem to be disinterested in playing for the national teams. Nepotism seems to run rampant. Low population. Not a super strong domestic league.\n\n4. Latvia\n\nPros: Hockey is extremely popular. Latvian fans are extremely passionate and get out to support. A few more Latvian players have been making the NHL as of late in compared to the late 2000s and 2010s. Bronze medal result was massive for the country. Junior results have been getting a lot better.\n\nCons: Weak domestic league. Latvia lost out big time on KHL and Russia going rogue. Extremely small population of less than 2 million.\n\nOverall, Iâd say these are the four biggest contenders (Iâd go in this order) with some other potential candidates (things would have to go extremely well) being Denmark, Belarus, Norway, Austria and Kazakhstan. I think those teams would have a hard chance of joining âthe next fourâ  let alone the big six. \n\n[View Poll](https://www.reddit.com/poll/1kup88x)",

      "text": "***âIâm going to watch ice hockey in Canada!â***\n\n***That was my big decision.***\n\n***But where were the teams? When were the games? And where could I go to see Cournoyer?***\n\n***I didnât even know how to begin looking for those answers.***\n\n\n\nTo learn about foreign countries while living a normal life in Tokyo, I subscribed to an English-language newspaper and began spending weekends browsing foreign bookstores in Shinjuku and Ginza.\n\n\n\nSometimes I found NHL game results in the newspaper, and occasionally there were short articles too. I carefully clipped them and pasted them into a notebook. Even a list of scores felt like precious information.\n\n\n\nAt the bookstores, I could find books and magazines about MLB, basketball, football, European soccer, and golf â but nothing about hockey. Still, I kept searching every weekend, and finally discovered a book called âFACE-OFF â74â'75\".\n\nIt introduced each team and key players. Thanks to that book, I began to learn:\n\n\n\n**\\* People call it just âhockey,â not âice hockey.â**\n\n**\\* The professional league is called the NHL.**\n\n**\\* The Montreal Canadiens were a powerhouse team.**\n\n**\\* The Philadelphia Flyers were known as aggressive âbulliesâ and had won the championship.**\n\n\n\nLittle by little, the NHL world started to take shape for me.\n\n\n\nOne day, I spotted a magazine cover with a hockey playerâs face on it. It was âSports Illustratedâ, and the player was Bobby Clarke.\n\nI rushed to grab it, panicked that someone else might get to it first â even though no one was around!\n\n\n\nAfter that, I always checked inside âSports Illustrated\", and if it had a hockey article, I bought it without hesitation.\n\n\n\nAt one point, NHL teams even came to Japan â around 1975, I believe.\n\nThe event was advertised as the NHLâs âfirst visit to Japan,â featuring the Washington Capitals and Kansas City Scouts.\n\nI was thrilled and saw both games held in Tokyo.\n\nBut honestly, they didnât impress me. Compared to that first game I saw on TV in 1972, they felt underwhelming.\n\n\n\nI checked my sparse collection of materials and realized both teams had finished last in their divisions.\n\nIt was April, the start of the playoffs â and these were the teams that hadnât made it.\n\n\n\nLater, I learned the Capitals had won only 8 games in their 80-game season.\n\nIn contrast, the Montreal Canadiens had lost only 8 games in a season.\n\nThat sealed it for me:\n\nâI want to go to Montreal!â\n\n\n\nAnother episode.\n\nDennyâs: My Misunderstanding, with All My Heart\n\nLooking back now, it makes me laugh â but at the time, I was completely serious.\n\n\n\nFamily-style restaurants were just starting to appear in Japan, and one of them was âDennyâsâ, with its stylish exterior that I had never seen before.\n\nThe name with a ââsâ at the end, the signs on the roof and on poles â all of it looked so American.\n\n\n\nNowadays itâs nothing unusual, but back then, it felt like something straight out of an American movie.\n\n\n\nI thought,\n\nâThat must be an American restaurant! Maybe there are American staff inside â and maybe one of them likes hockey! I want to talk to them!â\n\n\n\nSo I walked in with high hopesâ¦\n\nOnly to find that all the staff were Japanese.\n\nI was so disappointed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\\[Tell Me .....\\]\n\n\\* How did you come to support your favorite NHL team?\n\n\\* Are you interested in any sports played in Japan?

      "text": "European and North American fan culture differ greatly for many reasons. One thing that is important here (at least in Sweden) that doesnât exist in NA hockey is the tifo. The example in the video is DjurgÃ¥rdenâs tifo in the second semi-final against SÃ¶dertÃ¤lje in the promotion playoffs off the Swedish second league. What you see in the video is fan made and organised. \n\nIâm curious about how tifos perceived by North American fans? (Unaware of them? Would be neat in the NHL? Happy you donât have it? etc.)\n\nIs there anything similar in NA hockey on any level? I know college sports are always brought up as the closest thing when football (soccer) fans discussed. Is it the same for hockey and tifos? I read the Sens were supposed to introduce a âcheering sectionâ a few years back to emulate a more European style atmosphere. Did that go anywhere?\n\nMany questions, pick and choose if you want to share your perspective on any of them. \n\nhttps://youtube.com/watch?v=Q3_U3ubxidE&pp=ygUdRGp1cmfDpXJkZW4gc8O2ZGVydMOkbGplIHRpZm8%3D",

      "text": "Obviously the NHL regular season has started today with Buffalo and New Jersey playing the first of two games in Czechia. And in November Dallas and Florida play two in Helsinki. Comparing that to the NFL, they have 5 international games this year between Sao Paulo, London and Munich. The NFL is making more of a push to spread the game internationally, and that has come at the same time as an expanded schedule. If the NHL does look at an 84 game regular season as was recently reported, do you think those 2 added games should be earmarked as international games for more teams across the league? And does it make sense to have multiple series in the same city similar to the NFL having 3 London games? \n\nI know flying over to another continent is much easier logistically for football teams since they only play once a week, but I would like to see a greater emphasis on these games. I thought Montreal was looking at playing in France in the next year or two which I think would be awesome. I feel like with the NHL seemingly being all-in on participating in the Olympics and holding a World Cup of hockey biannually, they should couple that with more international regular season games. \n\nInteresting Wiki if anyone is interested \n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_international_games_played_by_NHL_teams",

I was thinking of wearing my Toronto jersey to get into the spirit of the game, as Iâm not sure whether I want to buy any DIF memorabilia whilst I am there. \n\nIs this an okay thing to do or will I get absolutely roasted?

      "text": "As a fan of baseball/football/basketball Bettman's name has frequently been brought up when it comes to complaints about the commissioners of each league. While there are some that are easy to understand (blackouts, time slots of games, promoting stars, etc), one of the things I'm not quite sure was whether he was really responsible for not growing hockey as fast as NBA.\n\nDuring his early tenure there were a number of relocations from traditional markets that were unpopular, but he did bring the game to a lot of new markets, evidenced by the success of the Canes/Panthers/Lightning/Knights. Assuming these moves were not made, how would the trajectory be impacted from the 90s? Was the popularity of hockey on an upward trajectory before Bettman was named commissioner?\n\nBonus: Could somebody given an ELI5 of why each of the teams relocated back then? I've heard that the cities could not keep the teams even under the condition that they fund the stadium 100% publically. Is this true?",

      "title": "NCAA Hockey, CHL-NCAA Transfers and NIL Deals - NHL Prospects Picking Their Team",
      "text": "TLDR at the end.\n\nI think we are going to see a lot more players going the \"unsigned prospect\" route to become a UFA 4 years post draft eligibility. It hasn't started happening much yet, but I really think things are going to get crazy in the coming years for NHL prospects picking where they want to play. I will explain below why I think that's the case.\n\nRight now, the UFA rules (or close enough) for prospects are as follows.\n\nUS college players - 4 years after being drafted, NHL prospects become unrestricted free agents if they refuse to sign with the team that drafted them. For example, this is what Jimmy Vesey and Justin Schultz did.\n\nCHL players - if they don't sign, after 2 years they re-enter the draft and become draft eligible again. Nick Boynton was a first rounder twice because of this. If they don't sign again, they become a UFA 4 years after their original draft year, just like US college prospects. \n\nEuropean players - If the league has a transfer agreement, the prospect becomes a UFA 4 years after being drafted.\n\nCHL players also can not play in the NCAA after basically doing anything other than talking to CHL teams. However, this is likely to change soon. The details still need to be worked out, but its very likely that CHL players will be able to play NCAA hockey after playing in the CHL. \n\nCurrently there is a huge incentive for players to sign those NHL contracts. Money, basically. You can get paid, sometimes a substantial amount. Yes, development is obviously a big part of it, but that can also be done very well by the players themselves with individual coaching, and most importantly by the NCAA teams. \n\nBut I think NIL opportunities and the changing NCAA-CHL agreements are going to change everything. Players won't need to decide between CHL or NCAA at 15 years old anymore. They will likely get to play both. Players also won't need to sign an NHL contract because the best players will be getting paid substantial money to continue playing NCAA hockey. Players will be able to play in the CHL, then play in the NCAA and get paid substantial NIL money and wait it out and pick where they want to play in the NHL as UFA's! I really think the next CBA and transfer agreements could have some pretty big changes around all of this and I really hope it doesn't lead to another stoppage. NIL has made college basketball and football crazy and I can definitely see that coming to hockey. Not at the same level, but its coming.\n\nWhat do you all think, am I just way overthinking it and these situations will continue to be niche cases? Or will more players decide to do what they think is best for them? \n\n**TLDR:** CHL players are likely going to be able to play in the NCAA. NCAA players are going to get substantial $ from NIL deals. Because they don't need the money incentive of an NHL contract, many more players will decide to not sign and wait 4 years post draft eligibility, therefore becoming UFA's and picking where they want to play in the NHL.",

As we Colognians are very proud and passionate about our city and our teams you see countless FC KÃ¶ln (soccer) or KEC (hockey) jerseys. Since American Football became very popular in the last few years you also see many NFL jerseys or people dressed up as (american) football players but as I walked in the parade today I was surprised to see quite a lot of NHL jerseys in the crowd.\n\nI saw jerseys from the\n\n- Mighty Ducks \n- Senators \n- Rangers \n- Kings \n- Stars \n- Canucks \n- Oilers (not as surprising since Cologne is Draisaitlâs hometown and he roots for our soccer and hockey team and his father played and coached here)\n\nJust thought I share this unexpected crossover between two things I love and share some local experiences with a mainly North-American community",

Each ranker has their own system and have their own reasonings and analyis. It truly is a lot of work.**\n\n### Rankers\n>!/u/dagetawayman421 /u/eatingasspatties /u/mukuu /u/sandman730 /u/lang14 /u/rawrberry_ /u/mdlt97 /u/joetothejack /u/atomic_penguin27 /u/rasera /u/nodessb /u/kellervo /u/mephisto1822 /u/jeff_banks_monkey /u/steckums /u/americanadian98 /u/timmablimma /u/maxpowr9 /u/hockeycross /u/driftshade11 /u/paynetrain181999 /u/thefragrancevol /u/silkeystev /u/oksoundtracks /u/raymondliang /u/copaceticvindication /u/assassin2107 !<\n\n### Organizers\n>!/u/lang14 /u/thatmikeguy429!<\n\n## Visualization\nThe visualization contains historical data, so you can see how your team has done over time. Hopefully, we can run this for many years in hopes that we can see the rise and fall of teams by /r/hockey opinion.\n\nIt automatically updates so feel free to bookmark. You can find it [here](https://public.tableau.com/profile/icydata#!/vizhome/PowerRankings/rHockeyPowerRankings)\n\n## Process\nHow does this work? Throughout the course of the week rankers are able to access an app that will allow them to rank teams. At the end of the period we calculate the average ranking for every team and collate all of the analysis provided by rankers.\n\nThe app then generates a post that is first proofread and then posted to /r/hockey!\n\n## Rankings\n\nRanking (avg) | Team | Delta | Overall Record | Record This Week | Comments\n:---:|:---:|:----:|:----:|:----:|:----:|\n1 (1.33) | [Winnipeg Jets](/r/winnipegjets) | - | 15-3-0 | 1-2-0 |  **rasera says** The expected outcome of the Florida beach trip, I mean, road trip. Oh well, just gotta take it to them in our building. Make sure to sign that Ehlers fellow, I see that he's quite good at that hockey thing Chevy.  |\n2 (2.44) | [Carolina Hurricanes](/r/canes) | 0 | 13-4-0 | 3-1-0 |  **timmablimma says** Necas now has a hotter start than Eric Staal did in 2005-2006. That season turned out pretty good and here's to hoping it keeps going. Spencer Martin got a \"shutout\" thanks to a weird penalty taking away a goal and changing the game. Back on the road after extending home win streak to 7. The team is buzzing, but Necas is scorching hotter than I think anyone expected and it's great to see him looking like the super star I've hoped he'd be.  |\n3 (4.15) | [Florida Panthers](/r/floridapanthers) | 0 | 12-5-1 | 1-2-0 |  **copaceticvindication says** The Devils are stinky little fartboys and Jack Hughes is a nerd ok. Devils dogged the fuck out of us after our nice win streak. Luckily this team has dawg for days, and steamrolled a super hot Jets team 5-0(Turns out Jet fuel can't melt florida beams) Have I mentioned I love this team and want to inject it into my veins?  |\n4 (4.52) | [Minnesota Wild](/r/wildhockey) | 0 | 11-3-3 | 1-1-0 |  **paynetrain181999 says** A convincing win against Montreal where Zuccy takes a puck to the gentlemen's area, big oof, and Ek leaves with injury as well.  Given that neither played against Dallas, nor did Brodin, the fact that we only lost 2-1 is a minor miracle.  They were outplayed for the majority of that game, but our undisputed best player this  week, the Gus Bus, kept us in it.  I'd love for him to win a Vezina trophy.  Things are still going pretty decently, but the longer the aforementioned players are out, the more vulnerable this team is...  |\n5 (5.74) | [Washington Capitals](/r/caps) | 0 | 12-4-1 | 2-0-1 |  **dagetawayman421 says** Ovechkin recorded a hat trick against Vegas... Connor McMichael almost did against the Avalanche. Hop on the wagon, this team is going places. Logan Thompson is undefeated in regulation and would probably be undefeated period if it weren't for the god awful officiating in the Caps-Leafs game. Caps got five points in six games. For the first time in Vegas Golden Knights history, they have lost both games in a season to the Caps. H I S T O R I C    Three games this week (Hockey Club, Avs, Devils), Caps need to continue getting at least 66% of the points. The Caps had an issues on their third line and solved it by bringing back Eller. They are rolling and I do not expect them to stop scoring.  |\n6 (6.11) | [Vegas Golden Knights](/r/goldenknights) | 0 | 11-5-2 | 2-2-0 |  No Knights blurb this week, it must be daytime, sorry.  |\n7 (6.96) | [New York Rangers](/r/rangers) | 0 | 11-4-1 | 2-1-0 |  **nodessb says** Not the best week, not necessarily the worst either though. A loss against the current best team and a win against the current worst team seems about par for the course so I guess I can't complain too much. There are definitely some areas to be concerned about *cough* the defense *cough* but hopefully Lavi can sort those out soon. I have confidence that this team can be an absolute wagon, but some things have to go right for that to happen: Mika has to return to form, Fil has to be healthy, and the defense needs to step up and give Igor some help. We shall see what this coming week brings. LGR!  |\n8 (7.74) | [Dallas Stars](/r/dallasstars) | 1 | 11-5-0 | 3-0-0 |  **rawrberry_ says** Efter fÃ¶rra veckan behÃ¶vde Dallas Stars ishockeylag nÃ¥got. FÃ¶r fÃ¶rsta gÃ¥ngen nÃ¥gonsin gjorde Dallas Stars sex mÃ¥l i fÃ¶rsta perioden i en ishockeymatch. Och fÃ¶r andra matchen i rad har Dallas Stars gjort sex mÃ¥l eller fler. Detta Ã¤r fler Ã¤n vad det amerikanska fotbollslaget Dallas Cowboys har lyckats med. NÃ¤r Dallas Stars spelade mot Minnesota gjorde de bara tvÃ¥ mÃ¥l. Den andra kedjan Ã¤r den bÃ¤sta den hÃ¤r sÃ¤songen, medan nÃ¥got verkar vara fel med den fÃ¶rsta kedjan. Det ser ut som om jag behÃ¶ver stanna i Sverige, eftersom jag blev kÃ¤r igen. Och innan ni frÃ¥gar â ja, hon Ã¤r blond. Min skola vann ocksÃ¥ igen. NÃ¤r jag Ã¤r i Sverige Ã¤r Texas 3 och 0. Jag tillhÃ¶r Sverige. In English for those of y'all that can't speak Swedish After last week, the Dallas Stars hockey team needed something. For the first time ever, the Dallas Stars scored six goals in the first period of a hockey game. And for the second game in a row, the Dallas Stars have scored six goals or more. This is more than what the American football team, the Dallas Cowboys, has managed to do. When the Dallas Stars played against Minnesota, they only scored two goals. The second line has been the best this season, while something seems to be wrong with the first line. It looks like I need to stay in Sweden because I fell in love again. And before you ask, yes, sheâs blonde. My school also won again. When Iâm in Sweden, Texas is 3-0. I belong in Sweden.  |\n9 (7.93) | [New Jersey Devils](/r/devils) | -1 | 12-7-2 | 2-1-0 |  **silkeystev says** This team is an absolute enigma, but at least there is more wins than losses lately. Two shalakings against a powerhouse like Florida, and then a dud of a los against their in-state brethren. That being said... the team is more or less performing at a level that I expect? And i don't know what to write about...  |\n10 (9.3) | [Toronto Maple Leafs](/r/leafs) | 0 | 11-6-2 | 2-1-0 |  **lang14 says** I called it last week with the Sens. The Leafs just do not care about the Battle of Ontario anymore. And they should. 5-1-0 in their last 6, the Leafs continue to cruise upward. Great comeback against Washington. Gave up a late period lead against the Oilers but were able to hold on for the win in OT. I love Stolarz. MVP. Domi probably going to continue playing hurt until Auston is back.  |\n11 (11.85) | [Vancouver Canucks](/r/canucks) | 1 | 9-5-3 | 2-2-0 |  No Canucks blurb this week, sorry.  |\n12 (11.96) | [Los Angeles Kings](/r/losangeleskings) | -1 | 10-6-3 | 1-2-0 |  **raymondliang says** Much needed win against a struggling Detroit, but not a great week for the Kings. Struggling to generate grade A chance, and not putting them away when they are presented. Key guys still just not putting the puck in the net as much as we need them to, especially on the powerplay. Tweaks have been made (5F on PP1), and Turcotte is healthy again. 5-1 at home so far, so that bodes well for this week.  |\n13 (13.41) | [Tampa Bay Lightning](/r/tampabaylightning) | 0 | 9-6-1 | 2-0-0 |  **keepitsteadyidiots says** No Point this week=all the Points. Vasy became the fastest goalie to 300 wins and as a celebration decided to shutout the next team he faced. Looking forward to seeing another 300 for the Big Cat  |\n14 (14.93) | [Calgary Flames](/r/calgaryflames) | 0 | 9-6-3 | 2-1-0 |  **kellervo says** 3 games this week, with 2 of them wins on the back of Dustin Wolf's performance. He's playing like a legit #1 and now he has his first shutout. Calgary's season rests on him and Vladar maintaining this level for the entire season, but I'm starting to believe he can do it.  |\n15 (15.74) | [Edmonton Oilers](/r/edmontonoilers) | 0 | 9-7-2 | 2-0-1 |  **eatingasspatties says** 1000 points and 5/6 points this week means Iâm very happy. Every game was sloppy, but we wonât be picky about our happiness  |\n16 (16.52) | [Colorado Avalanche](/r/coloradoavalanche) | 0 | 9-8-0 | 2-1-0 |  **hockeycross says** Solid week for the Avs, Best news is health as the team is getting healthy again. Adding 3 players at once may have disrupted things too much on Friday, but it is good to have a mostly healthy line up.    Avs have a big road trip ahead of them, and the big questions remain goaltending and team defense.     Hopefully Georgiev is only missing a short time, this team needed his play from the past couple weeks back.  |\n17 (18.3) | [Ottawa Senators](/r/ottawasenators) | 0 | 8-8-1 | 1-1-1 |  **driftshade11 says** This week started off so well, and ended off in such a frustrating way. Not having goaltending and not being able to play against contenders is not what I was hoping to see out of this team this year, but here we are. Hoping to get some kind of positive momentum this week.  |\n18 (18.52) | [Seattle Kraken](/r/seattlekraken) | 2 | 9-9-1 | 3-1-0 |  No Kraken blurb this week, sorry.  |\n19 (19.7) | [Boston Bruins](/r/bostonbruins) | -1 | 8-8-3 | 1-1-1 |  **maxpowr9 says** I think most fans are just fed up at this point; just fire someone, even Blades. The Bruins haven't been this unwatchable in over a decade: worst PP in the league and one of the worst PKs too. They struggle to make a series of passes and goals seem to happen by a lucky bounce more than skill. Seeing the Stars solve Swayman by chucking the puck over his shoulder was depressing.  |\n20 (20.81) | [Buffalo Sabres](/r/sabres) | -1 | 8-9-1 | 1-2-0 |  **oksoundtracks says** As a Rochesterian, this team confuses me. This squad will put up dominant performances over the Sens and the Rangers, just to keel over against Montreal and Philadelphia. They feel both tough and soft, dangerous and completely toothless. Am I ranking them a little high? Probably, but these fans deserve a little hope after the last decade of futility.  |\n21 (21.19) | [New York Islanders](/r/newyorkislanders) | 2 | 7-7-4 | 1-1-1 |  **oksoundtracks says** I'm sorry, Mike. You deserve better than what you're getting every week from this team. Our teams may have very similar records, but us new fans don't deserve anything yet.  |\n22 (21.3) | [Utah Hockey Club](/r/) | 0 | 7-7-3 | 1-1-0 |  **oksoundtracks says** Utah fans won't tolerate any Veggie slander in this arena. After a performance of the ages from Vejmelka, we had all the momentum in the world and promptly used it to squander a 2-0 lead against the Golden Knight. Utah giveth and Utah taketh away. But the jerseys are here, so I can have my weekly heart attack in style!  |\n23 (21.56) | [St. Louis Blues](/r/stlouisblues) | -2 | 8-10-1 | 1-2-1 |  No Blues blurb this week, clearly they are having the blues, sorry.  |\n24 (22.48) | [Philadelphia Flyers](/r/flyers) | 1 | 8-8-2 | 3-0-0 |  **assassin2107 says** Massive rebound week for the team. Full credit to Ottawa: We should have lost that game. But the team destroyed Buffalo and San Jose (That was a shootout game, but make no mistake, the Flyers got the better of SJ almost the entire way). Sanheim also looks like he's a major candidate for Team Canada right now, this version of Sanheim is actual 1D material... who would even be willing to trade this guy?  |\n25 (23.37) | [Detroit Red Wings](/r/detroitredwings) | -1 | 7-9-1 | 1-2-0 |  **americanadian98 says** Detroit started the week with a very acceptable showing in Pittsburgh, and a great first half against Anaheim. Then they decided that was enough and played absolutely awful hockey for the rest of the week, giving up a multi goal lead to lose to Anaheim, and never really looking in it in LA. They need to show some signs of life ASAP.  |\n26 (26.07) | [Columbus Blue Jackets](/r/bluejackets) | 0 | 6-9-2 | 1-2-0 |  **steckums says** The losing streak was broken by running into Tristan Jarry. Was the first time the Jackets beat the Penguins in regulation since 2019, which is just an absurd stat for a divisional game. We are definitely playing better than last year, but still struggling to not give up a bunch of goals per game.  |\n27 (26.48) | [Pittsburgh Penguins](/r/penguins) | 0 | 7-10-3 | 1-2-1 |  **jeff_banks_monkey says** This team is bad. This is the worse defense in the whole league. God has forsaken the Penguins as to balance out the Stanley Cup runs. There will be vintage moments from the core but besides the occasional blast from the past this is a miserable team that is not built to win now or in the near future  |\n28 (27.7) | [Anaheim Ducks](/r/anaheimducks) | 0 | 6-8-2 | 1-1-0 |  No Ducks blurb this week, clearly they ducked so my shot missed this one, sorry.  |\n29 (29.37) | [Chicago Blackhawks](/r/hawks) | 0 | 6-11-1 | 0-2-0 |  **sandman730 says** The Hawks have only scored 6 goals in their last 5 games. The Hawks allowed 9 ENGs this season (2nd most in NHL). Arvid Soderblom has a .934 SV% (highest of any goalie with 5+ GP).  |\n30 (29.44) | [Montreal Canadiens](/r/habs) | 2 | 6-10-2 | 2-1-0 |  **mdlt97 says** It was a much better week for the Habs. There are still a few players who really need to play better, but overall, the team is executing the system at a much higher level than 3-4 weeks ago. The powerplay continues to be a bright spot for the offence, they are no longer being embarrassed on their own end, and most importantly, they're winning games.  |\n31 (30.19) | [San Jose Sharks](/r/sanjosesharks) | 0 | 5-10-4 | 0-1-2 |  **atomic_penguin27 says** Which will happen first, the heat death of the universe or the Sharks winning a game in the shootout?  |\n32 (30.89) | [Nashville Predators](/r/predators) | -2 | 5-10-3 | 1-1-2 |  **thefragrancevol says** It's a dark day in Nashville. As I write this, Nashville is in last place in the league. Do they have the talent to pull a St. Louis? Yeah. Are there a million other examples of this kind of thing not working out? Also yes. At least Zach L'Heureux just scored his first goal as I'm typing this. That's a bright spot.  |",

      "title": "Continental Tournament Concept (International)",
      "text": "As far as I can tell, no continental tournament exists (at least not IIHF sanctioned and with top players) so I began to brainstorm a potential continental hockey tournament, inspired by those in place in soccer/football by FIFA, such as the Euros, AFC, Copa America, and AFCON championships. An obvious limitation is the scarcity of hockey countries, so why not make it a more intimate tournament in all other continents besides Europe. What does this mean exactly? Something like this:\n\nEuropean Championship - Every 4 years in the off-season *after* the Stanley Cup is awarded in the NHL, maximizing top European talent from contending teams. I propose 16 teams qualify for the tournament, with groups of four playing 3 round robin games, and the top two teams advance into a bracket-playoff system of 1-game-series.Â \n\nNorth and South American Championship - USA vs Canada due to a lack of hockey playing countries (I guess a qualification could exist, although it would be quite pointless as USA and Canada clear everyone else). A 7-game-tournament, essentially a playoff round between the two nations best-on-best. The tournament would be after the Stanley Cup Finals, and every four years like the European version, yet on an alternating year to maximize viewership.\n\nAsian Championship - Its no secret that Asia severely lacks any top talent (as of now, but I hope to amend that statement once the game grows in this part of the world), so an option would be a 4-team playoff bracket with a best of 3 game series (first to two wins advances). Potential nations could include China, Japan, Kazakhstan and a wild card such as Kyrgyzstan, South Korea or the UAE. This championship could be played every 2-3 years as there are at the moment no NHLers from this part of the world, yet still some skilled professionals from central Asia and China. .\n\nDue to a lack of hockey presence in Africa and Oceania, I won't be proposing any ideas for them, yet I hope for the game to grow in future in these areas.\n\nThoughts?",

It would showcase itself to the World but would then be up for debate for any following Olympics.\n\nI am a huge fan of this idea.\n\nSoftball / Baseball was not at Paris because Paris isn't really a Softball /Baseball nation and didn't have the adequate facilities to host as such.\n\nThis idea in turn alleviates environmental concerns.  Imagine if Paris built a Baseball stadium that would eventually rot away (like the purposefully built Aquatics arenas in Rio and Athens or the Bobsled Course in Sarajevo).\n\nA total waste of money.\n\nSo - if breakdancing can be a one-off, that means any other sport can be a one-off, most especially if that sport is particular to the host city and not to the rest of the world.\n\nBrisbane is fighting to have League and Cricket as one-offs, both sports of which are particular to Australia.  Los Angeles will have Lacrosse, which is a sport that originated in North America, as well as Flag NFL, which is a variant of the NFL sport.\n\nIt's a great idea all around.  New sports revitalize the Olympics, brings in new ideas about sport.  Each sport has their time to shine on the biggest stage in the World.  It's environmentally friendly.  The idea of a \"Demonstration sport\" becomes unnecessary.\n\nThe downside is having to wait to be chosen.  But it's better to wait to be chosen rather than not being thought about at all.\n\nHence:\n\nWe've had Climbing, so it's possible, though minutely likely, that Ice Climbing would be possible.  As too Snowmobiling !\n\nIf Canada is chosen, Frisbeeing could be chosen.\n\nIf China is chosen, WuShu could be chosen, but officially this time, as opposed to its Demonstration status in 2008.\n\nIf Italy is chosen, maybe Pallone would be chosen.\n\nIf India is chosen, Kabbadi could be chosen.\n\nTurkey = YaÄlÄ± GÃ¼reÅ\n\nIndonesia = Sepak Takraw\n\nIreland = Hurling\n\nRussia = Bandy\n\netc",

In most countries around the world, the only time you ever see it on the TV is at the olympics. And all international level artistic swimmers are pursuing olympic qualifications; it is the end goal. \nOn the other hand: Football already has a *massive* world championship. I'm pretty sure it gets more viewers than the olympics themselves. Most professional football players are aiming for FIFA and the olympics is kind of just a side gig. \n\nWhat do y'all think? Should they just keep adding sports forever? Should they cull some of the niche ones?",

      "text": "Iâve been thinking about what belongs in the summer Olympics and what doesnât. Some sports feel like theyâre barely hanging on to legitimacy, either because theyâre too niche, too elitist or simply donât demand Olympic level athleticism. Hereâs my take:\nIf a sport doesnât have wide participation, requires no serious talent/genetics/training or is so expensive most people canât even try it, it should be cut. The Olympics should showcase the peak of human performance. Not hobbies, not art projects, not sports where money matters more than skill. It should unify all nations.\n\nSports that should be cut or seriously reformed:\n\n\tâ¢\tEquestrian - The horse does the work, not the human. Itâs a billionaire-only event.\n\n\tâ¢\tModern Pentathlon - A weird mash up of unrelated events. No one masters all five.\n\n\tâ¢\tArtistic Swimming - More performance than sport, with a shallow global pool.\n\n\tâ¢\tSailing - Hugely expensive and gear-dependent. Inaccessible to 99% of the world.\n\n\tâ¢\tSport Climbing - Current combined format is garbage. Needs serious restructuring.\n\n\tâ¢\tTrampoline Gymnastics - Extremely niche. Feels like a side event to artistic gymnastics.\n\n\tâ¢\tRhythmic Gymnastics - Prop-based dance, judged subjectively, no male version.\n\nWhat should stay:\n\tâ¢\tTrack, swimming, gymnastics, weightlifting, rowing, judo, wrestling, cyclinâ¦\nSports where you canât just âtrain a bitâ and get in. You need elite genetics, years of work, and a global field of killers to beat.\n\nThe Olympics should raise the bar, not lower it. Otherwise it devalues being an Olympian. \n\nCurious what others think, what sports would you cut or defend?",

You run trails, paths, use teamwork, and I would love to see the different countries compete. Thoughts? Check out the national championship college x country race, and tell me that it isnât exciting, and a joy to watch! \n\nhttps://youtu.be/D5cb8-HwALQ?si=cg0kDTdcn_YBS6Io - menâs 10k ncaa championships.",

      "text": "Good evening, all. I have been doing some extensive research specifically in the retired athlete space and the difficulty it has been for many athletes, especially Olympic & Paralympic athletes, due to a lack of resources and funds over their career.  For those of you that this may have impacted, what has been your experience when you retired from sport? Mine was very difficult and took me down an 8.5-year significant depression, trouble with the law, family issues, alcoholism, and more. Thankfully, I was able to find the light in 2018.  I would love some insights from all, not just the athletes who have experienced this. Thank you.",

I see gymnastics more of a show like ballerina and depends on how hard youâve been practicing one move or segment but with boxing you canât just practice the same moves for competition and requires more of being sharp with your mind.

He began his career at the IOC in the Sports Department, first working on the development of athlete-related projects and the Olympic programme before focusing on relations with International Federations and sports operations. In 2010, he joined the Olympic Games Department, where he currently serves as Olympic Games Operations Director and plays a pivotal role in the delivery of the Olympic and Youth Olympic Games.\n\nIn his new role, Pierre will work closely with the International Federations, the athletes, the Organising Committees, and the Health, Medicine and Science and Olympic Programme Commissions. He will report to IOC Director General Mr Christophe De Kepper.\n\nâI wish Pierre Ducrey every success. His experience within the IOC and the Olympic Movement, and expertise in planning and delivering the Games and in stakeholder management, will be invaluable in the further development of the activities of the Sports Department,â De Kepper said. âI would also like to thank Kit McConnell for the excellent work he has undertaken over more than 10 years. I wish him all the best in his future endeavours, and I look forward to pursuing our fruitful collaboration with both of them in their new roles.â\n\nSOURCE: [https://www.olympics.com/ioc/news/pierre-ducrey-appointed-new-ioc-sports-director](https://www.olympics.com/ioc/news/pierre-ducrey-appointed-new-ioc-sports-director)",

I am thinking that given a specific disability, the pool of people that will meet certain criteria will be less; hence allowing a wider percentage of them to reach the highest competitions. Is this somewhat right? Thanks",

They essentially move around the controls to put them all within reach of the athlete, depending on their height, movements, etc.\n\nWhat are other sports that could be added?

      "text": "The venues for football (soccer) at LA28 have not yet been finalized with the exception of the Rose Bowl which will host at least six matches, including the mens and women's semi-finals and finals. If history is an indicator of the future, there should be at least six or seven other venues outside of the host city used for the football competition. Unlike the World Cup, the Olympics takes place over a much shorter period of time. This means, the less (shorter) travel players have to do, the better. \n\n  \nThe San Francisco Bay Area has four venues which could host matches. \n\n\n\nLevi's Stadium in Santa Clara can seat 68,000 and is already a venue for the 2026 FIFA World Cup. The stadium has easy mass transit access via the Santa Clara-Great American station which serves Amtrak's Capitol Corridor and the Altamont Corridor Express. VTA Light Rail's Green and Orange Lines also stop there. Stanford Stadium in Stanford seats 50,000. It hosted matches during the 1994 FIFA World Cup and 1984 Summer Olympics. The stadium can be accessed at the Stanford Station via Caltrain. California Memorial Stadium in Berkey can seat up to 60,000 people. The stadium underwent a significant renovation a decade or so ago. It can be accessed via the Downtown Berkley Station on BART's orange and red lines. While small with 18,000 seats, PayPal Park in San Jose can certain host group stage matches. The nearby Santa Clara transit center serves Amtrak, Altamont Corridor Express and Caltrain.    \n\n  \nJust imagine how convenient it would be for players and fans alike to be able to utilize four venues in the SF Bay Area. This also would allow the SF Bay Area to get in on the Olympic action. Add Snapdragon Stadium in San Diego to the list of venues, then you have five additional venues in CA, meaning less travel time for players. You would still need one or two other venues outside of CA, but this is a sensible approach.",

      "text": "Yesterday it was confirmed that the Rose Bowl in Pasadena will host both the men's and women's semi-finals and finals. That means six matches at the Rose Bowl. There is no word in regard to if the third place matches will also be played there. \n\n  \nThe article I read seemed to imply that preliminary (group stage) matches would be held \"out of state\" which I am going to logically assume means outside of California. That would mean quarter-final matches as well as third place matches would be played in California (just maybe not at the Rose Bowl).\n\n\n\nCrunching the numbers, the men's tournament would have 32 matches while the women's tournament would have 26 matches. That means 58 matches overall. If all sixteen knockout stage matches are played in CA, then that means 42 group stages matches would be played outside of CA. \n\n\n\nNow I'm thinking that the quarter-finals (for men and women) will be played in the San Francisco Bay Area (perhaps Levi's Stadium) and San Diego (Snapdragon Stadium). Maybe both third place matches happen in San Diego. \n\n\n\nWhich venues in California (knockout stage) and outside of California (group stage) do you see hosting football (soccer) matches?\n\n\n\nIn CA, I would also pick Levi's Stadium (SF Bay Area) and Snapdragon Stadium (San Diego). \n\n\n\nOutside of CA I would pick Allegiant Stadium (Las Vegas), State Farm Stadium (Phoenix metro area) and Lumen Field (Seattle). Those venues are close enough to the west coast. Beyond that I am unsure.",

      "text": "We've all seen the medal table, and there have been various complaints that it's not fair, especially to smaller countries, to order it by total number of medals.  Even as an American, I agree with this.  So, what's the best way to normalize this data?  Some have said it should be by the country's population.  But there is no good correlation between population and number of athletes sent, plus not all countries enter all events.  Others have said to normalize it by number of athletes.  But that's far from accurate, since a single athlete could enter many events (especially swimming and track), while you have an entire team in sports like football that counts for just one medal.\n\nThe best way that I could come up with to normalize the data was by number of entries into events.  This shows to me the chances each country had of getting a medal. For the raw data, I used [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024\\_Summer\\_Olympics\\_medal\\_table](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_Summer_Olympics_medal_table), and the individual country pages linked to that one, so there may be some errors.  (It was a pain collecting all the data!)\n\nSo here's my top ten, ordered by gold (like the medal table usually is):\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/6kyfj8ia8zpd1.png?width=1126&format=png&auto=webp&s=9584a251a8c9e22fe991fd3820910a9faca0750d\n\nCongrats to [Dominica](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dominica_at_the_2024_Summer_Olympics)!  They sent only 4 athletes, but still managed to come home with a gold.\n\nBut what about just getting to the podium?\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/66yeg6ct8zpd1.png?width=1126&format=png&auto=webp&s=8802cc3b88741dfd34e7fc635928a0ecf1257523\n\n[Saint Lucia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_Lucia_at_the_2024_Summer_Olympics) managed to hit the podium an impressive 40% of the times they entered events!\n\nHere's my full list of countries, ordered by gold, then silver & bronze.  I only included those that won medals.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/59npa5iz9zpd1.png?width=703&format=png&auto=webp&s=eb20e481812914b792c98d801373ebf028a4213f\n\nAnd for the raw data if you want to error check me (and get an eye chart too!), here's that:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/waqa7b55azpd1.png?width=2687&format=png&auto=webp&s=d257eeeb70c086d1aa9bc171b038157de9778e93\n\nSo, what do you think?",

      "text": "Rams owner Stan Kroenke will build a movie studio next to SoFi Stadium in Inglewood that will serve as the international broadcast center for theÂ [2028 Olympic Games](https://www.latimes.com/sports/olympics/story/2025-05-08/2028-olympics-opening-ceremony-coliseum).Â \n\nConstruction will start by summer on the studio and production facility that will house hundreds of broadcasters from around the world that have acquired rights to cover the Summer Games in Los Angeles, Kroenkeâs company said Tuesday.Â \n\nAfter the Games, the facility known as Hollywood Park Studios will be used to make movies, television shows and other productions and perhaps host live broadcasts.Â \n\n  \nThe development is part ofÂ [Hollywood Park](https://hollywoodparkca.com/), a multibillion-dollar complex built on the site of a former horse racing track also known as Hollywood Park that includes the stadium, apartments, theaters, offices, shops and restaurants.\n\nAÂ [luxury hotel is under constructionÂ ](https://www.latimes.com/business/story/2024-10-11/inglewood-will-get-300-room-hotel-at-sofi-stadium)there, and more development including a grocery store and medical offices is being considered.Â \n\nKroenkeâs organization hopes that attention from the Olympics will boost Hollywood Park Studiosâ appeal as a future entertainment production center.\n\nâWe want it to be recognized around the world,â said Alan Bornstein, who is overseeing development of the studio for Kroenke.\n\n  \nThe studio is part of Hollywood Parkâs master development plan focusing on media, entertainment and technology, Bornstein said, anchored by SoFi Stadium, YouTube Theater and the NFL Media office building.\n\nâThere has been an increasing convergence of media and technology and sports, all under the notion of entertainment that is now distributed in in multiple channels,â Bornstein said, âwhether itâs through streaming or whether through broadcast television or movies in theaters,â\n\n  \nThe first phase of Hollywood Park Studios will occupy 12 acres and will consist of five soundstages, each 18,000 square feet, two of which may be opened to a single 36,000-square-foot stage.Â \n\nThe complex will have a three-story, 80,000-square-foot office building to support stage, production and postproduction activities. The studios will have a dedicated open base camp where trucks, equipment and actorsâ trailers could be placed, along with a parking structure for 1,100 cars. Future development could include as many as 20 stages and 200,000 square feet of related office space.\n\nThe additional stages would be built to suit for future tenants as demand emerges, Bornstein said, who declined to estimate how much the studio complex will cost.\n\nAlthough demand for soundstages outstripped supply a few years ago,[Â production has recently slowedÂ ](https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/business/story/2025-04-03/l-a-s-production-woes-worsen-as-sound-stages-go-unused-shoot-days-decline)and dampened the current need for them.\n\n  \nLast year, the average annual occupancy rate dropped to 63%, a further indication ofÂ [Hollywoodâs sustained production slowdown](https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/business/story/2025-04-03/l-a-s-production-woes-worsen-as-sound-stages-go-unused-shoot-days-decline), according to a recent report by FilmLA, a nonprofit organization that tracks on-location shoot days in the Greater Los Angeles area.\n\nThat was a decline from 2023, which saw an average regional occupancy rate of 69%. That was the year when dual strikes by writers and actors crippled the local production economy for months.\n\nThe foray into Hollywood-level production facilities is part of Kroenkeâs goal to combine sports, entertainment and media from around the world, Bornstein said.Â \n\nIn addition to the Rams, Kroenke is owner of the Denver Nuggets basketball team, the Colorado Avalanche hockey team, the Colorado Rapids soccer team, the Colorado Mammoth lacrosse team and Arsenal Football Club, the Premier League soccer team based in London.\n\nSoFi Stadium, where the Chargers also play football, will be converted into the largest Olympic swimming venue in history during the Games in 2028. It will host the Olympic opening ceremony with the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum, as well as the opening ceremony for the Paralympic Games.\n\nKroenke is also a major real estate developer and landlord. The 300-acre Hollywood Park project is one of the largest mixed-use developments under construction in the western United States. SoFi Stadium alone cost $5 billion to build.\n\n  \nLast month, he alsoÂ [unveiled plans](https://www.latimes.com/sports/rams/story/2025-04-06/rams-new-headquarters-development-plan-warner-center)Â for a new Rams headquarters on a 100-acre site at Warner Center in Woodland Hills that would include a residential and retail community intended to be the centerpiece of the San Fernando Valley. It could cost more than the total price of Hollywood Park, which has been valued by outside observers at more than $10 billion.\n\nCreating a second epicenter in Woodland Hills allows the Rams to significantly increase the size of their footprint in the Southern California market.\n\nâWhen youâre looking to do a practice facility, you donât need to be right in the middle of everything, and typically that real estate is very expensive,â Kroenke told The Times. âWe built an identity in the Valley, with Cal Lutheran, and a lot of our players and families are up there. Our experience was really good.â\n\nArchitecture firm Gensler spearheaded the design for the Warner Center headquarters and Hollywood Park Studios. Clayco will be the general contractor for the studio, with Pacific Edge acting as project manager. Financing was arranged by Guggenheim Investments.\n\n\n\n  \nSOURCE: [https://www.latimes.com/business/story/2025-05-13/movie-studios-coming-to-hollywood-park](https://www.latimes.com/business/story/2025-05-13/movie-studios-coming-to-hollywood-park)",

      "text": "During a visit to Qatar,Â [IOC President Thomas Bach](https://www.olympics.com/ioc/mr-thomas-bach)Â honoured the achievements of the global table tennis community and Qatarâs commitment to youth sport and education.\n\n  \nLast week, IOC President Thomas Bach was in Doha, Qatar, where he attended the 2025Â [International Table Tennis Federation (ITTF)](https://www.olympics.com/ioc/international-table-tennis-federation)Â World Table Tennis Championships held at Lusail Sports Arena â a landmark venue that reflects Qatarâs emergence as a leading host of global sporting events. On Sunday afternoon, he attended the finals and presented the ITTFâs Geist Trophy to womenâs singles world champion Sun Yingsha of China, who successfully defended her crown in a gripping seven-game classic against compatriot Wang Manyu.\n\n  \nEarlier in the day, during the ITTF Summit held alongside the finals, Bach presented the IOC Presidentâs âUnity Trophyâ to the ITTF, in recognition of its contributions and recent innovations within the Olympic Movement. In his keynote address, which received a standing ovation, Bach praised the ITTFâs commitment to reform, technological advancement and global inclusivity, noting the sportâs impressive success at the Olympic Games Paris 2024 and its growing digital engagement.\n\nHe also highlighted the addition of a sixth medal event for table tennis in the Olympic programme â a strong signal of the IOCâs confidence in the sportâs continued evolution. Bach reaffirmed the IOCâs full support and encouraged the table tennis community to continue its leadership in advancing the Olympic values worldwide.\n\nIn a special recognition ceremony during the ITTF Summit, President Bach was awarded the inaugural ITTF Badge of Honour by ITTF President Petra SÃ¶rling and Deputy President Liu Guoliang. The distinction acknowledged his enduring support for table tennis and transformative impact on the sport throughout his presidency.\n\nâIt is with immense pride and gratitude that we honour a visionary leader whose extraordinary commitment has profoundly elevated the Olympic Movement and the sport of table tennis worldwide â IOC President Thomas Bach,â said SÃ¶rling. âYour visionary leadership and steadfast dedication have created a lasting legacy for table tennis.â\n\nPresident SÃ¶rling also commended his leadership in advancing gender equality and innovation within the Olympic Movement, particularly through the introduction of mixed doubles at Tokyo 2020 and the upcoming mixed team event at Los Angeles 2028. The ITTF recognised Bach as a visionary leader whose legacy of inclusion, sustainability and digital advancement has significantly shaped the sportâs global development.\n\nDuring his visit, President Bach met numerous athletes from countries competing at the World Championships, acknowledging their dedication and achievements on the global stage. He also engaged with representatives from several National Olympic Committees and other key Olympic Movement stakeholders, including delegations from China, France, India, Saudi Arabia, Belarus, Kazakhstan, Nigeria and Algeria.\n\nOn Saturday evening, Bach attended the final of the 2025 HH The Amir Football Cup at Khalifa International Stadium, where Al Gharafa claimed a 2â1 victory over Al Rayyan. The match was also attended by IOC Member HH The Amir Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad bin Khalifa Al Thani.\n\nOn this occasion, the two leaders discussed the State of Qatarâs overall policy in sport â from youth education and grassroots development to the organisation of numerous world championships and multisport events. A key topic of their conversation was the current tense global geopolitical situation and its impact on the world of sport.\n\nEarlier in the week, President Bach visited the 18^(th)Â edition of Qatarâs Schools Olympic Programme (SOP), held at the state-of-the-art Aspire Dome â a premier multisport venue that welcomed over 6,000 students and their families in a celebration of the unifying power of sport. The event was attended by HE Sheikh Joaan bin Hamad bin Khalifa Al Thani, President of the Qatar Olympic Committee; HE Lolwah Al Khater, Minister of Education and Higher Education; and Mr Å½eljko TanaskoviÄ, President of the International School Sport Federation.\n\nThis national initiative has become a cornerstone of Qatarâs vision to integrate sport into education and to promote the Olympic values of excellence, friendship and respect among the countryâs youth. During the finale, President Bach awarded medals in volleyball, joining in with the celebrations of young athletes whose achievements reflect the growing strength of school sport in Qatar.\n\nSOURCE: [https://www.olympics.com/ioc/news/ioc-president-bach-visits-qatar-for-2025-ittf-world-table-tennis-championships](https://www.olympics.com/ioc/news/ioc-president-bach-visits-qatar-for-2025-ittf-world-table-tennis-championships)",

The venue plan of theÂ [LA28 Paralympic Games](https://www.paralympic.org/la-2028)Â is strategically designed for the needs of athletes and the respective sportâs field of play requirements â matching each event with the best venue â while also delivering an exceptional experience for fans from around the world.\n\nâThe Paralympic Games showcases the highest level of athleticism, skill and endurance and it is important for LA28 to deliver a plan that not only elevates Paralympic sport, but brings it to the next level,â said LA28 Chief Executive Officer Reynold Hoover. âThe Paralympic venue plan ensures that Los Angelesâ first-ever Paralympic Games will take place in incredible existing stadiums and arenas across the region while creating the best possible experience for athletes and fans across the 560 events with accessibility top of mind.âÂ \n\n\"The first-ever Paralympic Games in Los Angeles will showcase the worldâs top talent and provide an opportunity for L.A. to improve inclusive accessibility citywide,â said City of Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass. \"The legacy of these Games will be imprinted on our city forever â proliferating beyond the boundaries of these venues to better all of Los Angeles.â\n\nWith every competition venue within a 35-mile radius, the venue plan maximises the use of premier venues within the Los Angeles area, reduces the overall number of standalone sites and minimises travel times for athletes staying in the Paralympic Village. As a result, for the first time since Rio 2016, Paralympians across every sport will have the opportunity to be housed together at the Paralympic Village which will be based on UCLAâs campus.\n\nDuring the Paralympic Games, the majority of sports and disciplines will be held in the City of Los Angeles, with Downtown Los Angeles and Exposition Park zones serving as main hubs for the competitions.\n\nThe Convention Center in Downtown Los Angeles will serve as a multi-sport complex featuring several dynamic sports includingÂ [boccia](https://www.paralympic.org/boccia),Â [Para judo](https://www.paralympic.org/judo),Â [Para table tennis](https://www.paralympic.org/table-tennis),Â [Para taekwondo](https://www.paralympic.org/taekwondo)Â andÂ [wheelchair fencing](https://www.paralympic.org/para-fencing). This multi-sport site will create a vibrant, high-energy atmosphere where excitement from one competition will flow into the next. By hosting multiple competitions side-by-side, the events will encourage constant movement, shared fan engagement and a festival-like environment that highlights the diversity of athletic performance.\n\nAdjacent to the Convention Center in Downtown Los Angeles, the Arena in Downtown Los Angeles will host wheelchair basketball where the storied venue will make the perfect backdrop for a high-stakes competition. The nearby Peacock Theater will serve as the home to goalball in an acoustically optimised setting, showcasing a field of play unlike anything the sport has seen before.Â \n\nIn 2028, the iconic LA Memorial Coliseum will deepen its Games legacy by hosting Para athletics events. The LA Memorial Coliseum will also host the Closing Ceremony on 27 August, 2028. On the other side of campus, the USC Sports Center will hostÂ [wheelchair rugby](https://www.paralympic.org/wheelchair-rugby)Â andÂ [Para badminton](https://www.paralympic.org/badminton), aligning with LA28âs commitment to maximise the use of existing world-class facilities.Â \n\nThe iconic coastal neighborhood of Venice Beach will deliver an exciting line up of events includingÂ [Para triathlon](https://www.paralympic.org/triathlon)Â and the starting point ofÂ [Para athletics](https://www.paralympic.org/athletics)Â marathon.\n\nThe City of Carson, a 2028 Venue City, will be the stage for a variety of Paralympic events within its state-of-the-art sports complex includingÂ [Para archery](https://www.paralympic.org/archery)Â at the Fields in Carson,Â [wheelchair tennis](https://www.paralympic.org/wheelchair-tennis)Â at the Tennis Center andÂ [Para cycling â track](https://www.paralympic.org/cycling)Â in the Velodrome.Â \n\nThe LA28 Games will mark the Paralympic debut of Para climbing featuring 80 athletes across fourÂ menâs and fourÂ womenâs events which will be staged in the Convention Center Lot in Long Beach alongsideÂ [Para swimming](https://www.paralympic.org/swimming)Â which will be held at the temporary outdoor aquatics centre. Both events are framed by ocean views which will bring energy and a striking natural backdrop to these action-packed competitions held in the 2028 Venue City of Long Beach.\n\nWithin the Convention Center in Long Beach,Â [shooting Para sport](https://www.paralympic.org/shooting)Â will take place in a purpose-built, temporary indoor range where spectators can witness the ultimate test of accuracy and control. Adjacent to the Convention Center, the Arena in Long Beach will stageÂ [sitting volleyball](https://www.paralympic.org/sitting-volleyball), promising a thrilling tournament experience.\n\nIn the near distance along the Pacific Ocean, a temporary arena will stageÂ [blind football](https://www.paralympic.org/blind-football)Â at Alamitos Beach, mimicking the successful Olympic-Paralympic venue share as seen in previous Games editions with Olympic beach volleyball, maximising the use of the temporary arena. Â \n\nFurther down the coastline of Long Beach,Â [Para rowingÂ ](https://www.paralympic.org/rowing)andÂ [Para canoe - sprint](https://www.paralympic.org/canoe)Â events will be held at Marine Stadium.

      "text": "**Los Angeles, CA**Â (May 8, 2025) â Today, LA28 confirmed that the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum and the Stadium in Inglewood will serve as the official venues for the Opening and Closing Ceremonies of the 2028 Olympic and Paralympic Games. Largely consistent with the 2017 bid plan, this announcement follows updates to the Olympic venue plan and precedes updates to the Paralympic venue plan, reflecting a revision to the 2028 Paralympic Closing Ceremony location with all other Ceremonies remaining at their original venue designation.Â Â \n\nÂ \n\nâThe venues selected for the 2028 Opening and Closing Ceremonies will highlight Los Angelesâs rich sporting history and cutting-edge future, showcasing the very best that LA has to offer on the world stage,â saidÂ **LA28 Chairperson and President Casey Wasserman**. âThese two extraordinary venues will create an unforgettable experience, welcoming fans from across the globe to an Olympic and Paralympic Games like never before and concluding what will go down as one of the most incredible Games in history.âÂ \n\nÂ \n\nâTodayâs announcement marks a proud milestone as the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum will become the first venue in history to host three Olympic Games,â saidÂ **Mayor Karen Bass of Los Angeles**. âFor over a century, the Coliseum has been a landmark host to some of the most iconic moments in all of sports history. That story continues in 2028 as our City and our region welcomes the world for what will be the greatest Olympic and Paralympic Games.âÂ \n\nÂ \n\n\"As a proud LA28 Venue City, the City of Inglewood is honored to play such a pivotal role in the 2028 Games,\" saidÂ **MayorÂ James T. Butts, Jr.Â of Inglewood**. \"Our stadium is one of the most impressive in the world and will deliver an incredible experience for thousands of in-person fans, with millions more watching from home, as we come together to celebrate the Opening Ceremonies of the 2028 Olympic and Paralympic Games.\"Â \n\nÂ \n\n\"The University of Southern California is excited to welcome the world to the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum for the 2028 Olympic and Paralympic Games,â saidÂ **Carol L. Folt, President of the University of Southern California**. âOur Trojan football stadium is a national landmark featuring the iconic 1932 and 1984 Olympic torch, and in 2028 will once again make history as the first stadium to host events for three Olympic Games. It's an honor for us to contribute to the Olympic Opening celebration and host both the Olympic and Paralympic Closing Ceremonies in 2028.\" Â Â \n\nÂ \n\n\"Sports has the power to inspire and unite people of all backgrounds, generations, and experiences, and the Olympic and Paralympic Games serve as a model for how this unparalleled platform of sport can bridge the world,\" saidÂ **E. Stanley Kroenke, Los Angeles Rams Owner/Chairman**.Â Â \"When we built our stadium, it was with the vision of transforming Los Angeles and bringing the biggest global events in sports and entertainment to our region.Â We are honored that the world will come together at our venue and celebrate the Opening Ceremonies for the 2028 Olympic and Paralympic Games.\"Â \n\nÂ \n\nOn July 14, 2028, theÂ **Olympic Opening Ceremony**Â will be shared between theÂ **LA Memorial Coliseum and the Stadium in Inglewood**, creating an unprecedented dual-venue celebration that will earn the Coliseum the unique distinction as the first venue in history to host events for three Olympic Games while also marking the Stadium in Inglewoodâs Olympic debut. The use of both venues strategically aligns with their respective roles as competition venues for Athletics and Swimming, accommodating the unique scheduling adjustment for the 2028 edition of the Games, with Athletics moved to the first week and Swimming to the second. Both venues will feature artistic elements that will capture the rich culture of Los Angeles, with the specific activities to be identified through the creative development process leading up to the LA28 Games.Â Â \n\nÂ \n\nTheÂ **Olympic Closing Ceremony**Â will take place on July 30, 2028, at theÂ **LA Memorial Coliseum**, an iconic venue that will once again shine as the worldâs greatest athletes come together for one final, unforgettable celebration. The Olympic Closing Ceremony will be a powerful tribute to the spirit of the Games, further solidifying the Olympic Movement into the history of Los Angeles forever.Â \n\nÂ \n\nTheÂ **Paralympic Opening Ceremony**Â will ignite in theÂ **Stadium in Inglewood**Â on August 15, 2028. This incredible venue will set the stage to showcase the spectacular scale and magnitude of the limitless possibilities for LAâs first Paralympic Games in one of the most modern and impressive stadiums in the world.Â Â \n\nÂ \n\nOn August 27, 2028, theÂ **Paralympic Closing Ceremony**Â will be hosted at one of the most storied Games venues of all time, theÂ **LA Memorial Coliseum**. This presents an opportunity for the Paralympic Games to write a new chapter in the venueâs history, cementing its place in Los Angelesâ history and creating an impact that will be commemorated for generations to come. The Paralympic Closing Ceremony marks the final moments of the LA28 Games, creating an unforgettable legacy that will forever connect the Olympic and Paralympic Movement to Los Angeles.Â \n\nÂ \n\nAdditional information regarding the 2028 Olympic and Paralympic CeremoniesÂ will be identified and shared at a later date. All confirmed Olympic sports and venues announced to date are available for reference onÂ [www.la28.org](https://la28.org/en/games-plan.html). The updated Paralympic venue plan will all be announced at a later date following review and approval by the International Paralympic Committee Governing Board.Â \n\n\n\nSource: [https://la28.org/en/newsroom/la28-unveils-2028-olympic-paralympic-opening-and-closing-ceremony-locations.html](https://la28.org/en/newsroom/la28-unveils-2028-olympic-paralympic-opening-and-closing-ceremony-locations.html)",

      "title": "Cricket's chance of inclusion in the 2032 and 2036 Olympics",
      "text": "Sure, cricket is popular in Australia, but I can't help wonder whether it should be the sole or primary reason to include cricket in the 2032 Brisbane Olympics. If it were to be included, then cricket events might be likely in another location within Australia instead of Brisbane.\n\nLA 2028 committee already put softball and kayak events at another location, and it's willing to do the same to cricket soon. Recently, Brisbane seems unable to hold cricket events due to failed attempts to upgrade existing cricket venues of Brisbane.\n\nHowever, popularity and revenue shouldn't be just the reasons to add cricket into core sports program. Cricket has other obstacles to overcome.\n\nFrom what I see, multiple teams around the world, mostly countries where cricket isn't that popular, consist of mainly foreign players and less locals, especially T20 teams. Attendees and viewers will be disappointed to see what a team contains. I think limiting amount of teams to six for the 2028 Olympics must have been based on existing team roster (from T20 leagues).\n\nSpeaking of six national teams, such amount would be too low to make cricket appealing especially for permanent inclusion into Olympics. Even using the same nations wouldn't help much. But then I can't help wonder how this will affect rugby sevens events, which also limit the amount of teams to six.\n\nIf amount of teams were to increase, I can't help wonder whether more of the teams will have more local players representing their own nations.  More likely not much, I bet. I dunno any American-born citizen well trained to play cricket and to represent the US.\n\nSecondly, I shall remind you about corruption within the cricket world, which has been reported over and over. Need I say examples then?\n\nThirdly, the Twenty20 (T20) format itself might be the best possible way to attract casuals who are curious about the sport itself. Even longer formats (e g. ODI and Test) can't compete T20 well.\n\nHowever, is the T20 even commercially viable? Sure, very few ad breaks may attract anti-ads viewers. However, a T20 match lasting three hours total, almost the same length as baseball and basketball... and even flag football (also included for 2028), makes me wonder how many commercial breaks in comparison to those sports. If the amount is as much as that of soccer (football if that's what your country wants to call it), then I can't help wonder whether T20 is worth the time to broadcast live.\n\nNot to mention other short alternative formats: T10 and 100-ball. Why not one of those instead of (standard) T20? Well, why not propose a format that is more friendly to TV commercials, like a 90-minute cricket somewhat similar to soccer/football?\n\nNonetheless, even cricket itself still isn't popular outside Commonwealth nations [e g. the United Kingdom (home of long-gone British Empire) and Australia] and former British territories (e g. India and South Africa). One billion might have watched and enjoyed cricket, but I bet those numbers come from mostly South Asia, which contains former territories of the British India. In other words, other than those in South Asia, the remaining numbers may not that impressive.",

      "text": "Why do they continue to claim that the reasons for their non-inclusion in Paris and Los Angeles were kept secret, or that the selection process was very opaque and not transparent? Just go to for example the related articles at Inside the Games like [this](https://www.insidethegames.biz/articles/1116237/karate-president-criticises-ioc-paris24) and [this](https://www.insidethegames.biz/articles/1147844/karate-paris-2024-absence-fans-perplexed). The Paris organizing officials were on the record multiple times in saying that karate was left out of Paris because they wanted to focus on sports that appealed to social media and younger audiences. They also pretty much said that they didn't think karate had the appeal they were looking for. This can be seen in [this news article](https://www.connexionfrance.com/news/french-gold-medal-winner-sad-as-karate-dropped-from-paris-olympics/420489) for example. I'm confused: were the WKF not aware of such statements, or they were aware but were deliberately claiming that the reasons were kept secret, despite this not being accurate?\n\nIs it also weird how karate is the only sport to make such claims, whereas other rejected sports for LA like breaking, kickboxing, motorsport, etc. did not make such similar claims and took their rejections much better and did not claim that the reasons for their non-inclusion were withheld from them?",

[Hereâs an online time zone converter you can use](https://time.is/).  \n\n**Athletics â 8:00 to 12:00**  \nMenâs marathon T54, womenâs marathon T54, womenâs marathon T12, menâs marathon T12   \n\n**Powerlifting â 9:00 to 12:00**  \nMenâs -107kg final, womenâs -86kg final  \n\n**Canoe â 10:00 to 13:15**  \nWomenâs K1 200m KL1 semifinals, womenâs K1 200m KL2 semifinals, menâs V1 200m VL2 semifinals, womenâs K1 200m KL3 semifinals, menâs V1 200m VL3 semifinals, womenâs K1 200m KL1 finals, womenâs K1 200m KL2 finals, menâs V1 200m VL2 finals, womenâs K1 200m KL3 finals, menâs V1 200m VL3 finals  \n\n**Wheelchair Basketball â 10:30 to 12:00**  \nWomenâs bronze medal match: China vs. Canada   \n\n**Wheelchair Basketball â 13:45 to 15:45**  \nWomenâs gold medal match: Netherlands vs. United States    \n\n**Powerlifting â 14:00 to 17:00**  \nWomenâs +86kg final, menâs +107kg final  \n\n###Guide to the Sports and Classification System   \nWhile many of the 22 sports at the Paralympics have Olympics analogues, several are unique. [See here]( https://olympics.com/en/paris-2024/paralympic-games/sports) for an official list of guides and rules for each sport. [The BBC](https://www.bbc.com/sport/articles/crlr5e9378xo) also has great explainers, which include write-ups on the medal favourites.  \n\nA foundational component of the Paralympics is the classification system, which helps to ensure fairness in competition. Athletes participate in different classifications within their sport that are based on the impact of an individualâs impairment and are periodically adjusted. For more information from the International Paralympic Committee on how classifications are set and how athletes are assessed, [see here](https://www.paralympic.org/classification). Each sport at the Games has its own set of classifications and criteria, which you can read about [here](https://olympics.com/en/paris-2024/paralympic-games/paralympic-classification). Another great resource is [LEXI](https://lexi.global/), which provides helpful graphics.  \n\n###Where to Watch\n\n[For the countries that are grey in this image](https://preview.redd.it/ormqxighvfld1.jpeg?width=2532&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f7502e60a004e1131d3716695f70daa4314439d8), the [official IPC Youtube account](https://www.youtube.com/@paralympics) will be streaming many of the events live. In addition, here is a [list of international broadcasters that are showing the Games for free](https://old.reddit.com/r/olympics/comments/1f0zxi0/where_to_watch_the_paralympic_games_for_free_a/).\n\n###General Housekeeping  \nSince there'll often be multiple events running simultaneously, it's helpful to identify which sport you're watching (if it's not obvious from the context). You can create a header by entering four spaces then typing the name of the sport.\n\nThe mods strongly request that you flair up with the new flair system if you haven't already. They put a great deal of work into it during the offseason. If you don't want to reveal your country, itâs fine to choose the neutral Olympic rings flag. Relatedly, I'm not a mod of r/Olympics so I won't be able to help with things like removing comments, sorting the thread by new, etc.",

Off the court, Iâm into tech, music, and finding new ways to stay inspired. I came across RAOA and was instantly drawn to the kindness and generosity here. Itâs refreshing to see people lifting each other up just because they can.\n\nIâm still learning the ropes, but Iâm looking forward to getting involved, sharing some smiles, and maybe even sending a surprise or two.

Planning to buy tickets as a gift for my dad but if he is unable to get the time off work, is it likely that my tickets for snowboarding events will resell easily? I donât mind if i lose a percentage by reselling on the official website.\n\nEither that or i would maybe buy his tickets in the resale closer to the time, in which case Iâd be worried that i wonât manage to get any if its very competitive.\n\nAnyone have any knowledge/advice on this?",

The fact that the 2030 world cup will be hosted in 6 different countries just like euro 2020 is completely ridiculous imo. And of course, the club world cup. It isnât a completely horrible idea, but the whole event has been so poorly run and the american sports style walkouts are comedic. All of the broadcasting of europes big leagues like the prem are starting to copy the insufferable style of Espn etc. Halftime interviews, halftime showsâ¦ letâs not do this please.\n\nEdit: iâm not blaming americans for this, as someone who also watches american leagues like the NBA, the broadcast is literally unwatchable. Ads every 2 minutes after a timeout and the constant need to be entertained. I feel like FIFA and broadcasters are selling football out to make profit and this sets a very dangerous precedence",

      "text": "Yes, he's a world class player and would make any team in the world better than they were before, but do Bayern really need him? They already have Kane, Olise and Musiala are basically nailed on starters so that leaves the left/10 open to him, how would this even work? Too many players who want to receive the ball to feet, no runners in the attacking positions plus you don't even necessarily have a focal point in the box since Kane likes to do his imitation of a 10. All for a potential club record fee of over 110 million pounds from a club who notoriously rejected a higher Bayern bid to sell their academy graduate to Chelsea instead. \n\n  \nThis is when the xi needs a lot more work done on it, like mentioned Kane needs willing runners that he can find so a LW who suits that would benefit Bayern a lot more. Upamecano aside Kim doesn't seem to be a straight fit and Ito has had so many injury problems, Dier is leaving for Monaco. They desperately need a CB there. At RB, Kimmich can probably service the team from there much better but seems to think DM suits him more. Palhinha has been a complete waste of time and in terms of midfielders who suit Kompany's possession based style they are lacking in that department.",

      "text": "For some context I come from the US. Where Iâm from, most high schools (secondary schools) have teams but they usually arenât super great. Often times teams will get a Gridiron football player and teach them how to do a do a proper throw in, and then essentially just chuck the ball into the box every time they get a throw in, in the attacking half. Itâs a strategy that works very well. \n\nSo my question is why donât more professional or high level teams utilize this tactic. Throw ins are by far the most common type of set piece. A typical professional game will see a total of 35-40 of them per game. So why donât teams try and make full use of them? \n\nWe have seen it be very successful at the professional level. In the 2008/09 season stoke scored 24 goals off of long throws. More recently Wrexham has found success having Ben Tozer chuck the ball at their tall center backs.\n\nI suppose the issue is that the fields are larger and most teams just simply donât have the player  that is capable of doing so. But then that begs the question why are clubs training their youth players to be able to preform long throws?",

      "text": "Some people think itâs just a sport â just a game with a ball and players. For them, itâs entertainment, a way to pass the time.\nBut have you ever stopped to think what it really means?\n\nTo us, the everyday fans, football is a feeling. Yes, a real, powerful feeling. And Iâd like to tell you a bit about the incredible emotion it can give someone.\n\nI was a kid when I first started watching football â or rather, when I wanted to start watching it.\nMy brother used to watch games on TV, and Iâd sit there with him, genuinely enjoying it.\nBut I also felt guilty.\nI didnât know who those people were â the ones fans were shouting for, screaming their names from the stands. I had no idea why it all mattered so much.\nI felt out of place, like I was missing something.\n\nThen during one halftime break, a commercial aired. A man in a white jersey with long hair scored a header â it was quick, just an ad, but it left a deep impression on me.\nCurious, I asked my brother:\nâWho was that guy in the white kit who scored with his head?â\nHe replied: âThatâs Cavani. Edinson Cavani.â\n\nBy then, I already knew the big names â Messi, Ronaldinho, Zidane, Maradona. I even had a favorite: Carles Puyol, the heart of Barcelona and the captain of world football.\nBut Cavani? That name felt so unfamiliar. So I opened my computer, typed it into Googleâ¦\nAnd thatâs when the journey began. A journey that still continues today â and I hope it never ends.\n\nI started watching all of his matches. Every clip I could find. I read everything: his birthday, his childhood, his family.\nAnd I fell in love â not just with the player, but with the person, with everything that made him who he is.\n\nBack then, he was playing in Paris. For me, he was absolutely magical.\nEvery move fascinated me.\nAnd for the first time, I felt like I was watching something unrealistically beautiful on a football pitch.\nThe way he hit bicycle kicksâ¦ the way he could head the ball from any heightâ¦\nIt all made me realize that football isnât just a sport.\nItâs art.\n\nI was a Barcelona fan, but that didnât change the way I felt about Cavani. Nothing could.\n\nYears passed. My idol left Parisâ¦ then Valenciaâ¦ then Manchesterâ¦\nAnd eventually, even Europe.\n\nI still donât know how to properly express how painful that was. Words feel too small for it.\nBut the tears that come to my eyes even today â those are real.\nMaybe it all sounds overly sentimental.\nBut when I think about how the football world never truly appreciated such a brilliant strikerâ¦\nWhen I realize that many fans today probably donât even know who he is â or have simply forgotten himâ¦\nIt hurts. It truly hurts.\n\nI honestly donât even remember the exact moment I became a Cavani fan.\nBut I know one thing for sure: Iâll never stop being one.\n\nDuring every World Cup and every Copa AmÃ©rica, I supported Uruguay â not because of their form, not because of their playersâ¦\nBut because that was his country.\nEven now, after heâs retired from international football, in my heart heâll always be the fearless #21 â the one who stepped onto the pitch full of hunger and hope.\n\nEven today, when I watch Uruguay play â even without him â I often find myself holding back tears.\n\nSo if someone tells you football is just a gameâ¦\nBelieve me: itâs not.\n\nYes, having a favorite player and watching matches brings joy.\nBut it also brings pain. Deep, soul-level pain.\nBecause when you truly love this sport â it becomes part of you.\n\nAnd if you ever ask me, what is football?\n\nIâll tell you this:\nFootball is a feeling â a powerful one.\nItâs nostalgia.\nTimeless, eternal nostalgia.\nThe kind that never fades with time.\nThe kind that becomes a piece of your soulâ¦ forever.",

But looking at all countries the former Spanish colonies in Latin America have been more successful than the British ones (Anglo countries US/CAN/AU/NZ and others like Caribbean and African countries). Like for example, you have Argentina and Uruguay with really strong teams and winning WC's while there are no equivalent Anglo countries with that strength of football culture. Yes England has won it but non of her colonies have. In all WC history the Spanish speaking teams have performed better than English ones.\n\nSo if anyone has ideas, why has Spanish speaking countries of Latin America + Brazil have had stronger footballing cultures and history compared to the British offspring ones despite the Brits inventing the sport?",

      "text": "This summer has been wild for the Saudi Pro League. Traditionally, the league made headlines by bringing in stars at the tail end of their careers with the likes of Ronaldo, ManÃ©, Neymar. Basically players past their peak chasing massive paychecks. Can't blame them...\n\nThough what we see in the last couple transfer windows is a different strategy: young talents in their prime are moving to Saudi clubs. Kingsley Coman (29) to Al-Nassr, Darwin NÃºÃ±ez (26) to Al-Hilal, Enzo Millot (23) to Al-Ahli, and even teenage/early 20s prospects like Jhon DurÃ¡n and Marcos Leonardo. The league has actually set up a âPlayer Acquisition Centre of Excellenceâ to coordinate transfers and reduce the average age of foreign players (down from 29 two years ago).\n\nOn one hand, i totally get it. The money is insane. No taxes, Huge salaries. Millot reportedly earns â¬10M a year and his transfer fee was â¬30M.\n\nBut the player angle is tricky. Young players moving early for big money face acclimation challenges different culture, style of play, climate, and expectations. DurÃ¡n is already on loan back in Europe just 6 months after his mega transfer.\n\nIs this a genuine sporting ambition to raise the leagueâs prestige, or just an acceleration of âsportswashingâ with obscene salaries? Either way, it seems like a new era: prime players taking massive money earlier than ever.",

      "title": "The Turkish Football Farce: State-Backed \"Fraud\" Is Destroying European Competition, and UEFA Is Letting It Happen.",
      "text": "âFriends, we need to talk about the absolute sham that is being allowed to unfold in European football. As a fan from the Netherlands, I watched Vitesse Arnhem, a historic club, get dragged to the brink of extinction for financial mismanagement. They faced point deductions and the very real threat of having their professional license revoked. This is what we are told accountability looks like.\nâThen, I look at Turkey, and I see a system that can only be described as a blatant fraud on the sport we love.\nâThe \"big four\" Turkish clubsâGalatasaray, FenerbahÃ§e, BeÅiktaÅ, and Trabzonsporâare drowning in a combined debt of over one billion euros. Yet, do they face relegation? Do they face bankruptcy? No. Instead, they continue to spend, sign players, and compete in Europe as if nothing is wrong.\nâHow is this possible? Itâs simple: they are playing with a state-sponsored cheat code. When these clubs are on the verge of collapse, the Turkish government facilitates massive, multi-million-euro debt restructuring deals with state-influenced banks. It's a bailout, plain and simple. It's financial doping on a scale that makes a mockery of any notion of a \"fair playing field.\"\nâEven a massive English club would have been forced into administration and relegated multiple times over for this level of financial insanity. In the Eredivisie, which is ranked higher than the Turkish SÃ¼per Lig in UEFA's own coefficients, clubs have to be self-sufficient. They have to earn their success.\nâBut in Turkey, this cycle of debt and bailouts continues. When does this stop being \"mismanagement\" and start looking like what it is? It feels like a criminal enterprise. A system so opaque and illogical, built on propping up failed entities with external money, has all the hallmarks of a corrupt system designed to launder money and maintain political influence, not to foster sporting competition.\nâAnd the ultimate insult? For all their big talk and financial advantages, they consistently fail in Europe. They are a protected species, destroying the competitive balance for clubs that play by the rules, yet they can't even translate that unfair advantage into success. They get the money, the players, and the second chances, while the rest of us get to watch our clubs fight for survival under the constant threat of sanctions.\nâThis is not okay. This is not football. This is a cancer on the European game.\nâUEFA's so-called \"Financial Sustainability Regulations\" are a joke if they don't apply to everyone. Their soft-touch approach of fines and settlement agreements has failed. The time for talk is over.\nâIt's time for UEFA to grow a spine and act. For the sake of every club that operates responsibly, for every fan who believes in fair competition, these clubs must be banned from European football until they clean up their act and prove they can stand on their own two feet.\nâAnything less is an admission that European football is no longer a sport, but a politically-motivated farce.\nâ#BanTurkishClubs #UEFA #FinancialFairPlay #FFP #SÃ¼perLig #Eredivisie #Vitesse #FootballFraud #Galatasaray #Fenerbahce #Besiktas",

      "title": "The Luis Figo transfer to Real Madrid that changed El Clasico 25 years on",
      "text": "The Luis Figo transfer from BarÃ§a to Real Madrid is one of the most fascinating moments in football history. At the time, BarÃ§a fans felt shock and betrayal, Figo was their beloved captain, and he had joined their fiercest rivals. But in hindsight, that moment helped elevate both clubs commercially and globally. El ClÃ¡sico was already intense before 2000, but it was relatively local in its reach. After that transfer, it became the most watched football match outside the World Cup.\n\nBefore the Figo betrayal, Barcelonaâs resentment toward Madrid was aimed at the city and what it represented, the centralized Spanish state and the historic oppression of Catalunya. Real Madrid, as a football team, wasnât yet the full embodiment of that resentment. The Figo transfer changed that. Suddenly, Real Madrid became the direct symbol of the power and dominance Catalans had long opposed, and the rivalry turned deeply personal.\n\nFigo, a Portuguese outsider who had spent five years at BarÃ§a after transferring from Sporting Lisbon, likely didnât fully grasp the cultural and political weight of the gamble he was taking on with Perez. He and his agent believed Florentino PÃ©rez would lose the election (everyone at the time did), so they thought it was an opportunity to make quick money. The buyout clause was also a tactical move to extract more money from BarÃ§a or gain leverage. Figo and his agent underestimated PÃ©rez, who pulled off a shock victory and exercised the clause, triggering a storm that reshaped Spanish football forever.\n\nThe ripple effects are still being felt today. The move changed the relationship local Catalan fans have with non-Catalan stars. They now know those players are borrowed for a time and not theirs. No outsider will ever be placed above the club, not even Messi. Thatâs why, when the club faced near financial collapse in 2021, and it came down to choosing between the club or Messi, he was sacrificed. BarÃ§a werenât willing to mortgage their future for him. Local fans were hurt, but they understood it had to be done. Itâs mostly Messi fans outside the region who are still angry about how it ended.\n \nPlayers were also shocked at how the fans reacted to the Figo move and it has become a cautionary tale for any Barca star who thinks of moving to Real Madrid. Figo is persona non grata in Catalunya 25 years on. He has also been erased from Barcelona history, you can't find any trace of him at their museum, it's like he never existed which is honestly kinda hilarious to me considering how beloved he was before the move.",

The amount of football being played is reaching obscene levels and it's almost certainly going to have negative effects on the product.\n\nYou don't need to feel sorry for football players, nobody is saying that, but for us, the consumer, pushing players beyond their physical limits - to a point where performance levels will inevitably decline - is of absolutely no benefit to us, only detriment. We're heading down a path of more player injuries, shorter player careers, fewer moments of skillful brilliance and load management/injury luck being the defining factor in who wins trophies. Footballers are humans, not machines, and the amount of money you pay them does not change that.\n\nThere's also a huge danger of over saturation making the sport harder to follow which can lead to declining fan interest and fewer new fans. Don't you want to miss football? To be excited for the start of the new season after a few months off? The sport is just everywhere, 24/7, and it's draining, even without trying to watch everything.\n\nWe're at a stage now where major tournaments involving most of the world's top players are being staged 3/4 summers. I dread to think what next year's World Cup will look like. It feels like FIFA in particular are taking football's place as the world's number 1 sport for granted and are assuming it's fixed and permanent. It absolutely isn't and it needs nurturing, not rinsing for everything it's worth.",

It takes a long time for tournaments to become relevant, so maybe over the years well see more people understand the relevance of it. \n\nI feel there's an element of racism for people who have a problem with the tournament. As if to say that these inferior leagues shouldn't be allowed to participate with eurorpsn teams. \n\nAt this time club football is more competitive than international, so I am more interested in this tournament than the world cup.",

      "text": "For supporters of Laâ¯Liga clubs outside Realâ¯Madrid, BarÃ§a, and maybe AtlÃ©ticoâ¯Madrid, what would you call a fair revenue split compared to what exists now?\n\nBefore 2015, Real Madrid and BarÃ§a negotiated their own broadcast deals, taking most of the revenue. The Spanish Royal Decree Law 5/2015 introduced collective selling, with 50% of the pot shared equally among all 20 clubs. The rest is divided by sporting merit over the past five seasons (25%) and by social and commercial reachâsuch as fan base, ticket sales, and contribution to TV value (25%).\n\nEven with a cap limiting the richestâtoâpoorest gap at 3.5 to 1, transitional rules allowed Madrid and BarÃ§a to keep earnings close to preâ2015 levels. Their massive social and commercial reach and sporting success still ensures they dominate financially, leaving the other clubs to fight over the remainder, though it is still far more than they earned before 2015.\n\nHere is the dilemma: Laâ¯Liga needs Madrid and BarÃ§a because they generate most of the revenue, so if they left for the Super League or another new league, the hit would be huge. Have they grown too big for Laliga to the point that no revenueâsharing formula could avoid favoring them?\n\nThere are also sleeping giants like Valencia CF and Athletic Club that could grow to AtlÃ©ticoâ¯Madridâs revenueâgenerating level of around â¬450â500â¯million and help strengthen the league overall, and they should be encouraged to do so. Ironically, the Luis Figo transfer saga in 2000 gave Madrid and BarÃ§a a surge in global visibility and revenue, contributing to the imbalance seen today and making it hard for other clubs to realistically catch up.",

You can see the hunger â pressing smart, staying compact, making the most of set pieces. Itâs not just about surviving, itâs about problem-solving on the fly against technically superior sides.\n\nItâs also a perfect spotlight for emerging talent. You get to see how players and managers handle pressure and adapt under adversity, not just in their comfort zone.\n\nYeah, FIFAâs got its corruption and shady business â thatâs baked into the game at this point. Itâs a business before anything else. But even within that mess, tournaments like this remind you why football is still the most universal sport in the world.

Every new rule from Infantino seems more and more stupid to me. It's time for the bald man to go: he's only hurting football.*\n\nIn the summer of 2025, the revamped Club World Cup will be held in the USA, featuring 32 teams. FIFA may implement new rules for this tournament.\n\nSkySports journalist Kaveh Solhekol reported that clubs are required to field their strongest available squads for the World Cup. Additionally, any club that refuses to participate will be fined Â£445,000. Furthermore, owners cannot hold shares in more than one club.\n\nOther possible rules for the Club World Cup include:\n\n* Teams must arrive at the tournament camp 3-5 days before their first match.\n* Preliminary club rosters will consist of 26-50 players, with the tournament roster narrowed to 26-35 players.\n* Football federations will have a special transfer window from June 1-10.\n* Between June 7 and July 3, clubs may add a maximum of 2 players to their squads.\n* Players are allowed to play for only one team.\n\nSourse: [Main squads and penalties for withdrawal.

As a teenager I had myriad trials at professional teams, including Premier League, and I have played in the FA Cup, FA Vase and against many pro teams. \n\nIt might not be of interest to people given I never played a minute of league football, but ask me anything! (Caveat - I wonât be revealing certain details or the specific team I played for as thatâs easily locatable information online with which I donât wish to dox myself).",

For the first time in a long while, it looked like Luis Enrique had managed to build a tight nit community of people whose only motivation is to win, not mercenaries like the past. But it seems we've been wrong. Behind the scenes drama just unfolded and it has been reported that one of their talisman and a major piece in their European triumph is definitely out of the door this summer or next. Gianluigi Donnarruma relationship with the PSG hierarchy has been soured beyond repair and there are no talks about a new contract. Exit is the only way and a replacement has already been signed. For such a top goal keeper, we would be expecting PSG to be doing everything to keep him at the club. But no, they want him out. Why? I don't know. Maybe it's just the cruel nature of the football business.",

During my playing career I made 286 Premier League appearances. Blackburn Rovers purchased me for 2.4m in 1993, making me the most expensive goalkeeper in Britain, and I went on to win the League title with them in 1994/95 as Alan Shearer finished our top goalscorer. I was capped 11 times with England and made the squad for Euro '96 and the 1998 World Cup.\n\nSince my playing retirement in 2002, I have had goalkeeper coaching roles with Leicester City and Manchester City, assistant roles with Coventry City and Hull City, and managerial roles with the likes of Solihull Moors and now Redditch United. I joined the Reds at the start of this season!\n\n>Thank you all for your fantastic questions! Apologies I couldn't get through more of them but I had an enjoyable hour and a half reliving some past memories.\n>\n>Thanks all!",

      "text": "Football has a way of sticking with you. Itâs not just the trophies or the statsâitâs those moments that make you feel something.\n\nFor me, itâs the 2005 Champions League final. Liverpool were 3-0 down at halftime against AC Milan. It felt hopeless. Then Gerrard scores that header, and suddenly, you could feel the momentum shift. By the time Dudek made that save in the penalty shootout, I was barely breathing.\n\nWhatâs your moment? A goal, a match, maybe even a celebration that stuck with you. Letâs hear it.",

City it seems the same roles have been taken by CBs like Gvardiol and Akanji? Is it that Guardiola became more defensive and ball possessions oriented after many defeats in europe?",

(there were +30 more influential players in the top 5 leagues)\n2. he was really bad with Brazil in an international year... (With Brazil for fucks sake, is not like he's playing for Slovenia)\n3. He does not have the numbers to think that his BdO were robbed, he has \"good\" numbers, not awesome (excluding his amazing UCL)\n4. both Vini and Rodri are victims here, but not of the BdO, they are victims of the entitlement of Real Madrid and Florentino's ego.\n\nI think football needed to rethink the awards, with Messi and CR7 it was very clear, but without them maybe we need to question what are we praising. I think Rodri is the best and most important player on the best playing team in the world and the basis of the success of spain can't be underestimated because you \"don't get it\". I also think a lot of \"football influencers\" don't understand how important and good he is.\n\nI would have given the BdO to Vini, he is incredible and has had a year to be in the conversation, maybe he even deserved to win it... But I don't see any \"injustice\" or theft, I just see a club that thinks it deserves everything without explaining why, just crying and complaining.",

Within a couple months I have to say I'm delighted that Barca are on course to win La Liga and just beat Real in the cup final, after already trashing them in the Super Cup in January. \n\nI don't think a more entitled football club exists. The Ballon d'Or snub because one of their players wasn't going to win, the way they reacted to their CL exit, and now the Copa del Rey final - both what happened at the game and the drama about the ref before it. \n\nRudiger should be given a decent ban, I can't say for sure what I think it should be, but put him out for a few months anyway. Along with fining a host of their other players who also went mad at the end of the game. Honestly even expulsion from next season's Copa del Rey would be considered fair. \n\nAlso just the treatment of Carlo Ancelotti is awful. First of all, they're still in with a chance of winning the league, they probably won't especially now seeing as their players are all big babies and it'll cost them further points in the final 5 games. But this guy is a club legend, a portion of the fanbase have been horrible to him in the last month or so. There are rumours he could even be sacked or walk before the end of the season despite the league still to play for. They club world cup as well. You have guys like Courtois throwing shade at him publicly. \n\nWhat a shit club honestly. \n\n[](https://www.reddit.com/r/football/?f=flair_name%3A%22%F0%9F%92%ACDiscussion%22)",

Like I know players like Taarabt in the modern game get their \"X\" factor coached out of them but sometimes there are some outliers who still play like they are playing panna or cage football.\n\nSome will say like Cherki or Yamal or Doue but I can't see the similarities between them and Taarabt. Like the way those guys play does have elements of street football but Taarabt was the embodiment of a cage baller, an absolute showman, a nutmeg maestro. Bro just lives for nutmegs, sole rolls and backheels. Like the goal he scored against Fulham where he rolls the ball with his sole and hits it with the outside of his boot, pure artistry and anyone who's played like street football or even futsal knows that finish. (I know I'm glazing him so hard but the goal is just so beautiful). So are there any carbon copies of Adel Taarabt in current world football?",

      "text": "Here's the link to the video of Football legend Vinnie Jones \nhttps://v.redd.it/vldjuxcf566e1\n\nFrom the Times:\n\nArsÃ¨ne Wenger is right on offside â it should be daylight not toenails\n\nThe rule was invented to prevent goalhanging but over a century and a half later technology has turned offside calls into MRI scans that send every fan, in every stadium, into spasms of impatient anguish\n\nGraeme Souness, several years ago, advocated changing offside priorities so that if any part of the forward player was onside, he was legal. \n\nFrom BBC:\n\nFormer Arsenal boss Arsene Wenger, now chief of global football development at world governing body Fifa, had considered a âdaylightâ rule, where an attacking player would be regarded as onside if any part of his body overlapped a defender.\n\nWenger is now cautioning against that because the advantage would be too great.\n\nHowever, the International Football Association Board, recognises the growing influence of VAR has taken out the âmargin of errorâ.\n\nThere are no specific proposals as yet but the issue is being discussed at high levels of the game.  IFAB technical director David Elleray said: \"We all agree that it would be nice if goals weren't necessarily chalked off for a toenail or a nose. \n\nIt is part of an early debate but we are seeing if there are ways in which we could deal with the challenges.â",
