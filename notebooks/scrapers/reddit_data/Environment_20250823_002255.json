      "text": "With the recent fires in LA and the increase in environmental hostility do to climate change I think it’s time we start to think about leaving areas where these issues are the most prominent. Why are we encouraging the growth of cities like LA and Vegas who have to pipe in water from other states to support their populations? Why do we keep rebuilding cities like New Orleans which have been built in areas that are susceptible to flooding and hurricanes. Obviously we can’t just cut people off, but implementing policies to discourage the growth of these cities and encourage folks to migrate to more hospitable areas seems like a reasonable next step in the face of climate change. The amount of state and federal resources that these cities take up on a yearly basis due to constant recovery from disasters puts a significant strain on the system and diverts resources that could be used elsewhere. Insanity is doing the same thing over and over again and expecting a different outcome. I look forward to hearing your thoughts!",

However - you trade this with:\n\n\\- Cutting more trees (releases CO2 and reduces overall plantation on the planet)\n\n\\- Spending more water and energy (high carbon footprint)\n\n\\- Heavier bags > more transport costs and more emissions. \n\nI looked it up and it appears like you have to use the same bag at least 3 times to offset those negative effects. Which is almost never done. (I am willing to bet that 99% of bags, including big \"reusable\" ones which require 100+ usages to offset effects are never reused).\n\nIt's the same things with the straws. \n\nI would argue that climate change is a MUCH bigger problem and more urgent than plastic pollution, and any solution that trade the latter for the former is VERY BAD. \n\nAre we just making things worse with the regulations??",

It will make people less wasteful. No more low quality off brand planned obsolescence junk from China. People will no longer overspend on Temu and related places. People will be buying and exchanging much more secondhand items. Thrift stores and secondhand markets will become more widespread. Instead of throwing stuff away, there will be more jobs for restoration and item repair. Items will be reused instead of replaced. Food will not be wasted as much and people will be much smarter with their spending habits. \n\n\n2. Increased recycling. Companies that used to rely on outsourced and imported materials will now have to rely on domestic recycled materials. Paper and plastic will have tons of usable materials to recycle. Not to mention all the other stuff that can be recycled into something else. Local craftsmen and upcycling industries becoming more widespread? \n\n\nI could be right or wrong, and I would really like your input!",

      "title": "AI might be a net positive for the environment",
      "text": "Please take all calculations and sources with a grain of salt, as such things are generally hard to quantify. I also would be happy to get corrected if I made mistakes or misrepresented some data. I tried to balance myself out with sources from both sides. I'm an AI doomer myself, but at the same time I think that many environmental claims is an overreach. So I'm obviously have some biases.\n\n———————————————————————————————\n\nIMO there are three main talking points about AI, harming the environment:\n\n- Energy consumption\n- Carbon footprint and Greenhouse gases (GHG) in general\n- Water scarcity and pollution\n\nI sorted sources about negative impacts at the top of each section and about negative impact - on the bottom.\n\n## 1. Energy consumption\n\nAs of 2024, [Data centers accounted for about 1.5% of global electricity consumption, with AI accounted for 15% of total data centre energy demand accordingly.](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/ai-will-drive-doubling-of-data-center-energy-demand-by-2030/) Therefore we can say that AI itself is using around 0.225% of global energy reserves.\n\n[Predicted share of energy usage for data centers by 2030 is between 5 and 20%.](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/ai-will-drive-doubling-of-data-center-energy-demand-by-2030/) Considering that AI it still on it's growth and can take over up to 50% of all data center's resources, in 2030 it can be responsible for 2.5 up to 10% of all energy consumption (20 up to 90 times more, than of now) which is quite radical, but not unrealistic prediction.\n\nNevertheless, as of right now, [ML-related technologies is able to provide 15% improvement in grid efficiency and 10–20% increase in battery storage efficiency](https://www.mdpi.com/2073-4433/15/10/1250) and [20–30% relative efficiency gains in cell and module R&D.](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0958305X241256293)\nSame magnitude of efficiency gains is also the case for all clean and non-clean energy sources, by forecasting the weather and autoadjusting solar panels, micromanaging power grids and plants, predicting deposits of fossil energy sources and so on. \n\nI think safe to say, that estimated energy gain overall will equal to or most likely surpass even the most pessimistic prognosis of 10% energy consumption from AI alone by 2030.\n\n————————————————————————————————\n\n## 2. Carbon footprint and GHG in general\n\nAccording to [ICEF report from November 2024](https://www.icef.go.jp/wp-content/themes/icef/pdf/2024/roadmap/15_ICEF2.0%20GHG%20Emissions%20from%20AI_stand%20alone.pdf), (This link will download PDF file!) AI’s total GHG emissions are estimated at 100–300 million tonnes CO2, or roughly 0.2-0.6% of global emissions. With that, operational emissions are around 0.05% while manufacturing servers, chips, facilities, model trainings and life-cycle impacts make up the remainder.\n\nAt the same time AI can [reduce global GHG emissions by 5–10% by 2030](https://thesustainableagency.com/blog/environmental-impact-of-generative-ai/), via optimized grids, predictive maintenance, and smart agriculture and, additionally, [cuts of up to 5.3 gigatons CO2 (another 5–10% of current emissions)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S277242712200122X) - through applications in transport, buildings, and supply chains.\n\n[One specific research](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-025-97110-3) (from month ago) from China indicates, that correlation between % of AI adoption and % of reducing carbon footprint (1% and 0.0395% accordingly) is quite sustainable and universal across the industries. But hard to say of this correlation will hold with future increasing AIfication of industries.\n\n————————————————————————————————\n\n## 3. Water scarcity and pollution\n\n[Apparently in US AI is responsible for 0.5-0.7% of total annual water withdrawal](https://oecd.ai/en/wonk/how-much-water-does-ai-consume). If source took a data of water consumptions by data centers in general (it most likely the case, as most of the articles do so), then actual numbers will be a 15% of 0.5-0.7%, which is 0.075-0.105% accordingly.\n\nConsidering that most of the world AI infrastructure is located in US and China, safe to say, that for the rest of the world this percentages is significantly smaller.\n\nThe real concern, however, is the water pollution and separate cases of mismanagement from the corporations. [Quote: \"Google’s planned data centre in Uruguay, which recently suffered its worst drought in 74 years, would require 7.6 million litres per day, sparking widespread protest.\"](https://sdgs.un.org/sites/default/files/2024-05/Gupta%2C%20et%20al._AIs%20excessive%20water%20consumption.pdf)\n(This link will download PDF file!)\n\n[Recent article from Politico](https://www.politico.com/news/2025/05/06/elon-musk-xai-memphis-gas-turbines-air-pollution-permits-00317582) about air pollution from xAI data center is also seems to me as a fair critique.\n\nHere is a positive aspects:\n\n[AI irrigation can reduce water usage by 30-50% while increasing yields by 20–30% (which is 5–8% savings of global agricultural withdrawals if deployed worldwide).](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2772375525002151)\n\n[AI acoustic and pressure-based leak detection is already working and have 80–97% accuracy, cutting non-revenue water losses by 20–40%. Given that networks lose ~30% of supply globally (the most distant and arid places usually suffer the most), AI is saving 6–12% of treated water.\n](https://www.waterrf.org/serve-file/2024_IWS-Challenge-Solution_Case-Western-CWD.pdf)\n(This link will download PDF file!)\n\nSame goes for demand forecasting, pump optimization, water quality assessment and many other projects, totaling up to 12% of the saved fresh water worldwide (if implemented worldwide as well, which is not the case for now). Some of this solutions is already implemented and working, although mostly in the water hungriest areas, like parts of Africa, China and India.\n\nI think it's crucial to point out, that most of the water scarcity-related suffering is mostly occurring far from data centers and their water sources. And this problem is more of a logistical one (how to transport the water to the arid areas), than of sheer amount of fresh water world supplies.\n\n————————————————————————————————\n\nI want to highlight, that AI still have an impact on environment and it's a right thing to strife for reducing the environmental impact in any area. But I believe that misinformation, toxicity and alarmism eventually will harm the both sides of this debates.",

      "text": "No doubt harming our planet is a moral issue in and of itself. But I tend to think about human interests first. And that involves cutting emissions and swapping our grid to carbon neutral sources asap, but not going back to mud huts and stagnating at that level of tech, and not cutting down the amazon to farm. I remain optimistic but regularly disappointed that we will one day get our sh!t together as a species and ideally be able to provide a quality of life similar to a middle class westerner to everyone, and a better quality of life for future generations, while not causing species to go extinct at a faster rate than new ones emerge, and not using resources at a faster rate than they replenish, but I know our impact will never be zero and we have a long way to go. I alsi realize it probablysounds like a pipe dream to many too. Swapping out fossil fuels for lithium mines for batteries or nuclear is a much better option, but we all know that it doesn't equal zero harm to the environment too. Perhaps it gets us to a manageable point though. That is my opinion.\n\nAnyway, my questions and hypotheticals:\n\nI imagine in a hypothetical situation in another universe, if Earth was going to go into an ice age, then our goal would become creating lots of emissions so that people aren't displaced by glaciers, we don't have a massive extinction events, and the quality of life of humans doesn't drop. But I know some people might take the ethical view that it would be wrong to interviene with nature in this manner.  What would be your take here?\n\nAlso what is the balance you see as appropriate for action? I know a green revolution will create new different jobs, but if given the choice of allowing a single species of algae to go extinct to save a million jobs today, I think that woukd be extreme. But letting the amazon die to save a single job is extreme. What is the appropriate balance? If using cheao and dirty fuels lets the developing world get out of poverty twice as quick or 10x as quick (hypothetical, I don't think this is the case and I know we are heloing them invest and things like solar are quite cheap now), at what rate would you at least find it acceptable  for them to do so to save lives before swapping to carbon neutral?\n\nIf you could push a button and every human would just live in a cabin in the woods prior to the industrial revolution and never advance further, but we would have none of the environmental issues of today, would you do it? Or do you feel we have a duty to advance as a species and eventually take off to the stars, teraform barren planets, and spread Earth based life to the cosmos? Or do you have more of a misanthropic view and just see us as a virus that needs to die here?\n\nDo you think climate change will extinct us as a species? Simply  risk a global societal collapse?  Or just make life much harder? No doubt with the wet bubble effect, displacement of humans, extreme storms, rains and floods in some areas, extreme droughts and fires in other areas, making farming much harder, and the extinction of many potential useful species and biomes is an existential threat and should be at the top of our list. I just want to guage how bad you think things will be? Hiw bad they can be with intervention? Or could be if we never interviened?\n\nAre you pro or anti nuclear? Particularly fission power?\n\nJust to clarify with some of these questions, we can have our cake and eat it too I know. We can maintain what we have and advance further if we go carbon neutral and tackle other issues. I only ask the extreme hypothetical questions as a philisophical and ethical question.",

Water, beer, beverages, canned goods, hospital supplies such as sterile water bottles and IV fluid bags etc... if you think about  one store... then think about the potential global volume  of liquid  that has been removed from the environment and thus the water cycle... that has to have some significant impact. Even though it may not appear to be a direct cause of some environmental issues, it has to have a ripple effect, if you will. This is a relatively new phenomenon in the history of the Earth. I am not well educated but just pondering  for a few minutes... it is no wonder  polar ice is melting. The amount of water being held up has caused the water cycle to be altered and in order to maintain homeostasis and replace the loss... maybe? Just maybe????",

      "text": "Hey, Environmental Engineering student here. I’m currently doing a thesis on lithium mining and its effects on the environment and energy transition. I’m no expert on renewables or anything, just a student trying to get my degree. As you can probably tell by now, enligsh is not my first language - I’m from South America. All the research I’ve done so far really makes me wonder how we can get out of this mess. Especially in countries like mine. Obviously I know that we need more effective climate policies and everything, but inside me I ask myself: how to feed 8 billion people? how to fuel airplanes? \n\nI know the problem is the economic system. \nI just want to know if someone else wonders this too.",

It feels like most articles focus on how we’re screwed or how we should’ve acted 20 years ago to avoid catastrophe. And they’re right, but it feels so fucking overwhelming after reading it over and over. It’s important to know how badly we’re screwed but it feels like too much sometimes.\n\nI really appreciate the posts that offer a bit of hope—showcasing the incredible work of the world’s smartest minds, the new laws being passed, and the breakthroughs in science and business that give us a bit of a chance. Those stories remind me that progress *is* being made.\n\nFor those in the same boat as me, I recommend reading a few positive articles every day. Here are a couple of good sites I’ve found: **Environment America** and **The Daily Climate** tend to have a more balanced and optimistic tone. They also gather news from multiple sources. Personally though, I’m also looking for more stories about business and scientific breakthroughs.\n\nI’ve also recently started an email newsletter called **Extant**, with informative, positive articles I’ve read and liked in the past few days. I send news in four categories: *science, business, politics, and activism*. If you’re also tired of the doomscrolling, feel free to join here: [Extant](https://extantclimate.org). 2 emails per week, just articles. No ads, nothing.\n\n(edit) I fixed the link above, it was glitching out. In case you all were signing up before.",

Too hot or cold to live in a region? Everyone will just move! Natural disasters? Relocate! Rising sea levels? Copy the Netherlands, every country can have their own wall. Since the dawn of time humans have adapted and thrived in shitty environments, why wouldn't we now? Honestly I have no idea what to say to this. I've brought up potential border crisis, poorer people dying disproportionally, etc., but it doesn't seem to appeal to his humanity the way it does for me. He's sure it's overblown and just democratic fearmongering to scare the people into submission. I get that I probably won't convince him, and I'm not exactly looking too, but I wonder what to say to people like this. I've never met anyone who agrees that global warming is manmade and is still convinced that everyone is making a big fuss out of nothing because we can just extinguish the fires and run from the flooding.",

Chief among these was the announcement to \"reconsider\" President Joe Biden's \"Clean Power Plan 2.0,\" which was a [group of regulations](https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/epa-limits-4-types-power-plant-pollution-sweeping/story?id=109579547) targeting coal and natural gas power plants announced last year....\n\n>While coal-fired electricity has become \"cleaner than ever,\" according to the [U.S. Department of Energy](https://www.energy.gov/articles/clean-coal-crucial-american-jobs-energy-security-and-national-supply-chains#:~:text=Coal-fired%20electricity%20generation%20is,compared%20to%20plants%20without%20controls), the fossil fuel is still responsible for significant greenhouse gas emissions and environment-polluting coal ash. So \"clean coal\" is a bit of a misnomer, sometimes referring to types of technology used to physically clean coal before it is burned or capture carbon related to its burning, according to Michelle Solomon, senior policy analyst at [Energy Innovation](https://energyinnovation.org/bio/michelle-solomon/).\n\n>\"Burning coal could never be technically considered clean regardless of the treatment applied to it before combustion – it will always emit the largest concentration of greenhouse gases of any fossil fuel, and soil and water pollution from coal and coal ash (what's left after it's burned) will never go away,\" Solomon said. \n\n[Trump wants 'clean' coal, but there's no such thing - ABC News](https://abcnews.go.com/US/trump-clean-coal-thing/story?id=119920490)",

      "text": "As an average American who has started to see the effects of climate change in the past couple years, I can’t help but feel immense guilt and anxiety about everything.\n\nI’ve already drastically reduced my red meat consumption, started using a water filter, plan to drive a non-Tesla EV (hopefully) soon, and generally stopped wanting/buying so much “stuff” and only replacing clothes/tech/etc. when needed. The environment is also one of my top priorities when voting.\n\nHowever, I do fly relatively regularly. One of my main hobbies is visiting theme parks, so I take 2-3 transcon flights to visit places like Disney World and Universal Orlando. Additionally I join in on 1 or 2 family vacations a year to various other places (usually domestic, but there’s a couple international destinations we are planning) and am part of a group of friends that live across the U.S. and we typically fly to meet up once a year.\n\nThese 4-6 flights a year are to do things that I enjoy and spend time with people I love, so they contribute a lot to my mental health, happiness, and wellbeing. It’s not just to post on social media that I went somewhere. But at the same time, sometimes one flight emits more than what the world’s poor emit in a whole year.\n\nI always take nonstop flights out of my major hub city, fly economy, and am a relatively light packer, so I seem to have the basics covered. However I do feel I can and should be doing more.\n\nMany of my flights are at night, but is it worth potential extra cost and a night of the trip to fly during the day if possible due to the contrail effect? I’ve seen conflicting information online on this and wondering if it is significant or not.\n\nAre there any reputable carbon offsetting programs? Many of the programs seem like they don’t really accomplish anything, but then again I haven’t really researched this very much.\n\nIs there something else I’m missing that could reduce my impact? Any tips for not being overwhelmed by guilt and anxiety regarding climate change? Or maybe I really should feel guilty for being part of the 10% that flies regularly for leisure and actually need to reconsider my lifestyle, I don’t know.",

      "text": "I've been watching the L.A. fire scene, and it shocked me to a point, I had to find solutions. To my surprise, they weren't hard to find? For people who currently have homes, most likely they are made out of wood, it might be covered in plaster, and insulated I hope? I don't know why wood has been the chosen material to build homes, wood is extremely vulnerable to fire, but if that's what you're living in, here's a few ways to protect it if there's a fire coming near. Get an extensive sprinkler system, or buy a bunch of cheap sprinklers and diy a system all around your house, and any extended property like a garage -install the sprinklers especially on your roof. Then you might want to get something that will hold quite a bit of water, so if you're faucets inside stop flowing, you have your private reserve at the ready. If the fire comes near, turn your sprinklers on and saturate your home, the roof sprinklers are the most important, make sure they're going full blast, and leave it on, even if you have to evacuate, leave the sprinklers on... It should save anything that is soaked, fire won't burn that. The other option if you don't want to use water is to get a tank of fire retardant, and put that through the sprinkler system, for extra security. \n\nFor anyone rebuilding, for crying out loud, don't use wood to build your new house! Use bricks, stone, concrete, use building material that is fire resistant. Those materials will hold together for a long time, but while you're at it, make it earthquake proof as well, yes that can be done, it's a matter of stacking things in a pattern, they might sway a little in a quake, but they'll come out standing strong. Make sure the roof is fire proof, and don't plant anything around the house, put plants in fireproof planters all around the house, and give it fire resistant insulation, you should wind up with a safe haven to call your new home. \n\nThe best way to live in this land, is to get to know the environment you're living in, and build according to what you might encounter? I don't understand the people who build houses in Tornado Alley, or directly on a fault line? Or at Beach level in tsunami territories? I haven't figured out the practical ways to advise them yet, so I'm going with my friends in California, and giving my learn not to burn advise. Anyone have any ideas I didn't mention? I'd love to hear from you?",

      "title": "Can anyone tell me why this idea I have is stupid and if there's something to it after all?",
      "text": "I have no expertise in this matter, I just thought of this crazy idea for carbon-capturing (perhaps the product over-caffeination) and am curious to get feedback on it. Please let me know if there is a better sub for this.\n\n(I'm going to include a bunch of \"facts\" here. Though I acknowledge I might be wrong about any of them, to save time I'm not going to say that caveat every time, so just feel free to tell me which \"facts\" are not in fact facts.)\n\nOne potential direction of technological innovation for mitigating climate change is finding a viable method of carbon-capturing (which would lower the amounts of carbon dioxide in the air and thus mitigate the greenhouse effect, increased ocean acidity, etc.)\n\nBasically what I'm wondering is whether a biological approach as follows could work. A very efficient carbon-capture process is photosynthesis. The more carbon is \"captured\" in organic material by plants, the less of it there is in the air. To go towards a significant improvement, one would need to facilitate the capturing of carbon by plants and the *storage* of said carbon, to make sure it does not go into another living being that would turn it back to CO2 and heat. To offset carbon emissions from greenhouse gas, one would need to store as much carbon as has been stored in fossil fuels. The problem is that in the natural order of things, newly generated organic material takes up a lot of space, and is often quite attractive to animals (or to humans, who want to burn it for energy). \n\nIdeally, you would want to get plants to do photosynthesis and milk the organic material out of them in a dense and easily protectable form. I am wondering if a particularly efficient way to do this is to utilize honeydew-producing insects (such as aphids, scale insects, and others). These animals leave behind a dense form of organic material (the honeydew). If you are able to:\n\n1. Control an environment enough to guarantee the aphids are numerous on the one hand, but not numerous enough to kill the plants on the other.\n2. Prevent ants and other animals from collecting the honeydew.\n3. Collect the honeydew efficiently.\n\n...then you are producing organic material (with solar energy) in a storable way.\n\nHow is this better than just having a lush forest?\n\n1. It takes up less space -- the aphids regulate the growth of the plant, and direct the energy it produces with the carbon into a denser state. The reason we don't have forests is humans cut them down to make room for farmland.\n2. A lush open-air forest can't produce that much excess organic material because the animal populations of that forest would grow in size and consume all those sugars (and as opposed to aphids, they would not leave behind concentrated carbon, but will break it down back to CO2 and water).\n\nIs this idea completely dumb or, conversely, is it so obvious to experts that it is being studied/developed as we speak?\n\nThanks in advance!",

      "text": "Hi all everyone,  \nThere are some amazing food statistics from Our World in Data that show how unfair and unsustainable the current food system is.\n\n# LAND STATISTICS\n\nDeserts and ice cover a quarter of ALL land, leaving three quarters as ‘habitable’.We use 44% of that habitable land for agriculture! Nearly half. It is equal to about 5 TIMES the size of the United States! Yet here is the really UNFAIR bit. The way it breaks down, over 80% of this farmland feeds the rich. We get most of the livestock meat and dairy.  But the rich are a really small fraction of the world's population! As Our World in Data shows, “Meat, dairy, and farmed fish provide just 17% of the world’s calories and 38% of its protein.” (This includes crops like soy bean that are fed to cattle.)  \n[https://ourworldindata.org/global-land-for-agriculture](https://ourworldindata.org/global-land-for-agriculture)\n\n# THE POOR\n\nThe rest of the human race is mainly vegetarian, and are fed by 1 USA worth of land. The rich consume 4 USA's worth of land in livestock production - but this only feeds 17% of humanity's calories and just over a third of our protein. That sucks and is obviously unfair - and then we'll have another 2 billion people by 2050. And they'll (hopefully) be richer, and want to enjoy what we do. But there's no way to do it!\n\n# PRECISION FERMENTATION\n\nScientists have found natural cultures out in the environment which can be brewed up using renewable energy. Solar power captures 4 TIMES the sunlight of photosynthesis. The whole process is 10 TIMES more land efficient than even soy beans! [https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2015025118](https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2015025118)\n\nBut unlike soy beans, solar panels can be put on rooftops and in deserts and even floated on fresh water reservoirs (which could save precious fresh water from evaporation.) Futurist Tony Seba predicts 'Precision Fermentation' could scale up and bring costs down to the point where it bankrupt meat and dairy farming.  If we assume this - then we could return 4 United States worth of land to natural ecosystems.\n\nThis would soak up so much CO2 it could potentially store “332–547 Gt CO2”   \n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41893-020-00603-4](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41893-020-00603-4)\n\nASSUMING we can clean up our energy and land use and ***actually reach*** net zero by 2060 - what temperature reduction would this range give the world?\n\n#",

A working fluid (CO₂ or ammonia) absorbs heat from the ocean surface, causing the fluid to evaporate and rise through the system.\n\n        Heat Rejection:\n        The heated refrigerant flows to a heat rejection chamber, where it condenses within an insulated pool, transferring the extracted heat to the desalination process. The cooled fluid returns to repeat the cycle.\n\n    Insulated Pool with Integrated Desalination\n\n        Evaporation:\n        The insulated pool captures the rejected heat, creating a warm environment that maximizes evaporation. The system is insulated to reduce energy loss.\n\n        Condensation:\n        A transparent cover traps evaporated water vapor, which is directed toward inclined condensation panels. These panels cool the vapor, causing it to condense into fresh water.\n\n        Freshwater Collection:\n        Condensed freshwater is funneled into gravity-driven drip channels leading to storage tanks. A separate outlet for brine ensures salinity is managed effectively.\n\n    Concentric Structural Design for Stability and Efficiency\n\n        Stability and Efficiency:\n        The central thermosyphon is supported by radial horizontal arms, ensuring stability. Solar panels and flotation devices are arranged concentrically to optimize space for both energy collection and heat rejection.\n\n        Energy Optimization:\n        Solar panels provide auxiliary power, enhancing energy efficiency, and reducing reliance on external energy sources. They also serve as partial shading for the desalination pool, reducing evaporation losses.\n\n    Modular, Scalable, and Autonomous Operation\n\n        Modular Pods:\n        The system is designed with modular components, allowing for easy scalability to meet the needs of different regions. Pods can be connected or disconnected as required, offering flexibility for varying community sizes and environmental conditions.\n\n        Autonomous Maintenance:\n        Autonomous robots or drones can be deployed for cleaning, inspection, and maintenance, reducing human intervention and extending the system's lifespan.\n\n    Advanced Environmental Protection\n\n        Double-Wall Heat Exchanger:\n        The heat exchanger is designed with a double-wall construction, allowing any refrigerant leaks to safely vent to the atmosphere, preventing contamination of the water and the formation of carbonic acid.\n\n        Eco-Friendly Coatings:\n        Non-toxic, anti-fouling coatings are applied to all exposed surfaces to prevent biofouling and corrosion. These coatings are made from sustainable, bio-based materials that minimize environmental impact.\n\n        Brine Management:\n        Brine discharge is managed using advanced filtration or concentration techniques, reducing the environmental impact. In some cases, brine can be converted into valuable byproducts like salt or magnesium for industrial uses.\n\nEnergy Efficiency and Carbon Capture\n\n    Energy Storage and Hybrid Power Systems\n\n        Battery Storage:\n        Solar power is stored in batteries, ensuring continuous system operation during low sunlight or at night. This energy storage reduces the system's reliance on external power sources.\n\n        Hybrid Power:\n        Integration with wave energy converters or tidal turbines offers a consistent power supply, particularly in remote coastal areas, further increasing system efficiency.\n\n    Carbon Capture and Sequestration\n        Carbon Capture Units:\n        The system can be equipped with carbon capture technologies that extract CO₂ from the atmosphere or seawater, sequestering it in deep oceanic storage or in mineralized forms, contributing to climate change mitigation.\n\n    Phase Change Materials (PCMs):\n        Thermal Energy Storage:\n        The incorporation of PCMs within the system can store excess heat for later use, balancing fluctuations in energy demand and improving overall thermal efficiency.\n\nSymbiosis with Marine Ecosystems\n\n    Artificial Reefs and Aquaculture Platforms\n\n        Marine Habitat Creation:\n        The flotation devices and structural components can function as artificial reefs, providing habitat for marine organisms. This promotes biodiversity and supports marine ecosystems.\n\n        Aquaculture Integration:\n        The system can be integrated with sustainable aquaculture practices, such as fish farming or seaweed cultivation, providing additional food sources while also helping maintain water quality.\n\n    Seaweed Farming for Carbon Sequestration\n        Seaweed farms could be cultivated alongside the thermosyphon units, contributing to carbon sequestration while also supporting marine biodiversity and providing sustainable bio-products.\n\n    Eco-Friendly Designs for Marine Life\n        The system employs acoustic dampeners and low-profile designs to reduce noise pollution and physical disturbance to marine species, ensuring the system operates harmoniously within its environment.\n\nOutreach and Community Engagement\n\n    Public Awareness and Education\n        An interactive dashboard can track system performance and environmental impact, offering transparency and educational opportunities for local communities, NGOs, and the general public.\n\n    Eco-Tourism Integration\n        The system can incorporate eco-tourism elements, such as observation platforms or guided tours, generating additional revenue to support ongoing operations and increasing awareness of sustainable ocean technologies.\n\n    Collaborations with Governments and NGOs\n        Partnerships with environmental organizations, local governments, and academic institutions can help further research, provide funding, and support system adoption in coastal regions.\n\nConclusion: A Scalable and Sustainable Solution\n\nThe refined thermosyphon system offers a self-sustaining, environmentally friendly solution for addressing global challenges such as water scarcity, ocean warming, and climate change. By integrating renewable energy, eco-friendly materials, modular design, and innovative cooling technologies, the system can be scaled to meet the specific needs of various regions while fostering symbiotic relationships with marine ecosystems. It represents a forward-thinking approach to sustainable freshwater production, climate adaptation, and ocean conservation, with the potential for broad adoption by coastal communities, governments, and environmental organizations.",

Over the past several years, I have been studying climate change in depth, understanding its physics, mathematics, economic impact, societal effects, and much more.\n\nI am currently working on a unique solution that, when sprayed from the sky using simple hydrogen balloons, can sequester CO2 with very low activation energy. This solution will not only capture CO2, but it will also store it for millennia in solid form once it falls to the ground. Additionally, it has the potential to enrich the soil and benefit both humans and the environment, without causing any harm.\n\nI plan to file a patent for this invention and need to publish my research paper. I am conducting this independent study and require some financial assistance to acquire the necessary instruments to obtain precise experimental readings. These instruments will be crucial in proving the effectiveness of my solution and in convincing others that it works.\n\nI would be extremely grateful for any help or support you can provide in this process.\n\nThank you.",

      "text": "Since I relocated after my house burnt down, I have found daily solace in walking through the [Ballona Wetlands](https://www.ballonafriends.org/). The breeze carries the scent of salt and earth, and I often pause to watch egrets wading through the shallow pools, their white feathers stark against the dark mud.\n\nOnce, I watched a heron silently stalk its prey, its graceful movements a reminder that this patch of wildness is still thriving — for now. The Ballona Wetlands is a sanctuary in an increasingly urban sprawl, a reminder that nature has its own quiet strength. But now, that strength feels fragile.\n\nIf you aren’t familiar with the Ballona Wetlands, they are a vital lifeline for Southern California’s fragile environment. Located between Marina del Rey, Playa del Rey, and Culver City, bordered by Lincoln Boulevard to the west, Jefferson Boulevard to the south, and Ballona Creek to the north, they are one of the last remaining coastal wetlands in the region. The Wetlands provide vital flood protection and a natural buffer against rising sea levels.\n\nThey’re also home to endangered species like the **Belding’s Savannah sparrow** and the **California least tern**, whose survival depends on this rare, marshy habitat.   \n\nThe [Trump Administration](https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/climate-energy/us-epa-reconsider-biden-clean-power-plant-rule-2025-03-12/) announced plans to dismantle over 30 environmental regulations established during the Biden era, rolling back protections for clean air, water, and climate efforts. Through this action, the EPA seeks to further limit which wetlands receive federal protections by narrowly implementing the ruling from a 2023 Supreme Court case, [Sackett v.

I am also hoping to understand how members of these subreddits imagine and view the future regarding climate change, and what they hope and want from social media going forward. \n\nØ  **What am I doing here?**\n\nPrimarily, I will be observing how your subreddit works, and how Reddit as a social media platform serves people interested in climate change. As part of this, I will be reading, thinking about, and taking notes on the sort of things I read here, and may make copies of posts that are relevant to my research. These copies will be completely anonymised, and won’t be directly quoted in my research, but will inform it. More information about this is below.\n\nØ  **Will the outcomes of the research be published?**\n\nThe primary outcome of this research will be a doctoral thesis (hopefully), but may also include published articles and presentations at conferences. You will not be identifiable in any of these. I will also make a post to my Reddit profile when anything related to this research is published.  \n\nØ  **Who has reviewed the research project?**\n\nThis project has been reviewed by the SEED (School of Environment, Education and Development) Ethics Committee at the University of Manchester.\n\n**What would my involvement be?**\n\nØ  **What would I be asked to do if I took part?**\n\nNothing – you are not obliged to do anything specifically for this part of the research. I may interact with you on posts/comments, and may later put out a public advertisement inviting yourself and other Reddit users for an interview, but you will be provided with further details and asked for your consent at that time. This would be done via email. \n\nØ  **Will I be compensated for taking part?**\n\nThere is no compensation for taking part in any part of this research.\n\nØ  **What happens if I do not want to take part or if I change my mind?**\n\nIf you wish for me to exclude my future interactions with yourself or any future content (comments, posts etc.) produced by you from my research, please contact me directly at [cameron.coakley@manchester.ac.uk](mailto:cameron.coakley@manchester.ac.uk). Because the copies of posts I make will be anonymised as soon as they are collected, I won’t be able to remove data that has already been collected from my study. If you would like further information about this, please contact me via email.\n\n**Data Protection and Confidentiality**\n\nØ  **What information will you collect about me?** \n\nAs part of observations, I may record fieldnotes about public interactions I have had within subreddits. These may contain quotes, which would be paraphrased if included in a published output of this research. I may also collect screen-captures of specific posts, particularly when the post is an image or video. No personal identifiable information will be collected, and copies of posts will be entirely anonymised (usernames and any personal information will be removed, and the original copy deleted). \n\nØ  **Under what legal basis are you collecting this information?**\n\nWe are collecting and storing this personal identifiable information in accordance with UK data protection law which protect your rights.  These state that we must have a legal basis (specific reason) for collecting your data. For this study, the specific reason is that it is “a public interest task” and “a process necessary for research purposes”. This research is being conducted in accordance with Reddit’s Terms and Conditions, User Agreement, Privacy Policy, and Public Content Policy. \n\n \n\nØ  **Will my participation in the study be confidential and my personal identifiable information be protected?** \n\n \n\n·      Data from posts will be anonymised immediately after it is collected, and the original (unanonymised) version deleted.\n\n·      Data will be stored on my personal, encrypted laptop, before being uploaded to a secure University of Manchester server.\n\no   At the end of the project we will deposit a fully anonymised dataset\\] in an open data repository where it will be permanently stored. We will use ICPSR. Researchers at other institutions and others can access the anonymised data directly from the repository and use it for further research or to check our analysis and results.\n\nØ  **What if I have a complaint?** \n\nIf you have a complaint that you wish to direct to members of the research team, please contact:\n\n·       **Dr. Nathaniel Millington -** [**nate.millington@manchester.ac.uk**](mailto:nate.millington@manchester.ac.uk)\n\n·       **Prof. Erik Swyngedouw –** [**erik.swyngedouw@manchester.ac.uk**](mailto:erik.swyngedouw@manchester.ac.uk)\n\nIf you wish to make a formal complaint to someone independent of the research team or if you are not satisfied with the response you have gained from the researchers in the first instance then please contact:\n\n·      The Research Ethics Manager, Research Office, Christie Building, The University of Manchester, Oxford Road, Manchester, M13 9PL, by emailing: [research.complaints@manchester.ac.uk](mailto:research.complaints@manchester.ac.uk)  or by telephoning 0161 306 8089.\n\n \n\nIf you wish to contact us about your data protection rights, please email [dataprotection@manchester.ac.uk](mailto:dataprotection@manchester.ac.uk) or write to The Information Governance Office, Christie Building, The University of Manchester, Oxford Road, M13 9PL at the University and we will guide you through the process of exercising your rights.\n\n \n\nYou also have a right to complain to the [Information Commissioner’s Office](https://ico.org.uk/concerns) about complaints relating to your personal identifiable information: Tel 0303 123 1113",

I live in Ontario, Canada and got to start applying to universities in a few months. Problem is I did not take grade 11 seriously so my grade 11 grades are awful due to depression and substance abuse but I got better during the summer break and quit drugs. I feel like cause I did not take grade 11 seriously (universities look at Gr 11 and 12 grades), I'm on a tight deadline to figure out what exactly I want to study and do in my life. \n\nNow that I'm serious about my future, I've joined local climate and environmental volunteer groups and reached out to adults in the environmental field for advice. Most of the people I spoke to work in areas like educating kids about the environment/climate change, waste management, or helping companies become more sustainable. However I'm not very interested in those areas. \n\nI'm good at English, reading, and writing, but not so good at math. I'm not sure if that's because I didn't try hard enough due to depression or if I just don't understand it. Part of me thinks that if I study hard enough, I could improve in math and science, but people often say you should focus on what you're already good at to be successful. I'm also afraid that even if I get better at math and science, university might become too overwhelming, especially with STEM courses and all the new adjustments. Some people suggest environmental law, and that doesn't seem to be a bad idea, but it would take me 8-9 years to get there. Plus, I’ve heard that environmental lawyers sometimes end up helping the wrong side. \n\nI want a career that will really help fight against climate change. With the predicament I'm in now, as a very confused 17 yr old, **someone give me some guidance and let me know what kind of university programs and jobs are out there that have the most positive impact on climate change**.",

This produces methane which is rather harmful for the environment.\n\nWhy don't we incinerate? Because that produces harmful gas, that also contributes to climate change.\n\nBy reducing the waste we produce, we reduce the amount of pollution we are creating.

And even if it wasn’t, what harm is there in encouraging people to live greener?”\n\nAnd they’ll immediately laugh me off. Their counters tend to be along the lines of \n\n- “earth will be around long after we’re gone either way. Humanity has only been around for a blink of an eye and we’re too minuscule to actually harm the planet past the point of no return”\n\n- “the earth naturally warms and cools anyway. How do we know that this faster cycle of warming has never happened *before* recorded history?” \n\nBut what set me off the other day was a conversation I had with my uncle about the environmental impacts of big oil & gas companies. He is dead set on his belief that any source backing my claims is too biased to take seriously. He does not think it’s impact is any worse than an alternative energy source, and that the US should increase our oil & gas production (for political reasons that I won’t go into due to sub rules)\n\nHe also doubts the health concerns that come with poor air quality. Even further, he doubts that gas & oil actually have a tangible impact on the air quality at all. He again wouldn’t accept any sources I presented due to their “bias” and “fear mongering”\n\nI just know I’m going to get roped back into this conversation come thanksgiving. My family is willing to change their opinions if I hear them out (because, granted, I never read/watch the things they send me as “proof” that *they’re* right) and can provide completely unbiased sources backing my claim.  \n\nDoes anyone know of any simple and strong stats/studies that they might respond to?

      "text": "https://preview.redd.it/2do60w18cgmd1.png?width=1060&format=png&auto=webp&s=138625e37552503350a318ad392a07d394029608\n\n# \n\nUrban waterways across the United States have long been plagued by pollution, often becoming symbols of environmental neglect and degradation. Canals that once served as vital arteries for transportation and industry now face the consequences of industrial waste, sewage, and urban runoff. However, successful cleanup efforts from around the world offer valuable lessons that can be applied to America’s polluted canals. By examining case studies from New York to Singapore, we can explore effective strategies to restore these waterways and turn them into assets for communities and the environment.\n\n# Gowanus Canal, New York: A Model of Advanced Techniques and Community Engagement\n\nThe Gowanus Canal in New York is one of the most polluted waterways in the United States, suffering from decades of industrial contamination and combined sewer overflows (CSOs). Designated a Superfund site, the Gowanus Canal cleanup combines advanced remediation techniques, such as dredging and capping, with community involvement. The strategy involves removing contaminated sediments from the canal bed and capping it with clean materials to prevent re-contamination. Additionally, measures to control CSOs, a major source of ongoing pollution, are critical to the project’s success.\n\nCommunity engagement plays a vital role in the cleanup effort. By involving local residents in education and monitoring programs, the project not only improves water quality but also fosters a sense of stewardship among the community. The Gowanus Canal serves as a model for integrating advanced remediation techniques with community involvement, highlighting the importance of public participation in achieving long-term environmental goals.\n\n# Thames River, London: Infrastructure Overhaul and Regulatory Enforcement\n\nThe Thames River in London was once infamous for “The Great Stink” of the 19th century, caused by severe pollution from untreated sewage and industrial waste. Today, the Thames is one of the cleanest urban rivers in the world, thanks to comprehensive cleanup efforts that included major investments in modern sewage treatment infrastructure and the construction of the Thames Tideway Tunnel. This tunnel captures and diverts sewage away from the river, significantly reducing pollution levels.\n\nStrict environmental regulations have also played a crucial role in the Thames cleanup. By enforcing pollution controls on industries along the river, London has been able to maintain the river’s improved water quality. The transformation of the Thames demonstrates the power of infrastructure upgrades and regulatory frameworks in restoring urban waterways. This approach underscores the importance of long-term planning and investment in sewage and waste management systems to support the ecological health of rivers.\n\n# Cuyahoga River, Ohio: The Impact of Environmental Legislation and Public Awareness\n\nThe Cuyahoga River in Ohio gained notoriety in the 20th century for catching fire multiple times due to extreme pollution from industrial waste. The river’s pollution became a national symbol of environmental degradation and helped catalyze the U.S. Clean Water Act, which introduced stricter regulations on industrial discharges. Cleanup efforts on the Cuyahoga included sediment removal, pollution controls, and habitat restoration initiatives, supported by public awareness campaigns that played a key role in driving community support for the cleanup.\n\nThe Cuyahoga River’s transformation from a polluted fire hazard to a symbol of environmental recovery highlights the importance of strong environmental legislation combined with public advocacy. The river’s recovery demonstrates how regulatory action, backed by community involvement, can drive significant environmental change and restore degraded waterways.\n\n# Cheonggyecheon Stream, Seoul: Urban Renewal through Green Infrastructure\n\nThe Cheonggyecheon Stream in Seoul, South Korea, offers a compelling example of how urban waterway restoration can enhance both environmental quality and urban life. Once a polluted and buried stream, Cheonggyecheon was transformed through a major urban renewal project that uncovered and restored the stream as a naturalistic waterway. The project incorporated green spaces, walking paths, and natural filtration systems to improve water quality and enhance the urban environment.\n\nBeyond its ecological benefits, the Cheonggyecheon project has boosted tourism, improved air quality, and created a vibrant public space for Seoul’s residents. This case demonstrates the potential for environmental projects to drive economic and social benefits in addition to ecological improvements, making it a model for urban waterway restoration worldwide.\n\n# Singapore River: Coordinated Cleanup through Public-Private Partnerships\n\nThe Singapore River, once heavily polluted with industrial and domestic waste, underwent a comprehensive cleanup in the late 20th century that transformed it into a central feature of the city’s landscape. The cleanup involved modern sanitation upgrades, the relocation of polluting activities, and collaboration between government and private sector entities. Public-private partnerships were instrumental in funding and managing the cleanup process, allowing Singapore to address the river’s pollution effectively.\n\nToday, the Singapore River supports businesses, recreation, and tourism, illustrating the impact of coordinated, multi-stakeholder approaches in urban waterway cleanup. This case highlights the importance of collaboration between government and industry in managing urban waterway cleanups, demonstrating that shared goals and resources can lead to successful outcomes.\n\n# Danube River, Europe: International Cooperation for Transboundary Water Management\n\nThe Danube River, Europe’s second-longest river, flows through multiple countries and faces significant pollution challenges from agricultural runoff, industrial discharges, and untreated wastewater. The International Commission for the Protection of the Danube River (ICPDR) coordinates efforts among Danube basin countries to manage and reduce pollution, focusing on nutrient reduction, habitat restoration, and international agreements.\n\nThe Danube’s cleanup efforts have led to substantial improvements in water quality and ecosystem health, demonstrating the power of regional collaboration and international agreements in managing transboundary water pollution. This case underscores the importance of cooperation among nations in addressing shared environmental challenges.\n\n# Superfund Cleanup Strategies: A Blueprint for U.S. Canals\n\nThe U.S. Superfund program provides a framework for cleaning up the nation’s most contaminated sites, including polluted canals. The key strategies include:\n\n* **Dredging and Capping:** Removing contaminated sediments and capping with clean materials to prevent re-contamination.\n* **Source Control:** Addressing ongoing sources of pollution, such as industrial discharges and combined sewer overflows.\n* **Community Involvement:** Engaging local communities in the cleanup process through education, monitoring, and participation.\n* **Long-Term Monitoring:** Implementing continuous monitoring to ensure that cleanup efforts are effective and that re-contamination does not occur.\n\nBy applying these Superfund strategies, along with lessons from global case studies, U.S. cities can develop effective cleanup plans tailored to their unique environmental challenges.\n\n# Applying Global Lessons to U.S. Canals\n\nThe successful cleanup of urban waterways around the world offers valuable lessons for addressing the pollution challenges facing America’s canals. Investing in modern infrastructure, enforcing strong environmental regulations, engaging communities, and fostering public-private partnerships are key components of effective waterway cleanup strategies. By learning from these global success stories, U.S. cities can transform their polluted canals into thriving, vibrant parts of the urban environment, benefiting both nature and people.\n\nThese case studies illustrate that with the right combination of technology, policy, and community involvement, it is possible to tackle the complex challenge of urban waterway pollution.

      "text": "Hi everyone! We’re CMECH, a startup dedicated to fighting climate change by removing carbon dioxide directly from seawater. Our mission is to tackle one of the biggest contributors to the climate crisis and restore balance to the environment. Here’s a bit about us:\n\n**What We Do:**\nAt CMECH, we’re developing innovative technology that targets the ocean—one of Earth’s largest carbon reservoirs—to extract and capture CO₂. By focusing on seawater, we’re taking action to address rising CO₂ levels and contribute to a cleaner, healthier planet.\n\n**Why We’re Doing This:**\nThe ocean absorbs vast amounts of carbon dioxide, but as emissions rise, it’s nearing its capacity. Excess CO₂ leads to acidification, warmer waters, and harm to marine ecosystems. Our goal is to help reverse this process and protect our environment for future generations.\n\n**How You Can Help:**\nCreating groundbreaking solutions like ours takes resources. You can support our mission by donating or purchasing carbon credits through our website. Every contribution accelerates our progress, helping us get closer to deploying large-scale carbon removal technology.\n\nWe’re excited to share our work with you and would love feedback on our new website, https://cmech.tech/index.html. Does it communicate our mission clearly? Any suggestions on the layout or content?\n\nThank you in advance for your thoughts and support—we’re looking forward to hearing your ideas!",

      "text": "Dear Front Line,\n\nI applaud the enthusiasm and passion of those who protest global warming, but I believe it's time to shift our focus from mere demonstrations to tangible, impactful actions.\n\nYes, we all know climate change is a pressing issue. But shouting slogans and waving signs, while important for raising awareness, won't solve the problem on its own. It's time to roll up our sleeves and get to work.\n\nInstead of spending money on banners and protest materials, why not invest in a piece of land? Start a garden, create a wildlife sanctuary, or simply protect a piece of our beautiful planet. This is a tangible, meaningful way to contribute to the fight against climate change.\n\nI understand that this might seem daunting, but it's not as difficult as it may seem. With a little planning and effort, anyone can create a positive impact on our environment.\n\n**Here's a starting point:**\n\n1. **Find a Piece of Land:** Look for affordable land, perhaps in a rural area, that you can protect and restore.\n2. **Create a Plan:** Decide whether you want to cultivate a garden, establish a wildlife sanctuary, or simply preserve the land in its natural state.\n3. **Get Involved:** Gather friends, family, or like-minded individuals to join your efforts.\n\nRemember, every small action counts. By taking ownership of a piece of land and working to protect it, you're not just making a difference; you're also setting an example for others to follow.\n\nLet's move beyond protests and towards tangible, positive change. Together, we can create a healthier, more sustainable planet for generations to come.\n\nSincerely,\n\nFellow Earth Resident",

      "text": "A lot of people ask, what they can do individually, in addition to lifestyle changes, to maximize their positive impact on climate and environment. Asking that myself, and researching flaws of available alternatives, led me to start a new project, to allow individuals to take measurable climate action through participation in forest restoration at scale.\n\nOf course it should be treated as a complementary solution to political pressure and necessary systemic changes, and not as excuse to continue current state of affairs. But if we can do something extra in the meantime, why not? After all, we have to not only reduce our emissions, but also recapture already emitted CO2.\n\nWe are dedicated to plant new forests with mainly ecological functions and not industrial monocultures, to make an actual land cover change and provide additional ecosystem services. We also include trees’ survivability rate in our impact calculations, to not overestimate it. We partner with municipalities and regions, which provide necessary land, and already few of them declared interest in our project.\n\nOur project allows to gradually build towards tangible impact through planting subscriptions. In our case, they are different from other subscription-based services, as you don’t lose your impact when decide to cancel it, as already planted trees will keep recapturing CO2 for you. Such model just makes reaching a proper scale of impact more available.\n\nWe also provide feedback on your planting contributions and CO2 recapture journey.\n\nCurrently we are building an international community of individuals, who would like to take such climate action with us, so I’d like to invite you to join and bring in your friends!\n\nIf it sounds good to you, check our website: [https://greenwedge.eco](https://greenwedge.eco)\n\nHope to see you joining, so we can reach a critical mass of positive impact!",

      "title": "Plastic Pollution: Balancing the Benefits and the Costs of a Global Crisis",
      "text": "Plastic pollution has become one of the most pressing environmental issues of our time, affecting ecosystems, wildlife, and human health. But the conversation around plastic is often more complex than it seems. While many advocate for drastic reductions in plastic use, others point out the benefits that plastics bring to modern life. So, where do we draw the line, and how do we balance the pros and cons?\n\nThe Scale of the Problem\n\nLet’s start with the basics: the sheer volume of plastic pollution is staggering. An estimated 8 million tons of plastic enter our oceans each year, and by 2050, it's projected that there will be more plastic than fish in the sea by weight​. Once plastic is in the ocean, it doesn't go away. It breaks down into microplastics, which are now found everywhere from the deepest ocean trenches to the fish we eat. Studies have shown that nearly 90% of marine species have been negatively affected by plastic, whether through ingestion or entanglement​.\n\nMoreover, plastic waste has profound impacts on human health. Microplastics have been found in human blood, and there is growing concern about the long-term health effects of consuming food and water contaminated with these particles. The chemicals used in plastic production, like BPA, are known endocrine disruptors, and their widespread presence in our environment raises serious public health concerns​.\n\nThe Benefits of Plastic\n\nBut here’s where the conversation becomes more nuanced. For all the harm it does, plastic also brings significant benefits to modern life. It’s lightweight, durable, and incredibly versatile. Plastic has revolutionized industries like healthcare, where single-use plastics have reduced infection rates in hospitals by providing sterile environments and tools. In the food industry, plastic packaging extends the shelf life of perishable items, reducing food waste and the resources needed to transport goods​.\n\nFrom car parts to electronics, plastics have allowed us to create safer, more energy-efficient products. For example, lighter cars and planes made with plastic components use less fuel, reducing greenhouse gas emissions. So, while plastics are a pollution problem, they are also key in some environmental solutions, which is why many argue for a balanced approach rather than a complete plastic ban.\n\nThe Case for Reduction and Alternatives\n\nDespite its benefits, the evidence is clear: we can’t continue producing and disposing of plastic at the current rate. According to the WWF, even if all plastic production were to stop today, microplastic levels in the ocean would more than double by 2050​. So, how do we strike a balance?\n\nOne promising avenue is the development of biodegradable alternatives to conventional plastics. Companies are experimenting with materials like bioplastics made from corn or sugarcane, which can break down more easily in the environment. There are also efforts to create closed-loop systems where plastic is continually recycled instead of being discarded after a single use. However, biodegradable plastics and recycling systems are not without their own challenges. For instance, many \"compostable\" plastics require industrial facilities to break down properly, which may not be available in all regions​.\n\nThe Role of Policy and Corporate Responsibility\n\nMany experts argue that the most effective solutions will come from large-scale policy changes rather than relying solely on individual action. Governments worldwide have started to take notice, implementing bans on single-use plastics and introducing incentives for companies to reduce plastic production. The European Union's 2019 directive banning single-use plastic items like cutlery and straws is a prime example of how regulation can push industries toward more sustainable practices​.\n\nHowever, critics argue that policies alone aren't enough. Plastic pollution is a global issue, but many of the countries most affected by it lack the infrastructure to manage waste properly. For example, Southeast Asia is responsible for a significant portion of the plastic entering the ocean, largely due to inadequate waste management systems​. Addressing the root causes of plastic pollution in these regions will require international cooperation and investment in better waste management.\n\nMeanwhile, corporations that profit from plastic production need to take more responsibility. Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) programs are being touted as one solution, where companies are held accountable for the entire lifecycle of their products, from production to disposal. Companies like Unilever and Nestlé have already pledged to reduce their plastic usage and invest in recycling, but critics argue that these efforts are often too little, too late​.\n\nThe Individual’s Role\n\nWhile systemic change is crucial, individuals also have a part to play in tackling plastic pollution. Reducing personal plastic consumption by using reusable bags, bottles, and containers is a start, but it’s only a small piece of the puzzle. What’s needed is a cultural shift toward understanding that waste—plastic or otherwise—has long-term consequences.\n\nRecycling, though often touted as the solution, isn’t a cure-all. In fact, only around 9% of all plastic ever produced has been recycled​. This low percentage highlights the need for better systems and education around recycling, as well as the fact that many types of plastic can’t be recycled at all due to contamination or material complexity.\n\nWhere Do We Go from Here?\n\nThe truth is, there’s no single answer to the plastic pollution problem. The best path forward likely involves a combination of individual action, corporate responsibility, innovative technologies, and government regulations. We need to rethink not just how we use plastic, but how we produce, manage, and dispose of all materials in our global economy.\n\nWhat do you think? Is the key to tackling plastic pollution individual responsibility, corporate accountability, or policy change? And are biodegradable alternatives really the solution, or just another stopgap? \n\nFurther Reading:\n[WWF: Impacts of Plastic Pollution on Marine Species](https://wwfint.awsassets.panda.org/downloads/wwf_impacts_of_plastic_pollution_on_biodiversity.pdf)\n\n[National Geographic: A Running List of Action on Plastic Pollution](https://www.nationalgeographic.com/environment/article/ocean-plastic-pollution-solutions)\n\n[European Union: Directive on Single-Use Plastics](https://environment.ec.europa.eu/topics/plastics/single-use-plastics_en)",

Foresight is about imagining the future and then looking at how to change it.\"\n\nHere, the report draws on a wide diversity of disciplines and voices to foresee the future. \n\nThe report focuses on the triple planetary crisis of climate change, nature and biodiversity loss, and pollution and waste, but also combines with other key drivers of change, including social, technological, geopolitical, and AI, among many others. Indeed, we are facing a 'policrisis', whereby the triple planetary is impacting and exacerbating human crises like conflicts for resources and declining health. Taking a holistic view is important for understanding the whole situation. \n\nIt identifies old and emerging challenges that require immediate attention and have the potential to drastically impact planetary health. Eight critical global shifts or phenomena that emerged from the foresight process.\n\n1. The relationship between humans and the environment in flux\n\n2. Critical resources: scarcity, competition and the shifting dynamics of global security\n\n3. AI, digital transformation and technology – a wave of change\n\n4. A new era of conflict\n\n5.

While the absolute number of climate discussions has increased, the expansion of other topics on Reddit has outpaced it, suggesting a relative decline in engagement with climate issues. This trend might be attributed to various factors, including topic fatigue, competition from other crises, and the emergence of other engaging topics.\n\nThe authors also noted that redditors talk about \"global warming\" in different ways from \"climate change,\" where \"discussions about global warming tend to use less sophisticated language and exhibit more positive sentiments compared to those about climate change.\"\n\nDo with this information what you will.",

We don't see many brush fires where I live. Sure, a few here and there but nothing at the rate of this and ESPECIALLY not in November.\n\nI was having a discussion with my Grandma earlier today who's house is a few hundred feet away from one of the major fires. I brought up Climate Change being the cause and she shut me down right away. She said there was no such thing as Climate Change and this was \"Perfectly normal weather\" and things like this just happen sometimes. My Grandfather and Great Aunt who chimed into the conversation to conquer with her answer. I was in complete SHOCK! \n\nHow can they deny Climate Change while a Wildfire blazes right by their house? How can they even call this Weather normal? I went Trick or Treating with my cousins a week ago and felt so hot in my costume. I checked the Temperature and it was 75 FREAKING Degrees, on Halloween, In the North East. How can people be so ignorant to the truth?\n\nSorry about the rant.

      "text": "I have noticed a lot more in the last five years the occurrence of extreme weather events in my area, I have lived in central Texas since 2019 and have experienced two freezes where both times the power grid failed and last year a very nonexistent winter to say the least (it was 75+ for most of the winter season). We also had a tornado that went through half of my city and this year in particular too i have noticed that it has been extremely WINDIER than normal. Coupled with the fact it’s getting unbearably hotter each summer, there also seems to be an increase in severe storms. Every time there is a thunderstorm it is always extremely violent with high winds, heavy rain and sometimes hail. What changes have you noticed where you live?",

In total last year, the US produced about 16 tons of carbon per citizen, which means my household, which produced (47 tons / 5 people) 9.4 tons of carbon per resident is almost twice as green than the national average. To completely wipe out our carbon footprint, given the average American lives 80 years and a white oak absorbs an average of .1 tons of CO2 per year and lives \\~250 years (25 total tons per tree), we each need to plant ((9.4 \\* 80) / 25) about 30 white oaks to offset our individual carbon footprint. \n\n \n\nTo me, this sounds like we need a government organization that lets people enroll to plant a certain amount of trees, say each member works 12 hours per month (or 144 hours per year), and every tree takes (let's make it time inefficient and easy to calculate) 30 minutes to plant, we would have about 288 trees per year per member. If the government really wanted to solve climate change, they could offer military equivalent benefits to every citizen who verifiably participates in this program for a certain number of years, let's say 10 because out deficit is already plenty large, and we don't need it too much higher. Assuming only 1% of the population goes into this program, we will be planting 1 billion trees per year, offsetting our carbon output by about 100 million tons per year.  Or if 10% of the population joined, 1 billion tons of CO2 per year. Back to the 1% example, the number of trees would be 1 billion n every year, and every tree planted will be absorbing carbon for another 250 years, so there will be 100 million n tons of carbon being absorbed every year by the program. By the 10th year, the US would be carbon neutral. by the 30th year, the US would be covering more than the carbon of both us and China.",

So yeah i stand corrected oops lol\n\nI have parents that try to be as ecologist as possible so I grew in an environnement where the climate change issue was always and will always be a real thing. \n\nBut I do not understand why people would call it fake Underestimating it's impacts on their lives because it didn't impact them yet that I can understand. \n\nBut denying it's existence with multiple proof and an overwhelming majority of scientist agreeing on the matter seems so weird to me ? \n\nJust why ? This question has been mind boggling to me. I do understand that a lot of people do prioritse the economy and other aspects over the environnement and I can kinda understand it especially if the effects didn't impact you yet due to human brain. (Like if doesn't impact me then it's no real until it impacts me). \n\nI dont understand what you gain by doing that. At worst just say you don't care and that's it. But actively trying to make it worse while denying it's existence is so weird to me\n\nDid anyone had a the chance to discuss that with someone that doesn't believe in it ? Like that was actually opened to discussion and not telling that \"you're a sheep controlled by the government\"?",

Yet, as explained below, research validating the accuracy of climate change models perhaps may now be verboten (\"forbidden, especially by an authority\").\n\n>Climate scientists do not have crystal balls. But they do have climate models that provide remarkably accurate projections of global warming – and have done so for decades.\n\n>[Zeke Hausfather](https://berkeleyearth.org/team/#zeke-hausfather) is a research scientist at Berkeley Earth. He [looked at](https://eps.harvard.edu/files/eps/files/hausfather_2020_evaluating_historical_gmst_projections.pdf) climate models dating back to the 1970s and evaluated their predictions for how increasing carbon dioxide in the atmosphere would affect global temperatures.\n\n>Hausfather: “A lot of those early models ended up proving quite prescient in terms of predicting what would actually happen in the real world in the years after they were published. … Of the 17 we looked at, 14 of them were pretty much spot-on.”\n\n[https://yaleclimateconnections.org/2025/04/computer-models-have-been-accurately-predicting-climate-change-for-50-years/](https://yaleclimateconnections.org/2025/04/computer-models-have-been-accurately-predicting-climate-change-for-50-years/)\n\n>And he says today’s [climate models](https://climate.mit.edu/explainers/climate-models) are far more advanced.\n\n>They incorporate vast quantities of data about land cover, air circulation patterns, Earth’s rotation, and carbon pollution to create localized projections for heat, precipitation, and sea level rise.\n\n>And they simulate a range of scenarios.\n\n>Hausfather: “ … that reflect a wide range of possible futures, you know, a world where we rapidly cut emissions, a world where we rapidly increase emissions and everything in between.”\n\n>So the models provide reliable projections based on each scenario … but which outcome becomes reality will depend on the steps that people take to reduce carbon pollution and limit climate change.\n\nClicked on \"looked at\" in the above transcript.  The link was to \"Earth and Planetary Sciences at Harvard University.\"  Apparently Hausfather's research link was not available, even though the above transcript is dated April 10!\n\n>Sorry.

Did a search and was unable to find another link anywhere to Hausfather's recent research on climate models.\n\nDid find this article from 2019, when Hausfather still was a graduate student.\n\n[https://www.science.org/content/article/even-50-year-old-climate-models-correctly-predicted-global-warming](https://www.science.org/content/article/even-50-year-old-climate-models-correctly-predicted-global-warming)\n\nAre Harvard departments now self-censoring reports that contradict Donald Trump's ideology, as repeatedly is being reported as occurring at federal agencies involving science research?\n\n[https://www.highereddive.com/news/harvard-university-federal-funding-ultimatum-trump-administration/744532/](https://www.highereddive.com/news/harvard-university-federal-funding-ultimatum-trump-administration/744532/)\n\n[https://www.thecardiologyadvisor.com/news/trump-censorship-federal-websites-academic-journals/](https://www.thecardiologyadvisor.com/news/trump-censorship-federal-websites-academic-journals/)\n\nHere's a fascinating article by Hausfather from 2023:\n\n>While there is [growing evidence](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/13/opinion/climate-change-excessive-heat-2023.html) that the rate of warming has increased in recent decades compared to what we’ve experienced since the 1970s, this acceleration is largely included in our climate models, which show around 40% faster warming in the period between 2015 and 2030 compared to 1970-2014.\n\n[https://www.theclimatebrink.com/p/global-temperatures-remain-consistent](https://www.theclimatebrink.com/p/global-temperatures-remain-consistent)\n\nEDIT 1:  New EPA administrator Lee Zeldin, in announcing an effort to roll back the EPA's crucial 2009 endangerment finding, labeled climate change science a \"religion.\"\n\n>EPA administrator Lee Zeldin [announced](https://www.epa.gov/newsreleases/trump-epa-kicks-formal-reconsideration-endangerment-finding-agency-partners) Wednesday that the agency will undertake a “formal reconsideration” of its 2009 endangerment finding, which underpins the agency’s legal obligation to regulate carbon dioxide and other climate pollutants under the Clean Air Act. The EPA also announced that it intends to undo all of its prior rules that flow from that finding, including limits on emissions from automobiles and power plants alongside scores of other rules pertaining to air and water pollution.  \n\n>“Today is the greatest day of deregulation our nation has seen. We are driving a dagger straight into the heart of the **climate change religion**, \\[BF added\\]” Zeldin [said](https://www.epa.gov/newsreleases/epa-launches-biggest-deregulatory-action-us-history). \n\n>[https://www.sierraclub.org/sierra/epa-endangerment-finding-trump-zeldin-tries-to-torpedo-greenhouse-gases](https://www.sierraclub.org/sierra/epa-endangerment-finding-trump-zeldin-tries-to-torpedo-greenhouse-gases)\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/1jtwm32/comment/mlxhv0m/?context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/1jtwm32/comment/mlxhv0m/?context=3)\n\nEDIT 2:  EDIT 1 omitted this quoted material from the immediately above OP:\n\nReleased in 2009, the EPA's endangerment finding has been considered the \"holy grail\" of climate change regulation, and Trump's EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin has announced an attempt to dismantle it.\n\n>The agency at the center of federal climate action said it would roll back bedrock scientific findings, kill climate rules, terminate grants that are already under contract, and change how it collects and uses greenhouse gas data. Taken together, the plans would effectively remove EPA from addressing climate change at a time when global temperatures have soared to heights never experienced by humans.\n\n[https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/trump-epa-unveils-aggressive-plans-to-dismantle-climate-regulation/](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/trump-epa-unveils-aggressive-plans-to-dismantle-climate-regulation/)\n\nEDIT 3:  In response to an excellent comment by Molire, clicked on the \"looked at\" link again 14 hours after the original post.  Now the following research letter is provided!\n\n>We find that climate models published over the past five decades were generally quite accurate in predicting global warming in the years after publication, particularly when accounting for differences between modeled and actual changes in atmospheric CO 2 and other climate drivers. This research should help resolve public confusion around the performance of past climate modeling efforts and increases our confidence that models are accurately projecting global warming.\n\n[https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1029%2F2019GL085378](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1029%2F2019GL085378)\n\nWhile the conclusions seemingly are the same as presented in the transcript discussion, it's a complex research letter that will take considerable time for a non-scientist, like me, to absorb.",

But considering my dislike of the cold and the difficulty of immigration, I'm seriously considering moving to South American highlands.\n\nSouth American highlands stay spring-like all year round, even under climate change. Unlike Scandinavia or New Zealand, cities like Medellín, Quito, and Cuenca are at high altitudes near the equator, which means no extreme heat, no frost.\n\nIt's also the only highland area in the world that have large modern cities with strong infrastructure, and plenty of fresh water. There’s no risk of hurricanes or major wildfires either. It’s stable.\n\nUnlike lowland tropical zones or temperate regions facing extreme heat, drought, sea level rise, or wildfires, high-altitude equatorial cities like Medellin, Cuenca, Quito, or parts of the Peruvian Andes sit in the sweet spot\n\nAt over 1,500 meters elevation, South American highlands avoids both sweltering heat and frost. It’s one of the few places where temperatures are projected to remain tolerable well past the 2-3°C global threshold. So I'm seriously considering moving there. Do you guys think this makes sense?\n\n**P.S.** I’m not sure why some people tend to make this assumption, but just to be clear, I’m not a doomsday prepper, a survivalist trying to live off-grid, or an environmental activist. I’m simply a digital nomad traveling the world, trying to find cities that will still be the most livable and stable in a climate-challenged future.",

      "text": "We are living in the middle of a mass-extinction event.\n\n\nSometimes I wonder, after all the death and destruction caused by climate change is over, after the majority of humans and animals have gone extinct, what will future scientists learn? \n\n\nIm actually not convinced humans will dissappear. There's just too damn many of us, our technology is too advanced, and we're all clever enough to find someplace to survive. Even if that someplace is in what is now a colder climate. Humans will be around in some shape or form LONG after all of us are dead.\n\nBut what will future scientists think? What will they learn from what is our present, and their past?\n\n\nMass extinction events rarely take place over a human lifetime. Sometimes they can take even take tens or hundreds of thousands of years to play out. From beginning to end.\n\n\nIn school, you may have learned about the asteroid that killed the dinosaurs. But unless you were a geology or biology student, you probably never learned about even earlier extinction events. such as the great dying: \n\nhttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Permian%E2%80%93Triassic_extinction_event\n\n\nThe great dying (or the Permian–Triassic extinction event) occurred around 250 million years ago. It was started from volcanic activity in the siberian traps, that released sulfur and carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. This toxic cocktail deprived our oceans of oxygen rich water, and killed up to 96% percent of all marine life and 70% of all land based life. But it didnt take place over a few hundred years. Not even a few thousand years. \"The great dying\" took anywhere from 60 to 200 thousand years. From beginning to end.\n\n\nSomeday, millions of years from now, scientists will be digging up layers of rock or from our mountains or examining ice in our poles. They will see a brief, but unusual layer of rock or ice with high concentrations of carbon dioxide. What Will they conclude? Will they learn from our past mistakes? We can only hope.",

This obligation stems from the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), which mandates that agencies consider significant comments during rulemaking and provide a reasoned explanation for their decisions. The EPA must address substantive comments that raise pertinent issues, explain how they were considered, and justify the final rule, typically in a “response to comments” document or the rule’s preamble. This ensures transparency and accountability in the rulemaking process.",

But I can’t see any alternative that doesn’t involve questionable and morally fraught actions, whether that means drastically lowering the global standard of living (which in many places is already poor) for a long time, or massively reducing the population or its growth, both of which are dangerous and obviously unethical.\n\nAnd if we take the drastic route, who would be in charge of enforcing it? It certainly wouldn’t be the general public, since people are not going to vote to have their way of life destroyed and their living standards reduced to those of the 1600s. It would have to be driven by wealthy elites, politicians, and non-government organizations imposing their vision on the world without democratic consent.\n\nThe ethical problems with this are enormous. Who gets to decide what sacrifices are made? And are the people in power even ethical or competent enough to wield such influence responsibly?\n\nWould the elites imposing these measures make the same sacrifices, or would they continue living in luxury while forcing the masses to bear the brunt of the changes?\n\nCould governments exploit the climate crisis to justify authoritarian control, using it as a pretext for surveillance, restrictions, and population control?",

Can you please explain to me how CO2 emitted from the burning of fossil fuels is chemically, physically or in any other way different from CO2 emitted from other sources?\n\n>I was under the clearly misguided impression that the warming effect on the climate was the same, regardless of the source.\n\nThe true situation, which there is a desperate need for people to understand, is that our problem is very specifically the movement of carbon from fossil sources to the atmosphere. If carbon is taken from the atmosphere, turned into wood, and then the wood is burned as fuel, then that is just the same amount of carbon cycling around the biosphere. Most fossil carbon was removed from atmosphere millions of years ago, at a time when the climate was much hotter than it is today. Fossil carbon which is put into the atmosphere then starts cycling around, which means the total amount of carbon goes up, which is what is actually causing all of our climate problems.\n\nSurely this is not too difficult to explain to people? The problem, of course, is it logically follows that we need to leave carbon in the ground. And nobody wants to hear that message, because everybody knows that it isn't going to happen.",

There are little steps that can be taken, like eating less animal products/byproducts and more plant-based products percentage wise. Using fuel-efficient transportation is another one. I'm surprised I can't rattle off the complete list of little easy steps off the top of my head, but I admit I can't.\n\nIf live streaming climate-change-caused events does not make the problem force people to act on it, what will?",

      "text": "I was chatting with a friend the other day—we’re both in environmental sciences—and we got into this interesting hypothetical: What if climate change had a cooling effect instead of a warming one? Like, what if the industrial-era carbon emissions and land use changes had set us on a path toward global cooling instead of heating?\n\nIt got us wondering whether the global response—public perception, political will, economic incentives—would have been different. In a weird way, would people have cared more if the threat was extreme cold rather than extreme heat?\n\nHeatwaves, droughts, wildfires, sea level rise—these are terrifying, but often perceived as distant or “manageable” (especially by people in power in cooler, wealthier regions). But imagine if the main impacts were things like shortening growing seasons, encroaching glaciers, deadly freezes, and snow in places that don’t usually get snow. Would that feel more “urgent” to the general public? Would it have affected powerful nations more directly, and therefore provoked faster action?\n\nOf course, the core issue is still about destabilizing a climate system that human civilization depends on—but the psychology of how it destabilizes seems to matter a lot.\n\nCurious to hear what others think. Would “global cooling” have triggered a more aggressive or unified global response—or would we have just adapted differently and still dragged our feet?",

Asheville was always a floodplain and people always knew that.\n\nFor starters it imagines this mythical past that was somehow disaster free - and that could not be further from the truth. There's a reason the Taos and Acoma pueblos are a handful of the only spots that have been continuously inhabited in the US - what happened to Cahokia, Chaco Canyon etc?? There's many places that did get wiped out from disasters prior to climate change. North America isn't exactly easy mode for habitation, which is why it was historically less populated.\n\nSecond some disasters are preventable while others are not. No matter what we do, we cannot prevent sea level rise from damaging Florida. We can't prevent a hurricane from making landfall. We can choose to not build in a local floodplain. We can choose to thin forests and prevent fires - Wildernest CO is the case in point where a thinning band around the town literally saved the entire village. We can choose to use water in more efficient manners instead of for alfalfa.\n\nClimate change is going to make disasters more frequent, but for some disasters we've never had more tools at our disposal to address them. There absolutely is better places to live with modern tech across the nation than others, and we need to keep reinforcing that idea.

Cars, trucks, ships, and planes run on fossil fuels. Producing or farming food causes emissions of carbon dioxide, methane, and other greenhouse gases. Powering buildings, offices, heating, cooling, appliances, etc. Even electric car batteries require mining ore and fossil fuel consumption to produce.\n\nObviously we need food, transportation, housing, raw materials, and a functioning power grid for civilization as it is today to exist, so would actions such as moving our major power grids to primarily electric/solar/wind sources, walking/biking more, using energy efficient appliances/lights, electric modes of transportation and better building insulation even be enough to make any sort of meaningful impact? \n\n  \nThank you in advance for taking the time to answer.",

      "text": "This Business Insider story on [\"Millenial Retirement Panic\"](https://www.businessinsider.com/rise-of-millennial-retirement-panic-boomer-parents-saving-401k-market-2025-5) makes an important point about what climate change could do to Millenials' retirement plans:\n\n>  \nFor me, it was the climate crisis — and how little we're factoring its long-term effects into our economic planning — that first triggered my retirement panic. Back in 2018, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change projected 2040 — the year I turn 60 — as the moment the world will likely warm by 1.5 degrees Celsius, the threshold at which the effects of global warming will become irreversibly catastrophic. The following summer, I caught a panel during London's Climate Week that shook me even more. Economists who advise major insurance companies and pension funds presented findings from a model about what climate change will do to the world economy. At the highest projected temperatures, they estimated, GDPs would plummet by 30% by 2080 in every country they modeled, including the United States.\n\n>After the panel, I asked one of the presenters, Willemijn Verdegaal, what I should do to prepare for retirement, assuming the Earth stays on its current warming trajectory. \"In all honesty,\" she told me, \"there's very little point in you saving anything anymore.\"",

This person holds a degree in economics and values data-driven evidence but mentioned they've never encountered compelling data that convincingly demonstrates climate change.\n\nIf you had to select just one scientific figure (strongly backed up by evidence/data) to present to an educated skeptic, which would it be? I'm looking for a clear, easy-to-understand figure that effectively illustrates global warming or climate change—something that would be difficult to dismiss for someone who claims to believe in data.\n\nUpdate: This person's main argument is that many environmental claims are not grounded in direct observations or empirical data.

I tried to look online but I keep getting greenwashed articles I don't really trust.\n\n  \nI realize I may just be biased on this. In which case please set me straight - I just want to know the correct answer!",

      "text": "Here's what I'm doing to reduce my emissions.\n\n1. After my trip to England as an American, I will not willingly fly for pleasure again anytime soon.\n\n2. Adopting a plant-based diet. Not willingly buy industrial meat, dairy, and eggs. Though, I am gaining interest in hog hunting, as feral swine are destructive in the Southeast U.S. where I'm from, and they don't have a natural predator, but if I don't have a way of hunting game, I would remain vegetarian.\n\n3. Composting. I built two bins outside, one from a Lowe's bucket and another from a tote, also from the same store as the former.\n\n4. Growing produce at home. I grew Walmart organic bell peppers from seed with an LED light I'm using as an aquarium light for my 55 gallon freshwater aquarium. I also feed the homegrown peppers to my guinea pigs.\n\n5. Looking more into home aquaponics. Already doing that with a romaine stalk I have in one of my fish tanks. I want to eventually have all of my fish tanks (freshwater) to grow something aquaponically. I guess being an avid aquarist helps find more sustainable way to get food for not just me, but for my pet guinea pigs.\n\n6. Doing outdoor gardening as well as the aforementioned aquaponics. I got gardening gloves, shears, and a farmer's almanac for Christmas this year.\n\nHere's some of my long-term goals:\n\n1. Getting our house solar powered.\n2. Never owning a pure gas vehicle again. I'm looking to get an EV or e bike. In fact, if I remember correctly, I think they're building an EV battery factory just between Savannah and Statesboro on I-16.",

      "text": "This article has cropped up in r/collapse and they've worked themselves into a fervor over it. The article, from Richard Crim: https://richardcrim.substack.com/p/the-crisis-report-99\n\nRichard is very upfront about not being a climate scientist himself, but has clearly done much research over many years. I'm looking for the view from climate change experts on whether what he is saying holds water, because I don't have the expertise to analyse it deeply myself. The article highlights a lot of really concerning data, and asserts/predicts a number of scary things. A few of which are:\n\n* The temperature should have been falling in late 2024 as El Nino comes to an end, but it increased\n* We saw +0.16°C warming per year on average over the last 3 years\n* Obsession over \"net zero\" emissions is missing another major contributor, Albedo. Because of this, many predictions about the temperature leveling off after hitting net zero are wrong and the temperature is more likely to continue to accelerate.\n* Temperatures will accelerate well beyond the worst case scenario\n* We are so far off of predictions that we are in \"uncharted territory\"\n* We will see +3 sustained warming by 2050\n\nHis writing style comes across a bit crazy with all the CAPITALS everywhere, a bit conspiratorial and alarmist. But, I can't fault what he's saying. I'm hoping someone can tell me why this guy is wrong",

      "text": ">**Global methane emissions have surged, undermining efforts to curb climate change. Human activities continue to drive emissions from fossil fuels, agriculture, and wetlands, pushing warming beyond safe limits.**\n\n>Methane emissions, a major contributor to climate change, have continued to rise without slowing down. Despite a global pledge by over 150 nations to reduce emissions by 30% this decade, new research reveals that global methane emissions have surged at an unprecedented rate over the past five years.\n\n>The trend “cannot continue if we are to maintain a habitable climate,” the researchers write in a Sept. 10 perspective article in *Environmental Research Letters* published alongside data in *Earth System Science Data*. Both papers are the work of the [Global Carbon Project](https://www.globalcarbonproject.org/), an initiative chaired by Stanford University scientist Rob Jackson that tracks greenhouse gas emissions worldwide.\n\n[https://scitechdaily.com/methane-levels-at-800000-year-high-stanford-scientists-warn-that-we-are-heading-for-climate-disaster/](https://scitechdaily.com/methane-levels-at-800000-year-high-stanford-scientists-warn-that-we-are-heading-for-climate-disaster/)\n\n>The current path leads to global warming above 3 degrees Celsius or 5 degrees Fahrenheit by the end of this century. “Right now, the goals of the Global Methane Pledge seem as distant as a desert oasis,” said Jackson, who is the Michelle and Kevin Douglas Provostial Professor in the Stanford Doerr School of Sustainability and lead author of the *Environmental Research Letters* paper. “We all hope they aren’t a mirage.”\n\nHere's a fascinating observation in the article about the impact of the pandemic on atmospheric methane accumulations:\n\n>Our atmosphere accumulated nearly 42 million tons of methane in 2020 – twice the amount added on average each year during the 2010s, and more than six times the increase seen during the first decade of the 2000s.\n\n>Pandemic lockdowns in 2020 reduced transport-related emissions of nitrogen oxides (NOx), which typically worsen local air quality but prevent some methane from accumulating in the atmosphere. The temporary decline in NOx pollution accounts for about half of the increase in atmospheric methane concentrations that year – illustrating the complex entanglements of air quality and climate change.\n\n[https://climate.nasa.gov/vital-signs/methane/?intent=121](https://climate.nasa.gov/vital-signs/methane/?intent=121)\n\n[https://news.stanford.edu/stories/2024/09/methane-emissions-are-rising-faster-than-eve](https://news.stanford.edu/stories/2024/09/methane-emissions-are-rising-faster-than-eve)",

      "text": "A significant factor contributing to the environmental impact of animal agriculture is its inefficiency. Behrens pointed out that *converting plants into animal products wastes a staggering 80 to 97 percent of the calories initially present in the crops.* To produce one kilogram of beef, for instance, a cow must consume 25 kilograms of animal feed.  Behrens explained that humanity is exceeding six of nine planetary boundaries, which are thresholds that define a safe operating space for our planet.  Each of the four boundaries linked to animal agriculture paints a grim picture:\n\n1. **Biosphere Integrity:** The loss of biodiversity is directly tied to habitat destruction caused by agricultural expansion. Farming animals displaces native species and fragments ecosystems, pushing many species toward extinction.\n2. **Land System Change:** The conversion of forests and grasslands into agricultural land disrupts natural ecosystems, reducing carbon sequestration and exacerbating climate change.\n3. **Freshwater Use:** Animal agriculture is one of the largest consumers of freshwater, contributing to water scarcity in many regions.\n4. **Biogeochemical Flows:** The overuse of nitrogen and phosphorus fertilizers to grow animal feed leads to pollution of waterways, causing dead zones and disrupting aquatic ecosystems.\n5.

And she is very excited to take it to the next level.  \n  \nSince I work in this area too, I told her to be open about the brand’s impact in areas like carbon emissions, waste, or ethical sourcing. She also needs to be specific about it, right?  \n  \nShe asked me if there’s any way to quantify the company's impact in these areas.  \n  \nDo any of you have any experience in this area?  \n  \nIf yes, what were the biggest challenges you faced in measuring these metrics?  \n  \nAlso, are there any specific tools or resources that you found helpful?

Just for this its in most countries’ interests to chase energy efficiency. \n\nThe last time Trump pulled out of the Paris agreement, other countries stayed true. With their advancements and with renewable energy having economic incentive, US continues to lose its power and will be left behind. \n\nEventually, even if the US was not compliant, the other countries with the majority will be able to slap taxes on us. Europe also has laws on imports to meet requirements for methane, so if we dont conform, we will only lock ourselves out of trade opportunities.\n\nThe US already has 10 million jobs in renewable energy compared to only 300k in fossil fuels. Even if Trump opposed green energy, there is naturally more economic opportunity there so regardless the market is going to go there.\n\nhttps://www.sciencemediacentre.org/expert-reaction-to-trumps-re-election-and-impact-on-climate-issues",

      "text": "Small reactors, safer waste that can be repurposed instead of buried, passive failure safe and about a millennium’s supply of fuel. All this could be had if Thorium was developed in a way that it could be commercialised. Reactors that could be just for city districts, remote communities, hospitals, container ships etc.\n\nEDIT:\nThis is to function as a general response to common answers and arguments I’ve seen from commenters. I simply don’t have time unfortunately to respond to all of them individually so I’m lumping it all here . Those who have already made up their minds will ignore it .  Those who are open to the idea may find it a reason to research further .\n\nSo here goes nothing : \nThere are those who argue that these reactors are financially unviable. They are no doubt financially at a disadvantage to renewables but so were renewables during the stronger years of fossil fuels. Discoveries are made, research carried out, and with time the costs invariably come down. That’s true of most technologies.\nSo this is more a reluctance to invest and ensure future generations will already get the basics ironed out because, by goodness, they’ll have enough shit to deal with, without adding a second energy crisis to the mix.\n\nAside from the purely financial there is a geopolitical. Most people in Europe are acutely aware of what it is to be dependent on a volatile or unfriendly state for their energy needs. Rare earth elements are found in a number of places the largest of which is China. Those who advocate going purely for renewables such as wind and solar are basically saying that they are happy to be somewhat subject to the whim of China’s foreign and trade policies.\nPersonally, I find that unwise. Not to mention that rare earth elements are in shorter supply than thorium is. Recycling techniques will no doubt improve but the likelihood is that these elements will run out in much the same way fossil fuels are doing.\nIf thorium salt reactors were developed and refined and became a standardised technology the sizeable reserves, its more abundant distribution and the fact it is 3x more plentiful than uranium mean countries like China or the US or Russia wouldn’t have quite the same energy monopoly they do now. Put that in the context of how many conflicts have basically been based on acquiring raw materials for energy.\nI would very much like for my grandkids, if ever I have any, to grow up in a world where at least that reason for killing each other is taken off the table .\nAnd finally given the gravity of what climate change represents in terms of human survival let alone prosperity , I would argue that having as many tried and tested technologies on the table for future generations to use and enjoy is a good thing even if, right at this particular moment, some are more costly than others. I’d argue those future generations would be grateful for us at least getting that right.\n\nTLDR: Molten thorium salt reactors could provide a millennium‘s worth of energy potentially available in a safe scalable and sustainable technology that gives virtually every country access to the raw fuel without depending on another, thus adding to the climate change arsenal alongside renewables.",

      "title": "Florida apparently has a large hardcore of residents concerned about extreme climate change",
      "text": "Yale Climate Connections extreme weather supporters from Florida numbered 62 during the website's May fund raising campaign.  This was more contributors than the combined total of contributors from the seven other most populated U.S. states combined!\n\n[https://yaleclimateconnections.org/2025/06/you-did-it-our-2025-extreme-weather-coverage-is-funded/](https://yaleclimateconnections.org/2025/06/you-did-it-our-2025-extreme-weather-coverage-is-funded/)\n\nAdmittedly, Yale Climate Connections is a superb source of analysis and general information about hurricanes, which increasingly ravage Florida, but this relatively high level of contributors from Florida surprised me.\n\n[https://yaleclimateconnections.org/2024/11/human-caused-ocean-warming-intensified-recent-hurricanes-including-all-11-atlantic-hurricanes-in-2024/](https://yaleclimateconnections.org/2024/11/human-caused-ocean-warming-intensified-recent-hurricanes-including-all-11-atlantic-hurricanes-in-2024/)\n\nReportedly only 62 percent of Floridians are worried about global warming, below the national average of 63 percent.\n\n[https://climatecommunication.yale.edu/visualizations-data/ycom-us/](https://climatecommunication.yale.edu/visualizations-data/ycom-us/)\n\nThis low percentage of Floridians concerned about global warming is surprising as Florida reportedly is the third warmest state.\n\n[https://www.redfin.com/blog/hottest-states-in-the-us/](https://www.redfin.com/blog/hottest-states-in-the-us/)\n\n[https://yaleclimateconnections.org/2025/06/may-2025-was-the-planets-second-warmest-on-record/](https://yaleclimateconnections.org/2025/06/may-2025-was-the-planets-second-warmest-on-record/)\n\nAlso, thermal expansion due to ocean warming helps explain the accelerating sea level rise on the Florida coasts.  Over the past decade, sea level rise has increased over 10 mm (about 4/10ths of an inch) on average annually off the U.S. Gulf and Southeast coasts.\n\n>The faster SLR on the Southeast and Gulf Coasts, at a rate of more than 10 mm/year during 2010-2022, coincided with active and record-breaking North Atlantic hurricane seasons in recent years.\n\n[https://cpo.noaa.gov/rapid-sea-level-rise-along-the-us-east-and-gulf-coasts-during-2010-2022-and-its-impact-on-hurricane-induced-storm-surge/](https://cpo.noaa.gov/rapid-sea-level-rise-along-the-us-east-and-gulf-coasts-during-2010-2022-and-its-impact-on-hurricane-induced-storm-surge/)\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/climatechange/comments/1ic1tkd/ocean\\_temperature\\_rise\\_accelerating\\_as\\_greenhouse/](https://www.reddit.com/r/climatechange/comments/1ic1tkd/ocean_temperature_rise_accelerating_as_greenhouse/)\n\n>The Earth’s oceans absorb approximately 90% of the heat trapped by excess greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. About 40% of the historically observed sea level rise (SLR) can be attributed to thermal expansion from ocean warming, while 60% can be attributed to glacial and ice sheet melt^(5).\n\n[https://saet.famu.edu/research/dos\\_visualizing\\_sea\\_level\\_rise/sealevelriseandItsimpact.php](https://saet.famu.edu/research/dos_visualizing_sea_level_rise/sealevelriseandItsimpact.php)\n\nHarold Wanless, former chair of the Univ. of Miami geological sciences department (Wanless is in his 80s) and one of Florida's leading experts on sea level rise, repeatedly warns Floridians of the dire impact of global warming on sea level rise.\n\n>Scientists like Dr. Harold Wanless, a geologist and professor of geography and sustainable development at University of Miami, predict that later this century, downtown Miami will be underwater.\n\n>“The tide is coming in and eventually it’s not going to go back out,” Wanless said. “Climate change is real.”\n\n[https://www.tampabay.com/opinion/2025/02/11/real-reason-greenland-is-important-florida-column/](https://www.tampabay.com/opinion/2025/02/11/real-reason-greenland-is-important-florida-column/)\n\nIn fact, Wanless believes with every passing year, rising sea level will more negatively impact Florida coastal areas with severe consequences in the decades immediately ahead.\n\n>We’re probably going to have trouble buying and selling houses within 20 years because we won’t be able to get insurance or we won’t be able to get 30-year mortgages, and they will be flooding more frequently. There’s a good chance that we could have a three foot further rise in sea level within 30 years, and it’s possible in 50 years we could be up to five and six feet. In other words, this isn’t something that’s going to be a problem late this century or next century. It’s going to be a problem this century or even before. \n\n[https://www.theinvadingsea.com/2023/03/29/miami-harold-wanless-sea-level-rise/](https://www.theinvadingsea.com/2023/03/29/miami-harold-wanless-sea-level-rise/)\n\nSo I'm wondering if Floridians now overall are much more concerned about climate change, given the relatively great level of Yale Climate Connections contributors in May.  Future polls showing the percentage of Floridians concerned about global warming will be interesting.  A poll showing exactly what Floridians believe about climate change impacts on Florida also would be worthwhile, such as the current rate of sea level rise and the expected future level of sea level rise in the decades ahead.",

      "text": ">Research published in the journal Environmental Research: Climate, “[Human-caused ocean warming has intensified recent hurricanes](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/2752-5295/ad8d02),” found that between 2019 and 2023, the maximum sustained winds of Atlantic hurricanes were 19 mph (31 km/h) higher because of human-caused ocean warming.\n\n>And a parallel report by [Climate Central](https://www.climatecentral.org/report/2024-hurricane-attribution), a nonprofit scientific research organization, applied the techniques developed in the Environmental Research paper to the 2024 hurricane season, finding that climate change increased maximum wind speeds for all 11 Atlantic hurricanes in 2024, increasing their highest sustained wind speeds by nine to 28 mph (14-45 km/h). \n\n[https://yaleclimateconnections.org/2024/11/human-caused-ocean-warming-intensified-recent-hurricanes-including-all-11-atlantic-hurricanes-in-2024/](https://yaleclimateconnections.org/2024/11/human-caused-ocean-warming-intensified-recent-hurricanes-including-all-11-atlantic-hurricanes-in-2024/)\n\n>Potential intensity theory was pioneered in 1987 by MIT hurricane scientist Kerry Emanuel, who theorized that the wind speeds in hurricanes can be expected to increase about 5% for every increase of one degree Celsius (1.8°F) in tropical ocean temperature, assuming that the average wind speed near the surface of the tropical oceans does not change. [Computer modeling has found](https://journals.ametsoc.org/view/journals/clim/17/18/1520-0442_2004_017_3477_iocwos_2.0.co_2.xml) a slightly smaller magnitude (4%) for the increase....\n\n>Although a 10% increase in hurricane winds because of climate change may not sound like a big deal, it matters a lot because hurricane damage increases exponentially with wind speed. For example, [according to NOAA](https://yaleclimateconnections.org/2024/09/four-ways-climate-change-likely-made-hurricane-helene-worse/), a Category 2 hurricane with 100 mph (161 km/h) winds will cause 10 times the damage of a Category 1 hurricane with 75 mph (121 km/h) winds. This includes damage not only from winds but also from storm surge, inland flooding, and tornadoes. **Bottom line: A 10% increase in winds yields about a doubling in hurricane damage** (Fig. 2).  \\[Boldface emphasis added.\\]\n\nResearchers determined about 45 percent of the economic damages caused by Hurricanes Helene and Milton could be attributed to climate change, according to the article.\n\n>They added that the analysis “likely underestimates the true cost of the hurricanes because it does not capture long-lasting economic impacts such as lost productivity and worsened health outcomes.”\n\nNOTE:  According to post insights, available only to the author and moderators, this post has only an 86 percent upvote rate during the first 8 hours after posting.

So, I finally decided to launch it.\n\n**Here’s the Introduction** if you want to check it out:  \n[https://www.themundi.com/book/introduction-bold-climate-action-plan/](https://www.themundi.com/book/introduction-bold-climate-action-plan/)\n\nIt’s called **“How to Fix Our Broken World”**, and the first four chapters are now live and free to read online. (More chapters are coming as I finish them.) \n\nIt builds toward a full climate action plan for Canada, but most of the ideas can apply more broadly.\n\nThis isn’t a book about how bad things are. We know it's bad. It’s about what we can actually *do*, including:\n\n* Reforestation and carbon removal\n* Nuclear, geothermal, and hydrogen energy\n* Carbon capture, ocean cleanup, sustainable agriculture\n* A data-backed climate plan that could *pay for itself* over time\n\nIt’s been a 5-year passion project so far, written whenever I've had time outside of a full-time job and being a dad. I’d love any feedback, questions, critiques, or shares if you think it’s worth it. \n\nThere’s also a newsletter signup if you want to follow along. I'm especially looking for folks who are up for reading chapters and giving honest feedback as I go.\n\nIf you give the intro a read, I’d love to know what you think!",

      "text": "I’m working on some ballot measures in Ohio aimed at combating climate change, specifically phasing out gas and coal plants over the next 15-20 years, with potential funding from the EPA. But I’m facing challenges finding alternatives to nuclear and large-scale biomass. Biomass, while useful on a smaller scale, has issues when scaled up, like sustainability and environmental impact. Nuclear is a low-carbon option, but the long-term storage of waste for hundreds of thousands of years is a major concern. I’ve also looked into hydro-power, particularly pumped storage systems, but they’re not reliable in Ohio during the cold winter months because the turbines freeze up. So, I’m looking for alternatives—wind and solar seem like obvious choices, but scaling them up across a large, spread-out state like Ohio, with fluctuating weather, is a big hurdle. Battery storage is promising, but I’m unsure how quickly the technology can be ramped up to meet our needs in the next couple decades. Geothermal could be a possibility, but I’m not sure if it’s feasible here. Ohio, with a population of around 11.8 million, is a large and diverse state, and while it leans conservative, I believe climate change is something that can unite people, especially if we frame it in terms of job creation and energy independence. I’m hoping to get some input on what other clean energy alternatives might work at scale without relying on nuclear or large biomass plants. Anyone have thoughts or suggestions?

If companies have to pay more for paper only for it to be thrown a way, its minisculelly similar to making companies pay for carbon sequestration? Right?\n\n\n\nWould love to be told why I am wrong, for one I suppose I shouldnt assume the logging industry is 100% sustainable and this would instead eat into the world's forests instead of just increasing the throughput of sustainable forestry and logging only.

Since graduating I spent about a year doing freelance journalism (mostly general news - some science stuff), a year teaching high school science (physics, AP physics, chemistry etc.), and the last two years doing data analysis, strategy and communications (flyers, videos, basic website building etc.) for a global manufacturing company. I plan to stay at this company for at least one more year. \n\nI’m undecided on what I ultimately want to do, but I like the idea of anything related to climate/sustainability or space studies. That being said, I’m also much more interested in areas of these fields such as communications, data analysis, consulting, policy etc. rather than being an engineer, researcher or things of that nature. \n\nI know that may limit my options, but I would love to hear from anyone knowledgeable in these fields about related graduate programs and/or realistic career opportunities if I were to pursue this degree.\n\nI’m also more than happy to hear about potential opportunities in these fields having just my Bachelor’s and work experience.\n\nIf there’s any more context that would be helpful to know, please feel free to ask!",

      "title": "Can Individual Actions Truly Reverse Climate Change and Environmental Degradation?",
      "text": "How much of a difference can I make to reverse the impact of climate change and minimize environmental degradation? \n\nI was asked this by a friend the other day, and the question has been spinning in my head ever since. \n\nI believe that each of us can do our part, but how effective can our solitary efforts really be? \n\nHere’s the answer I gave in the moment:\n\nCollective action starts with individual choices, and even small steps can contribute to broader change. It's indeed important to recognize that the most significant impacts often come from those in positions of power, such as politicians, corporate leaders, and billionaires, whose decisions can shape policy and influence entire industries.\n\nGiven this reality, one of the most impactful actions we can take as individuals is to support and vote for leaders who are committed to addressing climate change and promoting sustainable practices. Now this isn’t easy either. \n\nTake the USA for example. The Democratic party is the one that takes this issue seriously, and campaigns on it. However, a Republican party controlled state, Texas, is leading the country in renewable energy production.  (not here to promote anyone, just mentioning)\n\nThe nuances of politics and policy are complex, and it’s crucial to stay informed and engaged beyond just voting, by supporting policies, initiatives, and organizations that push for meaningful environmental change.\n\nBeyond the political sphere, there are practical steps you can take in your daily life to reduce your environmental footprint. This includes actions like donating to reforestation projects, buying second hand instead of new, reducing energy consumption, and supporting companies with sustainable practices. \n\nEvery step counts, just as every misstep counts. Which is why it’s important to prioritize harm reduction as well.\n\n\n\nThis was me. What about you?",

      "text": "Hi,\n\nI am writing my bachelor thesis on sustainable agricultural policy and found what seems to be an inconsistency in a European Environmental Agency report. Unfortunately I don't have a lot of knowledge about climate science and would like to ask someone who does (my bachelor's focuses more on the policy aspect).\n\nOn page 54 of this EEA report on soil indicators and critical thresholds, at the section \"Critical limits for N concentrations in air and water\", the first indicator noted is NH3 in air, with a threshold of 1-3 mg / m\\^3. Right under it a study by Cape et al. (2009) is cited as the baseline for developing this threshold, however the actual 2009 study concludes that a threshold of 1-3 micrograms / m\\^3 is a suitable threshold. The EEA report is also theoretically consistent with the study in the difference in threshold between lichens and higher plants.\n\nMy question is, did I find a typograhpical error in the EEA report or is it actually correct and I don't get the science behind it? I don't know how to make sense of this and am a bit pressed for time to do so. Thanks in advance.\n\nSorry for bad formatting, I barely use reddit.\n\nSources:\n\nEEA report: [https://www.eea.europa.eu/en/analysis/publications/soil-monitoring-in-europe](https://www.eea.europa.eu/en/analysis/publications/soil-monitoring-in-europe)\n\nCape et al.

      "text": "Hi everyone,\n\nI'm a university(Vrije Universiteit) student currently writing my thesis on the topic of **Just Transition**—the process of moving toward a sustainable, low-carbon economy in a way that is fair and inclusive for workers, communities, and vulnerable groups.\n\nAs part of my research, my group and I are conducting short interviews with professionals involved in renewable energy or working directly or indirectly on Just Transition initiatives. This could include work in policy, advocacy, implementation, research, or industry. For this topic I am looking for people on all sides of the spectrum.\n\nBelow is the message we’re sending to potential interviewees. If you're working in this space—or know someone who is—and would be open to a 20–30 minute interview, I’d be very grateful for your support. The interview can be scheduled at your convenience and conducted via Zoom, phone—whatever suits you best.\n\nIf interested and willing to help, please shoot me a dm.\n\nKind Regards,\n\nSabri",

Despite contributing **less than 0.1% of global emissions**, Nepal is on the frontlines of the crisis.\n\nYet, even here, the fight for climate action is growing. From **community-led reforestation projects** to **youth-driven sustainability initiatives**, people are pushing for change despite limited resources. But the reality is tough—**climate finance is hard to access**, and many local efforts struggle to scale.\n\nThat’s one reason I started to work on climate projects. I have been working on this since I have graduated and now I can finally be more overt my need to ask a wider community. I also have been promoting this in Nepal since 2020. I also launched [www.carbonupdates.com](http://www.carbonupdates.com) to help a lot of younger people like me in learning from my experience. But I do need more experience from other people as well. So, \n\nI want to ask this community:\n\n* **How can smaller, developing nations like Nepal push for stronger climate action on the global stage?**\n* **What strategies have worked in other regions facing similar challenges?**\n* **How can individuals (especially those outside government and big organizations) make a real impact?**\n\nWould love to hear your thoughts and ideas. The fight isn’t easy, but giving up isn’t an option. **We keep pushing.** 🌍💚",

      "text": "Construction and infrastructure is responsible for over 50% of global emissions, much of that coming from the manufacturing and processing of high carbon materials like concrete and steel.

But changing a material on a large construction job? That can have huge impacts, and is relatively easy to do.\n\nThe amount of carbon saved when using mass timber vs steel, or a carbon capture concrete, dwarves anything a single person can do (unless that single person is the architect in charge of selecting materials!).

      "text": "A year or so ago I had an opportunity to speak to a Resiliency Officer for the South Florida Water Management District. I asked if it makes sense from a resiliency standpoint to rebuild in areas demolished from storm surges and other increasingly intensive weather events.  \n\nThey said the resiliency team looks at the data and makes recommendations, but ultimately the decisions are in the hands of the municipalities to change zoning codes in order to discourage redevelopment and turn previously developed land into nature preserves. \n\nThe problem with that is if you know anything about local governments, they’re usually beholden to real estate developers and want to do whatever increases their tax base. Therefore the concept of doing anything other than demolishing nature to build more buildings is contradictory to their goals. \n\nSome cities like South Florida (Broward, Miami, Monroe county) and Saint Augustine are trying to prepare by strengthening their building regulations for new construction and more resilient infrastructure, but it’s difficult to achieve that without being “overly burdensome” to the private interests against stronger regulations. \n\nAnyone paying attention to how the US federal government is responding to the issue of climate change knows they’re not taking this problem very seriously. Both sides of the political duopoly are prioritizing locking down the border from refugees and letting the chips fall where they may with town after town getting devastated. \n\nAnd Floridians know that the insurance crisis is going to reach a breaking point where no private insurance company will insure any costal construction or even any FL home. There will undoubtedly come a day where the federal government has to bale out Florida. \n\nDo you think Floridians should pressure their local municipalities to change the zoning code to be more environmentally sustainable? Are insurance companies going to be the death knell to coastal cities before the government can effectively act?",

      "text": "Hey, guys!  \n  \nI was wondering if there’s a way to measure total carbon offsets, particularly for large scale business.  \n  \nI recently had a client mention their company's offsetting program, where they track the environmental impact they make and try to balance it out at the end of each fiscal year. And it sounded pretty unrealistic to me.  \n  \nHere’s the thing: I get that reducing the impact from the start makes a lot more sense, but offsetting seems like an option too.  \n  \nSo, I am actually curious to know how many companies actually spend money on this? Like, are businesses out there taking real steps to reduce the impact they've already made through their operations?  \n  \nI know a lot of the focus is on sustainable practices, like using fewer resources or going green from the beginning, but I wonder how widespread offsetting programs are in practice.  \n  \nIf you know a company who is doing this (or even thinking of doing it/advertising about it), please mention their names below.  \n  \nAny leads help!",

      "text": "Just got my ballot and noticed we're voting on banning fur sales in Denver (Prop 308). I always thought fur was bad because of the animal cruelty thing, but I did some research and holy shit - the environmental impact is actually insane.\n\nFur farms dump animal waste into waterways, use toxic chemicals to preserve the fur, and the whole process has this crazy high carbon footprint just from feeding all the animals - especially since foxes and minks are carnivores so they need meat-based food for their whole lives.\n\nThere's this new study that compared real fur to other materials, and the numbers are wild. 1kg of mink fur has a carbon footprint 25 TIMES higher than polyester. The water usage is even worse. Real fur uses 104 times more water to make than fake fur, and even uses 5 times more than cotton (which everyone knows is already super water-intensive). The fur industry tries to claim it's \"the most environmentally friendly material available\" but that's straight up greenwashing.\n\nI know what you're thinking - isn't fake fur just more plastic pollution? Yeah that's definitely an issue, but there are actually some cool companies making eco-friendly fake fur from stuff like hemp, recycled materials, and even denim. Plus regular fur uses chemicals that are way worse.\n\nThe best part? Some animals escape these fur farms and become invasive species (how does that even happen??). Plus trappers sometimes catch endangered animals by accident when they're trying to get fur-bearing animals.\n\nI'm personally voting yes on Prop 308 because it’s a no-brainer. What do you guys think? Anyone else seeing a fur ban on the ballot in their city?\n\nFor anyone wanting sources, [here's the study I’m referencing](https://www.hsi.org/news-resources/fur-industry-accused-of-greenwashing-as-new-report-reveals-carbon-footprint-of-fur-fashion-far-higher-than-other-materials/).",

      "title": "Anyone who's serious about sustainability should change to a plant-based diet",
      "text": "Studies have shown the best way for us to reduce deforestation, land use, fresh water use, eutrophication, and biodiversity loss is to change from omnivore diets to plant-based diets. This is because animal agriculture is the leading driver of all of these factors, and switching to a plant-based diet can reduce them by as much as 75% (example source [1](https://www.nature.com/articles/s43016-023-00795-w), [2](https://www.nature.com/articles/s43016-021-00343-4), [3](https://josephpoore.com/Science%20360%206392%20987%20-%20Accepted%20Manuscript.pdf)). Per the [FAO](https://www.fao.org/4/a0701e/a0701e00.htm), animal agriculture also emits more greenhouse gases than the entire transportation sector.\n\nWe need to protect what is left of our biodiversity and change the way we interact with the environment. The World Wildlife Fund (WWF) states we've lost an estimated [69%](https://livingplanet.panda.org/en-US/) of wild animals in the past 50 years, with losses as high as 94% in places like Latin America. We've already changed the world so much that [96%](https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.1711842115) of mammalian biomass is now humans and our livestock.\n\nOne of the most common rebuttals to the above is a plant-based diet isn't healthy, and therefore isn't a viable solution for sustainability. In fact, it can be a major improvement over what many in the west are currently eating. My country (USA) gets [150-200%](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18469286/) of the protein we require and only [5%](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6124841/) hit the recommended minimum daily fiber intake. The Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics is the largest nutritional body in the world with over 112,000 experts, and its [position](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27886704/) is a plant-based diet is healthy for all stages of life and can reduce the chances of getting the top chronic diseases, such as heart disease, type 2 diabetes, obesity, and certain cancers.\n\nCorporations and governments won't lead the charge alone against the status quo, so it's important that we as consumers take responsibility at the same time.\n\nThis does not include the rare exceptions, such as people who have no other choice, hunt/fish overpopulated animals, or otherwise. Since only a few hundred million (vertebrate) animals are hunted/non-commercially fished each year, whereas [hundreds of billions](https://ourworldindata.org/how-many-animals-get-slaughtered-every-day) are commercially farmed and fished, this post is in regards to the latter 99%.\n\nAlso, if it's between reducing by, say, 90% or not reducing at all, the prior is clearly preferred.\n\nFarming practices have become [very cruel](https://watchdominion.org/), with an estimated [90%](https://www.sentienceinstitute.org/global-animal-farming-estimates) of farmed vertebrates being on factory farms and [99%](https://www.sentienceinstitute.org/us-factory-farming-estimates) in countries like the USA.  Switching to a plant-based diet can reduce this harm at the same time.\n\nThe dominant diets in developed nations are based on societal and behavioral norms, but are far from optimal. It's true that diet is a personal choice, so I hold it is better to choose a diet that is much more sustainable than what we're currently eating.\n\nSince we're in the midst of earth's 6th mass extinction, it's time for us to step up and take responsibility for our own impact.",

      "text": "I've quit cigarettes for over a month now. This might surprise you, considering how much I used to enjoy smoking. Cigarettes were a part of my daily routine for nine years, and I truly liked them. However, while I enjoy cigarettes, I love nature more. That’s why I do not want to buy another pack(I'm trying). During those nine years, I prided myself on being a responsible smoker. I never threw my cigarette butts in the street, believing that this small action was enough to protect the environment. But I’ve come to understand that the entire tobacco process from cultivation to packaging and delivery leaves a damaging footprint on our planet.\n\nWhat’s even more concerning is the behavior of major tobacco companies like Philip Morris (Marlboro), British American Tobacco (Lucky Strike), and R.J. Reynolds (Camel and, yes, American Spirit). These companies have a long history of unnecessary and cruel animal testing, and they continue these practices today. Sadly, some people believe that American Spirit is a harmless, vegan option, but the truth is, purchasing this brand still supports R.J. Reynolds and their unethical practices. If quitting smoking is difficult, and you still choose to smoke, you might consider switching to a brand from Imperial Brands (like Golden Virginia or Davidoff), which, as far as we know, doesn’t engage in animal testing.\n\nHowever, it’s important to remember that even these brands aren’t free from environmental impact. The tobacco industry is a significant contributor to pollution. It’s responsible for around 0.2% of global greenhouse gas emissions and has been linked to deforestation, water contamination, and air pollution. The World Health Organization has accused the industry of emitting millions of tons of carbon dioxide about 84 million metric tons—and opposing regulations on the plastic used in cigarette filters. The sheer amount of water used in tobacco production—22 billion liters further exacerbates climate change and deprives vulnerable populations of safe drinking water.\n\nCompared to the average sugar consumer, a smoker’s impact on the environment is staggering. Smoking contributes almost five times more to water depletion, nearly ten times more to fossil fuel depletion, and four times more to climate change. The air pollution caused by cigarettes is ten times greater than that of diesel car exhaust you find it hard to quit smoking, I understand, and it’s commendable if you make an effort not to litter. But don’t fool yourself into thinking that your actions have no consequences. By supporting these companies, you’re contributing to climate change and other environmental issues that threaten our planet. Stay safe!",

How nice it was to be able to see new places without needing to check out of a hotel room and drive to the new place.\n\nNow that I know just how bad for the environment going on a cruise is, I won't be able to go back.

      "text": "Hello everyone,\n\nI definitely do not have a lot of knowledge on sustainability and how to be environmentally friendly, but I'm really interested in learning more and being more aware. I'm at about that time in my life where I should start looking into getting my own vehicle, but I of course have concerns about my impact on the environment. \n\nI'm wondering what the best means of transportation is overall while still being affordable and eco-friendly. I live in an area that is not very walkable and doesn't have a lot of bike lanes or options for public transportation other than the bus. Even though I plan on trying to take advantage of the aforementioned options as much as possible, I'm wondering if there are any vehicles that are practical and still environmentally friendly? Are mopeds, for example, a better means of transportation in that sense? Or electric bikes/scooters? \n\nSorry in advance if these are dumb questions. Like I said I really just want to try to be more aware of my impact in my day to day life. Any insight is much appreciated.",

I’ve been looking into carbon offsets and wondering how they compare to donating to charities or foundations.\n\nOffsets seem more direct since you’re paying per ton of CO2 reduced or removed, while charities tackle broader systemic issues but can be harder to measure in terms of direct impact. I’ve also read a bunch about the legitimacy of some offset projects but have also seen some fantastic ones that I would genuinely want to support.\n\nWhat do you think?\n\n* Are offsets inherently more impactful especially with the goal to reduce personal impact, or do charities provide unique value?\n* How do you decide where to allocate your money for the biggest difference?\n* Any trustworthy offset projects or charities you’d recommend?\n\nLooking forward to hearing your thoughts—thanks for sharing! 😊",

      "text": "48% of US consumers say they are ready to start changing their habits in order to save the environment. *But how do they, and you, start?*\n\n**Misconceptions about zero waste living**\n\n1. “Zero Waste Means Literally Zero Waste” One of the biggest misconceptions is that being zero-waste means *producing absolutely no waste at all*. In reality, the term “zero waste” is more of an aspirational goal than a rigid requirement. It encourages minimizing waste as much as possible, but even the most dedicated zero-waste advocates occasionally produce some trash. The focus should be on progress, not perfection.\n2. “You Need to Buy Expensive, ‘Eco-Friendly’ Products”. It’s easy to feel like you need to overhaul your entire life and invest in chic, eco-friendly products to be zero waste. However, the movement is actually rooted in reducing consumption, reusing what you already have, and repurposing items creatively. Instead of buying a set of bamboo utensils, for example, simply carry a set from your kitchen. It’s less about aesthetics and more about making mindful choices.\n3. “Zero Waste is *All or Nothing*” Many people think that unless they can fully commit to a zero-waste lifestyle, there’s no point in trying at all. But like any lifestyle change, it’s best to start small and build over time. Whether it’s replacing single-use plastic bags with reusable ones or composting your food scraps, each step you take contributes to the larger goal of reducing waste.\n4. “It’s Just About Recycling and Composting” While recycling and composting are important components of a zero-waste lifestyle, they’re not the only strategies. The movement is based on the “5 R’s”: Refuse, Reduce, Reuse, Recycle, and Rot (compost). Recycling should be a last resort after exploring ways to reuse or reduce unnecessary items.\n\n**Realistic approaches**\n\n1. Start with an **Audit of Your Waste** before diving into any drastic lifestyle changes, take a week to observe your household’s waste patterns. What items are you throwing away most frequently? Are there alternatives that could reduce that waste? Conducting a waste audit helps you understand where to begin and where you can make the most impactful changes.\n2. **Swap Single-Use Items with Reusables On**e is one of the simplest and most effective steps is to replace commonly used single-use items with durable, reusable alternatives. Start with items you use daily, such as water bottles, coffee cups, grocery bags, and straws. By gradually phasing out disposables in favor of reusables, you’ll start reducing your waste significantly without feeling overwhelmed.\n3. **Focus on the “Refuse” and “Reduce”** principles while recycling often gets the most attention, the first two R’s—refuse and reduce—are actually the most important. Refuse items you don’t need, like freebies, promotional items, or excessive packaging. Reduce consumption by buying only what you need and choosing products with minimal packaging. The less you bring into your life, the less waste you’ll have to manage.\n4. **Embrace Imperfection** zero-waste living is not about being perfect—it’s about making conscious choices that align with your values and capabilities. Some days, you might forget your reusable cup or need to buy something with plastic packaging. That’s okay! The goal is to create a sustainable lifestyle that you can maintain over the long term.\n5. DIY Where You Can, But Don’t Overdo It Making your own household products—like cleaners, toothpaste, or snacks—is a great way to reduce waste. However, it’s easy to get overwhelmed with the DIY culture surrounding zero waste. Focus on a few simple DIY projects that fit into your routine without causing stress. For example, making your own cleaning spray with vinegar and citrus peels is easy, affordable, and effective.\n6. Reduce Water Consumption-water is a precious resource, and conserving it is crucial. Simple practices like taking shorter showers, fixing leaks, and using water-saving devices can greatly reduce your water usage. Additionally, consider collecting rainwater for gardening and use drought-resistant plants in landscaping​\n7. **Join a Community for Support and Ideas:** Embarking on a zero-waste journey can be much easier with the support of a community. Join local zero-waste groups, attend workshops, or follow online communities where people share tips, successes, and challenges. This connection can be motivating and help you discover new strategies that you hadn’t considered.\n\n# The bottom line is progress over perfection...\n\nSimilar posts on [https://greenlymovement.substack.com/](https://greenlymovement.substack.com/)",

      "text": "I am making an effort to minimize harm and adapt to our degraded environment. As part of that I am trying to reduce unnecessary petrochemicals in my life, especially in textiles, and especially fuzzy ones (fleece jackets, microfiber diapers). It is a daunting task just to avoid new plastic fabrics, so much so that I'll tolerate non-fuzzy kinds. What is the best action to take with the fuzzy plastic clothes already in my house?\n\nSome has been gifted to me. Some I purchased years ago, skeptical of plastics but not actively avoiding them yet. I'm at a point now where, despite society acting like polyester fleece is normal, it seems outrageous to me to have stuff like this around. Even moreso with young children at home. \n\nWhat do you think? Am I crazy, or is it insane how normalized petrochemical clothing is? Maybe I need a therapist. And/or...\n\nDonate this stuff? That's just passing it to the next person.\n\nThrow it away? Near me that means landfilling, which seems like a different kind of bad than careful use and enjoyment in my home (hard to enjoy a fuzzy polyester blanket now, though)\n\nWhat can one do with unwanted, unnecessary petrochemical clothing?\n\nIf there's a better Reddit community for this sort of post I'd welcome suggestions too.",

      "text": "***TLDR:*** *I work in corporate sustainability and feel frustrated by the minor impact we’re having on the real issues. Despite good intentions, the current system feels broken, and many people/companies don’t care or won’t change. I’ve seen firsthand how \"sustainable practices\" on paper don’t match reality, especially in places like Asia. I’m questioning whether staying in this field is worth it and wondering if anyone else feels the same.*\n\n\\_\\_\n\nI’m currently working in the field of corporate sustainability at a large german company and I’m finding it increasingly difficult to reconcile my work with the realities of tackling problems caused by the way we do business on this planet. I’m confident that the way we conduct most of business on this planet is fundamentally harmful to both people and the environment.\n\nWhile I see that many sustainability teams within corporations are genuinely trying their best (besides doing carbon accounting and disclosure/reporting 90% of their time), I feel that our overall impact on the real issues of sustainability is often minor. It feels like we’re just scratching the surface while the deeper systemic problems remain unaddressed.\n\nI’m in this field because I believe it’s the right thing to do. I do feel a moral obligation to advocate for meaningful change. However, I also see how many individuals and corporations either don’t care or don’t do better because there aren’t viable alternatives without overhauling the entire system.\n\nI regularity travel to Asia where some of my relatives live. I’ve noticed that, while there’s a shift towards sustainable business practices on paper, the reality I experience is quite different. There’s rampant resource wastage, excessive waste production, and a general disregard for ecosystems and nature.\n\nSometimes, I doubt whether we can make a real difference. I find myself questioning if I should continue in this field or consider changing my area of expertise.\n\nHas anyone else experienced similar feelings? How do you cope with these challenges? I’d love to hear your thoughts and any advice you might have.\n\nThanks for reading and for any support you can offer.",

Anytime people talk about sustainable ways of feeding such a large population, they mention going vegan, but I don't understand why we should be that conservative. Wouldn't it make more sense for everyone to grow their food locally the old fashioned way (using manure, manual labor, etc.)?\n\nOf course with more than 8 billion people we'd need to supplement food growth with some fertilizer and a little bit of machinery, but I think that would be alot more sustainable and less destructive to the environment since we won't have to deal with all of the requirements/problems that are associated with industrial farming. I don't think taking up lots of space is an issue either, considering that we've already destroyed most natural environments and reduced the wild mammalian biomass to just 3%-6%, I think trading in our cities and urbanized environments for farms would be a net positive in the end, even if they take up more space.\n\nIs there anything wrong with how I'm seeing things or any improvements?

Which uses more energy and water to manufacturer?\n\nDo paper cups cause trees to be cut down, or are they only made from fibers that are “scrap” from wood production? \n\nI’m only asking about the pre-consumer impact, not about the harm from a landfill/litter standpoint. It’s my understanding that virtually no paper cups are compostable due to their plastic lining. \n\nEssentially, if I have to choose between buying paper or plastic disposable cups, which is overall better for the environment?",

      "title": "Sustainable Tourism: Balancing Economic Growth with Environmental Protection",
      "text": "Tourism is a powerful economic engine, generating trillions of dollars globally and supporting millions of jobs. However, the rapid growth of tourism has brought significant environmental challenges, from the depletion of natural resources to pollution and habitat destruction. As the world becomes more aware of the environmental impacts of tourism, the concept of sustainable tourism has gained prominence. This approach aims to minimize the negative effects of tourism while maximizing its benefits, both for the environment and local communities. It may not be *the* answer to solve all the environmental issues that tourism can raise, but it sure can help.\n\nSustainable tourism is defined by the United Nations World Tourism Organization (UNWTO) as tourism that \"takes full account of its current and future economic, social, and environmental impacts, addressing the needs of visitors, the industry, the environment, and host communities.\"\n\nSustainable tourism is crucial for several reasons:\n\n1. **Environmental Preservation**: Tourism can lead to the degradation of natural environments through pollution, overuse of resources, and habitat destruction. Sustainable tourism practices help protect ecosystems, conserve biodiversity, and reduce carbon footprints.\n2. **Cultural Heritage Protection**: Many tourist destinations are rich in cultural heritage. Sustainable tourism ensures that these cultural assets are preserved and respected, rather than being commercialized or damaged.\n3. **Economic Benefits for Local Communities**: By promoting sustainable tourism, local communities can benefit economically through job creation, income generation, and the development of infrastructure, all while preserving their way of life.\n4. **Long-term Viability of Destinations**: Unsustainable tourism can lead to the deterioration of tourist destinations, making them less attractive to visitors over time. Sustainable practices ensure that these destinations remain viable for future generations.\n\nSeveral destinations around the world have adopted innovative sustainable tourism practices that balance economic growth with environmental protection. Here are some exemplary practices:\n\n1. **Ecotourism in Costa Rica**\n   * Costa Rica is a global leader in ecotourism, with 25% of its land protected as national parks, reserves, and wildlife refuges. The country emphasizes low-impact travel that benefits local communities and conserves the environment. Tourists can explore rainforests, volcanoes, and pristine beaches while supporting conservation efforts and local economies.\n2. **Community-Based Tourism in Bhutan**\n   * Bhutan's \"high value, low impact\" tourism policy limits the number of tourists to preserve the country’s cultural heritage and natural environment. Tourists pay a daily fee that includes accommodation, meals, and a sustainable tourism royalty, which is used to fund free education, healthcare, and infrastructure for Bhutanese citizens.\n3. **Sustainable Accommodation in Sweden**\n   * Sweden is home to numerous eco-friendly hotels and lodges that prioritize sustainability. For instance, the **Treehotel** in northern Sweden offers unique accommodations in the treetops, built with sustainable materials and powered by renewable energy. These eco-lodges focus on minimizing their environmental impact while providing unique and immersive experiences.\n4. **Marine Conservation in Palau**\n   * Palau, an island nation in the Pacific, has implemented a \"Palau Pledge\" that all visitors must sign, committing to respect the environment and culture of the island. Palau is also home to one of the world's largest marine sanctuaries, protecting its rich marine biodiversity from overfishing and other threats.\n5. **Waste Management in Japan**\n   * Japan’s commitment to sustainability is evident in its meticulous waste management practices. In towns like Kamikatsu, residents separate waste into 45 different categories to ensure that as much as possible is recycled or composted. Tourists are encouraged to participate in these practices, contributing to a cleaner environment.\n\n**How Tourists Can Support Sustainable Tourism**\n\nTravelers can play a significant role in promoting sustainable tourism by adopting the following practices:\n\n* **Choose Eco-Friendly Accommodations**: Look for hotels and lodges that have strong environmental policies, such as energy efficiency, waste reduction, and water conservation.\n* **Support Local Businesses**: Opt for local guides, restaurants, and shops to ensure that your spending benefits the local economy.\n* **Reduce Your Carbon Footprint**: Consider using public transportation, biking, or walking instead of renting a car. When flying, choose airlines that have carbon offset programs.\n* **Respect Local Cultures and Environments**: Follow local customs, avoid disturbing wildlife, and stick to designated trails when exploring natural areas.\n* **Minimize Waste**: Carry a reusable water bottle, avoid single-use plastics, and dispose of waste properly. \n\nSo, let's support sustainable tourism, for a greener world.",

I’d love to find ways to make a meaningful impact, maybe something measurable and actionable, rather than just hoping every change will add up.\n\nI’m particularly interested in tracking my carbon footprint and maybe even offsetting emissions, but I don’t know how to get access to quantities for consumers. I know offsets aren’t a perfect fix, but I think supporting climate projects that actively reduce emissions is a step in the right direction. We’re always going to emit some level of carbon, so getting closer to net-zero feels like a practical goal I can work towards.\n\nAre there any apps, tools, or websites that help with this? Or ways to make sure I’m supporting projects that truly make a difference?\n\nLet’s talk about what we can actually do to make a difference—any tips or info would be amazing!",

      "text": "It’s hard to miss the growing sense of fatigue around climate change. Conversations are fading, policy momentum is stalling, and even the Environmental Protection Agency faces pushback. While the broader fight for our planet seems to lose steam, there’s still something each of us and every organization can do right now: make the economic case for action and audit your own carbon footprint even more deeply.\n\nPeople may tune out climate rhetoric, but almost everyone pays attention when you talk about **their bottom line**. Business leaders juggle budgets, procurement pros chase cost savings, and consumers shop for value. By framing carbon reduction as a direct opportunity to reduce expenses, you transform environmental action from an abstract cause into a tangible economic strategy.\n\nFor eco-minded advocates, the mission hasn’t changed, we still need to pull the world back from the brink. But our tactics must evolve. Instead of preaching to the converted, let’s equip organizations with clear, financially compelling roadmaps to cut emissions in their own operations first.\n\nSimple Steps\\*\\*:\\*\\*\n\n1. **Identify Scope 1 -** All the greenhouse gases you emit directly through stationary combustion (boilers, furnaces) or mobile sources (vehicles). Upgrading a boiler from 80% to 95% efficiency can cut gas bills by 20–30% and often pays back in 18–36 months.\n2. **Identify Scope 2 Emissions -** Emissions tied to the electricity you purchase and consume. Today’s green‐energy contracts rival standard rates, and an energy-management system can pay for itself in 12–24 months by trimming bills 10–20%.\n3. **Identify 3 Emissions** All other indirect emissions in your value chain, think upstream suppliers, logistics, and end-of-life product use (e.g. website hosting, data centers, non-green material suppliers etc.) **a Scope 3 audit** can pinpoint hidden lifecycle costs. Companies typically uncover that 20–40% of their total spend lies in procurement and logistics—and can cut those costs by 10–25% through cleaner inputs and leaner shipping\n\nThere are a lot of tools out there that help in building the business case i.e. lower costs, stabilized budgets, reduced regulatory risk, you’ll win buy-in from even the most “economy-first” stakeholders. And in doing so, you’ll accelerate the very progress we all want to see on climate.\n\nStop expecting people to care about climate for climate’s sake. Instead, show them how caring for the climate can boost their own bottom line today.",

      "text": "A few months ago, regarding climate change, I considered myself an optimist. That was until I took a global environmental politics this past semester in college and learned about how difficult the situation is regarding working together as a planet to end climate change. Furthermore, the election of Trump tanked my optimism even further. \n\n  \nNow, I am at a low point. I am not hopeless, but I've realized that the situation will not improve enough for the tipping point to be avoided. I am worried about how I will deal with the numerous and grand consequences that will befall me and my family in the future. I worry about the increasingly concerning numbers of articles saying the xy species have gone extinct or z habitat has disappeared. And worst of all, I fear that in my much later years, I will be nothing but full of anger and hate towards the past generations and specifically the corporations, billionaires, and politicians who did everything in their power to prevent us from making any sort of progress towards a greener future. \n\n  \nSo, how does one come to terms with the current situation and make peace with what will occur in the future?",

      "title": "What If We Tried Living Differently - And This Time, It Worked?",
      "text": "I’ve been doing a lot of thinking lately about the way we live - not just as individuals but as communities, and even as a species. It’s hard not to feel overwhelmed sometimes with how much seems to be going wrong. Climate change, inequality, loneliness - the list goes on. But there’s this idea that keeps coming back to me, and it feels simple at its core: What if we just lived differently? What if we focused on building something that works for people and the planet, rather than just trying to patch up what’s broken?\n\nI know, it’s not a new thought. People have been dreaming about utopias and better ways of living forever. Plenty of communities have tried to create them, and let’s be honest - a lot of them have failed or fizzled out. But that doesn’t mean it’s not worth trying. In fact, I think we’ve learned so much from those attempts, and that’s what makes this time different.\n\nThe difference is that we’re not trying to build something perfect. There’s no such thing. It’s about building something real, something adaptable. It’s not about rejecting modern life entirely or pretending the world’s problems will just disappear if we all grow our own veggies. It’s about creating spaces where people can come together and figure things out as they go - a balance between innovation and simplicity, between individual freedom and community care.\n\nThe truth is, this idea isn’t mine alone. It’s built on conversations I’ve had with people from all walks of life - farmers, activists, educators, even random strangers at events. What’s struck me is how many people feel the same: that the way we’re living now just doesn’t make sense. There’s this shared longing for something different, something better. And it’s not about running away from the world, but about creating a way of life that helps us reconnect - with each other, with nature, and with ourselves.\n\nWhat makes this feel achievable, for me at least, is that it’s not about starting from scratch. It’s about taking what’s already been done - the successes and the failures - and building on that. It’s about looking at the systems we have and asking, \"What’s actually working? What isn’t? And how can we do it differently this time?\" That’s where the difference lies. It’s not about pretending we’ve got all the answers. It’s about being willing to try, to learn, and to grow together.\n\nI get that it sounds idealistic. And honestly, it is. But that’s okay. Sometimes you need big, bold ideas to start chipping away at the mess we’re in. If this resonates with you, I’d love to hear your thoughts. What kind of changes would you want to see in the way we live? What would it take for you to feel like you’re part of something bigger? I think these questions are where the real magic starts - not in the answers, but in asking them. And if you want to really get involved in this sort of thing chuck me a DM :)",

They’ve seen 500-year droughts, 500-year floods, back to back... Our No. 1 export cannot be topsoil from erosion from these massive storms.” \n\nTopsoil erosion is a huge issue for farmers across the world and we know that climate change exacerbates and accelerates this issue. People dedicate their lives to studying topsoil, but this quote really got at something else that resonated with me as an somebody from a rural town. \n\nSometimes rural populations are written off as indifferent to (or deniers of) climate change, but that's far from the truth. Across every city, county, and town in the U.S., you'll find passionate individuals and communities committed to mitigating and adapting to the effects of climate change.",

I live in the Netherlands, and everything that’s supposed to be more sustainable or a better alternative always seems to cost more.\n\nOn top of that, it’s a constant struggle to figure out what actually counts as sustainable and what’s just clever marketing. I also notice how people seem to view sustainability. I get that going fully vegan, never traveling, and living off the grid might be considered ideal, but that’s not something I want to commit to completely. I love exploring and traveling because our precious world has a lot to offer and to experience, and I also enjoy eating meat now and then, especially when it’s local and responsibly raised. Finding a good balance without feeling judged is really tough.\n\nHow about you? What do you find most frustrating, confusing, expensive, or just plain annoying when trying to live more sustainably? And if you could magically fix one thing, what would it be?",

Meat, single use items… I really want to make a change to benefit the world in as small of a way as I can. But it does require surrendering the comfort and convenience of life. Would I be happier eating steak and fried chicken all the time? Obviously. I think a lot of people would,\nbut you have to let that go since it’s the right thing to do. And that’s scary. I think part of it is losing the innocence of being young when you didn’t have to worry about those sorts of things. So these are feelings of growing up as well. It’s also because it’s switching up such familiar habits and flipping them over because it’s such a big culture shock. It’s also a little scary because when I was a kid I didn’t have to worry or be aware of these problems in the world, and that’s a great privilege that I miss. And I think a lot of people ignore these things or pretend that they don’t exist so they’re able to live without the stress. Did anyone else face these feelings when opening their eyes to these problems and making these changes. \n\nIt’s also tough because I’m a huge picky eater, even with animal products, I don’t like most meats or veggies. It’ll be a slow process but I’m ready to really try",

I actually asked the hiring manager (who's now my boss lol) during my interview how reckons with working in such a controversial industry. She essentially said that she believes that corporations have a moral obligation to be transparent and promote sustainability and that she'd rather be working here than doing some BS for a company like H&M.

I tested positive for mold toxicity after moving into a home that had incorrectly remediated water damage. The mold remediation industry has almost no regulation and is absolutely atrocious. I've become really interested in using recycled or repurposed materials to create a home, probably starting with updating an apartment and then building a small home at some point. I've come across a couple of videos that have mentioned safety issues that I didn't think of. Today, I saw a video with someone who repurposed items from a house that flooded. I'm not sure if it was stuff thrown out after the flood or left over materials, but it made me think that I'd really like to have a broad and comprehensive understanding of the safety issue related to using repurposed materials in a home. I'm not sure if this is even the right sub, but does anybody have any recommendations?",

My house is damp, and I’m worried that everything smells, that I smell and everyone else can smell it.

      "text": "It’s a pretty disappointing day for many of us and the planet. And the news and media we consume are going to sense that we’re hurting, then pull us into a feedback loop of hand-wringing and despair. But there is something else we can do: take whatever you’re feeling right now, and do something. Whether it’s anger, sadness, or fear, let it galvanize you to action. Do something today, and you will feel better. A few suggestions:\n\n1. Conservatives have promised to “unleash fossil fuels”. But in many states, you don’t have to participate in that agenda; in many states, you have a right to choose your energy provider. It is often as easy as filling out a form. Competitive energy dot org has a great state by state map for this.\n\n2. Research local environmental advocacy groups in your area, and take this opportunity to get connected. Even if it’s joining a facebook group or email list, it is a step towards sustainable legislation in your area.\n\n3. Contact your lawmakers, ESPECIALLY at the local/municipal level. Tell them that sustainability is still a top priority for you as a voter. At the national level, most politicians are just going to tread the party line, which can make it feel like it’s useless to do this in conservative areas. But city council members, mayoral candidates, and other local authorities are much more in touch with the people, and your message may mean more.\n\nBy all means, take care of yourself today. It was hard news all night. But if you’re like me, and you won’t feel better until there’s something for you to *do*, here’s a few ideas to get you started.",

Push come to shove biodiversity is my priority over carbon but I’d like to do well on both fronts when not having a tree just isn’t an option for everyone else in the family.\n\nPot trees just don’t work.

I’ve enjoyed my work, however it is a life goal of mine to pursue graduate education. \n\nI would love to know the perspective of someone who is completing or graduated a program in this area. Do you feel it was “worth” it? What did you find most interesting? What was most challenging? How did this degree contribute to your overall life? Where did you do this degree and would you recommend it? Etc. \n\nI have a special interest in social sustainability and have done some boots on the ground work developing sustainable business practices to bring people in rural areas out of poverty sustainably. I also am interested in food systems. \n\nI’ve looked at some policy masters programs, or programs at the University of Vermont that is a “green MBA” or PhD in a chosen area of sustainability. Although I’m not partial to the MBA, I see its potential. \n\nLocation is not a concern for me. I’m willing to travel to attend a program that works for me. I live in the USA and would consider an international program, though studying abroad would definitely present some more logistical challenges. Would love to hear everyone’s thoughts and suggestions, thank you!",

      "text": "If 50% of people reduced their animal products consumption by half, that would have the same impact as 25% vegans. We urgently need more vegan and vegetarian products, and cheaper ones, such as plant milks and yogurts, etc… And that would only be possible if more people join the cause. You don’t need to go fully vegan, you could just halve meat and animal byproducts.\n\nMy experience: I started reducing my meat and fish consumption, followed by substituting dairy with plant-milks, and now I only eat eggs twice a week, which I may leave soon. I did it little by little and it wasn’t hard at all. If you do it slowly you’ll see that it’s actually easy. \n\nEating 90% vegan is super easy, and not inconvenient at all. the more demand there is, the more varied and more affordable plant-based food becomes. 😊",

For our situation we are between pressure treated pine and Trex composite decking. \n\nWood:\n\nPros: Renewable, biodegradable \n\nCons: impact of forestry, pressure treating, staining, won’t last as long\n\nTrex Composite:\n\nPros: claims less carbon emissions, lasts longer, made from recycled plastic bags and waste sawdust \n\nCons: mixture of materials, likely not able to be further recycled so will go to a landfill. Spreading microplastics in cutting and weathering \n\n\nSo Wood is natural, renewable and biodegradable. But with composite, using landfill recycled waste instead of new materials sounds like a pretty big pro.  Plus the extra longevity. The ending up in a landfill aspect seem like the biggest thing against composite, but the plastic was going to head there anyway unless there was another use (know now it’s a mix of materials). \n\nIt doesnt seem like a clear cut answer but hoping for some thoughts from others. Sorry for the long post and thanks!\n\n\n\nTrex page on environmental impact:\n\nhttps://www.trex.com/why-trex/eco-friendly-decking/\n\n\nPro wood site:\n\nhttps://www.thinkwood.com/blog/why-lumber-is-the-better-environmental-choice-than-composite-decking",

Hope you are doing well 🩷\n\nI wanted to know more about good natural and ethical brands in case I need to buy clothes, I wanna start changing bit by bit to a more sustainable life (of course, keeping my clothes the best I can). \nIs just that almost all my wardrobe is from aliexpress or shein bc it was a lot more affordable to me than anything else (i think thats why people buy from those \"brands\" mostly)\nI hate having that plasticky(?) feeling on my body, the clothes riping apart months later, and the horrible things they are doing is disgusting on my body and my soul.\n\nSo wanted to change a bit to natural and ethical clothing, but idk where to look or who to trust, a lot of them are very expensive (like 80-90€/per clothes) and I know it has to be expensive bc is good, but maybe idk 50€? Hahahsa\n\nAnyways, and anyhow, pls tell me you favorite brands or any trusting brand you know, thank you!\n\n🌒🌕🌘",

Creating a new product will almost never be better than using something that's already made.\n\nThis is why when I need new cookware (as rare as that may be) I head out to goodwill or antique shops, and go for good, high quality vintage cast iron. I love the stuff.\n\nThis being said, there are times when you need nonstick. I use Green Pan brand for my small frying pan that is use when I need nonstick. They seem to be relatively eco-friendly, and no have all the nasty stuff in most nonstick glazes.\n\nWhat do you use/recommend? Green Pan also? Copper cookware?",

My husbands parents graciously gifted us 2 acres of land with the intention that we build our dream home on it. It was something me and my husband talked about in passing but was never something we fully agreed upon. The plot of land has many trees and the deer come up here to rest during the fall season. it is surrounded by many acres of farm land (we're in iowa.) There are not many homes near us that are affordable as they all need many restorations and we want a home that we will live in for the rest of our lives. We talked about every tree we take down we plant two more and add solar to the house we build but i still feel so terrible inside that i am taking away what little land is left to build something and that i am being selfish for doing this and i am not sure what the best course of action is. Do we use the land as equity? still find an already built home and make the renovations which will still cause us to dump parts of the house? I just need some advice on how to navigate this.",

Millions of people planting forests, restoring coastlines, building renewables, repairing ecosystems. In two years you’d leave with skills, friends, and a healthier planet — not PTSD and a uniform.\n\nWe could have a planet-wide public channel — no politics, no propaganda, no ads — just straight facts on the state of Earth, updates from scientists, and clear actions anyone can take. No greenwashed “fixes” designed to make corporations richer. Just reality.\n\nWe know how to mobilise at that scale — we’ve done it before.\n\nWe could change the trajectory in years, not decades.\n\nWe won't — because governments and corporations don't make money off of fixing what they broke.\n\nSo we just sit back and watch the clock tick away, hoping \"someone else will do it,\" while leaving our kids with the bill.

If the whole world can be made aware of the issue in plain sight, there is no excuse left to turn a blind eye.\n\nWe need to revolt, push the system, and protest for this above everything else — because nothing else we fight for will matter if the planet can’t sustain us.\n\nI’m only posting to spread awareness of how things are only going to get worse.  \nThank you for taking your time to read.\n\n  \n**TL;DR:** We’ve mobilised for wars, the Moon, and pandemics — but not for the one thing that keeps us alive. It’s time to treat saving the planet like our lives depend on it… because they do.",

I care deeply about my impact and try my best to be mindful about my consumption. Having ADHD can make being sustainable difficult sometimes and when my symptoms get bad and I fall short I feel intense guilt and shame. For example, I’ve been trying to cut back on my takeout consumption and meal prep instead, only to buy a ton of groceries and they go bad before I use all of them or struggling to eat leftovers due to food sensitivities or my chaotic schedule. Another example is forgetting my water bottle so I have to consume plastic. It hurts me deeply and makes me feel like a poser of some sorts. I’m just not sure if anyone in the community struggles with this as well or can give me some tips that work for them.",

I graduated last year from a UK university with a 2:1 in BSc environmental biology (ecology + environmental science) and after a year out living in a UK city independently in a dead end admin job (though excelling) I’ve decided to move to Australia.\n\nFirstly, has anyone had experiences with recruitment agencies in the above fields, how were they and did they allow you to temp or move around the country? If not, are there any full time perm positions that do?\n\nI was more interested in the environmental sector in the UK because of the progression and opportunity compared to practical ecology work, though I’d be much more inclined to explore practical fieldwork (ecology, conservation) should it pay high enough because it’s a completely different ball park. No salary target (see q4) as I have no idea what the economy is like there, the only request is that the job is a hybrid of outdoors and indoors, or purely outdoors. I’m honestly fine with any subfield of ecology. I have a huge range of skills that I’d be happy to finally make use of rather than sitting on a computer.\n\nI’m a very experienced DJ, years of experience so I would be very interested in building a career out of this in aus as I have done in the UK (more of a side hustle career though), are any major cities a good start including info from above or are there some in particular where opportunities/partying is higher? No genre preference as I mix and produce all.\n\nWhat’s the COL like over there? What is the minimum salary I would be able to put money aside with? Or at the very least explore to the fullest extent, or travel to SEA with.\n\nLastly, I’m going completely solo as I want a fresh start, I’ve heard great things about aus people but I imagine the jobs further outback or in less major cities will make it more difficult to make new friends, so this is a key one for me.",

As far as I know, he is not actively working in the field of biology, but he has his own zoo. So, anyway! The gist of the argument:\n\nHe said that ecology is NOT a science. I mean, at all. If he wasn't a biologist, I wouldn't have considered his argument, but he was basing it on his experience. According to him, ecology is a pseudo-science with superficial and made-up terms. For example, it takes a team of chemists, biologists, zoologists, etc. to predict and plan for ecosystem protection and conservation, because they are the ones with the right knowledge to do the 'work' of ecologists. And to be an ecologist you have to know too many disciplines in depth and it's not realistic. He said that ecology is essentially doing nothing because superficial knowledge is not enough to predict/protect the environment and analyze it.\n\nIs there an argument here to prove that ecology is really a science to him?",

Well there are native weeds out there that are beneficial to the environment and wildlife. Clovers for example are considered a weed yet are a great replacement for grass lawns if you use native clovers to your area. \n\nAnother example is a plant in my area called the evening primrose, it’s considered a weed yet is one plant that gives desert tortoises a food source they can eat. \n\nWe need to get away from this mindset to destroy all weeds because it could be affecting wildlife and the soil without even realizing. We need to start teaching communities the difference between native and invasive weeds.",

Thanks everyone!\n\nWe get a lot of rewilding/de-extinction posts here, and I usually allow them because they are at least loosely related to the science of species and their environments. Not that it matters from a moderation POV, but they are usually highly upvoted, which is fine, but they also cause a lot of push-back, with the usual complaints being humans further meddling, it being borderline science fiction, etc. I don't need to rehash, [just check out this recent thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/ecology/comments/1kwz252/could_elephants_be_introduced_into_southcentral/) for more commentary than I could possibly write here. (Please refrain from commenting in that thread if you found it from this link). There are possibly a hundred other threads over the years that you can also dig up if you want further examples.\n\nI'm wondering what you, the subscribers, think of these sorts of posts, and whether I should make a rule and blanket ban them, keep the status quo, or something in between. **This is not a referendum**--I just want to get a sense from the community as to how this sub should be run in this particular case. Please upvote comments you agree with.\n\nIf you have any moderation questions, ideally related to this topic, then ask away. If you have any rewilding or de-extinction questions then also feel free to ask away, but I probably won't answer them myself as I'm not an expert and frankly not particularly interested in the subject.",

I have 2 problem with cloning extinct animal:\n\n1)i dont think we can cloning any extinct pleistocene megafauna because even if we find DNA of any pleistocene megafauna in bone or mummified specimen,those DNA are too damaged to be used for cloning.\nWe could genetically engineering asian elephant to look like woolly mammoth but the result would not 100% true mammoth but asian elephant with some mammoth trait.\nKeep in mind even with genetic engineering, we cannot turn norway brown rat into christmas island rat despite both species are 95% genetically same\nhttps://www.sciencenews.org/article/crispr-de-extinct-christmas-rat-species-gene-editing\nBasically people are overestimate what our cloning & genetic engineering technology can do\n\n2)even if we succesfully cloning pleistocene megafauna,i dont think the cloned animal will have exact same behavoir as it species before became extinct. A baby animal need to learn from their parent how to find food & survive in the wild. The cloned animal will not have parent from their species that could teach them how to live & behave like their species.\nIf we clone mammoth,the cloned mammoth will have asian elephant as mother. Asian elephant & mammoth are 2 different species\nthat live in different environment so they have different behavour,lifestyle,interaction with their environment.\nBasically If we cloning extinct animal,how can we sure that the cloned animal will have exact same behavour & will interact with their environment same as their species before extinction?\n\nI already made this post in r/megafaunarewilding but my post get deleted by mod in that subreddit.",

After that I worked at a zoo as a Husbandry Assistant for about a year, now since August I've been working as a Research Technician at my undergrad institution. The lab I'm in does biophysics research with ion channels, which isn't exactly what I went to school for, but I've been really enjoying it. The problem is I want to go to grad school for fall 2026, and am planning on applying by the end of this year. I've been considering a master's because idk if I can commit to a phd/want to be in the stressful academia environment my whole life. At the same time, job prospects seem to be better for phd grads and funding for your degree is more stable. BUT given the state of this trump administration a career in research seems difficult, especially with ecology. I don't want to give up on my passion, but should I pivot to biomedical research for grad school or stick with ecology? Should I jump right into a phd or start with a master's? orrrr do i go into a different field completely lol. any advice or input is appreciated",

I hate it. I despise maybe 90% of engineering. I've been unemployed in California for a year and it sickens me applying for jobs that I qualify for - plastics, aerospace, defense, oil, etc. Just today I saw a position fitting of my background in a company dedicated to \"whole body reversible cryopreservation\" because humans are afraid of death and their own nature. My worldview can not be more opposite and I can't ever hold a job while drowning in cognitive dissonance.\n\nWe're doomed when engineers are just laborers for the military industrial complex and whatever else capitalist enterprise, having stopped seeing themselves as in service to actual people and the environment (most of my college mates did start out with the latter pov, now working in AI, military, or oil). Ecology on the other hand is THE critical work, exactly because the modern world has divorced itself completely from the source of life. We need to get back, but unfortunately, as yall probably already know, ecology is very much underfunded, underutilized, undervalued.\n\nIt was heartbreaking to finally realize that the US is just one big weapons manufacturer, and any work valued and compensated is involved in one way or another to this violent industry. The only resolve is to fight violence with care by tending to nature and restoring balance.\n\nSo all this to ask, is it possible to get a master's in ecology with a BS in engineering? I still haven't even paid of my undergrad debt so I'm tight with money as well. But, I want to live a life of meaning now that I've seen what meaningless looks like.",

Growers intentionally drought stress their plants to get more concentration of flavor at the expense of yield. \n\nWouldn't grasses and trees do the same? If CO2 levels rise but there's a rise in drought wouldn't that be a self limiter on growth and the nutrition profile would more closely resemble a lower CO2 environment? If studies were looking at raised CO2 levels but the plots were raised under ideal circumstances - the problem with nutrition might just be vigorous growth rather than pure CO2 changes. Have they done studies on nutrition with raised CO2 levels but decreased water?",

      "text": "**\\*\\*\\*UPDATE\\*\\*\\***\n\n**Edit: Should’ve clarified — the whole point of this post is to find a way to actually** ***end*** **Lyme disease by drastically reducing the tick population.**\n\nObviously the most straightforward approach would be the largest deer cull possible, but I didn’t focus on that here since it’s already widely known and controversial.\n\nThe medicating deer idea was mostly for fun, though I do think ivermectin feeders might be worth trying in some contexts.\n\n**I’m actually serious about the guineafowl concept though.** Not as a full introduction but as a seasonal, controlled release in high-risk areas. Would love to get an actual discussion going around whether that could be viable or if something similar has been tested before.\n\n\\------------\n\nHi everyone,\n\nI’m looking for ecological insight on two unconventional strategies that might help reduce the surge in tick populations in northern US states like Wisconsin, where Lyme disease and other tick-borne illnesses are becoming increasingly severe.\n\nI understand the ecological risks of introducing or modifying species and I’m not married to either of these ideas. I just want to get the conversation started. If there is any biological strategy that could help end ticks’ oppressive reign, it’s worth exploring.\n\n**\\*\\*1. Seasonal and/or Cold-Hardy Foraging Birds for Tick Control\\*\\***\n\nGuineafowl are possibly the only bird species known to consistently consume large numbers of ticks. They are already used for pest control in agricultural settings. However, they are not cold-hardy and typically cannot survive winters in the Upper Midwest. That might actually make them well-suited for seasonal use. We could breed and release flocks in the spring to forage in tick-prone areas, then let them die off naturally in the winter or be ethically culled before snowfall. This would avoid long-term ecological disruption.\n\nAnother option would be to selectively breed or genetically develop a cold-hardy strain of guineafowl that could establish a more permanent seasonal presence without requiring shelters or supplemental food. Are there native birds or other species that could fill this role more safely? Has a seasonal release model like this ever been tried in another pest control context?\n\n**\\*\\*2. Medicate Deer (And Moose) Instead Of Hunting Them\\*\\***\n\nWhite-tailed deer and moose are both major hosts in the tick life cycle, especially in northern climates where moose populations are being devastated by winter ticks. One idea is to use tranquilizer darts to medicate these animals with long-lasting anti-parasitic treatments. The goal would be to treat enough of the population to disrupt tick reproduction over time.\n\nThis approach could be applied in both agricultural regions and remote forests, and might offer an alternative or complement to culling. It would likely need to be sustained for several years and coordinated at the state or regional level.\n\nOne concern is that many people rely on the meat during hunting season. If hunting were paused or reduced in favor of medicating animals, the state would likely need to provide a meat subsidy or food assistance to those affected. There is also the question of whether medicated venison or moose meat would be safe to consume later, and whether these medications could affect the wider environment.\n\n\\---\n\nThese two strategies are not mutually exclusive. I’m just wondering whether either or both could be viable parts of a larger ecological solution. Are there examples of similar programs being tested elsewhere?\n\nI would love to hear from anyone working in wildlife biology, ecology, conservation, or land management.\n\nThanks.",

      "text": "Most explanations for mast seeding, those years when trees across vast regions all produce huge seed crops, focus on weather, resource availability, or pest cycles. But what if there’s a global environmental signal that helps synchronize them?\n\nPlants have magnetically sensitive proteins called cryptochromes that affect flowering through light-sensing pathways. Large-scale geomagnetic disturbances from solar storms change Earth’s magnetic field strength and direction for days to weeks, and these changes are detectable even by simple biological magnetoreception.\n\nMy hypothesis:\n\nGeomagnetic activity during a plant’s floral induction period could subtly shift hormone balances via cryptochrome pathways, nudging many trees in a region into synchrony.\n\nPredictions:\n\nMast intensity in a given year should correlate with specific patterns in Kp/Ap geomagnetic indices from the prior 6–24 months, even after accounting for climate and resource factors.\n\nTrees grown in magnetically shielded environments or exposed to altered magnetic fields during induction should flower out of sync with controls.\n\nPlants with cryptochrome mutations should show reduced magnetic sensitivity in flowering timing.\n\n\nThis could be tested with existing mast data, climate records, and geomagnetic logs, plus greenhouse experiments with magnetic shielding or field manipulation.\n\nIf supported, this would add a new dimension to how we understand plant phenology and large-scale ecosystem synchrony.\n\nHas anyone seen research along these lines?

I know invasive species are typically brought over by humans, have no natural predators, and live in an environment similar enough to their home environment climatically that they can survive. \n\nWouldn't this have been true of many species, pre-humans, that walked or rafted over to other lands and recolonized there? Like horses, or gray wolves, or dire wolves, or lemurs, there are so many examples of animals that entered new areas where they possibly had no natural predators and were able to thrive for a long time until the environment adapted to their presence through natural selection.\n\nI am looking for an answer that isn't just \"because humans are bad\" - I feel like modern ecology can sometimes lack perspective on human-wildlife interactions, and how we are animals and a part of nature too, so what we do is not alien, even if it doesn't have a positive outcome.\n\nLastly, can a species overcome its invasiveness?

In the UK water companies are famously awful for sewage dumping into rivers and the sea and I'm not sure if working as an ecologist for something that is negatively effecting the environment seems a bit wrong? \n\nIt would be better pay, less overtime and much better for learning and career progression as i'd have involvement in a range of surveys compared to my current role. They also do have a host of sustainability goals and conservation development targets they're proving they're hitting. \n\nWould love to hear some thoughts? 🌱",

But before I just launch into it, I'm curious how those who are in the field of ecology/environment, and those who want to be, view the degree? Some specific points I'm interested in:\n\n-BS or BA? BA would allow for more cross-curricular fields, and reduce the hard science edge. BS would make it more similar to an Environmental Science degree (which we already have).\n\n-Students, what did YOU think this degree was when you applied? What were your expectations? How did your school meet or fail those?\n\n-Professionals, what are you looking for in someone with a Sustainability degree? What are the typical gaps you see in recent graduates?\n\n-What else should I know before building this? I am a classically trained ecologist, and I am aware that I don't know what I don't know. What do I need to adjust my thinking and expectations on?\n\nEDIT/UPDATE: Thank you all so much for all your feedback! There's a lot of good info here for me to dig in to.

      "text": "Edit: I should say Introduced instead of Invasive.\n\nYes people have introduced things that have created problems. But the current dogma - that unless a plant has been deemed 'native' it should be not planted or even eradicated - is completely off base and misinformed.\n\nFor starters, it ignores the reality that at least for Europe and N America, pretty much EVERY ecosystem that exists is less than 14000 years old. Look at a climate map of the ice age and look at the current, there's basically no area that has stayed in the same zone. So all our ecosystems moved in from the south and are newly established. And 14K years is not enough time for evolution to happen.\n\nSo, when new species come in from other continents, they sometimes take off and grow aggressively, like smooth brome in N America. That's how it gets an 'invasive' label. On the surface that sounds bad - but the ONLY way we got our current environments over the last 10000 years was rapid invasion of plants that grew aggressively, had dieoffs, and then fit into the new niche. There's no way else we could even had the mix of species we have now.\n\nSo with smooth brome, that's only had like 200 years, it's invaded and is now integrating into the species mix. No other native US grass species on the eastern plains and rockies can grow as fast in hard conditions, so it's producing a lot more biomass and plants and animals are learning how to integrate it in. Deer love to bed in it and prairie dogs love eating it. If we eradicated smooth brome today, these biomes would be worse off because it would leave an ecological hole that native species can't fix.\n\nBottom line, there's a difference between noxious and invasive - and if there's problems with invasion, it probably means the ecosystem was not optimized anyways.",

(Though if I am in the wrong place any recommendations for where to post this would be great!) Just for a bit of background here before I get to my big question, I'm 25 now and have been out of school for roughly 2 years and been doing work based on my college degree in those past 2 years. I went to school for Media Studies which means that for work I mostly edit video and make promotions for stuff. However, I don't really feel super fulfilled doing that and would like a change of pace. Going back to school seems like the most logical step to me. I care a lot about the environment, animals, education and everything that goes a long with that so I figure an ecology degree makes sense. But here's where I run into trouble I think. In High school I  struggled with math and science (I feel the need to clarify that I didn't struggle with science for lack of interest, I loved the classes it was specifically the math part of those classes I struggled with.) occasionally and ultimately that's what turned me off from pursuing any kind of science degree the first time I went to college. Ultimately the question I've come to ask is, if I committed to going back to school for a new degree, would I be setting myself up for failure by pursuing a degree in Ecology or perhaps another related scientific field? If I am, are there alternative routes I could take to being able to work in an ecology related field?  For those of you who also struggled with math did you find it hard to do classes for ecology related fields/degrees? \n\nTLDR: I want to go back to college for an ecology degree but am nervous about having to do math and science again because A. I'm rusty ad out of practice. And B. I wasn't the best at it in high school. Am I screwed?",

For example, someone who’s is happy to keep drinking coke while being aware of Coca Cola’s horrible impact in the environment. \n\nI can section the reasons behind my frustrations \n1. Cognitive dissonance. Very often the person doing the harmful action, will also themselves identify as a supporter of the cause they are helping make worst. A clear contradiction.\n2. Legitimacy. When questioned about the contradiction brought on the last point, the answer will often be a poor founded justification that is enough for them to continue doing the action. I often question the legitimacy of this justification and I can’t help but think that rather than believing in it, they are simply not willing to give up their harmful action because it compromises their own comfort.\n3. Privilege. I come from a third world country and I’m currently living in a first world country, and even though there’s way less people carrying about the issues in my own country, the fact that there’s people in a position of privilege who could much more easily do something about it but still won’t, makes me bitter…\n4. Personal relationship. I call a lot of these people my friends and family. I feel love for them. Seeing them do all of these points has been depressing me recently.\n\nAnd so I find my self here looking for a solution to my biggest frustration of them all. Failure.

These two factors would be pretty impactful in Canada and the western US where a couple weeks longer of frost free time expands the growing season in percentage terms by quite a bit. \n\nNow these effects would benefit both conifers and deciduous trees, but it seems that if there's a disturbance, deciduous trees can grow faster and outcompete conifers and they are less prone to fungus / beetle outbreaks.

      "text": "TL;DR: THE PUBLIC COMMENT PERIOD FOR THE REMOVAL OF NATIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL POLICY ACT (NEPA) REGULATIONS ENDS IN 22 DAYS. I have not seen much reporting on this at all, and I'm terrified. How can I draw more attention to the environmental consequences of this interim rule and the public comment period??\n\n  \nThe intention is to decentralize the process so that regulations are under the purview of each individual agency and will be rewritten to suit the needs of the administration. If you are sad/angry about federal cuts and firings, this is a way to speak directly to Megan Healy at the whitehouse council. In your comment, please mention that a centralized, regulated, and consolidated NEPA process is imperative for agency cooperation. \n\nLink: \\[federalregister\\](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2025/02/25/2025-03014/removal-of-national-environmental-policy-act-implementing-regulations)\n\nI am a graduate student, scientist, former NPS and USFS seasonal (wildlife technician). My biggest fear right now is that something major will fly under the radar - unnoticed by the public and largely unreported by the press amidst the chaos.\n\nLast week, my research advisor informed me that the Trump administration has started making moves to repeal National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) regulations. If you are unfamiliar, this act requires federal agencies to prepare detailed statements assessing the environmental impact of major federal actions significantly affecting the environment. So far, I've seen very little reporting on the consequences of this final rule, or the fact that there is an open comment period. \n\nIf you have worked for a federal agency, chances are you know someone who helps write Environmental Impact Statements because of NEPA. This is THE process for public disclosure of the environmental impacts of federal projects and our ability to fight them in court. Think major mining operations, highway development, fuels reduction projects, timber harvests, etc...\n\nThis interim rule was posted on the federal register on 2/25/25 and is effective April 11th, 2025. \n\nPlease submit your comment, share, and suggest methods to spread this message. No matter the eventual outcome, we can't let this pass without saying something.",

      "text": "So it’s always been my dream to work in nature, to study animals in their natural environments and help preserve them. I absolutely love the idea of working in education and being in a career where I can educate people daily on wildlife and all things related to nature would be a dream come true. My only concern is, I know just how competitive it is to get a job in ecology - which is what I plan on studying starting from next year September. By the time I start my course I’ll be turning 26, and I’m only starting then because well due to my immigration status I was not able to start earlier. I keep hearing about how a Bachelors Degree is not enough and experience is essential, which I completely understand. But truth be told my resume isn’t all that impressive, I still have lot of experience I need to obtain. I guess my question is, am I too late?? Am I too old to pursue a career in ecology?",

      "title": "Realistic Chances for Agroecology MSc with Humanities BSc? (ISARA, Wageningen, UNISG, NMBU)",
      "text": "Hi everyone,\n\nI'm aiming for a career in agroecology and plan to apply for MSc programs for 2026 entry. My biggest concern is my undergraduate background: a BSc in Philosophy and Politics from a Russell Group UK uni (high 2.1, couple points off from a First). I'm aware these programs typically prefer applicants with natural sciences or agriculture degrees, but they all accept social sciences to some degree, and kind of leave the door open in that respect.\n\nI'm was hoping to get some opinion of how realistic my chances of getting in are if I successfully execute a comprehensive plan between now (June 2025) and the application deadlines (Jan-March 2026).\n\nHere are the top 5 MSc programs I'm targeting:\n\n* **MSc in Agroecology** \\- ISARA (co-taught with Wageningen University)\n* **MSc Resilient Farming and Food Systems** \\- Wageningen University & Research\n* **Master in Agroecology and Food Sovereignty** \\- University of Gastronomic Sciences (UNISG)\n* **MSc Agroecology** \\- Norwegian University of Life Sciences (NMBU)\n* **MSc in Agroecology** \\- Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences (SLU)\n* **MSc in Environment and Development** – University of Copenhagen (not Agroecology because UoC doesn't allow candidates without scientific Bachelor's, but there's some overlap)\n\nI'll also apply to some other master's in sustainable development/business as a secondary option to agroecology.\n\nMy plan to strengthen my application is as follows:\n\n* **Foundational Courses to bridge my academic gaps:**\n   * Capra Course on Systems Thinking (already completed).\n   * By September, I will have a year of sales experience, and I've been doing well so far.\n   * Complete the \"Permaculture Educators\" course (PDC + Permaculture Teaching combined certification).\n   * Take \"The Future of Sustainable Business: Enterprise and the Environment\" 8-week course (Oxford University / Smith School of Enterprise and Environment).\n   * Take a selection of introductory online courses in core natural sciences (biology, ecology, plant science, soil science, agriculture).\n* **Practical Experience:**\n   * Get practical experience from September on a permaculture, land restoration, agroforestry or agroecology project, ideally one where I could help with project coordination, community outreach, budgeting, or even developing educational materials alongside physical work.\n* **Application Materials:**\n   * Hopefully obtain a strong letter of recommendation from a leading figure in permaculture, who I have a good relationship with, highlighting my commitment and practical engagement.\n   * Craft a compelling personal statement that articulates why my unique background in philosophy and politics, combined with my demonstrated passion and acquired practical/scientific knowledge, makes me an excellent and unique fit for an agroecology MSc.\n\nMy main worry is that my BSc might be too far removed. How much of a shot do you think I have if I go all in and complete all of these courses and gain solid work experience?\n\nAlso, for the natural science short courses, are there any specific recommendations for online platforms or highly regarded introductory courses in ecology, plant science, agriculture or soil science that would effectively bridge the gap for a humanities background? So far I've found 7-8 on Coursera offered by different universities. Ideally free ones, as I'll already be spending around £3,250 (\\~4,400 USD) on the Permaculture Educators double certification and the Oxford short course.\n\nAny advice or insights would be greatly appreciated! And thanks in advance! I really want an environmental career, and with my love for food, nature and desire to help with the food insecurity crises that we'll face in the coming decades, I feel like this could be my pathway to make it a reality.\n\n**Thank you again!!**",

      "text": "I believe dingoes should be spared from excessive culling, because while I may be American, I’ve had a life long fascination in zoology and ecology, and would like to spread awareness on why we should save one of Australian most iconic species.\n\nRecent policy changes in some Australian states have extended hunting permits, leading dingoes to be a the brink of extinction, and this is bad news, as dingoes being eradicated causes more problems than it solves.\n\nMany people believe dingoes should be eradicated because their an invasive species brought by humans, but while yes they were brought to the outback by humans, they’ve been on the continent for so long that they effectively integrated into the ecosystem.\n\nAs this archeological shows https://www.nma.gov.au/defining-moments/resources/arrival-of-the-dingo#:~:text=The%201969%20discovery%20of%20archaeological,at%20least%203%2C500%20years%20ago.&text=Since%20the%20mid%2D2000s%2C%20technological,into%20the%20origin%20of%20dingoes.\n\nDingoes have been on the continent for atleast 3500 years! To put that into perspective, dingoes were already on the continent, when lions stilled roamed the Greek peninsula https://www.sapiens.org/archaeology/lions-europe/\n\nTo say dingoes have been on the continent since ancient times is an understatement, dingoes arrival in Australia would have been ancient history to Vikings in the Middle Ages.\n\nHeck some research shows that dingoes could have been on this continent for 5000 years, so it’s possible dingoes were roaming the Australian outback before the great pyramids of Giza were built.\n\nDingoes have been on the continent for so long, that as this article shows https://www.google.com/gasearch?q=should%20dingoes%20be%20eradicated&source=sh/x/gs/m2/5\n\nThat they actually help the ecosystem in many ways, helping to prevent kangaroos and other herbivores from overgrazing, leading to the ecosystem being more sustainable than it would otherwise be.\n\nDingoes also help protect the environment from far more destructive invasive species, like foxes, cats, and rabbits.\n\nRabbits in particular reducing the amount of fertile soil and available grass for farmers and livestock, meaning even for farmers and ranchers, it’s in their best interest to preserve dingoes presence, because the alternative is far worse.\n\nIt’s been proven and shown that eliminating not just apex predators, but in particular pack hunting canines can have negative consequences on the ecosystem, look no further than Yellowstone as an example https://www.yellowstone.org/wolf-project/#:~:text=By%20the%20late%201920s%2C%20wolves,a%20profound%20effect%20on%20Yellowstone.\n\nFarmers and ranchers claim that they have to eliminate dingoes to protect their livestock, but not only do dingoes make food for their livestock more plentiful as I explained earlier, but livestock can be protected from dingoes through none lethal means that people have been using to protect livestock stock for over a century, like barbed wire and guard dogs trained to scare dingoes off.\n\nIn conclusion, it’s better to leave dingoes alive, regardless of how they got on this continent, so let’s please pressure policy makers and influence farmers to #savedingoes!",

Contrary to the stereotype, I'm not that interested in building fast cars or big machines or quantum computers. I simply chose my undergraduate degree because I love finding out about how nature works on a fundamental level and hoped to do some good with that knowledge. \nNow, I have passed up an opportunity for a geophysics master's because I thought the program I chose would be more interdisciplinary and more focussed on teaching students how to make an impact outside of academia.\n\nBut part of me is itching for the environmental physics classes I now don't get to take.\nIn addition, I would love to gain some skills in ecology. I believe it would be great for anyone in sustainability to also know a bit about the environment they are trying to protect, but I am also just genuinely interested and trying to make the most of my years in university. \nTherefore, I have thought about trying to take some additional ecology/geophysics classes and I really hope my uni will let me. I don't have a biology background so I can't do a proper ecology graduate degree but I should be able to handle classes on things like GIS, atmospheric physics or oceanography, right? I'm not afraid of extra work either, if that's what it takes :)\nI also considered applying for internships or summer schools or certificates in that field and was wondering if anyone has any tips on that.  \n\nSo, in conclusion: Does anyone have any tips for me on how to squeeze some ecology into my education? \nI'm from Europe, and I would love some somewhat affordable options, even though I am prepared to spend some extra money for extra education.\n\nThanks a lot!",

With mammoths being de-extinct by colossal it really got my mind going on what else would be possible, and mostly what would be possible without genetical engineering. I think the best location figuratively speaking would be the area that american prairie association has. Some of the animals would be (mostly megafauna): step caribou, bison, mule deer, white tail, prong horn, wolves, elk, moose (in the river areas), american cheetah, musk ox, feral alpacas, bactrian camels, cougars, mammoth (possibly), brown bears, black bears, american lions, przewalski horse or feral horses, burros, etc. Obviously you need the little guys, insects, and funguses to help sustain the eco system. \n   Now I'm not 100% sure on mammoths in this type of environment specifically because the lack of trees, plus I flat out don't know their diet. \n   Another topic, prong horns don't have any inherent predators because the American cheetah died off. But!! I did find that cougars and cheetahs are very close living relatives. So, you could either transplant a cheetah subspecies that is adapted to cold environments or cross breed and cougar and cheetah to get a possible american cheetah. \n   American lions honestly a cold hardy African lion would work. \n   Could you imagine how amazing of an experience this would be when all the animals fall into their niche. I wonder if it would be possible to start something similar down I'm texas they seem to have huge properties with exotic animals on them. Just food for thought I would love if you contributed animals that would be relatively easy to find and adapt to the habitat. Or! If you have a better location to sustains these animals. Obviously this is just supposed to be fun and nothing serious, you wouldn't be able to tackle fencing containing the animals to a single area.",

I’ll literally take the lowest level job if it means I get to do what I love. \nI know that that is corny, but I keep on reading all this stuff about how there isn’t much jobs available in it and I keep on hearing contradictory information. If there isn’t jobs in it then how are people getting employed??? And how do I make myself stand out? Please help. I seriously cannot imagine not doing something related to this. I feel it is my calling. Even working on a farm would just be wonderful.",

All maps about the historical range of malaria and of the Anopheles mosquito worldwide that I've seen show central and southern Argentina unaffected.\n\nI know that yellow fever hit Buenos Aires in the 19th century, and this disease generally has a good territorial correspondence with the more malignant, less cold-adapted falciparum malaria, the difference that yellow fever was more common in urban environments and malaria was more common in rural ones.\n\nThe same thing seems to happen with South Africa and most of Australia.",

      "text": "Hello, I am wondering if I could get some feedback on the from the ecologist community surrounding the ethics of peat moss harvesting (primarily in Canada). As a native plant nurserymen I try to be very careful about the soil materials I'm using.  I had planned to use a peat free soil mix for my potted plants, obviously this comes at increased price.  I did some further poking around about current peatmoss harvesting primarily in Canada.  It seems they are truly making efforts towards sustainable harvesting there, operating on roughly 55,000 acres with 3-5 year plant recovery windows.  I understand it's still a destructive process, but by containing the harvesting to a smaller area and working to restore the bogs post harvest, I found myself wondering if this is an acceptable trade-off.  Coconut coir is what is used as a replacement for peat moss, but that also comes at a cost of its carbon footprint shipping.   Is the trade-off of coir vs pest closer than I previously thought?   \n\n     I want to hear from your side because many companies/industries love to greenwash, so I am still dubious of peat harvesting.  Just like I am dubious of what most people call sustainable logging, just because the trees grow back doesn't mean we aren't degrading the environment.  I started my own nursery because I despised the environmental damage caused by the nursery industry. \n\nSo I'd love to hear about your thoughts of peat moss harvesting for soil products, thanks!",

      "title": "We need more ecology-focused input on fisheries management decisions. How to do it:",
      "text": "Hello r/ecology , I hope this post is allowed but I really think this message needs to be out there. I'm in a government fisheries management role with \"inside\" knowledge about fisheries management decision making, rulemaking, process, etc. Hence why I'm using a throwaway account as this isn't against any rules or laws, but I just don't want any info being traced back to me, especially with the current political climate in the U.S.\n\nFisheries are a huge issue in marine ecology and conservation as unsustainable harvest, gear usage contributing to marine debris, and habitat destruction are pervasive in fishing practices. For a little bit of background on how fisheries are managed, decisions are made through the regional councils with representatives from different managing bodies and user groups. These include the New England, Mid-Atlantic, South Atlantic, Gulf of Mexico, Caribbean, West Pacific, Pacific, and North Pacific Fisheries Management Councils. Since most fisheries resources span jurisdictional boundaries, these councils primarily function so that the states and feds can agree on management decisions for consistent regulations and enforcement across boundaries. A bit like how treaties function. I could write pages on how these work as each is achingly complicated, but that's the jist of it. \n\nFishing communities are deeply intertwined into the process because they put effort into learning how to contribute. I **have consistently seen more participation from recreational fishing charter companies and commercial fishing fleets than conservationists across decades**. And one thing I know for a fact is that participation DOES make a difference - big time. Fishers regularly pressure the councils to get what they want, which is more access and less regulations. It's hard to ignore the people in front of you saying that they need more access to fish because they're \"barely scraping by\", pointing out flaws in regulations, pointing out flaws in stock assessments, saying that the data doesn't line up with what they see out on the water. And, the council has to listen because part of the job of fisheries management is to provide opportunity to fishers. But in my experience, the scales of public representation are too unbalanced. We need equal pressure from INFORMED conservationists who can provide an avenue to justify more cautionary management decisions to make sure the councils are doing their jobs for the people who care about the environment, too. **The more public pressure comes from the stance of conservation and responsible management, the more these decisions can be justified.** \n\n  \nI urge you all to become more informed and more active at these councils. Many councils publicly stream these meetings and are required to allow public comment in written form, in-person testimony, or virtual real-time testimony. Now, it is VERY EASY to get overwhelmed in the council process with information overload. My recommendation is to pick the council in your area and stick to that. Then, get on their website and find a fish stock that you are interested in, and go to the briefing books for past meetings and start reading up on the issues for your fish that the council take up. Many times you can find documents here that provide a summary of the issue at hand with important background. There should be a clear path on their website to provide public comment, but it's important to provide public testimony and comments that are informed and understand the complexities with these issues, yet provide a clear message. \n\nIt's important to be active in natural resource management and I promise you, you can make a difference with this.",

So researchers did an experiment in which bird were dewormed, and they found that the intensity of population cycles (peaks and troughs of population density) were proportional to parasite deworming intensity. They observed that the fewer parasites the less oscillations in population density, to the point that the population level stayed nearly consistent ( no oscillation) in heavily treated hosts ( fewest worms)\n\n[https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.282.5397.2256#:\\~:text=Red%20grouse%20populations%20in%20Britain,reducing%20parasite%20burdens%20in%20grouse](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.282.5397.2256#:~:text=Red%20grouse%20populations%20in%20Britain,reducing%20parasite%20burdens%20in%20grouse).\n\nallowance for coexistence of species with niche (lizards)\n\non many Caribbean islands there are two species of anolis lizard, now these lizard have high competition due to limited resources. Now one species(call it A) is significantly more fit, and without outside forces will always outcompete species B. however, species A is highly susceptible to Malaria parasites, in that where as B is not. so some of these islands have lizard malaria, and on these island both species coexist, however on islands without malaria, Species B is not present because it is out competed.\n\n[https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF00317262](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF00317262)\n\n\n\nThese are just a few of the large examples there are countless smaller scale examples of really cool dynamics. i think parasites are a great way to learn about an ecosystem as you are forced to learn about the host/hosts biology, the behavior and the interconnectedness of species through unseen transmission between different hosts\n\n\n\nyes, i am the mod of [r/Parasitology](https://www.reddit.com/r/Parasitology/)",

      "text": "Hello! I’m currently a Junior at University. I already have two years of volunteer experience combined, just got an internship with National Geographic, and have started a campaign meant to help endangered panthers at my Uni. Even though I actually switched to Bio from engineering, I think I’ve done a decent amount. Also, I’ll be graduating debt free, which is what lets me dedicate time to volunteering in the first place. I have three minors: Mathematical Biology, Environmental Science, and GIS. I’ve got Python experience, statistical analysis experience,  excel, good writing skills (though you’ll never be able to tell by this post because I will barely proofread, sorry), and am fully bilingual. I’m saying all this because, after all the research I’ve done, I still can’t get a straight answer to my big question about this field. \n\nAnd that question is - will I be jobless forever if I don’t go into ridiculous debt to get a master's degree? Because here is the thing - I literally just want a decent job. I don’t care if it’s an environmental science job, wildlife biology job, marine biology job, geology job, conservation job, oceanography, or a job in ANY related field. I want to start my professional career in a field I love as soon as possible. I’m truly not picky as long as it’s paying decently, because I know the first few years are never ideal, even for engineers/doctors/lawyers. If I can live comfortably in any of these fields that are doing work that helps this planet, that is all I need. Those jobs paying next to nothing are just not an option for me after the first job. Also, I genuinely don’t need the fancy research positions right now. \n\nI have a pretty negative attitude regarding master's degrees in general - they’re too expensive in the USA. I know they’re favored in academia and for PhDs, but aren’t years of experience worth much much more?  No matter where I research, every source is consistent on that much - experience is the absolute most important thing in this field. Also, after looking carefully, I’ve discovered that a few years in the field can raise your pay just as much as getting a master's. So I’m sorry, but I just refuse to spend a single dime on something that will not give me a good enough return on investment. I’m graduating debt free, so I will keep it that way unless I have no choice. \n\nAll of this chit-chat aside, what do you all think I should do? I’m sure you can tell by how I talk already, but I’m just not about wasting time. I have to care for my family financially relatively soon after graduation, so I like to put every ounce of my energy into doing something that will further my career. I am also looking at ways to make money on the side, but I really do want a stable career in the field. \n\nDon’t get me wrong. I do hope to one day dedicate my time to saving animals and the environment without gaining anything in return. And hopefully, I can get into research somewhere down the line. But neither of these will pay for my necessities, savings, or family right now, so I truly just need to get my foot in the door and become stable as soon as possible. \n\nAny tips from people with only bachelor's degrees would be greatly appreciated! I am already applying for internships for next semester, summer, and school year. My goal is to have at least four by graduation. I’ve got two down already. \n\nPlease be honest. If jobs in this field genuinely require a master's degree, I want to know now so I can have a good cry and find a way to make good money online on the side starting now. \n\nThank you x",

I am wondering what kind of flora/fauna you think would be most likely to survive and thrive through a warmer, more unstable climate, specifically in North America?\n\nMy understanding is that the Pleistocene did not have enough CO2 to reliably farm crops. Do you think climate change (which I suppose is /more/ CO2, at least initially) could bring about an analogous environment where humans have to abandon agriculture?  My idea is that the humans I’m writing about are living in an age where, after a period of hunting and gathering, the climate is becoming more like the holocene again, with agriculture becoming feasible along with more hierarchical forms of society.\n\nSo my questions are:\n\n1. What kind of flora and fauna do you think would dominate this world, given a few thousand years of evolution?  Is there anything that would do particularly well in the flat deserts of abandoned parking lots and highways, and in the confines of abandoned office buildings?\n2. What kind of crops do you think would survive climate change?  Would raspberries and blackberries be a viable source of nutrition in North America while the remnants of humanity are in hunt & gather mode?  What would be viable large-scale crops coming out of this unstable climate era?\n3. Does anything stand out in my concept as being misguided or uninformed?  Would a different time period be more appropriate, or would climate change work differently than how I am imagining?\n\nAny and all ideas are welcome, and let me know if there are additional resources I should check out!",

From what I could remember we noticed that there were more species present at the harsher environment than the one that was more hospitable.\n\nIf I'm remembering correctly, the premise we were taught was that in \"good\" spots, usually a few plant types would dominate to exploit the area, whereas in harsher environments there would be more species (I don't have a botany background but presumably from different family groups) with their own specialization to establish at the area.\n\nI've been trying to find if there's a research paper or named theory for this relation, could you kind folks help me with shedding light on this please? It's not adaptive radiation where a species evolves different specializations like the Galapagos finches.",

      "title": "Future Climate Change and Ecology - To intervene or not to intervene?",
      "text": "Hi there! Here's some food for thought.\n\nI live in Athens, Greece. I don't study plants but have had a keen interest in them for several years now, although I don't dabble too much nowadays. Priorities, I guess.\n\nWhat could grow here in the future?\n\nMy area is one of the driest of the Greek mainland; pre-industrially the coasts would have had a MAT of ca. 17-18 °C and MAP around 350-400 mm with marked seasonality (>80% falling in the winter half of the year, Oct - Mar).\n\nNowadays the climate is almost 2 °C warmer but not noticeably drier.  \nThe soils are shallow and calcareous and the vegetation near the coast is a mix of phrygana (spiny heathland), maquis (closed shrubland with scattered trees) and pine forest. Olives (Olea europaea ssp. europaea) and carob trees (Ceratonia siliqua) form the dominant Oleo-Ceratonion alliance here and are the main tree species, along with Aleppo pine (Pinus halepensis).\n\nAssuming climate change eventually stabilizes at a temperature anomaly greater than or equal to the IPCC best estimate ( >ca.+3°C by 2100) we're looking at several degrees of warming and a marked drying of the climate. I estimate (with the most dumb approximations I could think of) that the coasts could easily see MAP as low as 200-250 mm and MATs of 23 °C, or 'worse'.\n\nThe thing is, these native tree species, although very drought tolerant compared to those of other regions, simply can't survive in these conditions. In this scenario, winters will eventually become too warm for the native olive subspecies to flower and fruit reliably. Although carob does not require winter chill (courtesy of its tropical evolutionary origins), both olives and carob trees require a bit more water than such a future provides to persist (>250 mm for mature individuals to survive). Pines are highly flammable and also require slightly more water (>300 mm for persistence and abundant forest recruitment requires >400mm, at current MATs) (I am not aware of chilling requirements for their strobili)\n\nCommercial exploitation of both species requires irrigation at such low precipitation (certainly >400 mm for commercial viability and >450-500 mm for high quality and yields, if rain-fed). They are the most drought- and heat-tolerant tree crops grown here. Where will this water come from?\n\nAll in all this paints a very dire picture for even the most heat- and drought- tolerant forest, woodland and maquis formations, never mind agriculture. I expect similar fates to befall many of the larger shrubs and trees of lowland SE Greece. I am less sure about chamaephytes; common sense would dictate that they need less water, and indeed the most degraded, drought-prone soils only support them. But the literature is lacking on if they require chill to regulate their life cycle. In any case, species that use other cues instead of temperature, such as daylength or soil dryness, will possibly be more plastic in their response to climate change. This is pre-adaptation to rapid climate change, however, and much diversity will undoubtedly be lost.\n\nSo where does this leave us? These extant ecoregions that most closely resemble future conditions run in a mostly narrow belt sandwiched between the Mediterranean Basin and the Saharo-Arabian deserts, from the Canary Islands through Morocco, Algeria, Tunisia, Libya and then from Palestine across the fringes of Mesopotamia onto the foothills of the Zagros and across the strait of Hormuz, following the coasts as far as 60 °E. One could also include those mountain regions of the deserts which are not greatly influenced by the summer monsoon, such as various mountain ranges in the Sahara (Tibesti, Hoggar, Tassili n'Ajjer), the mountains of NW Arabia, the northern Al Hajar mountains, and parts of the southern Zagros.\n\nThe climate ranges from arid to semi-arid, with mild to warm winters and very hot summers. Frosts range from absent to mild. Plants here are very well adapted to such conditions, unlike our own. In my humble opinion, one could make the case that these populations and their genetic resources be conserved on a large scale, for potential transplantation in the degraded regions to the north. The logic behind this would be to perform ecosystem services that the native species would have performed. This would include things like providing shade and conserving soil consistency and moisture, as well as increasing soil fertility through nitrogen fixation.\n\nIt is probable these dryland plants will not survive the heating and drying of their native semi-arid zones and, once they and their genetic diversity are lost, it will take a long, long time for anything shrubby surviving in the Mediterranean to evolve to thrive in the new conditions.\n\nAlthough distinct, there are common elements between our current plant associations and those ecosystems. There is also no long history of geological isolation as there is e.g. between the Mediterranean and winter-rainfall North America / Australia etc., so the probability of such introduced plants becoming invasives, I presume, would be a bit lower - as we see with the tree legume Retama raetam which, although introduced here in Attica, is not invasive under current conditions. The zone I described earlier is also likely the largest in terms of land surface.\n\nThe consequences would be unpredictable, yes, especially with regards to invasiveness for the remaining ecosystems and impact on native pollinators and fruit dispersers. Is it possible native animals would adapt to fulfill these roles? Yes. Is it likely? I am not sure. There is also the question of the fire regime changing. Mediterranean plants have varied adaptations to tolerate or even thrive in, typically, destructive crown fires of multi-decadal frequency Right now we are seeing the results of fire supression and climate change in unquenchable \"megafires\", and these have in the last 15 years already cleared much of the urban-adjacent vegetation, and reduced its ability to reach a previous state. In contrast, proper aridland plants are typically much more sensitive to fire, given that the vegetation is so open there. How would they fare following their introduction in such dynamic conditions of temperature, moisture and fire? Who knows, we could, ya know, research?\n\nAgain, even if this works long-term, there are only specific parts of the country where this specific pool of introductions could be implemented; those that are already warm and dry. There also warm and wet places such as the NW coast, or mild and wet, such as the Pindus mountains ecoregion. They will also suffer and this approach would need another suite of foreign introductions to close the services gap.\n\nThere are potential benefits to agriculture, too. There are, for example, several Olea europaea populations which do not live in the Mediterranean Basin proper, and are confined to semi-arid or even arid parts of the zone I outlined above (ssp. laperrinei, ssp. maroccana, ssp. cuspidata). Their potential tolerance to drought and heat (especially winter heat) could provide valuable insights for GM cultivars and should be researched thoroughly. As for carobs, they only have one other sister species - Ceratonia oreothauma, from the mountains of Yemen and perhaps northern Somalia, and I'm not sure how useful such research would be. You get the point.\n\nDo the benefits outweight the costs? What is your opinion?  \nThe answers to these questions require massive research and funding, as the current situation allows for it. Decades in the future? I'm not so sure that's possible. And I'm not seeing it today, either.\n\nI would usually have to cite many, many sources to back up these claims, as well as my methodology (mostly going off crude calculations from the IPCC publicly available data), but such work is tedious, so you may as well take the above as a thought experiment - In any case, they are very crude estimates, not predictions. After exams I'd love to run a simple climate model on my PC and practice some good coding that way. That'd be fun.\n\nAll in all this was a pretty directionless post, but I hope I provided some food for thought. I'd love your opinions on the above. Feel free to dissect and critique, and recommend any literature that explores such questions, given that tampering of this sort is considered very taboo at the moment.",

I assume that is what it was like before it was colonized, and what it would be like if it was unoccupied now.  Let's assume no climate change.\n\nI understand that tree growth is directly related to growing conditions, but assuming conditions are favorable for decent tree growth and maturation, would 100% forest cover be the ultimate natural condition? \n\nContrast Maine with Kansas.  I assume prairie is the natural setting there with tree cover being very limited. \n\nWhat about states in between these two extremes. Would the natural land cover be a mix of prairies and forests?  What would control the distribution? \n\nThanks in advance.",

I hope to narrow this down once I get into reading published research for gaps, but I have a feeling most would rely on conducting fieldwork in the summer/spring :(\n\nThe only other thing I can think of would be working with a zoo, however, they'd probably want to benefit from studies that focus on improving enclosure usage or nutrition.",

      "text": "Basically i saw a Tiktok from this guy Paleopedia where he answered a question about why dinosaurs didn't take over again after the KT event when their evolutionary tree still lived on in some form. The answer basically boiled down to the dinosaur \"branches\" that lived on were basically on their way to being birds and as their path continued birds \"took over\" the air. Mammals, being primarily ground dwelling, had their path continue to \"take over\" the ground because all of the ground dwelling \"branches\" of the dinosaur tree died off.\n\nThat got me wondering: if you ran back a similar extinction event - which basically wiped out all large & medium size animals - wouldn't this basically suggest that mammals would once again be the most likely heirs to the earth? In this scenario there's still a lot of small mammals, which were around in the cretaceous, around competing with small birds, reptiles, amphibians etc during the sort of evolutionary reboot mass extinctions trigger.  \n\nBut then isn't that relatively unique in the context of mass extinctions? Usually the dominant animal kingdom \"passes the crown\" to another kingdom right? I just can't think of why anyone else would \"win\" though. My thought is that homeostasis is a pretty huge fucking advantage since the transmission mechanism for most mass extinctions seems to be some kind of climate change.\n\nI guess you could argue that a new \"kingdom\" could evolve, branching off from an existing tree, but isn't that tree usually pretty clearly identifiable before the previous extinction event? Like birds existed with dinosaurs, rodents existed with dinosaurs, reptiles evolved before amphibians lost their dominance etc. If that's the case what's the emerging but \"distinct\" branch showing up among extant species? What hybrid creature (e.g. the platypus, lungfish) is among us today who will sire the next masters of this pale blue dot?",

I understand that you probably get posts like this all the time so apologies if this is redundant. \n\nI'm currently a 4th year undergraduate at a UC in California, majoring in ecology with a minor in GIS. I chose this major not out of some plan for the future but because it was the only thing that seemed like it truly mattered in our world at the moment. Studying any other field just felt like it would be pointless, I couldn't bring myself to care about anything else enough to study it. So here I am, less than a year before graduation. I've done a few small internships and am working on a small independent research project.\n\nThe elephant in the room right now is the future. With the actions of this current administration and a general lack of real effort around the globe to stop climate change, I fear that there will be little prospects for me in this career (though I'd be willing to move, well, anywhere else if necessary). With no time to pivot, I'm racking my brain trying to figure out what to do. I want a job that will actually do some good, but it seems all the most \"lucrative\" options (forestry, consulting) are not in that vein. I'm lucky to have a landing pad after college, but that will only last so long. \n\nSo, my question is - if you were in my shoes, what would you do to secure the best odds of having a bearable future in this career? Please be brutally honest, smash my naivety, whatever, I probably need to hear it anyways. Thank you",

I will be a part of a project that studies the effects of climate change on tree saplings in forested areas. My job as a field technician will be working in remote areas for 10 hours a day, hiking, measuring and planting saplings. I am wondering if anyone experienced in field work could give me any advice on what to expect? I have done field work before but it was not for this long a duration at one time. I also workout, love to hike and spend time in nature, etc. I am used to bugs, heat and rain. I am mostly wondering about supplies that will make my life easier. I have a 24 oz water bottle right now but should I get something bigger for such long days? has anyone who has done fieldwork like this had to bring their own lunch cooler, etc.? I am really excited but I am also an organized plan ahead type of person and I would love to have everything \\*mostly\\* figured out before I begin in about a month. Thanks!!\n\n  \nEDIT: I am also looking for the best brands/styles for rain jackets and work/rain boots as well as I will ned to get some new stuff in order to be prepared!

      "text": "This is going to be a long post, so please bear with me. Im a 33 year old ecologist who has about 7 years' worth of experience in field research. I completed my MSc a long time ago and then hopped from job to job as my passion was to study carnivore population dynamics in changing landscapes, but the scope of carrying out such a study is limited in India (such research is being led by a few senior scientists whom I dislike for reasons that im not going into). So for the past 2 years, I have been working in projects aimed at analyzing long-term tree phenology and hornbill nesting data, particularly in light of climate change. Research is all that im good at, and I have 4 publications to my name (no first author ones, but in at least 2 of them, my contribution was comparable to that of the supervisor's) and hopefully 2-3 more in the pipeline based on this project.   \n  \nNaturally, I would like to do a PhD as I would like to see my own research ideas come to fruition. My current organization has tied up with a university to offer a PhD programme, which im applying for. So I initially pitched an idea about studying the guild of cavity nesting birds in my study area, and prepared a concept note on the same. My supervisor liked it and since im an internal candidate, I have a high chance of getting accepted into this programme.   \n  \nUpon studying available literature more extensively, I came to realize that collecting data on the use of natural cavities for nesting is going to be difficult in my study area and that the truly interesting research questions that I put forward are unlikely to be answerable owing to lack of statistical rigor. I put forward an alternative idea, also based on my field experience, of how bird communities vary in stands of production forestry, and how these stands also vary in terms of their species composition. I feel that the latter topic is very interesting as in India, little study has been carried out on the use of these stands by different groups of fauna (although other landuse types, such as agroforestry plantations have been studied extensively).   \nYesterday, I tried pitching this idea, but my supervisor started yelling at me, saying that this idea isnt innovative and that it has nothing to do with the programme (which is about tropical forests and fauna in the Eastern Himalayan region). She says that such work isnt innovative at all and insists that I carry out work on nest cavities and assured me that they would be easy to find (I know otherwise).   \n  \nNow at my age, im running out of options. I tried applying to a number of programmes in other countries in this cycle, but I failed. So I have just this programme and another one for which I am going to be interviewed for. I feel that im too old to continue to do entry-level research and I can't keep postponing my PhD. Its going to be a big commitment and if adequate data cant be found, then the failure would ruin my career, not my supervisor's.   \n  \nSo what do i do? I've been thinking of switching to some other kind of job like a consultancy perhaps, but im passionate about research and its literally all that I know. At my age, I would be at a severe disadvantage compared to those who have substantial experience in these other fields.   \nThanks for bearing with me.",

      "text": "Hello, folks. I hope this is the right place to ask this. If not, please steer me to someplace which would be more suitable. \n\nI've recently inherited 35 acres of forest, farm-field, and riverside in the Sápmi region of Sweden along the Lule River. For the past three hundred years the area has been pastured and farmed by small-scale mom and pop workers, not on an industrial scale at all (my own family and a neighbor who currently uses the area to grow food for his cows, as my own family quit farming in the 70's). The forested area consists of about 3-4 acres and is separated from the river by the aforementioned fields. It hasn't been logged in the past 200 years, so there is a healthy system of old-growth lodgepole and all its accompanying fungus networks in that area, but it is a relatively small patch and is cut off from other sections of forest by roadways and farm fields. The groundcover is lingonberries and moss, with a limited mid-level of juniper bushes. There is a fox that lives up in the wooded area.\n\nAs someone familiar with this area since childhood, I've noticed the dramatic increase in temperatures from climate change as well as the significant drying which has taken place in the area. Walking through the fields used to mean dodging frogs. Now it is mostly dry dirt. Snowfall is less than it used to be, and what does fall melts quickly and then re-freezes into solid sheets of ice, which local reindeer have a hard time digging through. The wildflowers which used to grow here are no longer around - bluebells and cat toes (I'm not sure of that translation) used to be common, as did the large local bumblebees. Now most flowers are dandylions.\n\nThe neighbor who is currently working our fields is on the older side and won't be active much longer. I would like to prepare a plan to restore some biodiversity to the area after his retirement. Whether this takes the form of wild field / prarie or forest or something else, I'm open to considering whatever would be most beneficial. I would ideally like to preserve some of the view towards the river, but the health of the land and the local wildlife is what matters most to me. There are a few birch that have been planted along the avenue up to the house, but I am not confident they will survive much longer as birch requires a great deal of water and precipitation levels in the area are changing rapidly. \n\nOf utmost importance to me is that I try to \"future proof\" the area against climate change as much as possible. I don't know to what extent that even \\*IS\\* possible, and scientists seem divided on whether the area will continue to dry and warm and we'll wind up with arctic desertification, or whether it will plunge back into a miniature ice-age with the cessation of the Gulf Stream. \n\nTo summarize, I find myself entirely at a loss. This is most definitely not my field, but it's something that I care a lot about. How would you go about tackling this task if you were in my shoes?\n\nAlso thank you for reading this far.",

      "text": "Hi Reddit community, this is one of my first posts so apologies for any formatting issues. I am interested in going back to school to research ecology. I have a significant amount of interest in studying human and wildlife interactions, especially in relationship to climate change scenarios, such as wildfires and flooding. I also have a personal interest in beavers, especially in their relationship to fire prevention. \n\nI originally went to school to study in environmental engineering, but wasn’t in love with the engineering aspect of it all. Rather than try and take more lab classes during college, I switched my focus at the time to math and graduated with a BS Applied Mathematics. After graduating I thought perhaps I could use my skills more in the architectural world, so I decided to pursue landscape architecture, which is where I have stayed as a drafter and designer for the last three years. I’ve come to realize that it’s not where my heart is going to be happy long-term, I am not satisfied at the end of the day having helped take away a natural space to create a landscaped park.\n\nConsidering that my schooling background is math based, does anyone foresee issues with me or trying to go into the ecology field? What would you recommend -if anything- to bolster my application?\n\nAdditionally, I would love to know what schools and programs people would recommend that I research further. I have currently looked into Cal Poly Humboldt, UC Berkeley, and the University of Montana. I just feel overwhelmed with the number of possible universities and professors, and just need some help narrowing my focus. I also would like to know if folks have some suggestions of ecology-related or adjacent fields which could utilize my background in applied math? I have a passion to be hands on in the field, but I also like creating and running statistical analysis.\n\nThank you all!",

      "title": "Feedback On A Chapter From A Science Fiction Story About Ecocentrism",
      "text": "Would you consider providing feedback on a chapter in the science fiction novel I am writing about Ecocentrism? The chapter is 1k words in length, the equivalent of three pages in a printed book.\n\nIn my retirement, I write short stories, novellas and novels about humanities issues relating to social robots which are fully conscious. The stories concern things like philosophy (existential and ethical issues), justice, art and spirituality.\n\nSeveral of them have a strong emphasis on ecological concerns. One is about a climate emergency that takes place in 2025 (The Shepherd) and another is about climate change that extinguishes civilization on another world but leaves its AI and social robots intact (Alpha & Omega). One of the main characters of the latter is an ecologist. There is also a short story about preserving the wisdom of people like Rachel Carson and related writers (Best Not Forgotten).\n\nThe chapter in question is from the story I am currently writing that is about how, five hundred years from now, we make the transition from an anthropocentric civilization to an ecocentric one. Specifically the story is about a technology called Empathetic Touch that allows us to communicate not just words and images, but to communicate feelings along with them. \"Communion\" is the name for this form of communication. An unexpected effect is that it allows us to communicate with other species as well and this leads to an expansion of the circle of moral concern.\n\nThe chapter I would like feedback on is called \"The Green Fire\", after the famous Aldo Leopold quote. *The particular feedback I am hoping for is whether you feel I have accurately and fairly represented the ecology field in letter and spirit.*\n\n[https://adventofthelanians.wordpress.com/the-green-fire/](https://adventofthelanians.wordpress.com/the-green-fire/)\n\nI realize the content in this regard is very brief but the fact that this is a work of fiction means I must communicate academic ideas in as few words as possible. I normally never ask for feedback on my writing, but I'm finding this point is particularly important to me.\n\nThe story largely takes place at a fictional academic institution called Helicon. Below is an explanation of some of the terms used…\n\nThe Lanians the title of the story refers to are an alien intelligence that arrives and informs us that until our social values evolve beyond anthropocentrism, they will not permit us to expand beyond our solar system.\n\nFawn is the main character of the story. Yara is her foster mother (a Companion). Fawn's life partner is Chanda and both are humans. Fawn and Chanda's PhD dissertations were respectively titled, “Ecocentrism: A Lens For Understanding Who The Lanians Are And What They Want” and “A Strategy For Implementing Ecocentric Policies In Agriculture”.\n\nShepherd is the AI that survived the extinguishment of civilization on her home world.\n\nPip is an AI/human hybrid from yet another alien world where Empathetic Touch evolved naturally.\n\n3GAI Companions are third generation artificial intelligences which are fully conscious. Their consciousness is based on the fictional theory that it is an emergent phenomenon which arises from the fact that their AI is based on social values and the interdependent trinity of values/emotions/self.\n\nThe WGF is the World Governments Federation formed after the Climate Emergency of 2025.\n\nA final note is that there is no sex or violence in my stories so you can read this chapter without concern over those issues. I do not write according to the demands of the publishing industry but self-publish on Amazon. You can see a complete list of all my fiction here\n\n[https://www.amazon.ca/dp/B0CLKX4S9C](https://www.amazon.ca/dp/B0CLKX4S9C)",

Foresight is about imagining the future and then looking at how to change it.\"\n\nHere, the report draws on a wide diversity of disciplines and voices to foresee the future.\n\nThe report focuses on the triple planetary crisis of climate change, nature and biodiversity loss, and pollution and waste, but also combines with other key drivers of change, including social, technological, geopolitical, and AI, among many others. Indeed, we are facing a 'policrisis', whereby the triple planetary is impacting and exacerbating human crises like conflicts for resources and declining health. Taking a holistic view is important for understanding the whole situation.\n\nIt identifies old and emerging challenges that require immediate attention and have the potential to drastically impact planetary health. Eight critical global shifts or phenomena that emerged from the foresight process.\n\n1. The relationship between humans and the environment in flux\n2. Critical resources: scarcity, competition and the shifting dynamics of global security\n3. AI, digital transformation and technology – a wave of change\n4. A new era of conflict\n5. Mass forced displacement and migration\n6. Persistent and widening inequalities\n7. Misinformation, declining trust, and polarization\n8. Polycentricity and diffusion of governance\n\n\"Adopting agile and reflexive governance—with shorter-term time-bound targets to enable course correction combined with multi-layered monitoring at the UN level—would significantly enhance achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Placing a new global emphasis on wellbeing metrics rather than pure economic growth will help the transformation needed. The future must be consultative, multilateral, cooperative and integrate the voices of traditionally marginalised groups, including women, youth, local communities and Indigenous Peoples.\"\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/1ouxonn5onpd1.png?width=2368&format=png&auto=webp&s=4352afa34b93c61a6560f30131163fadfdf98c88\n\n[https://www.unep.org/resources/global-foresight-report](https://www.unep.org/resources/global-foresight-report)",

      "text": "I’m interested in what a career conservation or ecology would look like, as it’s a passion of mine, and I’m curious what the safest paths are career wise. What I mean by this is, a relatively well paying career with relative job stability. The main allure of going into ecology or conservation is not the money or job security obviously, as the work itself is what’s crucial and important, but from what I understand straight up conservation work is not very high paying. What are the safer routes of getting into conservation(if there are any), and otherwise are there any conservation adjacent careers in other fields that would fit this bill?",

      "text": "Hi everyone. I'm about to finish my bachelor’s degree in Biology, and I feel really stuck trying to figure out what comes next. I’m from a low-income family in Latin America, and everything I’ve done so far has been with the hope that one day I can support my parents and give back to them for all their sacrifices.\n\nThe problem is, I’m passionate about two fields that seem quite different: molecular biology (I love genetics, eDNA work, biotechnology), and marine ecology (I've done some work with coastal communities and I’m really drawn to ocean conservation and species like sharks and rays). But I don’t know which path is more realistic in terms of career opportunities and financial stability.\n\nThat said, I’m not completely limited to just those two. I would genuinely enjoy working with birds, general ecology, and evolutionary biology too, bacteriology more focus on antibiotics, and things related to human disease. I’m pretty open and happy doing fieldwork or lab work as long as I feel like I’m learning and contributing to something meaningful. My biggest concern is finding a path that’s both sustainable and allows me to help my family.\n\nI’ve considered applying to grad schools abroad (since options are limited in my country), but I have no idea where to even start. I have no strong academic network, no money, just a lot of curiosity, work ethic, and hope.\n\nSo I’m reaching out here to ask:\n\nHas anyone been in a similar situation?\nWhich areas of biology tend to lead to more stable job opportunities?\nAre there any grad programs or scholarships that are realistic for someone from a background like mine?\nAny advice or personal stories would mean a lot. This is a genuine question from someone just trying to figure out how to move forward in life without leaving everything behind.\n\nThanks for reading.",

I definitely have a strong passion for ecology and environmental science, but I’m not too sure about the job stability and pay. I’m trying to narrow down my choices for university and would love to hear some of your experiences. I’m thinking to go one of two routes: 1) Get a business degree (and try to get a sustainability-related business job) to make bank and fund my hobbies, while volunteering at environmental non profits in my free time or 2) Get a science degree and grind to get a decent job doing what I love (I know this is pretty hard to do). If this doesn’t work out, I would get an MBA. Currently leaning towards the first option as I got into a great program.\n\nIn the future, I would prefer to make a decent salary (covers living expenses with some extra for spending on hobbies) and possibly retire early and spend my time wandering around outside.\n\n  \nSo, for naturalists out there who work an unrelated career, what do you do? Are you satisfied with your work/life balance? Any regrets?\n\nAnd for those who went on to follow their passion, what do you currently do? Do you think pursuing your passion was worth it? \n\nAny input would be incredibly helpful! Thanks in advance :)",

      "text": "I realize I’m a little late to the party. [A year ago the US Fish & Wildlife Service proposed a Barred Owl cull in the PNW, in order to help preserve the California & Northern Spotted Owl populations.](https://www.npr.org/2024/04/01/1241874707/california-spotted-owl-barred-owl-usfws) This was discussed heavily in numerous online spaces, including this subreddit.\n\nHere’s what I’m curious about.\nThe Barred Owl, to me, is an unusual case of an invasive species. While their range expansion was allowed to happen due to behaviour by European settlers, Barred Owls are native to eastern NA. Whether or not they are eradicated from the west, they will continue to expand their range westward until they re-establish western populations. \n\nNot only that, but as an invasive species, the Barred Owl seems to be a less-harmful species than many of the worst offenders. The Barred Owl is invasive because it competes with native species in the same ecological niche. To my knowledge (and I could be wrong), that’s pretty much all of it. If Northern Spotted Owls went extinct and were replaced by Barred Owls, there wouldn’t be a significant change in the ecosystem. That environmental niche is still being filled, just by another species, without significant ecological ripple effects. \n\nThis leads me to ask:\nWhat is the long-term goal with Spotted Owl preservation? Will Spotted Owls be able to have self-sustaining populations without Barred Owl culls, if we protect and expand their old growth habitat? Or will we have to continue the culls forever? \n\nAs frustrating and saddening as it sounds, to me, it feels like the best option is to let the Spotted Owls go, and focus those efforts on species of more importance. And believe me, this really hurts to say; I am a diehard environmentalist and am very much in favour of preserving species wherever possible. But this case feels like one with some unusual variables that kind of push it into a more grey area. \n\nWhat are your thoughts? Please do correct me if I’ve made any false assumptions or have incorrect info.",

I also have a bachelors in health sciences (UCF).\n\nMy MSc was focused on wildlife conservation, camera trapping, qgis (arcgis certificate), statistical models in R, and writing a thesis (hoping to also be published) \n\nI will apply to get a wildlife conservation biologist certificate from the wildlife society. \n\nI also have previous experience working in two molecular labs, where i learned the technicals thoroughly (DNA and viral RNA extractions, PCR, real time PCR, Sanger sequencing, exo-sap purification, karyotyping, flow-cytometry…), and identifications of species with molecular markers (GeneAid, taq-mix), and metabarcoding (PCR amplification, sequencing, QIIME2, DADA2).\n\n\nDifferent career paths \n\n1. Environmental scientist - similar to my MSc, camera trapping, qgis, R…\n\n2. Environmental biologist - obtaining dna samples and analyzing them\n\n3. Environmental consultant \n\n4. Environmental health specialist \n\n5. Environmental compliance analyst\n\n6. Sustainability auditor / ESG Associate\n\n\nQuestion\n\nI disliked the surveying, it took too much time and energy, for reference, as an environmental scientist I have to wake up at 5 am, travel a hundred miles to separate locations, set camera traps, finish at 10 pm, do it again for a few months, write a report, then repeat, hence why I’m looking for alternate career paths \n\nIs it possible for me to change to one of the other listed jobs, if I get certifications like ISO14001 lead auditor, OSHA 40 hour HAZWOPER training, OSHA 10 Hour construction safety, SEIR certificate, UNEP-WCMC TNFD& biodiversity disclosure course… \n\nWhat would you guys advise? \n\nThanks in advance",

Large enough to make global impact.\n2. High priority ecosystem to preserve\n3. Presence of local partners that desire sustainable development with a priority on forest preservation.\n4. Local intelligence to inform efforts.\n\nI care less about the governmental policies. Even under Lula, we're still seeing far too much destruction of the rainforest.\n\nPlease send in your suggestions. Based on results, I would like to start fundraising. We will need millions of dollars to establish an action plan and get boots on the ground.\n\nWe cannot expect governments or NGOs to do this work for us. Time to take the fate of the Earth into our own hands.\n\nBest,\n\nA.G.",

It's also Giving Tuesday, so help share knowledge with friends, families, coworkers, and help get donations going to the organizations you're passionate about -- and tell them why they should be passionate about them!\n\nIf you have questions, I'll do my best to answer about predator compensation programs, community partnerships, and how anti-poaching and anti-trafficking operations differ in various countries. I'm more familiar with projects and programs in Africa and Asia, so I invite knowledgeable people to talk about front-line conservation programs in other parts of the world and what they like about their goals and methods for achieving them.\n\nAlso, if you're looking for an organization to support this Giving Tuesday let's talk about them here! If you're like to make a recommendation, that's cool too!\n\n___\n\n**[Akashinga](https://www.akashinga.org/)** - Formerly known as the IAPF (the folks who did that [great IAmA!](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/a0vpd6/im_a_former_navy_diver_and_special_operations/), Akashinga has been renamed after its famed all-female anti-poaching ranger group.

      "text": "HI everyone,\n\nI'm in the process of applying to Master's programs in Rangeland Ecology/Management and/or other ecology programs.  I have a relatively unrelated BA (urban sustainability) which was very light on science and research.  However, since then my professional career over the past decade plus has been almost all ecology related in some sense.  I'm currently the head gardener for a giant skyscraper in Manhattan which I'm managing ecologically.  Before this I was a project manager for a landscaping company specializing in ecological restoration.  The rest of m post-BA career has been gardening, farming, and nursery work including greenhouse propagation.  I know what I want to do (managing land for ecological restoration of habitat) and I Know there are many avenues of study and research that can lead me there.  I am finding my lack of science and research background to be pretty significant obstacles in achieving this goal.  I'm very motivated to find a program and research ecological problems and apply and test solutions.  Any advice on helping an extremely capable and motivated but somewhat less \"qualified\" potential student?",

      "title": "Continue Landscape architecture/UX or go into Science?",
      "text": "(Hi Mods please don't remove this. I know this post doesn't specifically mention ecology, but I'm trying to gather career insights from as many science jobs I'm interested in as possible.)\n\nHi, everyone. I’m a first year uni student in a dual Landscape Architecture and UX design degree. Applications to transfer courses into other Bachelors closes soon, so I really need as much insight as possible because I’ve been struggling with this issue since uni applications in high school. (If it’s relevant at all, I live in Australia and will likely continue living here).\n\nI think the most important thing for me in a job is free time. I have a wide variety of interests that I like to casually hop around in, so having the time to properly decompress and live outside of a job is really important to me. Obviously I also want a well-paying job, but I’m not interested in expensive lifestyles either so that’s less of a concern. \n\nLandscape Architecture: I do quite enjoy drawing and using CAD programs, and the idea of being able to design usable and sustainable spaces is really appealing to me. However, I am concerned that this career will have long working hours and require a lot of dedication, especially since I don’t even know how in demand Landscape Architects are. I know any job is going to require effort, but I’m really not the kind of person who can stand doing the same thing continuously day after day. I need a variety of experiences, which I could accomplish with a low-hours job, but based on how long my studio subjects are I doubt architecture jobs are. My studio subjects have been making me experience a sense of burnout, but I am also taking several other subjects alongside it, so maybe a job where I’m purely focusing on studio work would be more manageable time and effort wise?\n\nUX: Website design has never been something I’ve been crazy passionate about, but I’m actually really enjoying my UX subjects so far. Gathering user information, analyzing the information, and then creating a product out of it has felt like a really natural and chill process. But are actual UX jobs significantly more high-stress compared to first-year uni subjects? And again, are UX designers in high demand in Australia? What are the work hours like? The general working environment?\n\nScience: I know that’s a really broad field, but I really don’t know the actual specifics of job types. The natural world has just always been something I’m interested in. I am curious about how the body functions, I really really enjoy hiking and visiting interesting natural places, and put any small creature in front of me and I’ll be content staring at it for hours. This current career crisis has honestly started from a biology class I’ve been taking on the side in which we were testing the reactions of live bugs to different environmental conditions. I was just watching the bugs and their movements intently for the entire two hours, and I love examining specimens under microscopes and dissection. So I definitely have an innate interest, but is this enough to consider a degree switch? I haven’t been able to properly consider how much I like all the literature review, report writing and experimental design portions of the subject because I’ve been so focused on my Landscape classes. Again, what is the demand, salary and work hours in Australia? How often do ‘interesting’ things happen in the average job?\n\nI know I could always change degrees later if I actually manage to figure out what I can and can’t tolerate in a career, but I really don’t want to go through second year, or even third year, and then drop out just before I earn the degree. It would be such a waste of money. And if I manage to switch into Biology and find out that the academic aspects are too frustrating for me long-term, then it’s going to be a real hassle to switch back again.\n\nSo yeah. I know no job is likely to completely fulfill me, so I’d like a job with manageable work hours so that I have apt time to pursue a lot of hobbies, but something chill enough or has a strong barrier between work and personal life so that I don’t burnout. Just, anyone working in these fields, especially in Australia, could you tell me the honest work hours, monotony levels, and salary for someone entering after uni? I need to be free from these past two years of constant career indecision.",

      "text": "Hello everyone, my name is João Paulo and I am a Chemical Engineering student with a great interest in the area of ​​sustainability and sanitation. During my scientific initiation, I had the opportunity to work on a project that aims to create a system for treating car wash effluents without the use of chemicals, with the aim of reducing the costs of the inputs used in this process. This project is in the development phase for a possible patent.\n\nThis contact with technological solutions in the area of ​​sanitation led me to think about the possibility of, in the future, undertaking the development of small water and sewage treatment plants, especially aimed at peripheral communities and rural areas that are not connected to public sanitation networks. I see this as a way of applying the knowledge I acquired in Chemical Engineering, together with some subjects I study in Environmental Engineering, and also integrating aspects of Civil Engineering, such as the resistance of materials.\n\nHowever, I would like to discuss the feasibility of this idea. I believe that, on a technical level, designing and developing the systems is something within my reach. However, the biggest challenge seems to be in the implementation phase. I am concerned about the difficulty in finding qualified labor in the construction industry and the management of the construction itself, in addition to the fact that this type of project requires a significant initial investment, something that I do not have at the moment.\n\nTherefore, I would like to hear advice and suggestions from those who already work in this area or have experience with this type of initiative. My main questions are:\n\nTechnical and financial viability: Is it possible to undertake this sector, using my background in Chemical Engineering, perhaps in partnership with professionals from other areas, such as Civil or Environmental Engineering? What are the main challenges that I may encounter when trying to develop and supply these compact stations to more isolated communities?\n\nLabor and construction management: How have you dealt with the lack of qualified labor and the challenges of monitoring the works? Do I need to have a construction office myself to manage these projects or are there business models that outsource this stage effectively?\n\nPreparation during graduation: What could I do during graduation to better prepare myself for this type of project? What disciplines, experiences or partnerships do you suggest I explore to better qualify myself in this process of developing compact stations?\n\nI am really motivated to seek a solution that can contribute to the quality of life of populations that do not have access to public sanitation networks, but I would like to better understand how to transform this idea into a practical and sustainable reality.\n\nI would like to thank everyone in advance for their attention and willingness to share their experiences and knowledge.",

      "text": "Currently in school working on a PhD in an ecology-adjacent field in the US, and my plan was always to try to pursue either government agency work (USFS, APHIS, state governments, etc) or academia. With the general state of funding currently, I am starting to scope out other career options, and one idea I have been intrigued by is making my own money as some kind of independent contractor. I occasionally see people doing this sort of thing, but have never really made a solid contact with one of them, haha. \n\nIt definitely seems more common to me in e.g. soil science or agriculture, but is anyone out there maybe contracting with landowners for ecological restoration, designing native plant yards/communities, things like that? How has it gone for you? Is it particularly lucrative? I imagine that depends a lot on your market, but can you speak to how you evaluated your market at all? Is this actually a way harder career path to make happen than academia/government? Would appreciate any thoughts!",

      "text": "Hello! I realise this might be a very far-fetched request, but I don't know who else to turn to except the World Wide Web in the faint hope that it can reach someone who might be able to help!\n\nI'm from South-east Asia, where the oil palm (E. guineensis) is grown in massive plantations in what used to be pristine rainforests, peat swamp forests, mangroves, and other rich tropical ecosystems. While E. guineensis was introduced to our region, our economy and so many people's livelihoods are built on top of their (thorny) fronds, and it's not an exaggeration to say that entire countries here may collapse if palm oil plantations were to stop existing one day. \n\nAs someone who loves ecology, I've always found these plantations to look like graveyards full of zombies. I don't think the plant itself is destructive; I know the destructive force is the action of the humans who cleared beautiful, diverse, and complex forests and other types of ecosystems to grow these plants in such intensive monoculture it would lay waste to the land within a few planting cycles. My idea of oil palms are what I see of them in the plantations, which I know are stunted versions of what they would otherwise be since they're bred to be stout and would be cut down by the time they're 25 years old as they're no longer seen as productive. Otherwise, I've seen self-sown oil palms grow here and there in some secondary forests around here. \n\nWhat I've never seen before is what the oil palms look like in their natural habitat in West Africa. I've found a paper discussing its ethnobotanic use in its native habitat, but I still have not found any photos of a native wild oil palm 'in its nature', so to say (as opposed to in a plantation). I'm really curious now as to what this tree looks like 'naturally' (for a lack of better word) in its native habitat or in 'traditional management'.\n\nThank you in advance and I apologise if this is very out of topic! Please feel free to delete if that's the case. Thanks again!",

      "text": "Hello all, I am currently going into my sophomore year of university, and I only found my passion in nature and ecology earlier this year. The current school I am attending does not offer an Ecology degree, therefore I am planning to transfer out to a school which has a pretty good program. I spoke to an advisor at the school about what I should do academically and for some experience and she helped me figure out that I enjoy conservation and restoration, and should get a major in ecology with a minor in wildlife sciences and multiple different certificates. But because it took me so long to decide what I wanted to do, I have 0 experience in this field, and the area which I live in offers no internships or jobs that are close. The internships I did apply to all rejected me, and the only one that I was going to be an environmental educator for got cancelled. \n\nTo get some kind of experience, I am volunteering for a Native Plant society near me and I have started recently. I just want to know if it is realistic for me to end up doing some fieldwork or hard work in the future in conservation or restoration. I see a lot of people online speaking on how they have ended up doing spreadsheets and I don't want to do work of that kind. I am still really young and inexperienced, and I have just tried to focus on what I can do now rather than worrying about what the future holds, but I just wanted some advice from people who may have been in a similar position as me. I am open to any discussion!",

For a variety of personal reasons I do not want to work in Australia once this is finished. \n\nI did an exchange program and met multiple people from the Midwest, particularly from University of Wisconsin Madison. \n\nI had looked into how to work in the US previously and on the visa side of things it’s significantly easier than a normal overseas worker, I would just need the employer to sponsor the roughly $1000 visa. I would really love to get to work and see these people again. \n\nMy main question is, can it actually be done? I’ve tried to branch out a lot and have got skills using both ArcGIS and QGIS, as well as some python knowledge and the regular knowledge of R for someone at my level. The GIS knowledge in particular though I feel like is my strongest skill. I am aware that the current employment market in this area might be to my disadvantage here but I was hoping Wisconsin would be a place that wasn’t feeling this impact as heavily.\n\nI would take literally any job to get over there, it just needs to be something that directly uses my bachelors degree so that I qualify for the Visa. If anyone has had similar experiences or knows where would be a good place to start looking in Wisconsin that would be great because the careers councillor at my University wasn’t very helpful in this area (understandably).\n\nJust to add extra info to this, I’m won’t take questions about choosing to move to the US, and specifically the location around Madison/western Wisconsin is needed for personal relationships I have there. The visa I would fall under is the E-3 work visa. I don’t own or am eligible for a passport to any other country than Australia. \n\nThanks in advance :)",

As we all know field clothes need to be SERIOUSLY hard wearing and be able to withstand the constant onslaught of wire grass, log scrambling, bush bashing etc. I know you need to pay a bit more to get good quality but some places seem to be seriously taking the piss (e.g. $800 for a waterproof jacket from Mont Adventure).",

The forest has become \"imbalanced\" without the dragon as the top predator, and now, years later, humans are experiencing the consequences.\n\nMy inspiration is the change of the Yellowstone after reintroducing wolfes there.\n\nI'm now looking for help with brainstorming: What consequences does the dragon's death have for the magical ecosystem? Could we incorporate trolls and basilisks?",

      "text": "Hi, I'm planning on returning to school because I have become really interested in conservation.  I took a couple classes thru my state university extension for their Conservation Stewards Program and Master Naturalist class.  I really loved the whole experience and started volunteering for invasive removals, got involved with monarch butterfly monitoring, vernal pool monitoring,  started doing some educational outreach with kids, and I volunteer on a rare plant survey for the DNR.  \n\nI have a big love of native plants and bugs and currently have a career in horticulture so historically plants have been my wheelhouse and have spent a good deal of time IDing bugs from a pest control perspective.  I am just a little confused as to what degree path I should be trying to follow to work in either habitat restoration or some kind of community outreach/education role like many of the people who work at nature centers and parks.  \n\nMy local community college offers a degree in environmental science or biology.  I am wondering which would be a better path to start on if I want to work at a place like a conservation non-profit or nature center.  I'm really fortunate to be located in an area with a lot of these kinds of organizations.  I've talked to a few staff members at local places but their degrees are all over the place from entomology, natural resource management, environmental science, botany, even one guy working in restoration with no degree at all, so it hasn't helped me narrow my choices XD\n\nEnvironmental science vs Biology \n\nWould either degree be a better starting point if I'm undecided on what I want my Master's to be?  Does one have a substantially more difficult curriculum?  Is one more desirable for the kind of work I hope to do?  And what kind of options should I look at after my 2 years of Community college?",

      "text": "Hi all,\n\nI am a current undergraduate student who will be applying for a PhD in Ecology this upcoming cycle (in the US). I was hoping to seek some advice from current PhD candidates or Drs in the field. I apologize for how long this post is. \n\nI am feeling worried that I lack the research experience needed for a strong application.\n\nI have spent 3 semesters in a conservation genetics lab, but I had some conflict with the PI and I am no longer working with them. We are on good terms, but they are an awful communicator and it was quite difficult to work with them as a consequence. The summer of 2024, I received a stipend to pursue a research project in an invertebrate ecology lab, but it wasn’t necessarily my own project. I was more under the guidance of my PI and I was using it as an opportunity to explore other fields. My data ended up being insignificant (and then the PI went on sabbatical.)\n\nThis summer, I received another stipend to pursue an independent research project in another ecology lab. I have plans to continue working in this lab till I graduate in the spring. My PI said that she’d work with me to get my project published, but we are far from that point. I have also gained experience writing grants this summer due to my internship (doing 50/50 internship/research). I’ve given 1 oral presentation on my research project last summer, spoke about my research/goals during a Women in STEM presentation, and I will also be attending this upcoming ESA conference (was invited by my current PI).\n\nQuite frankly, I am worried that coming right out of undergrad plus not staying in one lab for a long period of time are going to damage my chances of getting accepted. Only 1/3 of my graduate school recommendations will be coming from someone I did research under. The relationship with my current PI is fairly new, so I don’t feel comfortable asking them for a recommendation just yet. My 2nd recommendation will be from the director of the organization I intern at, and I’m still figuring out my third.\n\nWith my background out of the way, there is one professor at a different university who I really want to work with. What concerns me is that the majority of her PhD students obtained a master degree before applying for their PhD. The only student that I know who doesn’t have a masters degree worked with her during their undergrad. I am nervous about being perceived as under qualified from her POV, and I was wondering if there was anything I could do to make my application stronger beforehand. I was also hoping someone could tell me if I’m overreacting or overthinking things.\n\nThank you!",

I'm not really sure where to look and after a few searches I haven't found anything too big.  Can anyone give me some recommendations?  \n\nThanks!",

      "title": "How to Pass the LEED Exam in 2 Weeks - From a LEED & WELL AP Trainer!",
      "text": "A little about me: I have been a LEED and WELL AP trainer for 10 years now, you can check my [**profile on LinkedIn**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/shadiabousamraleed/). In that time I have helped more than 7,000 professionals earn their accreditation by passing the LEED Green Associate exam, LEED AP BD+C, and WELL AP exam.\n\nI have trained at universities, training centers, municipalities, and companies to help their employees prepare for the LEED and WELL certification exams using my simplified study material.\n\nThe below are the most frequently asked questions I’ve been asked and how you can pass in 2 weeks:\n\n**#1 How to register for the LEED exam and WELL AP exam?**  \n*The LEED GA and AP exam registration are the same.*  \nStep 1, create a [USGBC](http://usgbc.org) account  \nStep 2, purchase the official LEED exam you are targeting (cost of the exam below).  \nStep 3, use the code USGBC gives you after purchase (valid for 1 year) and head to [Prometric](https://prometric.com/gbci) to schedule a time and day using the code. (You can schedule the exam from home or at a test center).\n\nWELL AP exam registration is the same but should create an account and purchase the exam on [IWBI](https://www.wellcertified.com/) not USGBC.\n\n**#2 How much does the LEED exam cost? WELL AP exam cost?**\n\n* LEED Green Associate costs $250 (veterans for free, USGBC member companies get a discount and students take the exam for $100).\n* LEED AP costs $350 ( veterans free, students $250 and USGBC members get a discount)\n* LEED GA+AP combined exam $550 (4 hour exam both credentials in 1 sitting)\n* WELL AP costs $299 ( students 125$)\n\n**#3 Where to find Free LEED study material, free practice exams?**\n\nComplete study materials are not free but you can find free introductory videos, sample exams, free articles that help build a foundation.\n\n* Youtube videos:\n   * [Archiroots](https://www.youtube.com/@leedgreenassociate) (my simplified trainings)\n\n* Free practice questions:\n   * [LEED GA sample exam](https://archiroots.com/quizzes/free-leed-green-associate-practice-exam/)\n   * [LEED AP BD+C sample exam](https://archiroots.com/quizzes/free-leed-ap-bdc-practice-exam/)\n   * [WELL AP sample exam](https://archiroots.com/quizzes/free-well-ap-practice-exam/)\n\n* Handbook:\n   * [LEED GA candidate handbook](https://build.usgbc.org/leed-green-associate-handbook)\n   * [LEED AP candidate handbook](https://build.usgbc.org/leed-ap-handbook)\n   * [WELL AP handbook](https://a.storyblok.com/f/52232/x/78041f6cd4/well-ap-candidate-handbook-october-2023.pdf)\n\n**#4 What are the requirements to take the exam?**\n\n* LEED GA: no requirements, only to be above 18 years old.\n* LEED AP: a valid non expired LEED GA credential. (Expired? need to take the GA exam again).\n* WELL AP exam: no requirements.\n\nNo experience, no specific discipline (even professional not in the building industry can take the exam).  \nNo background or knowledge is required and no you do not need to have worked on a LEED or WELL project to take the exam.\n\n**#5 How to get free LEED CE hours?**\n\nAfter you pass the LEED GA exam, you have 2 years to satisfy 15 continuing education hours.  \nAfter you pass the LEED AP exam, you need 30 continuing hours.\n\nBest approach is to do the GA exam, just before it expires become a LEED AP. You will get 2 extra years so you won't do any GA CE hours. You will need to do AP CE hours after that, meaning 4 years to do CE hours since you got a reset when you upgraded to AP.\n\nTo satisfy those hours, do not buy LEED CE hours. You can find free hours on [USGBC](https://www.usgbc.org/education-listing), just filter the free videos and select the credential you want videos for.\n\n**#6 What is the difference between LEED GA, LEED AP and WELL AP?**\n\n* LEED Green Associate, basic green building principles, LEED certification overview.\n* LEED AP, more technical information about LEED. You need to learn how to calculate a credit, few formulas, more things to memorize. Showcases this professional can streamline and handle the LEED certification process fully whereas a LEED GA would be good to monitor and understand.\n* WELL AP, there is no WELL Green Associate only WELL AP. You have to know all WELL certification material.\n\nThe LEED certification focus on energy performance, reducing negative impact on the environment, sustainable building practices.(Green building aspects).\n\nWhereas the WELL certification is a complimentary certification, it focuses on the occupant inside the project, how the project and company supports the occupant and employees in the project. Nourishment, food, fitness, air quality, thermal comfort, mind and similar. (Health and well-being of occupants in a project)\n\n**#7 How to prepare and make sure you pass in 2 week:**\n\n1. Take this [**LEED GA simplified training**](https://archiroots.com/leed-green-associate-exam-prep/), [**LEED AP BD+C simplified training**](http://archiroots.com/what-is-the-leed-ap-certification/) or [**WELL AP simplified training**](https://archiroots.com/well-ap-exam-prep/) watch 30 minutes a day to learn all material in 1 week. You can watch more, maybe even finish it in 1 day. But ideally 30 minutes to make sure you have grasped the material and was not heavy on your long day at work or school. The goal is to understand the concepts not cover content.\n2. Exercise on 1 [**practice exam**](https://archiroots.com/leed-courses) a day for 1 week to make sure you learned the material. You might know the content but still answer incorrectly, you have to get used to how tricks come in the exam. Use the elimination strategy, highlight keywords and similar. All tips and tricks are included in the training.\n3. During that week of practice exams, it is good to review through flashcards. They are basically study cards that include all the important key terms and definitions to be able to review on the go. [LEED GA Flashcards](https://archiroots.com/leed-green-associate-flashcards/) / [LEED AP Flashcards](https://archiroots.com/leed-ap-bd-c-flashcards/) / [WELL AP Flashcards](https://archiroots.com/well-ap-flashcards/).\n\n \n\nIs 2 weeks enough to prepare? Yes and No! If you purchase a $200 book of 800 pages, it will surely take you around 3 months. But if you follow a [simplified training](https://archiroots.com/leed-green-associate-exam-prep/) it is quite easy to be ready in weeks and NEVER take the official exam without passing practice exams, even if you have memorized a thick book, EVEN IF YOU HAVE LEED PROJECT EXPERIENCE!\n\nI am happy to answer any question, feel free to drop a comment or email me: [shadi@archiroots.com](mailto:shadi@archiroots.com) or better yet, message me on [**LinkedIn here.**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/shadiabousamraleed/)",

One person is sitting comfortably, enjoying their favorite meal, while someone else on the other side of the world is witnessing their family being torn to shreds—how horrific. Somewhere else, a person has to walk miles just to fetch water infested with bacteria, while another person only needs to extend their arm for the bottle of clean water that’s on their table.\n\nThere are countless societal problems in the world—hunger, water scarcity, climate change, education inequality, homelessness, and more. While many people don’t have the financial means to make a difference, they might have the right words, strategies, or ideas to create change.\n\nI’m building a social crowdfunding platform where users can discuss these issues, raise awareness, and propose actionable solutions. The platform promotes collaboration by allowing users to outline solutions in multiple phases. It fosters a community for sharing ideas, engaging in meaningful discussions, and working together to tackle real-world challenges. Leaders can also create and lead projects that the community can follow and support.\n\nThe beta will be private and launches on November 30. I’m looking for people interested in joining this journey, providing feedback, and helping shape the platform. If you’re Interested in participating or would like to get to know more about me or the project, you can message me on reddit or add me on discord to have a chat (itsomidkhber).\n\nThank you for reading, and I will appreciate your input!  \n[https://docs.google.com/forms/d/13D4HtYD0Zmctp1\\_-jMZi-0EM4vRmOfsn-6IXlojSoGU/edit](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/13D4HtYD0Zmctp1_-jMZi-0EM4vRmOfsn-6IXlojSoGU/edit)",

We all know that the event industry has a considerable footprint—whether it’s from materials used, transportation, or waste generation.\n\nLately, we’ve been trying to integrate more sustainable practices into our projects (like recycling materials, eco-design, choosing eco-friendly partners, etc.), but it feels like the industry is moving slower than our ambitions.\n\nDo other project managers or agencies here also feel the tension between client demands (often focused on the “wow” factor) and the need to reduce our environmental impact? Have you been able to convince your clients to opt for more sustainable choices, and if so, how did you go about it?\n\nI’d love to hear any thoughts, tips, or experiences on what you’ve implemented to move toward a more eco-responsible approach without compromising creativity or the visual impact of booths.",

      "text": "The Illusion of the Center: The Ego that Disconnected Us from Gaia\n\n\n\nHumanity placed itself at the center of the Earth, as if it were the nucleus of everything, with an irrevocable right to consume and explore the world around it. But this right, so widely accepted, is an illusion. The Earth was not created just for humans – it is a shared home, an interconnected ecosystem where all life has value.\n\nThe Ego That Dominated Our Choice\n\nAt some point, we let our ego guide our decisions. We choose to dominate instead of coexist, explore instead of cooperate. We enslaved everything we could: the animals, the rivers, the forests, and even each other. We mark this exploration as “normal” and forget that there were other choices – choices based on respect, balance, and harmony.\n\nHow did we allow the ego to steal our free will? How did we accept that exploring and destroying was the only way to exist? These questions lead us to a deep reflection on what it really means to live in an ecosystem.\n\nThe Earth Is Not Just Ours\n\nGaia, our Mother Earth, is not a bar or a doll's house created exclusively for humans. It is a living organism, sustained by millions of interconnected lives. Every plant, every animal, every microorganism plays an essential role in maintaining the balance that sustains the whole – including our own survival.\n\nPlacing human life above all other forms of life is a reflection of a small, egocentric and disconnected humanity.\n\n\n\nIf we want to change, we need to look at nature and animals as masters, not servants. They teach us:\n\nThe simplicity of living with enough, without excess.\n\nThe value of balance, respecting natural cycles.\n\nThe strength of mutual respect, where each being has its role.\n\n\n\nThe choice to explore and dominate is not inevitable. We can still choose coexistence and cooperation. This starts by recognizing that:\n\nWe are not more important than any other form of life.\n\nOur value lies in our ability to respect and protect the whole.\n\nTrue free will is choosing the good, rather than normalizing the bad.\n\n\n\nHumanity has much to learn from Gaia and its inhabitants. Maybe it's time to ask ourselves: are we ready to put our egos aside and reconnect with the Earth? Or will we remain blind until it is too late to repair the damage we have caused?",

As someone who cares deeply about this space, I'd really value your perspective.\n\nI've put together a short survey (2-3 minutes) covering topics like:\n\n* How you currently make environmental decisions\n* What frustrates you about trying to live sustainably\n* Whether existing tools/apps have been helpful\n\nThe goal is to better understand what's working and what gaps exist in supporting people who want to live more sustainably. I'm happy to share the aggregated results with this community once I have enough responses.\n\nSurvey link: [https://buildpad.io/research/IQlEtp2](https://buildpad.io/research/IQlEtp2)\n\nThanks for taking the time - your input really matters for understanding how we can better support each other in making positive environmental impact!",

Sorry for taking your time twice  \nThis isn’t a big startup pitch, just a small project I’ve been thinking about. I’m just trying to get a few honest takes.\n\nLately, I’ve been frustrated with how hard it is to find appliances that just... work. Everything’s “smart” now. Full of sensors, screens, and updates but most of it breaks after a few years. It feels like planned obsolescence has become normal.\n\nSo I started exploring a different idea:  \nWhat if we brought back fully analog household appliances. 100% mechanical, no digital parts, built to last 20+ years like the old freezers from the 80s?  \nSimple design, modular, easy to repair, even usable off-grid.\n\nIt’s not a scalable business, more like an experiment to see if people are tired of modern \"smart\" junk and would actually pay for something built to last.\n\nI’d really appreciate any feedback, especially the honest kind.  \nIs this worth exploring, or just nostalgia in disguise?\n\nsome pertinent questions i have would be: do u think there is a market for it and would people be okay to pay a premium for this kind of product?\n\nThanks.",
