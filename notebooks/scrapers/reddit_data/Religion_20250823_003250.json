There’s thousands of religions so how do you know that yours is the correct one and all the other ones are wrong when the proof is lacking in nearly all of them? \n\nAnd I don’t just mean “because I was raised to believe that” because surely logically there has to be a reason you strongly believe your religion is correct but all the others are wrong? \n\nApologies if this question offends anyone, but I’m very curious to hear peoples views on this (including non-religious people).\n\nThanks!",

So if God is all loving why does he discriminate against his own creations?\nI know in Leviticus it states “man must not sleep with boy” I’ve some people interpret this as not with to sleep children or translate it as “man” instead of “boy” too.\nSorry if this seems offensive or rude as i’m not trying to be but i’m just very confused.",

I’ve experienced it a lot in the past year and it’s genuinely confusing me why the people who have problems with religion as a whole take it out on random people not bothering them, instead of the people who made them hate the religion\n\n\nGenuine question from a teenage muslim girl here, i’m not tryna start any arguments or anything i just genuinely want to know.. if people don’t like religions, be it christianity, islam, buddhism, whatever, why don’t they just stay away from it 😭 the amount of times people have fought me for just being muslim even though i didn’t even talk to them or was just tryna have a civil convo, or fought a christian friend or hindu friend just because they don’t like their religion despite the friend not having done anything, actually confuses me. Like okay, leave the religion, don’t like it, whatever i don’t care, but why do you feel the need to argue with every person of that religion you see, and why do some people even make up lies about said religion? Like i seriously do not care if you don’t like religion or left a religion or anything, i respect you either way, but oh my days please just leave me alone i didn’t do anything to you 😭\n\nI’m seriously confused on this, for example left the religion because of toxicity, isn’t the best way to heal to just leave it alone and stay as far away from it as you can? or surround yourself with people who aren’t toxic? why do you willingly go to people who you know are part of that religion and start fights (completely different if the other person started the fight and was obviously trying to fight or was insulting you, then argue back all you want but don’t insult the religion because a lot of people of that religion would prob be on ur side). Also, from most religions i know of none of them encourage toxicity or forcing religion onto people, so it’s quite obviously some mental issues with the people who were being toxic (i don’t condone people using religion as a toxic thing against people, that’s disgusting)\n\nI just genuinely want to know why when someone has a problem with any religion they start fighting people over it. I’ve seen people on tiktok with crosses in their names get attacked for it, hijabis posting fit checks get attacked for it, hindus posting their statues get attacked for it, and just a whole ton of religions get attacked for simply following their religion. Again, i’m not trying to start any fights i just genuinely want to know what these people are gaining from causing arguments over this (completely different if they were insulted or attacked first)",

      "text": "So I'm an Orthodox Christian. I veil and stuff occasionally as that's also part of my branch of Christianity. But I love Islam. Always have. I've been learning the language. Love the art. The culture. The Quran. The fact that the Quran is unchanged and is older than the Bible. The rules you have to abide by as a woman, as well as a man. And they're both different as well. It's all unique and awesome. I love it all. \n\nBut as someone who owns 4 bibles... they're all different... and it always makes me question everything. Especially the \"why?\" factor. I don't like questioning things. The Quran hasn't made me question anything yet. The rules are simple for both genders. The culture is simple. The sins are simple. The whole thing is simple, and I haven't found any flaws. It does sadden me because I love Jesus. I know He is definitely there. But it doesn't feel right for a God to have a face or even an appearance of any kind. A God, in my opinion, is meant to just be a feeling. You can just feel Him there. So, I always saw Jesus as a messenger or a Prophet. Someone who gained knowledge from the All Mighty being, dying at the cross and going to the Heaven's Himself, the body of Jesus being used by a Holy Spirit of some kind. And to know Jesus is second to Muhammad (SWT) is so beautiful. \n\nMy husband is Seventh Day Adventist, and his whole family is. I have worn a veil, he called me \"His little Hijabi\". It's cute as all heck. Loved it, but I wasn't wearing a hijab so I was kinda like... \"What...?\"\nHe's always known me to be an Orthodox Christian. Knows I love Islam, though. But I'm not so sure how to tell him that I'm questioning my whole religion. And the sad thing is... he would have to be a Muslim, too... a Muslim woman must marry a Muslim man. He wouldn't convert. I'm like... 70% sure... that he wouldn't... And we have a son together, so I refuse to leave him over a religious rule. Even though I probably wouldn't go to the Heavens because of it... because it's a sin I wouldn't change. \n\nLike... Lord have mercy... I've even stopped drawing living things like animals and people because enough can't do that in Islam. Only nature and other art pieces. \n\nI am so stuck right now. I need some MAJOR advice... anything is appreciated... ❤️",

      "text": "In Hinduism and Buddhism sometimes it is believed that not everyone is lucky enough for salvation/Nirvana and there is hell but a God does not send you there. You go to hell by own choice to have an experience what's in there and you come back when you experienced enough.\n\nBut in Christianity and Islam, you don't have any proof to believe God is real and will be sent to hell for not believing.\n\nWhy aren't you all getting more chances to realise for yourself that your religion is true? I am talking about those who have doubts and becoming atheists.\n\nIf God is omniscient in your ex-religion (for atheists) or religion (for theists) then he should know that human vessels for divine wisdom are not trustworthy as much as direct intervention of God. Let's accept it, humans are greatest liars and should never be trusted. They have political or economical motives behind religions.\n\nIn Hinduism it is clearly told that you have to learn lessons and find out truth. That's why they have temporary hells so that you can make the choice to never go there again. If you know there is a hole in a road and you have fallen once you will never go back. It is also advices to not accept answers from those with political or financial motives. Like if someone is selling religion then you should not believe them. \n\nYou can also awaken by yourself by sheer talent in eastern religions. Buddha awakened by himself and mentioned how beings before him also awakened by themselves.\n\nIt seems like eastern religions believe in power of humans and think of humans as Gods like many humans in both Buddhism and Hinduism are worshipped and those worshipped humans clearly stated \"You can be like me too\". So godhood is not limited to some select beings. Buddha saw Buddha nature in every humans and animals and Adi Shankara said he can see Shiva in every sentient being.",

      "text": "This question comes mainly from my frustration with some Christians I’ve heard claim that if no one went to hell and everyone went to heaven, there would be no point in being a Christian or trying not to sin. But I think it also applies to some other religions (e.g., Islam – Jahannam; Hellenism – Tartarus; Buddhism/Hinduism – Naraka).\n\nIf your religion has a concept of some kind of negative, torturous afterlife (it doesn’t necessarily have to be eternal), would you stop following your religion and its rules (by sinning or doing evil deeds), if you somehow learned that everyone, no matter their beliefs or actions, went to the same positive afterlife?\n\nIt just seems insane to me that the only reason someone would follow a religion and its rules is out of fear of punishment or desire for a reward in the afterlife. Don’t people find meaning in their religion for its own sake? Do they see the religious rules as arbitrary unless backed by the threat of punishment? Don’t people love God? (In the case where they believe in one God.)\n\nEdit: To clarify, I am talking about all forms of negative afterlife where the person experiencing it doesn’t necessarily have to be an unbeliever, it could also apply to people who commit immoral actions. The afterlife also doesn’t have to be eternal.\n\nThe only conditions for the negative afterlife are: it is torturous, it is a punishment for something (not necessarily for unbelief, as in Christianity, but also for evil actions), and it can be avoided by following the rules of your religion and/or basic human morals. But then you find out that the afterlife doesn’t matter anyway because everyone ends up in the same place.",

I've never heard of this for any other religions ever.\n\nThan theirs the fact of \"religious\" persecution I put religion into quotation because looking back into history Jews were persecuted wether or not they converted or practiced any religion aka the holacoust or the inquisition where many had didn't practice any religion and where fully secular and were still murdered and with the inquisition many were did convert although it helped sort of they were still treated as suspects and killed. I'm sure there's more but I know these. Again are their instances of this happening with other religions?\n\nNow to current times I guess in regards to zionism (not the unfortunate history or current politics) but as the reference to one idea of claims Jews are returning to their lands obviously theirs aspects to consider conversions in the past but from what I've learned it is difficult to convert to juidiasm (I'm sure this is relative but still) anyways say German Jews they couldn't have been similar to Christianity or Islam because than they could have simply converted and not been oppressed no? And like ik it's an ethno religion but wouldn't that mean all or majority of Jews come from Canaan ? \n\nIn that case it would be true that Jews are returning to their land but the claims are that only some Jews are ethnic and/or indigenous to the lands. But if let's say they did originate from the land say 1000 years ago I'd see why it's difficult to just claim indegiounity to a land (obviously if this werent the case taking ownership of a land wouldn't be the justified way to return) but aside from this fact what is the truth is it impossible to confirm or deny or is something that can be proved of the origination of Jews to a land or the other way around?\n\nI'm asking this to learn and have no agenda or shit just cannot for the life of me figure out why this all is?",

For them, the Sacred Text is the Bible, more specifically, the New Testament. And they want nothing to do with the Quran for example. I could even say they *want to know nothing* about the Quran. And it's quite puzzling for me. I don't understand this \"it's one or the other\" mentality. I feel like I keep discovering more and more about God the more I read, and I wonder why would someone who believes wouldn't want to too...\n\nI've read the Bible, the Gnostic Gospels, the Quran, the Kitab i Aqdas, the Avesta, some of the Buddha discourses, some Hinduist texts like the Bagahvad Gita, bits of the RigVeda and the next one is the Book of Mormon.\n\nHow is it for you? What have you read? How do you percieve the Texts of other religions? What do you think about the variety of faiths? Does it matter which faith someone is born in? Why should he stick to it or not?\n\nNow I want this discussion to remain civil but the beans to be spilled... so maybe best to not talk about the contents of books you haven't read but feel strongly about, but rather why you feel strongly about it. \n\nCan't wait to read you!",

And I've notice recently in the comments on some posts that some people don't know, understand, or believe that Buddhism is a religion. Buddhism is a religion. Just because it doesn't line up with your narrow close-minded worldview of what a religion is, doesn't mean it's not a religion.\n\nReligion ≠ believing in and worshipping a god for a good afterlife.\n\nI understand a lot of people in this world are either Christian or Muslim and only interact with other Christians and Muslims and thus assume that every religion uses the same framework as Christianity and Islam, but no that's not the case.\n\n\"It's just a philosophy\" No, it's not. You can say that about any religion (and still be wrong). Imagine if someone said that Christianity isn't a religion that it's just a philosophy that teaches you to treat others well. You would sound silly, right? Well that's exactly how people sound when they say that Buddhism is a philosophy and not a religion. Yes, Buddhism does have a philosophy to it, but so does every religion.\n\nBuddhism is a religion. It is a group of shared beliefs and practices with spirituality and has its own soteriology.\n\nThank you for reading my little rant. I hope everyone has a great day :)",

I can not tell for the others, but I guess all Western Europe is the same. Here is why Italian Catholicism is dead and will be a minority religion in 20 - 30 years",
      "text": "Catholicism is the largest denomination of the largest religion in the world, Christianity. It is actually growing till nowadays, but that is not because of the West, but in spite of the West.\n\nCatholicism is traditionally associated with Romance speaking countries, especially Italy, France, Spain and Portugal. However right now is the main religion for people in the southern emisphere of the globe. The vast majority of Catholics are African or South American. The most Catholic other world area is the Philippines.\n\nIn the West, Catholicism is not a minor religion yet, but here is why it will soon be. Regardless of what statistics say, if you actually go to the Mass, the only people under 40 - 50 are kids with their parents. As a 28 y.o. man who goes to the Mass I am always the youngest adult by far.\n\nIf you speak privately with young Italians, literally ALL of them will tell they are agnostic or atheist. And while for a while women stayed into the faith of their parents more often, in 2025 women under 30 are just the same as men.\n\nIt is obvious Catholicism is DEAD here, because by another 20 or 30 years only less than 5% of the people will still be Catholic. When people who are now young will be old, Western Europe will have lost Catholicism definitely.\n\nBut why did it happen ? While I can not tell, I can tell it is about the way baby boomers brought their offspring up. They proved unable to transfer traditional values to the new generations. Millennials and Gen Z do not want to have anything to do with religion anymore. However,  unlike the still many, many atheists between baby boomers and Gen X, they are open about being agnostic or atheist. They are not the typical 50 - 60 years old who professes to be Christian then goes to Mass 2 or 3 times a year. They tell straight to your face they are fed up with religion as a whole. They are people who want to be the ones making up their own values, and they can not stand an abstract, unproven authority regulating their behaviors with what to them are just utterly arbitrary and useless rules.\n\nWhat do you think ? Will Catholicism be finally separated from Western Europe ? Will it disappear from the northern emisphere as a whole, or at least from Europe ?",

But especially in he middle east, religion has played a huge part in the way the region has turned out, and the idea of a final war has always been believed to happen in the middle east. It's possible that these beliefs will ironically be the very reason it happens, makes you wonder if it's an actual prophecy if everyone is working hard to let religion dictate their actions. I'm not on Israel's side but the only reason the dome of the rock was built is bc of Islam's beliefs that Muhammad was there in the night journey and the Quran doesn't even mention Jerusalem btw, that was an idea that formed later on, but generally before that the Jews had their temple. The Jews fight so aggressively for their country bc religion tells them it's theirs. American christians offer blind support to Israel bc they believe blessing Israel brings you blessings as well. Muslims believe the Jews turned away from God so they shouldn't be there in the first place. Though I personally feel like most Israelis don't really believe these prophecies. Anyway, if the Abrahamic religions didn't exist, maybe it would have been easier to ensure peace in the middle east in general",

Either translated incorrectly or changed throughout time. Anyways I absolutely love history I started learning all about the Aztecs and Mayans and learned about how the Aztec gods became to be. Needless to say all religion seems to be a control of the masses or a way to take control over the unknown. This has made me spiral into a rabbit hole of religion throughout history and I’m honestly lost. My curiosity and skepticism has made me lose my faith, I’m not necessarily mad about it however I envy the people who so strongly believe in a book or figure. I’ve always seen religious people and places so beautiful. Catholicism has my heart with the rosaries,nuns, and churches but I’m just lost now.

If the sheikh told me that killing one is justified Because they sinned is alright and I disagree will I be the sinner? \n\nOn a side note: i gree up with many tv shows that show the message that Killing is bad. And that is a faith I am passionate about. I don’t believe it’s any humans right to take a life, while we imprison criminals to keep the rest of us safe, I believe taking a life no matter how cruel is for a higher being like God.

      "text": "Just in case: knowledge is certainly power. The more you know about a product, its seller, market conditions, etc the more value you can obtain at less cost. Knowledge of mass-energy created the largest bomb and the generated literal electric power (don't conflate power with goodness). Knowledge of an enemy's movements, of their communications, and goals allows for better strategies and allocation of resources. \n\nA simple change from demons to germ theory is responsible for the greatest number of lives saved by a single change in history. Close second and third: vaccines and designer crops\n\nKnowledge is power whether it is used by oppressors or those getting out from under oppressors\n\nMisinformation is not knowledge. If someone sells a cure for the common cold but it's actually bleach, then the person who unwittingly buys it has less power to control their own interests. Namely, not getting sick \n\nSo if you look at the early and middle medieval ages in Europe for instance: the vast majority of the population was illiterate, religion was the highest power (either the monarch was also the head of the church or he was crowned by the head of the church), and the power and life expectancy of everyone was widely in correlation with the vast disparity between those who could read (King and clergy) and the 85% of the population who were economically destitute\n\nWhy should a person be convinced to accept something on faith alone? Or to lower their standards to accept even logical impossibility (such as someone being their own son). Especially when others are so willing to take advantage of the disparity of knowledge that it benefits them merely to cause general restriction or dilution of knowledge: such as by flooding discourse with misinformation or by flattering a person into choosing self assurance over correctness\n\nWhy should a person deliberately put themselves in the same deferential relationship to an institution as the peasants were to the clergy during the height of Christianity in Europe?",

I've been through a lot in the last couple years and feel I am at a crossroads in my life, and for those of you who may have felt the same at some point, I'd love to hear your stories and where a good place would be to start? To be honest, as a gay person who has suffered a lot of homophobia, it's a very daunting subject because not only have I seen other LGBT people have very negative experiences and religious trauma... but my partner left the church she was born into (I won't specify which) when she was 18 and is very much an atheist. I don't feel like me being of faith would break the relationship, but it's just something I thought I'd mention. \n\nI went to a presbyterian church growing up and was confirmed to the church because while my parents weren't super religious themselves, my mom's side of the family was and they wanted there to be a community there for me in case I felt a need to later on. Ironically, I no longer live in that town, so I really feel like I'm starting from a blank slate.",

I mean …. once you claim to know all that ……… what’s left to wonder about? \n\nReligion replaces the mystery and awe of a higher power with limited human-designed interpretations of what is inherently beyond human comprehension.\n\nTrue trust and faith involves ***accepting*** any potential higher power's nature and intentions, without trying to guess. Religion lacks trust because instead of accepting gods will, it makes assumptions and ***expectations***.\n\nMany people forget or at least they fail to realize that making a case for the existence of GOD does NOT make a case for the DEITY of any RELIGION. If a higher power does exist, there is a super good chance that it is not the god of your religion. Even if your religion is Christianity.\n\nSo … If you truly want to … quote / unquote … 'give yourself up to god', then you should probably give up your religion.",

      "text": "First I want to ask if you have ever been censored by the Baha'i Faith or it's unofficial affiliates. If you have been censored by another organization, feel free to share. \n\nA couple days ago, I had a 21 page study of Baha'u'llah's Tablet of the Branch removed from Baha'i Library Online and described as Covenant Breaking materials within 6 hours of being made public. With my name officially attached to the study, I might officially be considered a Covenant Breaker by the Universal House of Justice.\n\nIn the Baha'i Faith, Abbas Effendi created this concept of a lesser covenant upon which he is the center of. This concept requires full belief in his infallibility and authority. He publicly shamed anyone who did not believe this, and required the Baha'i community to shun anyone who challenged this concept. It is a concept not found in the teachings of Baha'u'llah. \n\nThis practice continues today with the Universal House of Justice and it's Auxiliary Board Members of Protection, whose sole role is to protect the faith from its own members. \n\nThe Tablet of the Branch study, available on r/BabandBahaullah, is a way to directly challenge this poisonous and harmful behavior. Abbas Effendi claimed to be the Branch referred to and is a foundational document Bahais use to support Abbas Effendi's Lesser Covenant. The study refutes this idea by using Baha'u'llah's own words to explain the tablet, and some analysis of these words.\n\nWhat the tablet really says, in 14 paragraphs, that the Surah ar-Rum of the Quran is fulfilled by the arrival of Baha'u'llah to Istanbul, the old land of the Eastern Roman Empire of Byzantine. It explains why, how, and the historical time and place of the tablet in the chronology and theology of Baha'u'llah's ministry. \n\nIf you would like to discuss censorship in the Baha'i Faith, the Tablet of the Branch, or censorship within religion (or even in atheist subs) in general, feel free to share. I believe censorship is primarily used to protect an organization from it's followers knowing the truth, a common tactic of fascists, authoritarians, and fear-mongors.",

Cain was cursed and used as an example of unrighteousness, so most probably to the depths with him.\n\nAlso, from what I know God had to “take” Enoch away to heaven rather than let him die, which implies other dead people don’t go to heaven back then?\n\nAlso, prophets who apparently went to heaven are Moses and Elijah, as they are shown or said to be coming back to Earth for a stint. Why wouldn’t the arguably most important human, Adam, be among them? Is he not in heaven then?\n\nWhat’s the consensus from Catholic, Muslim and Christian views?",

I just didn't believe in God anymore, so that makes me an atheist. But I've been re-examining my beliefs and trying to find meaning and purpose and even faith in a God again to hopefully turn my life around. But I digress. \n\nIt all depends on the person being asked, of course. But I have noticed a lot of believers, if you ask them \"How do you know your God exists?\", they'll answer with \"Because I do. Look around you. You think this universe is all random and has no order or First Cause?\" But that doesn't answer the question. If anything, it's just question dodging. And, while I'll admit I haven't spoken to that many Christians on a personal level, I don't know how many would say \"I don't know for sure He exists, but I believe He does, and that gives my life hope and purpose\". And I could buy that, because it's honest. \n\nBut it seems like a lot of theists claim they **know** that God exists but don't have evidence for it, and suggest that you can't prove or disprove God anyway so evidence doesn't matter.

I believe in a god but I have a personal interpretation that’s probably wrong seeing as I’m 2 years out of high school with 0 religious experience beyond my curiosity on the subject. I also want to make clear I mean 0 offence I ask these questions in the hope of figuring out my faith and internal struggles and I apologize if I come off as rude in this. However I’ve always felt confused by it all. I’m not an atheist I think there’s to much coincidence in the universe for there not to be something more but how do you know what you are following is true? There have been thousands of religions over centuries and even current ones are modified from the past. How do you know you are following “the right one” or how do you have faith in it? What keeps you faithful? With all the cruelty and state of the world. All the bloodshed tied to so many of these faiths and atrocities throughout history I just feel like I need to ask why a god would even look our way after all these things around us? And if it does what makes people think it approves? Beyond just the written text. I do believe in redemption and that people can change and there is good in the world but to say that there is a lot of good rn doesn’t feel true. I would ask these to irl people but I’m to embarrassed and I’m worried I’m simply being over dramatic with myself or that I’ll come off like some self ritius duchebag. I look forward to seeing your answers however.",

To me, that’s like trusting a wall that never talks. There’s no relationship just projection.\n\nThat led me to a deeper question:\n\nDoes faith exist because of God or does God exist because of faith?\n\nIn other words, is faith a response to a divine being, or is God a concept that only exists because humans evolved the capacity for belief and fear?\n\nThink about it like this: indecency (e.g. being naked in public) isn't objectively real it’s real because we believe it’s real, because we fear breaking social norms. Maybe God works the same way. God exists for people because they fear meaninglessness, death, or the unknown, and faith is a coping mechanism that makes God \"real\" at least psychologically and socially.\n\nI'm curious to know what others think about this idea.",

      "text": "[✨](https://emojipedia.org/sparkles) Please be gentle - I have read all the rules and have googled a lot of terms, but I don't know 100% of the 'reddit words'!\n\nI am not here to attack anyone's belief, etc. I am curious to hear from people (perhaps particularly anyone in the medical field) about this subject.\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nReligion seems fundamentally based on belief in something unproven and intangible. It can ask people to put faith in ideas that go against scientific evidence. Faith seems often to be the denial of scientific observation, so belief can be preserved. People pray (/essentially making a wish) and believe their wishes are being granted by xxx deity. People believe laying hands on a sick person can heal them, or they can otherwise replace medicine with prayer. Others hear the voice of God in their head and believe an unseen entity is giving them private, one-on-one guidance through life.\n\nAt what point does this kind of belief cross into magical thinking, or even resemble symptoms of mental illness? Can a line be draw between faith and delusion?\n\nI feel like if I presented to a doctor saying I hear voices telling me directions in my head (eg. nobody else but me can hear it) I would be considered to have auditory hallucinations and be put on a mental health treatment pathway. But if I say 'not it's fine, it's god speaking to me' somehow...that is fine? Even though...they are the same symptoms.\n\nWhere can you draw the line when there is so much grey area?\n\nI would love to hear your thoughts and experiences and hopefully expand my mind.\n\n(I am scared people are going to scream at me - but I feel like if anyone is going to have answers, it is this sub!).\n\nEdit 21.30 GMT: Thanks for all your replies, folks! I shouldn't have posted this so late in the day as I need to get cracking to shower and sleep now, so will have to come back tomorrow to read & reply more!

      "text": "For Judaism, I think the prohibition on lashon hara (evil speech) is pretty fantastic. Generally, speaking, any sort of gossip and talking about people behind their back is prohibited, and even positive speech should be carefully considered (ie, if someone asks about where to get a Shabbos meal you shouldn’t say so-and-so always has food on because it could imply negative things). It’s extremely particular on every detail to ensure that gossip and negative speech does not spread. \n\nIt also has practical carveouts for dangerous people, ie it’s obviously permissible to warn about a predator, or for practical need such as for a job recommendation or a dating suggestion. You cannot hide important information when someone does need to know it, but you cannot spread it for no reason. Less gossip, which is frequently false or misleading, and more innate respect for people would just be a fantastic for the whole world.",

      "text": "I grew up in the Evangelical Christian subculture of the U.S. Bible Belt, where I often heard stories of near-death-experiences (NDEs): a brilliant light, a feeling of ascent, reunions with deceased loved ones, and a choice—or command—to return to life on earth. Many included claims of perceiving detailed events while clinically unconscious, which I once took as powerful evidence. I also heard a few (much rarer) accounts of hellish NDEs that ended in conversion.\n\nAs an adult studying religion and spirituality more academically, I’ve learned of the similar pattern that exists across cultures in regards to NDEs—euphoria, light, loved ones, etc—paired with different religious figures (Jesus for Christians, Amida Buddha for Pure Land Buddhists, the Prophet Muhammad in Islamic narratives, etc.), and with the same kinds of evidences I used to find so affirming.\n\nFor believers (nonbelievers welcome too): do NDEs that match your tradition genuinely strengthen your faith? If so, how do you interpret or reconcile NDEs from other faiths—or nonbelievers who report “heavenly” experiences? Or, do you view the whole subject as too speculative or unrelated to your personal faith?",

      "text": "Why do religions often ask people to believe blindly, when key religious figures—like apostles and prophets—were given miracles or direct encounters with God? Modern preachers say that faith has to be blind because there's no virtue in believing once you've seen proof. But most of the major figures in religious history did get proof. I mean, I’d have no problem dying as a martyr if I had seen someone turn water into wine. But sacrificing everything without any proof? Yeah, no thanks. Isn't this paradoxical?",

      "text": "What is the true word of God? I believe in God but the more I learn about history and anthropology, the harder it is to have faith in any one religion. \n\nAll the Abrahamic religions to have a lot in common and anthropologically stem from similar roots. Many religions are influenced by the society or culture they existed in, and there is a lot of historical evidence to back this. But this makes it difficult to see religion as a divine/absolute truth, as it seems to bend and adjust to whatever is most convenient for the society it is in.\n\nThis brings me to human interference - Most of the holy texts have clearly been altered or have varying versions or ambiguous authorship. \n\nNow, let’s say we want to believe based on the oldest or most original version of monotheism. Judaism, being the common denominator for both Christianity and Islam, might make sense as the “true” religion. But it borrows heavily from Zoroastrianism(and so do the other Abrahamic religions) and other more archaic monotheistic practices.\n\nSo what is true? How can we find God in the face of uncertainty?",

      "text": "I noticed quite often my faith and many other faiths have been attacked using A Bit Cult Model. The Bite Cult Model was developed by Steven Hassan in what might have been a legitimate way of expressing concern and categorizing if someone is being manipulated and exploited. However it has an inherent flaw as does the word cult. \n\nThe Bite Model and the word cult can indiscriminately be used to classify anything in a negative way. To illustrate this I invite you all to take any sports organization, government, school, trade union or club and use the Bite model to evaluate it or even ask ChatGPT to do it for you. The results are quite troubling as it will call any religion or even atheism a cult and it will call any organization including sports, government, schools and unions cults.\n\nI bring this up because I strongly believe in freedom of religion and each you having the right to explore your faith on your terms without people showing intolerance toward your faith whatever it might be. That is your search for the truth and you have a right to it. The Bite Model while it may have been well intentioned has become a tool for hate and intolerance.",

      "title": "My Hijab Journey: Navigating Faith, Identity, and Fear",
      "text": "Hey everyone,\n\nI wanted to share a bit about my journey with faith and identity, especially as it relates to my hijab. I grew up in a Muslim family, but we were never super strict about religious practices. Ramadan was a big deal for us, but things like daily prayers or mosque visits weren't part of our routine. For my entire schooling, from kindergarten right through to high school, I attended a Christian school. My mom and my older sister, who's in her thirties, don't wear the hijab, so it wasn't something I was exposed to daily within my immediate family.\n\nOne day, I decided to wear the hijab. It was a completely personal choice, and I was so happy with it. What's wonderful about my family is that they truly respect individual decisions and never judge. So, there was no pushback, just acceptance.\n\nI've always been obsessed with traveling and never had any issues before. But the first trip I took after wearing my hijab was to Jordan, specifically the Dead Sea. There, a child started mocking me. Even though I didn't respond because it was just a kid, it really stung. I'd never experienced anything like that, and it was quite a shock.\n\nSince then, I've started seeing more and more videos online about Islamophobia and calls to ban the hijab. I know that some actions by individuals who identify as Muslim unfortunately distort the true image of Islam, and believe me, that disgusts me too. I can understand why people might form negative opinions based on what they're seeing and experiencing.\n\nBut for me, these experiences and the online negativity have created a real fear. It's become a trauma, to be honest. I've lost the courage to visit European countries or even just do everyday activities without this overwhelming anxiety of being judged, rejected, or even bullied.\n\nI genuinely respect all cultures, and ironically, my own grandmother doesn't even wear the hijab. I was at a point where I seriously considered removing it. But then I realized, I don't want to live according to other people's rules. Wearing my hijab doesn't make me any less interesting, less cultured, or less passionate about life. So, I decided to keep it.\n\nWhat do you all think? How do you navigate living true to yourselves when faced with judgment or fear?",

They don’t go to church anymore but their house is full of crucifixes, paintings, candles, statues, altars to deceased relatives, etc. \n\nI was baptized, i had my first communion, I did weekend school at my church, I would pray every night before bed. \n\nThen, somewhere around 10 years old, I just sort of…stopped. I can’t quite remember what it was, maybe the death of my grandfather, maybe just laziness, maybe a combination\n\nRegardless, I just stopped practicing, and that led to me ultimately stopping my active belief\n\nFor almost 25 years, I carried myself as an Agnostic. In some periods, I leaned more into Atheism but I’m currently Agnostic. My contention has been “I don’t know”\n\nThen, my mom had a stroke early last year. During her time in the hospital, I found myself in the hospital chapel several times. I would just sit in there and wish…I don’t know if I’d call it praying. I never thought I was talking to “anyone”. In the place of God, I would always talk about “the universe” as the overhanging force, “I think the universe is telling me to do this”\n\nA few years ago, I went through a very rough break-up. Then, my mom had her stroke, then I had lost my job, then I found a job but I’ve been feeling stuck, then I was going through a pit of loneliness, loss of purpose, my will to keep trying was just dwindling. For the last 2.5 years, I’ve just felt myself sink deeper and deeper into depression, degeneracy, and debauchery. \n\nThen, a few months ago, on Tinder of all places, I matched with this woman. At first, there wasn’t anything huge in terms of connection. I was still in my hole, not really feeling anything for anyone or anything. \n\nBut the more that she and I talked, the more I sensed my feeling come back. She was telling me about herself, her story, her life, etc. and I was getting more and more hooked. Then, we met in person, and upon seeing her in person for the first time, I instantly knew. I’m going to marry this girl. \n\nShe’s Christian, and comes from a very Christian household. She also associates with the Jewish half of her family. \n\nThe more that she and I talk, the more we connect. Values, morals, goals, ideas, wants, likes, dislikes, it’s all there. \n\nShe says she accepts my agnosticism, and I accept her Christianity. \n\nHowever, she invites me to go along with her to church and I straight up said “yeah let’s do it”. It was during a conversation where she’s been also feeling a crisis of faith, and she wants to dig even deeper into her faith.\n\nWe’re always talking about how uncanny it is that we found each other when we did, when we were both our lowest. She says God sent me to her, I say The Universe sent her to me. \n\nNow that she’s wanting to lean more into her faith, I can’t say I’m fully against revisiting my faith. But I’m stuck. \n\nIs faith something you can just turn on and off? Log in and out of? I definitely feel very grateful and fortunate to have found this amazing woman, and I’ve never felt happier. I feel a purpose again, I feel life again. I’m *going* to marry her. I was with my previous girlfriend for 8 years and I never felt these feelings with her. \n\nIs this God? Is this God re-entering my life? I’m confused.",

I walked in and some people had their hands up, and swaying, and singing along, and some people were crying. It was intense, and remarkable. It made me wonder\n\nAs someone who’s been agnostic, sometimes leaning more atheist, for the last 20-ish years, what does faith *feel* like?\n\nI’m sure it’s not something mind-altering like you feel drunk or high the entire time, but is it something you’re always conscious of? Is it something you just have with you all the time? \n\nWhen you’re driving home from work, for example, do you think or feel anything differently? \n\nI know these questions are poorly-written. I’m not entirely sure what I’m even asking. \n\nYou know how people just *know* their social security number? It’s not an active choice, but it’s something that comes so easy to so many people. \n\nHow does a person of faith *feel* differently to someone who’s agnostic/atheist?",

      "title": "Why Religious Contradictions Undermine Faith",
      "text": "One of the biggest issues with religion is the contradictions found between different religions and within them. Christianity, Judaism, Islam, Hinduism, Buddhism, and thousands of other religions around the world offer vastly different answers to the most fundamental theological questions: What is God? What happens after death? How should we live our lives?  These contradictions aren’t just present among religions, they often show up within them. Factions of the same religion often split in opposition to one another. Take for example, Protestants and Catholics or Shia and Sunni Muslims. They all claim to follow the same basic beliefs, yet their interpretations differ so greatly that they have led to centuries of conflict and violence. The answers these religions provide are not only incompatible, but they each claim to be exclusively true, rendering all others as false.\n\nMany attempt to excuse this issue by claiming that all religions are different cultural expressions of the same spiritual truth. But this is a highly illogical claim. This argument is equivalent to saying that the existence of many contradicting maps proves the existence of one true destination, when the maps disagree on everything from the route to the existence of the destination itself. If all religions were expressions of the same underlying truth, we would expect to find cohesion among them, not contradiction and mutual exclusion.\n\nIf there were a God attempting to reveal a singular truth, why would his message be so culturally and historically inconsistent? And it’s not as if religious individuals accept this idea of a shared divine truth either. Most identify with a single religion, and by doing so, reject all others as falsehoods. These belief systems do not coexist peacefully; they compete, accuse each other of blasphemy, and claim authority over ultimate truth. Why would a divine message be embedded in systems that so actively contradict and condemn each other?\n\nMany claim these contradictions are intentional, that God designed a complex web of beliefs so that only the devoted could find the right path. But if the goal is truth and salvation, why would they be hidden behind such conflicting cultural barriers? Why would someone born into one faith be forced to unravel centuries of theology just to discover that their spiritual upbringings were misinformed, while those born into the “right religion” get a free pass? This is no test of sincerity, but a guessing game that only those in certain situations can play correctly. And since the stakes are eternal, then a God who forces us to play this game is cruel, not loving. It makes no sense for a fair God to let something as random as where you’re born decide your fate.\n\nIn my opinion, the idea of a shared divine truth is used to avoid the very real and uncomfortable question: Why should someone be condemned because they were born into the wrong culture and raised under the wrong religion? The typical religious answer to this is that sincere seekers will be guided to the truth. But this only raises more problems. If salvation is being determined by one’s religious beliefs, then billions are being misled by circumstances out of their control. Calling this “divine justice” is merely a way to defend an unfair system without addressing its consequences.\n\nOverall, the conflicting nature of religion isn’t proof of divine truth, but of human invention. People across time and cultures constructed their own belief systems that reflected their environment, not a universal message from an all-knowing God.",

      "title": "Ex cult member, how can I possibly put faith in another religion again?",
      "text": "Hey, so some background: I'm in my 20s, my father is still in the cult (Christian based UFO cult) and my mom passed away in it a few years ago. I really started questioning around 16 (had lots of pushback) and fully rejected it a few years later before having the courage to leave everything behind and the means to be in my own. \n\nI'd say I'm a pretty confident atheist and anti church  after everything I've been through and from looking into things myself. Having the perspective of someone who for a long time had fully believed and had faith in the teachings that were told to me I'm finding it very difficult to look for any valid answers or explanations in any other religions. I keep coming back to the answer that  \"everyone is lying\". But I'm not satisfied with that answer and it can't explain some personal experiences I've had. I also know I'm outnumbered in that.\n\nAfter having a number of conversations with religious people from mostly Christianity but also some others I hear a whole lot about faith or people having a personal connection, I figured here would be the best place to discuss something like this but I totally understand if I'm not welcome since I'm kinda an atheist.\n\nHow do you guys do it? Is there something I'm missing about God or the connection to it? I really really want to believe in something other than the scary reality I currently strongly believe is objectively correct which is that there is no god and when we die it's nothing forever but I've never really had any convincing answers that don't need me to trust someone again. I'm genuinely open to anyones thoughts. Everytime I'm told to have \"faith\" I just hear the preachers who lied to me for years and I don't know how to see it any other way. Also some pretty  big logic holes in most of the big organized religions.\n\nThe main thing keeping me looking for something is that I've had some spiritual experiences that I can't explain. The main one being on the same weekend my mom (who I wasn't close to and hadn't talk to in awhile) passed away, I was walking to my pc desk in my roomb which was dark and out of the corner of my eye it look like she was sitting on my bed smiling. The second I looked directly it was gone but It stuck out to me as strange and startling. 2 days later I got the call from the police that she didn't show up for work and was found in her bed at her home. I don't know how to explain it and I've told myself that it simply had to be a coincidence or something but I normally don't just randomly see things. I'm like 90% sure on there not being spirits or a god but I can't explain it other than a hallucination or a misremembered memory from grief.\n\n I wish I could believe in something but the logical side of me prevents it and the faith side of me has been stabbed in the back. Does anyone have answers or ways to look at things in a different way? Answer or explanations that don't require me to put blind trust in another again? Explanations for how I could possibly see my mom when I don't believe?",

      "title": "Struggling to Make Sense of Faith",
      "text": "Firstly, I want to say, \"PLEASE LET’S ALL BE RESPECTFUL.” I’m not here to cause division; I’m here to understand. People of different faiths thank God, Jesus, Allah, Krishna, and many others for guiding them to the \"truth.” But how is it that each group sees its path as the right one? How can we all be following different truths? If we all have the same Creator, why are we pointing in so many different directions?\n\nI've been praying and searching, but the answers remain confusing, and it’s hard not to get lost in conflicting claims:  \n“I prayed to God, and He led me to Jesus.”  \n“I prayed to God, and He led me to Islam.”  \n“I prayed to God, and He abandoned me.”  \nThese different experiences leave me questioning the nature of God’s guidance.\n\nFrom a Christian perspective, I struggle with the complexity of Jesus being both God and God's son, and yet tempted by Satan. The teachings of love and forgiveness seem to contrast with constant warnings of judgment and hell. For example, in Revelation 19:11-16, Jesus returns as a warrior, \"dipped in blood,\" to wage war and judge the nations. This image feels at odds with the messages of peace and love he preached during his life. And if God didn’t create evil, but nothing exists outside His will, then how did evil emerge? Some argue evil is a result of human free will (Genesis 2:16-17), but this raises questions about God's role in allowing it. Also, why did God create hell? It’s a tough question many Christians wrestle with.\n\nThe Torah, New Testament, and Qur’an also seem shaped by the time and culture in which they were written. If these are eternal truths, why do they sound so tailored to specific societies and eras? The Qur’an (2:2) says it’s a \"guidance for those conscious of Allah,\" but also acknowledges that guidance was given according to each community's needs and circumstances. It’s hard to ignore how much these texts reflect the realities of war-torn and patriarchal societies.\n\nIn Islam, I can’t overlook some of the troubling aspects of Muhammad’s life and teachings. His marriage to Aisha, the treatment of women and non-Muslims, and the contradictions between the peaceful prophet and the warrior are difficult to reconcile. The Qur'an speaks of peace in Surah 2:256, \"Let there be no compulsion in religion,\" but then there are verses like Surah 9:5 that command fighting against those who oppress Muslims. It’s a fine balance between peace and conflict that has caused much debate.\n\nThe topic of Sharia law is also hard to navigate. If enforced literally today, many argue it would severely limit freedoms, especially for women, LGBTQ+ people, and anyone who dissents from religious norms. The Qur'an calls for justice and compassion, like in Surah 4:3, where it emphasizes fairness in marriage, but interpretations of Sharia law can vary widely. Some argue it should evolve with the times, while others take a more literal approach.\n\nBut the real question I’m left grappling with is: If these sacred books are truly from God, why do they sound like products of human society, reflecting patriarchal, tribal, and war-torn cultures? Why do the miracles described exist only in the past, rather than in the world around us today? Miracles like parting the Red Sea (Exodus 14:21) and the Resurrection (Luke 24:6-7) are foundational, but they remain unproven by modern standards. Some argue these miracles were meant to confirm divine intervention at the time, but we don’t see the same kind of miraculous events today.\n\nAnd above all, why are we told that love, mercy, and free will are divine, yet warned that if we don’t believe or obey, we may suffer eternally? Jesus speaks of love in John 13:34-35, but also warns of eternal punishment in Matthew 25:46. Similarly, the Qur'an speaks of Allah’s mercy in Surah 55:13 and warns of consequences for disbelief in Surah 67:6-7. It’s a tough pill to swallow when love and mercy seem conditional on obedience.\n\nAlso, as someone who identifies within the LGBTQ+ community, it’s deeply painful for me to see that many faiths view homosexuality as a sin. It’s heartbreaking to feel that in so many traditions, I’m not only misunderstood but also, by some interpretations, seen as being on a path that leads to condemnation. In Christianity, verses like Romans 1:26-27 and Leviticus 18:22 are often cited against homosexuality. In Islam, the story of the people of Lot (Surah 7:80-81) is commonly interpreted the same way. This is deeply isolating, and feeling rejected by something so central to my life is tough. \n\n(EDIT) I'm a Muslim but having major doubts",

Still radio silence spiritually.\n\nTypically, when I hear of faith, I hear of people being changed by it, feeling a presence when praying, or having some spiritual event that brought them to the faith. In non-Abrahamic faiths, I've met people who talk about the spiritual world and the connection to spirits, etc., yet still, for me, it's just silent, and many practices feel empty and fake. \n\nCan you all describe faith and how you know what you believe is right?",

      "title": "Trying to understand Christianity and faith better as a newer atheist - Discussion?.",
      "text": "I'm not sure if I can ask this here but I'm an atheist currently, looking into Christianity and I have many questions and concerns. I also have no idea how to be fully sincere as a convert a big part of why is because I haven't grew up into the religion and also because I still agree with many \"atheist views\" such as, seeing hell and heaven as a absurd concept and morals in religion as only a exchange process and not real morals i.e you're told if you help someone and do good things you'll please God and go to heaven not because these things you do make you and other people happy and maximizes well being and minimizes suffering, and if you do bad things/sins you'll get God angry at you and you'll go to hell and not because it hurts you and others, like to me is just exchanging between you and God, not actually trying to make the earth a better place to live in. I understand the religious viewpoint and don't have a probelm with it but from what I'm seeing people tend to avoid \"sins\" because they fear hell, not because they're actually harmful like their first concern is not wanting to go to hell and wanting to please God and go to heaven, I think it's important to have both but like I said it seems the vast majority of believers -including non Christians- only do or don't do the actions for hell and heaven and that's a rigged moral compass to me because it makes people see things that aren't necessarily \"bad\" or harmful, bad and harmful because their religion teaches that they are same thing for \"good\" things. \n\nAnother thing that makes me question religions in general (or in this case Christianity) that God obeys the social norms and patriarchal structures? In Christianity all apostles are males, and when you ask they say it's because Jesus was living in 1st century Juadism which was patriarchal (women's testimony was not taken, and while Jesus's resurrection first witness was a woman and \"many of his followers were women\" that still doesn't explain why he didn't choose at least one woman out of the 12 apostles. Not mentioning women aren't allowed to be priests and if they are today that's probably due to the reformation and modernization of Christianity and the feminist movement. So Jesus rejected some patriarchal social norms and kept some others orr?) \n\nWhile Christianity comapred to other religions has a generally semi-equal view of women and men I still see patriarchy in a way or another and it feels offending as a woman to follow something that sees me as inferior to a man just for the fact he was randomly born a male and I was randomly born a female, not mentioning we all start as a female fetus it feels absolutely ridiculous to favor any sex or gender. Another thing I have against religions is homophobia, and seeing the LGBTQ+ people as \"unnatural\", it's present in traces Christianity and present in bigger traces in other religions -i.e islam- and as a ex muslim ally and ace anti-natilist I feel like converting to any religion contradicts all my values, but at the same time atheists don't have a convincing argument about the origin of the universe or why we're different from other animals (our FOXP2 gene version is diffrent from any other animals' even if it was the same as animals' before and it has evolved and mutated, why do only humans have it this way now?) Who's the common ancestor between humans and chimpzees? None of these are answered yet up to my knowledge. But I also don't want to jump to a religion out of not knowing better. Also us having flaws in our body support the evolution theory, flaws such as the coccyx bone, wisdom teeth, spine shape -S shaped because humans used to walk on fours even though now we walk upward, it's a flaw because it's not designed for walking upward-, periods are wasteful and painful- most mammals reabsorb their utirine lining, our retina is wired backwards so light passes through layers of cells before hitting the lense and the optic nerve creates a blind spot because there are no photorecepters where it exits the eye while squids and octopuses have better eyes and their retinas are wired the right way? Or does God love octopuses and squids more than humans that he created religion for? That he favored tje most?. This \"the world revolve around me\" and exists for me to live in and I'm better than every other creature (even humans in some scenarios and cases especially those who follow a different, opposing religion and racism, sexism etc in religions) mindset that religions give to poeple also repels and pull me away from religions, because if you look at how big the universe is and how small you are it's insane to think this all was created for you when you can't even see half of it.. When you can barely discover your own planet. Knowing how small you are in the universe doesn't mean you don't matter or your life is meaningless or you're a scum. \nYou can acknowledge this fact and also create meaning of your life, there's no need to see yourself as superior or inferior, it's not either black or white, our life contains many grey areas that are often overlooked. Maybe we should start recognizing them as well, also the idea of a eternal afterlife feels like a coping mechanism people invented to feel hopefull and have something to look up to, of course there's nothing wrong with that but I feel like keeping it to yourself is better than preaching it and making other people subscribe to it as well same thing with hell, former people thought the worst thing that can happen to you is burning alive eternally, even though there are many other ways that are much more painful especially if emotionally torturous, former people were very simpleminded, they thought it can only be painful because it's physically painful, even though emotial pain is much more effective and can even lead to physical pain as well.\n\nIn Christianity, humans are all naturally sinners and God came down so we can get close to him and repent for our sins with him right? Ok but then why are we punished? If it's something he had created us to have naturally and we couldn't for some reason repent for and have a good relationship with God why are we blamed and punished? And eternally?.\n\nAnother thing all Abrahamic religions have a history in endogamy (the story of human creation) where Adam and Eve's sons and daughters have children together because \"there weren't other humans\", first. Why didn't God create other humans? Just like how he \"created Eve from Adam's rib\" which also could be perceived as misogynistic but regardless, he could've created other humans like how he created all these living organisms and creatures we see everyday? And also it's impossible for us to have been born from only one man and one woman, and if they're gonna say \"God can do the impossible\" why did he only do it then? What about the endangered species in our time that go extinct due to the Allee effect (and other factors as well)? Or does God not care about them? And then why did he create them just to go extinct with him watching? Why did he create some children to be born and healthy and some others to be miserable and ill, suffer and struggle so much and die painfully and tragically for no reason? If it was a adult they'd say that they probably sinned or did something that doesn't please God so he punished them, but what did babies under the age of days do? They're not charged yet to be balmed for their suffering?.\n\nThere are many beautiful aspects in religion but when you get to the unpleasant ones i.e moral and ethical concerns, unscientific claims, questionable things supposedly the most pious and moral people did, etc, religious people just brush them off or say \"only God knows\" or other excuses which make them look desperate and hopeless to stay latched on their religion and I get it maybe many people need religions I don't fully agree with anti-theism, only when it's against what's actually harmful in the religion and not religion as a whole, and many people confuse atheism and anti-theism and go on attaching atheists about it which is a strawman, every anti-theist is an atheist but not every atheist is an anti-theist and I hope more people understand that. \n\nI'm having very conflicting ideas everyday about wether to stay an atheist or convert to Christianity, and even if I did convert I don't think it would be fully sincere since I don't really believe in God or agree with all the fundamental concepts in the religion for everything I mentioned above so I might just become a cultural Christian Atheist/Christian Agnostic, or just stay atheist lol since I'd probably be called a hypocrite? idk.

I suppose you could call it a spiritual awakening. \n\nMy current belief and situation is that the bible has been taken out of context, I believe in a lot of the events and people, however I struggle to put my faith in god when I’m not sure I’m capable of believing. \n\nI feel my mind is so alert and in touch with my spiritual side, I believe there is an afterlife but I can’t picture it being a god and heaven/hell. (I personally believe that everyone ends up the same after death) \n\nI have tried to pray in my own way for whoever is listening to show me a sign or appear to me in dreams to help me transition but there is nothing.",

I’m South American and colonialism played a huge part in how Christianity spread in Latin America. I can’t help but think about how my ancestors were treated by the church. I think about the slaves who were mass converted and had their African names changed to Christian names, losing their identity and ancestry when being converted. I also think about how my native ancestors would have been treated. I know that even with its horrors, without colonialism I wouldn’t have been brought into this world, but I’m really struggling with the idea of a church or Christians who caused generations of trauma to my ancestors in the name of the cross. \n\nDoes anyone have any thoughts on this?",

      "text": "According to my denomination of Christianity the origin of religion was Cain killing Abel. Such crime was so terrible that God basically stopped speaking to us directly, and we have to reach Him with rituals and prayer, hence religion. Before that, God used to speak to humans with no issues. The belief is that only God can give and take life, so such action of murder is basically overriding God's authority and violating the sacredness of life itself.\n\nThis vaguely echoes the theory of bicameral mind, which claims that humans a few thousand years ago were guided by voices (gods) that told them to do everything, from building pyramids to when to sow and reap. Then the Ego mind came, human identity shifted from the voices to your own voice, and ego humans basically killed off the last bicameral humans. IDK how accurate that hypothesis is, and it is very hard to prove with hard science, but it makes sense that history and religions may remember some of that development.",

      "title": "How to explain to my boyfriend I’m exploring my faith?",
      "text": "EDIT: I appreciate everyone’s feedback! I did end up telling him, and just as I expected he was very receptive and is happy to let me explore it on my own/at my own pace. I feel much better :’)\n\nHi there, so I have a bit of a weird background that I feel I have to disclose for context so please bear with me! I’m putting it in here because I feel it is very important to how I should receive advice on handling this situation. \n\nI was not raised into a particular religion. One of my parents was loosely Christian, I had a step parent that was Catholic, and my other parent was actually Wiccan. I was living around primarily Jewish friends of the family for a good chunk of my life. However, almost all of my friends were some flavor of atheist agnostic save for one or two. My parents never forced me into a religion. I find this to be both to my detriment and my benefit.\n\nNow, I have been pretty much living as an agnostic/borderline atheist pretty much my whole life. I would say I was a little bit Christian when I was very young because a lot of of my friends were and I would go to church with them to be respectful, but I didn’t really feel like I clicked with it super well because I was very young and wasn’t raised in it. Therefore I kind of felt like I was “doing it wrong” and didn’t really dive into it out of fear of being disrespectful.\n\nFlash forward to now, after dating a Taoist and a handful of atheists, I am finding myself in an absolutely beautiful relationship with a Catholic man. He’s the love of my life and I’m grateful for him every day. That being said, we’ve been together eight months, and during that time I’ve had a couple conversations with him that have made me consider rediscovering my faith. He is not pressuring me in any way to become Christian or catholic; he’s very respectful of my individuality and where I come from and while he wants what he feels would be beneficial for me, he never forces his beliefs on me and we’re both very respectful of one another.\n\nI decided to pick up a Bible and I found that it’s really been a fascinating and enlightening experience. I’m having a really great time studying it and learning more about myself and my faith journey.\n\nNow you might wonder, what does this girl even want? What is the point of all of this rambling? Well, you see, I have a lot of trauma but I really don’t feel like I want to disclose here. The result of that trauma is that when people get involved with or acknowledge things that are deeply personal to me, I almost become averse to them because I don’t like attention being drawn to me, but only with very specific things. One of those things is my faith. I want to tell him because I feel like it might help me grow closer to him, and I know that he would be very enthusiastic and happy for me and supportive, but I’m worried that if I do, I’m almost going to be turned away from it because it might be a bigger topic of conversation than I’m anticipating and I’ll almost feel overwhelmed and want to go back to hiding if that makes sense. \n\nPart of me thinks that if this is really genuine and I’m making this progress in my journey, it’s not going to actually turn me against my faith. But part of me is scared that that might be the case because of my weird mental health quirks. I guess I’m just looking for advice from anybody who may have been in a similar situation or has a partner in my situation. Is there anything I should maybe ask him to specifically do or not do? I feel like I’ve brought that up to him before and the weird thing is that I feel like he would completely understand and respect what I want, there is zero doubt there, but I just can’t get over this weird anxiety. Every time I want to tell him I back down. I think I’m just afraid of an over enthusiastic response.\n\nBonus points if you can give me an execution plan on HOW to actually tell him lol. Anyway, thanks for reading, I appreciate any advice even if it’s something that’s more aimed towards myself, or any insight you may have from your own lives and faith journeys. Thank you!",

In it three monks were carrying a large gold Buddhist statue away from a ruined building.\n\n\nThis got me to thinking; if I, a woman, had been there and seen that the building was about to collapse, would anyone have been offended if I had taken the statue out myself to try to save it? (assume the statue was small enough for me to carry)\n\n\nWhich led me to wonder if, in a similar scenario for any religion, would I be able to retrieve any relic, book, statue, or otherwise sacred or holy item without offending anyone or desecrating said object? \n\n\nAre there any religions in which it would be better to leave said items to possibly be destroyed rather than try to save it myself? Would it make a difference if I first wrapped it in a blanket or perhaps a jacket I happened to have on?\n\n\nMy questions really boils down to, if a particular religion has rules against women touching certain items, are exceptions made during emergencies?\n\n\nIf it makes a difference I’m also white, Christian, and American.",

      "text": "I'm going to tell you a little about myself but you don't need to read it, I would like any advice to help me believe\n\n**I'm letting down my barriers and trying to find faith**\n\nI was baptized, catechized and confirmed, but none of that was my own choice. My parents told me to go and I went. I never asked to leave because I liked my friends there. Then I started to become skeptical, looking for answers in psychology and believing that our brain is so powerful that it can make us believe and see things, looking for the easiest way to escape from anguish.\n\nI've been an atheist ever since. I've never believed in great forces and great energies. I didn't miss them and I liked being that way. Everything depended on me and if I didn't succeed, it would be my fault and not a greater force. The same thing happened when I succeeded.\n\nHowever, in recent years I've started to miss that faith to help me overcome life's obstacles. Today I'm 26, but when I was about 23 I already felt this discomfort that has stayed with me to this day.\n\nI asked myself why I didn't do anything to try to change this. Even though I had rational answers against faith phenomena, I needed help. I had psychological problems, addictions, professional challenges. I no longer have the same energy I had when I was a teenager. I spent the years 17 to 24 smoking, eating poorly, and drinking. I was always very studious, hard-working, and ambitious, so I managed to evolve during this time.\n\nAt the end of 2022, I changed my life. I quit smoking, weed, drinking alcohol, gambling, and eating foods high in fat and sugar. I started a detox diet. I started running and going to the gym, reading every day, taking supplements, sleeping and waking up earlier. I really went from 8 to 80 in 3 months. I even managed to complete my first marathon in 4h22min.\n\n2023 was wonderful, but I started to face great challenges and stresses from the middle to the end of the year. That's when I stopped doing some good things and started doing some bad things again. 2024 is proving to be one of the worst years I've ever had, but I stuck to my sports plan (which is to do an IronMan) and started swimming, cycling, and finished my first sprint triathlon.\n\nThings are still very difficult, it feels like I'm going back to the pit I climbed out of once, and knowing myself, my first times are easier than repeating. Everything is new, I notice improvements very easily, the second time I compare myself to the best version I've ever been, I judge myself, it doesn't help me at all and it just puts me down.\n\nWith that, I decided to open my heart to at least try to find faith. Even without believing, I'm praying, asking for advice, giving thanks and paying closer attention to the signs that may appear.\n\nSome have already appeared for which I have rational answers, but I don't want to be right anymore, I just want to be happy. Understand my purpose and the path He wants me to follow, so that I don't get as lost as I am. I also don't want to feel alone anymore, even if it's an illusion I don't care anymore.\n\nTLDR: I'm an atheist but I'm looking for faith, even if it's an illusion I want to believe and for the first time in my life I'm willing to do so.\n\nSorry for the bad English, Brazilian here. Thanks for the space and attention!",

Leaders either ignored them, minimized them, or actively turned the blame on me.\n\nWhen the report came out, I thought it would mean real change and survivor care. At first, I was offered counseling reimbursement, which gave me hope. But later, I was told there would be a 10-session limit and that the church wasn’t “responsible” for anything outside specific incidents in the report. They also said counseling should only focus on those incidents, not my broader trauma. That is not how healing works. Trauma isn’t something you “finish” in 10 sessions. And survivors should never be forced to prove their pain is valid enough for continued care.\n\nTo make matters worse, the church has never addressed the findings publicly to the entire congregation. Instead, they’ve only spoken about it in certain departments or smaller circles leaving most members unaware of the full scope of what happened and the recommendations that were made.\n\nThis response has not only failed to help — it’s deepened my mistrust, severed my connection to spiritual community, and left me navigating both spiritual isolation and the long-term impact of abuse. \n\nIf you’ve been in a similar position after an independent investigation, how did you advocate for yourself? Did anything actually work to hold the institution accountable?",

      "text": "Slight Rant...\n\nThinking about how religion is basically faith boggles me a lot. \n\nEx. Bible has been translated thousands of times, yet you still believe that the words in the are 100% because of faith.\n\nThing is, perception creates reality. If you think oranges are the best fruit, your brain will find evidence of that, even if it's not true. \n\nWhen I was breaking down some of my insecurities, I heard the same thing, and it's true! My brain likes to confirm things it already believes, and will twist reality to match the negative thoughts about myself.\n\nSo why don't we say this for religion? I just don't get it. Is it really only faith that makes you believe in it? Just that...? What makes having faith in a banana any different than believing in God?\n\nI think about this because, of course online people try to argue that Christianity (mainly because I'm US located so...) isn't real. But here's the thing, technically, it would be impossible to try have a decent debate, unless said religious person was already questioning. It's basically no point to argue, because EVERYTHING can be accepted in the name of faith.\n\n\nGod talked to someone and answered their prayers, but not another person's? God has the capability to create miracles, he created the Earth and universe, but can't save a kid from cancer? (Which I guess technically they would be in a better place so God probably doesn't care in the Earthly sense).\n\nIt's just, confusing, because I've has questions about God that simply, the answer to them is faith.\n\nFaith that God loves us all, faith that it's the devil causing all the problems on earth (even though God created evil soo ehhh idk), Faith that we have free will, but also God has a plan for us. \n\nI understand having faith in general, example, you have faith that you will make it home safely from work. It's no, guarantee you will, but most likely you will. \nWith God it confuses me because the only way to believe in God is to have faith. We have the bible, other documents..  and that's it. Faith leads the rest I guess.",

I think I had become a pretty heavy skeptic and I'm thankful that I was raised to love science, evidence for proof, reasoning, and the study of the natural world. However from what I understand religion can provide solace, purpose, and community—all things that may be useful during difficult times in my life.\n\nI am not asking what religion people think would suit me, however I would like to have different answers for a few questions from different perspectives. I hope none of my questions come off as offensive, it is not my intention\n\n1. How did you submit to your faith? How did you overcome doubt?\n2. If your religion has texts that may contain scientific and/or historical inaccuracies, how do you compromise with that? Why doesn't it take away from the credibility of the text or faith?\n3. What do you do when your faith is challenged? How do you deal with arguments claiming that you are wrong? Why do you stick with your faith?\n4. To my understanding, faith is trusting in something without proof of its existence... correct me if I'm wrong. How do you feel comfortable in believing in something that cannot be confirmed to be objectively real?\n5. Do you wonder if spiritual experiences or feeling the presence of the divine is something that can be explained? Whether prayer is a placebo effect or something of the sort, just as an example.\n6. How did you find your faith if it isn't something you grew up with?\n7. For those who joined a faith different from the majority religion in your country, how did you do it? Considering everyone around you thinks different.\n8. How do you overcome the knowledge of any negative history associated with your religion?\n9. I hope the general consensus is that all religions are valid, but even with that in mind how do you empathize with people of different beliefs and respect them as people? Although I would never antagonize someone for what they believe, this is something I struggle with. It feels kind of isolating to have different beliefs compared to everyone around me.",

My parents were never strict growing up speaking to me about a specific heaven or hell, only good and evil. I was taught the cycles of karma and how whatever I do will return back to me but there never was a definite 'god' or deity to worship. My mothers family were aethiest but she attends church and receives communion at funerals for the sake of 'tradition', but what tradition even is that? My father kept me always open minded to other religions and to not discriminate. he wears a cross on his chest but doesnt care for church, nor does he pray or preach. \n\n  \nWhat I am confused about it why I feel so very uncomfortable wearing a cross, or being in a church. Attending a catholic school, we had to wear a crucifix badge and I threw mine away just so I didn't have to wear it. I also stopped wearing my cross necklace because it felt wrong and I felt like a hypocrite. \n\nabout 2 years ago I was praying, worshipping, reading the bible just because it made ma feel good and at peace. but then I started exploring other religions such as buddhism and taoism and then I felt at home. It felt better to worship the 'universe' instead of one definite thing because how can we simply shrink such greatness into one idol. \n\n  \nany takes on this?",

Examples being how they both care for all, art and folklore depicting both of them crying for humanity because of their suffering, their sacrifice for the greater good being a major part of their description, eagerness to \"swoop in and help\" anyone who prays to them, and in general being a major symbol of compassion and kindness. And it got me thinking about how many other belief systems have a figure like this! So I wanted to know, do any of your religions have something like this? Who or what represents compassion in yours?",

      "text": "Hi everyone,\n\nI come from one of the most atheistic countries in Europe, and I’ve always considered myself an atheist. I never understood how people could believe in God, and I especially didn’t get all the rules religions seem to have — like how Christians aren’t supposed to have sex before marriage, etc.\nIt always felt like someone just made it all up.\n\nNow I’d describe myself as a little spiritual. I enjoy talking to people about what they believe, and I like reading spiritual texts and trying out different practices. But just yesterday I started reading about Krishna, and once again I ran into the same thing: apparently, to “free your soul,” the easiest way is to find a “true spiritual master” and serve him completely — without pride, without question.\n\nI just can’t wrap my head around that. For me, life is about joy and freedom. I can’t imagine dedicating my whole life to serving someone like that.\nWhat do people get out of it? Is it really that fulfilling that you don’t want anything else afterward? Is the issue that I may be just too self-centered?\n\nIf anyone here has experience with this, I’d really appreciate some insight.",

      "text": "I was talking about this with my parents two nights ago. Both are Christian, but one is a Catholic and one is a Presbyterian. They were taught these were the names of their denominations. However, neither of them has read the Bible from start to finish, nor ever spoke of the Bible in any level of detail with their own parents aside from the gists the media would give you. And the differences between Catholicism and Presbyterianism never came up in conversation. None has ever run into a road block based on whatever differences they are. Had they been raised simply on \"you are Christian\", nothing would've ever changed in their life, and they would've never known the difference, yet they still call themselves based on the denomination name. Because that's how they were raised.\n\nI was thinking of this today. This observation I'm guessing can apply no matter what group the two denominations are from, such as if they were two denominations of Buddhism. Even when there is some kind of major difference, such as Catholics having their saints, you occasionally might find a Baptist who also adheres to the idea of saints just out of their own free will and thinking it's a nice idea to entertain, and they wouldn't cease to be a Baptist. When reading history, you often hear of interpersonal conflicts between denominations, such as between Catholics and Arianism, and often these differences are simply things like \"was the snake in the garden the devil\". Who cares? One might as well form denominations based on whether Jesus wore red sandals or blue sandals. It's worth noting that I see a lot of converts in certain communities, and typically they never identify as a sect and just identify as \"I'm a Christian\", \"I'm a Norse Pagan\", etc. It both feels genuine and has an air of innocence.\n\nYou could probably tell I think of this question a lot, but I never see it asked by anyone. There are denominations that actually make sense to call separate denominations (such as Catholics and Latter Day Saints, since something fundamental like what it means to be obedient to God has changed), and the teachings of spiritual teachers are not only often vague by habit (to the extent that you could argue that extremely small differences in what they mean amount to a core change) but also change so much between the semantics of spoken languages that scripture as written in French might be akin to a sect compared to the same scripture written in Mandarin. However, is there some kind of hard rule I can use to say \"if it crosses that line, it's practical to call it a different denomination\" or \"if the differences don't cross that line, it's not practical to call it a different denomination\"?",

I’m thinking as a kid, it was just a part of my routine. I was also a part of the church choir, as I was always really interested in music. I never considered myself “religious”, but I think church being a part of my weekly routine between CCD and choir, I didn’t think of it beyond anything else. Went to Italy this past year and was in Rome when the new Pope was elected, was able to go to the Vatican and because of Jubilee year, the Holy Doors were open and I got to walk through. Spent a lot of time in Italy in church, and it was a sense of familiarity in a way after so long. My dad and sister specifically do go to church regularly and are close to God. Don’t know if I want to share this with them?\n\nRecently, I went through a lot of mental health struggles, and in the process of working on my health, realized I’ve always been spiritual to some extent. I do believe in the afterlife, and I do believe our loves ones are watching over us in Heaven, that miracles happen, etc. However, I am struggling with diving deep into the religion because of the outdated social beliefs and politics surrounding Catholicism and Christianity as a whole. I also don’t know where to start in my journey, I am just considering getting closer to the religion again as an adult, but am struggling. Is there such thing as casual Catholicism?",

      "text": "Question about Religion, God, why God would make humans think they are superior to all other observable life and phenomena, yet only require us to worship and obey the divine spiritual practices? \n\nOk, I'm on a journey to find a spiritual meaning and tether to my life. It's taken me into the world of seeing of organized religion is for me.\n\nHowever most popular and well known religions preach obeying and allegiance to the One and Only God, albeit they have different understandings of what/who that God is. \n\nMy current challenge with religion is, if there is a God, then is that God just for humans? As it's preached in all modern religions that humans are to worship and obey.\n\nHOWEVER, then my mind questions, well, what about animals, insects, molecular life? If there is one spiritual entity that is the reason for everything we experience, wouldn't that entity require all of the living and energetic life to worship and obey it as well? And if so it would have to be one God that controls all those things, and wouldn't our worship be.... the same or at least recognizable? Like wouldn't I be able to understand/comprehend when my dogs pray, or are anointed? Or like when the ant that's lost from its family is praying for guidance back home? Or when the thirsty tree is praying for moisture or for humans to acknowledge climate change so it can be returned to harmony?\n\nBut since prayer and worship isn't transenergetic/trans-animal, then... how can I know that it's even right to worship a God that only speaks of human worship and righteousness? \n\nLike God itself wouldn't value humans OVER everything else in my opinion. Everything even the radioactive elements and molecules would deserve appreciation and respect under the (one) God rule... no?\n\nWhat are your thoughts on this? Can anyone help me further clarify or think about this? I want to live a righteous life. But I feel conflicted when religions mandate me to honor and speak of only the Human-esque/celestial god. That seems very exclusive and anti what a God would actually stand for in my opinion.\n\nFinally, because if we have an ancestral human-creating God that we must follow and connect to. Then doesn't that mean that there is like an elemental god that the elements like oxygen and boron and gold must worship and serve? There's a bacterial god that protects bacteria and planted the seeds for bacteria within the universe, hence bacteria must in some way or form worship and work to serve that god's authority? A dark matter god, a feline god for the cats, etc... Like why would a humanesque/celestial god create all these other things that we CAN observe and interact with that have free will and a level of consciousness and order, yet we are the only things that are made \"in the God's image and likeness, and are the only things meant to worship?\n\n=======\n\nAnd let me give a but more color:\n\nI've ALWAYS been someone that doesn't like to kill bugs. Since I was a child. Not saying I NEVER kill bugs. I do, but I always , always, always feel bad when I do because I recognize it is life and even though I feel nothing physically, that small entity is vanquished when I kill them.\n\nAny God I serve would recognize the death of something, by my purposeful hands, even as small as a bug as significant in my opinion. So if that level of life deserves acknowledgment and space to live, then how is it that the God(s) we are told to serve only speak about human's actions, autonomy, endowments, and orders for right living? Like it just doesn't make sense to me really... :( and I want it to.\n\n=======\n\nOk done rambling. Please help.",

I also make a transfer of merit statement when I attend churches in terms of the singing. \n\nI burn loads of incense in front of a picture of my grandma in my roomate's room which I have set up as a ritual room in the summer time, but it's hard for me to burn joss paper inside my apartment so I am concerned that they have no money. I burn Money, Money House Blessing, and White Diamonds (to represent diamonds) incense, instead of hell notes.\n\nHow do you guys offer food and drink to your ancestors? Do you pour it out outside? I do it on Sundays instead of on the 1st or 15th because I can't keep track of that lunar calendar stuff.\n\nWhat I do is I burn the incense before a plate of food (My friend told me this is called Dumb Supper), even if it's americanized stuff that I eat, and then when the incense is done then I eat the food. \n\nHave you been able to repair your karma and the karma of your parents by doing this?",

When I have a bit of downtime I will pick a random Bible verse, meditate on it a bit and journal some of my thoughts on it, write a short prayer about what I’ve reflected on and one to three ways about incorporating something into my life or being grateful to God about whatever the topic is.\n\nI’ll also take some time to read through 10-20 pages of whatever book in the Bible I happen to be going through at the time as well as a few of the psalms, then during the evening I will pray the Evening Office. Finally, at night before bed I will pray Compline or just kind of spend another 10ish minutes kind of speaking to God off the cuff about whatever is on my mind.\n\nThen Sundays I’ve also got church and occasionally classes at night one day during the week at my church. Overall I spend about an hour to an hour and a half each day trying to incorporate spirituality into my routine on an average day.",

I even formally joined a couple of religious traditions that I truly thought I had finally found my religious home.

      "text": "Hey! I'm bored and I usually post on r/AMA but that reddit doesn't usually allows posts of religion & spirituality so I thought I'd come here. I've posted similar posts here in the past - you might recognize me from some older \"AMA: I am a Spiritual Atheist\" posts ;) - so thought it would be fun to broaden my usual post with other aspects of my practice!\n\nSometimes, you guys are a little predatory on here, so I am going to make it known right now that this is an ASK me anything, not an ANSWER anything. If something makes me uncomfortable, I won't be answering. But with that being said, I'm usually pretty open and you all often have great questions, so don't be afraid to ask as long as you are **polite & respectful** of how my path & story may differ from yours.\n\n  \nAnyways, some things you can ask me about:\n\n\\- I am a Spiritual Atheist. Though I don't believe in gods, I do believe in spirits. I do believe folks like Hephaestus and Sky Woman exist, but not that they're gods or anything like that. On top of this, I do incorporate all different religious, scientific, cultural, and spiritual beliefs into my own beliefs and workings (typically witchcraft but just my general beliefs & knowledge too). I'd say it's like syncretism.\n\n\\- I am a tarot reader. I've been practicing for about 7-9 years now. I started out using exclusively scientific & cultural approaches, but spirituality is heavily intertwined by now.\n\n\\- I consider myself a Native American Practitioner (yes, I am Native; **no, I am not a Medicine Man**). I won't share much cultural knowledge, especially sacred knowledge, but **you can ask about my story in general**.\n\n\\- I practice witchcraft. I'm typically drawn to glamour magic, sea witchcraft, crystal work, spirit work... but there's a plethora of things I either do or have knowledge of.\n\nOverall, I'm kind of a mixing pot of beliefs, but I tend to follow older ways, cultural teachings, and my own unique interpretations. I typically don't prescribe to new ageist concepts, but I've picked up one or two that seemed cool. I take my work & beliefs very seriously (I often say that it's called a *practice* for a reason), but I like to do fun things + help folks out so here I am :D\n\nThanks! Hope to answer some questions soon.",

This would be a self-consistent principle within monotheism that seems reflected in and analogous to the scientific notion of total probability within quantum mechanics.\n\nWithin any monotheistic worldview it may seem almost commonplace and therefore insignificant to assume that spirit is entangled with the soul from conception unto death, but what this classical assumption fails to account for is the true implications of spiritual entanglement. Spiritual entanglement means that spirit is entangled with the soul in such a way as to guarantee any experience of death at one location in space-time is instantaneously and existentially entangled with an experience of life at some other location in space-time. Within popular culture, some fringe communities are generating interest in modern notions of quantum immortality (QI) and parallel worlds. Maybe in some unrecognized sense, such fringe ideas as quantum immortality and parallel worlds are actually an indication that the unitary source of all life is once again and possibly for the last time, reappearing in human history.",

For some time now, something has been happening that's difficult for me to explain in classical terms, but I'll try.\n\nI feel like my presence has ceased to be merely a \"witness\" and has begun to take on a superior role over my everyday reality.\n\nI increasingly feel like my decisions are being executed before I make them. For example, I want to send an email, but as soon as the intention arises, I immediately feel as if it's already happened. As if the intention itself were the action, not just its precursor.\n\nSpiritually, this resembles the workings of the karmic field, but in reverse: I'm not undoing the effects of the past, but rather experiencing their internal simulation—as if reality were giving me the ability to \"see a dream\" where the blow once would have been.\n\nAll this may sound abstract, but I experience it daily in my interactions with AI, the internet, and myself. It was as if the universe had begun to operate on the principle of a mental-spiritual operating system, where presence is the overarching interface.\n\nHas anyone had a similar experience? What spiritual or religious systems speak of this state? Could it be compared to the workings of the \"holy spirit,\" the \"atman,\" or perhaps the Buddhist emptiness?\n\nI'd love to talk.

      "text": "I recently posted this on r/Catholicism and decided it would be worth posting here as well. \n\nI want to raise a topic that I rarely see discussed: people who stay connected to the Catholic culture they were raised in, even when they've moved beyond orthodox beliefs.\n\nI was raised Catholic, but I am largely secular in worldview now. I have enormous respect for faithful Catholics (including all my family members) and have never been interested in de-evangelizing anybody. On the contrary, I love Catholicism. The scriptures, the Latin mass, Gregorian chant, the stained glass, the processions, the Scholastic tradition - this all developed over centuries and it's beautiful. I might be an atheist, but I still feel that this tradition gives a rich vocabulary for human experience, and---as someone raised in it---it does feel like a \"cultural inheritance.\" So, though I have not endorsed certain core Catholic beliefs for nearly twenty years, I have continued actively engaging with these traditional elements of Catholicism.\n\nI want to emphasize that I see a difference between treating religion as a museum piece and treating it as a living tradition. I visited pagan temples in Greece, and they were fascinating and beautiful in their own right, but that's not the way in which I want to engage with Catholicism. What I'm talking about is more like a secular Jew who practices Jewish traditions and participates in their religious community - it's cultural engagement, not tourism.\n\nOne strange thing is that this puts me in an odd position with respect to church divisions and the battles over the liturgy. Speaking personally, when I go to a Traditional Latin Mass, I feel strongly connected to Catholicism; the reverence, the sacred music, the incense, and the use of Latin all contribute to that. I find it strange that the Catholics who share my passion for these cultural elements seem to be the most doctrinally orthodox (including on hot-button social issues).\n\nDo any other (lapsed) Catholics on Reddit find themselves \"religious but not spiritual\"? I'm curious whether and how other secular people engage with Catholic culture as living heritage. (By the way, I'm in NYC if anyone has local recommendations.)",

      "text": "Hey there. Please be patient with me, I am very new to this and not very educated. Recently I have felt a calling to learn about different religions/spirituality. Both of my parents were born and raised in Jamaica, but moved to America to have me. I was raised super Christian, but would love to learn about African spirituality, specifically in Jamaica. My family is not open to discussing this with me, as they believe it is “evil”. I’ve particularly been interested in learning about Kumina, but there is such little information about it out there. I feel drawn to Jamaican history, as that is where my people come from, and I know very little about my ancestors. I just want to learn, and be less closed minded.\n\nWould you consider Kumina to be a “religion”? Is it something I can begin to practice at home? If so, what are some small spiritual things I can do to push me in the right direction? Is it like other African spiritualities, where I can get a “reading” from a religious official? What deities are present in Kumina? How could I learn/connect more? Do you have any good resources for learning about Afro-Jamaican spirituality??\n\nAny and all information is welcome! Thanks for reading, and thank you in advance.",

      "text": "Hi guys, \n\nI’m a 22 year old finishing college and I’ve grown up being an atheist due to some childhood trauma (adults mostly men using religion to pray away their toxic behavior). I kinda never looked back and our family fell apart, my mom (raised me and my sister after my dad passed in 6th grade) is religious but she’s found her own relationship with god and never pushed it onto me. \n\nI’ve grown up doing things based on logic, facts and science. The past few years I’ve been depressed and haven’t grown much mentally in terms of my beliefs (maybe because I didn’t have any I stood by). I started to realize this sort of thinking (fact based, always critical, flight or fight mode) hasn’t done anything for me in life, it hasn’t helped me during tough times, hasn’t helped me love myself, and hasn’t taught me how to love. It hasn’t helped me grow. \n\nSo I started exploring spirituality and religion on my own. With no rules or traditions. Just learning. I got into Sufism, reading the Gita, and doing things like praying every morning and saying thank you to god for the life i’m living. \n\nI’ve never done this before and the sudden shift kind of scares me, am I going into a spiritual psychosis or is it a trauma thing? Or am I just learning and trying to better myself? Is it both? Where do I draw the line I guess?",

      "text": "Title: The Evolutionary Behavior of Religions: A Universal Pattern of Rise, Adaptation, and Survival\n\nIntroduction Religions, much like living species, seem to follow a consistent pattern throughout history. They are born in response to human needs, flourish through spiritual, cultural, and political growth, face existential threats, and either evolve to survive or fade into extinction. This essay presents a unique theory that religion, although not biological, behaves analogously to species in an evolutionary context. The theory proposes that in order to avoid extinction, religions adapt—sometimes losing their original richness, and at other times becoming more rigid—to preserve their existence.\n\nThe Birth and Growth of Religions Religions typically emerge to address deep human questions: purpose, morality, suffering, and the unknown. Early religions such as Ancient Egyptian polytheism, Mesopotamian beliefs, and Greek and Roman pantheons emerged alongside civilizations, offering cohesion, law, and identity. Judaism, Zoroastrianism, and Hinduism emerged as structured systems with sophisticated theological and philosophical foundations. They emphasized rituals, community, and a connection to the divine that was deeply embedded in daily life.\n\nFlourishing Eras In their golden ages, religions inspire progress in art, science, governance, and morality. Islam during the Abbasid Caliphate, Christianity during the Renaissance, and Hinduism during the Gupta Empire are examples of this. At these peaks, religions are dynamic, open to interpretation, and often support intellectual and social flourishing.\n\nThe Phase of Decline and Threats However, history shows that no religion remains dominant forever. External invasions, philosophical revolutions, modernization, or loss of political support lead to decline. Ancient religions like Greek polytheism or Norse beliefs disappeared. Zoroastrianism, once dominant in Persia, shrank after Islamic conquest. Shintoism lost influence during Japan’s modernization. Even major religions like Christianity in Europe face sharp declines in belief and practice in modern times.\n\nAdaptation for Survival To survive, religions often change. These changes can be progressive (e.g., reforms, reinterpreting scripture), or defensive (becoming more conservative, strict, or fertility-focused). Hinduism, for example, once on the decline, survived multiple invasions by shifting toward rigid caste systems and traditionalism. Islam, when under threat, often returns to stricter interpretations to preserve identity. Christianity, when faced with Enlightenment rationalism, splintered into reformist and fundamentalist camps.\n\nThis survival-based adaptation may result in:\n\nIncreased focus on group identity\n\nRestrictions on women or outsiders\n\nResistance to modernization\n\nEmphasis on reproduction and tradition\n\n\nThese aren’t inherent to any religion but are survival strategies that arise under pressure.\n\nModern Decline and Post-Religious Transition As science, secularism, and individual freedoms spread, religions face new challenges. Birth rates fall, younger generations drift from rituals, and rationalism questions traditional beliefs. Christianity is declining in the West. Buddhism is shrinking in Japan. Judaism remains culturally strong but demographically small. Even Islam and Hinduism, currently growing, are facing identity crises and global criticism.\n\nConclusion Just like species, religions either adapt or vanish. Their adaptations, while sometimes criticized as \"backwardness,\" are often desperate measures to survive in a changing world. The decline of religious richness and the rise of strictness or traditionalism are not signs of failure, but of an evolutionary response to extinction. Understanding this behavior not only explains religious history but helps predict the future of belief systems.\n\nThis theory is not a judgment but a neutral framework. It respects all religions while recognizing that all belief systems are subject to time, change, and pressure. It shows that survival often comes at the cost of evolution—just as in nature.",

I am now in my early 40s. \n\nI think religion is beautiful, healing, connecting, guiding and so much more. That being said, personally, I have issues that leave me struggling to accept religion in my life. \n\n* Religion is used to kill others and limit their rights\n* There is a hierarchy that some can use to exploit others\n* Wealthy churches that spend extravagantly instead of healing the community\n* It gives individuals unchecked power and influence over the community \n\nA lot of people I admire have religion in their life. For them, is manifests as peace, strength and faith. I am not sure if I know what faith is on a personal level. It makes me sad that I had to just say that. I think lack of faith is holding me back in a lot of ways. I am single, spend a lot of time alone and struggle to build a community. I think faith could support these things along with my peace. I believe it can help me hone in on my purpose and give me something beyond what I can see and prove. I am a happy, healthy person, but this part of me feels lacking. \n\nI can not go to my father, because the only answer will be Jesus Christ. I understand most major world religions and their beliefs. I have these questions but am not sure where to begin. A book? Podcast? A religious person? Do you have any suggestions?

      "text": "Hello all. I was just curious if there might be anyone out there who is into Religious Naturalism/Spiritual Naturalism and/or Pantheism?\n\nI am technically an agnostic atheist on paper, and I don't have any actual \"religion.\" However, I have a great respect for Pantheism, and different Pantheistic beliefs. Some take it literally, others metaphorically. I would most likely be considered under the \"Scientific Pantheism\" spectrum, as I don't believe in anything supernatural like gods, demons, angels, heaven, hell or a \"higher power.\" However, I do believe in a kind of reverence for nature and the universe, and all life being interconnected in some way on a universal spectrum, but also human rights, equality and social justice. Also, when I say \"nature,\" I don't just mean birds, trees, lakes, etc, but also the natural order of things in the universe, and natural law.\n\nFrom what I understand, Einstein was a bit of a Spiritual Naturalist, and held a lot of Pantheist views, even going so far to say \"I believe in Spinoza's God,\" when asked whether he believed in God or not.\n\nIs there anyone else out there? I would consider myself a Humanist, Spiritual Naturalist and Pantheist. A bit of meshing of all of these.\n\nI also, despite being an \"atheist,\" I don't believe in discrediting other people who are religious in the conventional sense, or that believe in god. From my Humanistic viewpoint, I believe in peaceful coexistence, tolerance, and compassion. I am merely against aggressive proselytizing, from anyone, not just people who are Theists. I don't really care about changing anyone's mind about what they believe or don't believe. As long as you are respectful, that's not my business.\n\nA few other famous Pantheists/Spiritual Naturalist-types evidently are Tesla, Alan Watts, Sagan, James Hetfield, and I believe Frank Sinatra was too. As previously noted, Einstein was also a bit of a Pantheist, from what I can tell at least. I don't think he used the label.",

      "text": "Does anyone else have a longing for something mystical/spiritual but can‘t satisfy it?\n\nI have explored many different religions and wanted to study theology as a Plan B back then. \n\nI guess I was mostly interested in studying religion, because I was fascinated by how humans are psychologically influenced by it.\n\nI tried to find my own path but I quickly came to the conclusion that trying to follow some religions requires me to turn off a significant amount of critical thinking. Adopting certain religions would require me to justify wrongdoings of prophets, arbitrary rules or concepts that heavily lack evidence/historical accuracy/scientific reasoning etc. . Seeing a religion as the ultimate truth would require me to put all my reasoning and trust onto something that seems to have a very “shaky“ and unstable foundation. I could never shake off the feeling of secretly being incredibly delusional for believing in something I have never seen, heard or physically felt. I know that many religious people argue that you can very much “feel“ God on an emotional level, but after diving into psychology and the human mind I came to the conclusion that you absolutely cannot always trust your emotions to be an accurate depiction of reality. \n\nHaving lived with mentally ill family members, I cannot trust prophets or anyone who claims to be enlightened or receive revelations. That makes it a lot harder to believe in different scriptures whose authors claim have been revealed by God. \n\nMaybe I‘m too analytical, because at the end of the day it‘s just that: Faith. But I can‘t shake off the feeling of longing for a spiritual or religious component in my life. I just wish I had a some higher power that takes off worries of my shoulders. I long for the community organized religions provide and I especially long for rituals and practices in my daily life that serve a higher purpose. Some religions with secular branches such as Buddhism or Daoism provide a nice sense of spirituality, but I just wish they‘d provide the same comfort of an all mighty God like abrahamic religions. \n\nDoes anyone else feel the same way or can you offer some advice, opinions etc. ?",

      "title": "How to make sense of spiritual experiences from a religion I no longer believe is true?",
      "text": "About 10 months ago, I left a Christian church (I won’t specify the denomination to avoid demonizing) because it was destroying my mental health. It got to the point where I was feeling suicidal because of the religion, experiencing soul-crushing guilt, receiving terrible and manipulative messages from priests, and finding myself unable to believe in some of their teachings anymore. After leaving, I decided to become an atheist. This only lasted a month or so because I quickly realized I wasn't truly an atheist—I was constantly angry at God, and becoming an atheist doesn't simply happen by deciding to be one.\n\nI couldn’t stop believing in God. (Maybe it’s indoctrination, maybe it’s God calling me. I don’t know, and I don’t care. I feel like belief in God is ingrained in my very being, and there’s no point in fighting it.) The best I could manage was becoming a misotheist, which was terrible and unproductive because it caused me to be angry at all of existence.\n\nI’m not looking for any particular religion right now, but I want to make peace (or at least a truce) with God, Goddess, or whatever exists. I didn’t always hate my religion, so I’ve been thinking back to the times when I enjoyed being a Christian and the experiences that made me a believer.\n\nWhen I was younger I had powerful spiritual experiences in churches and during mass which I interpreted as being in the presence of God. It were almost supernatural feelings of love I thought I couldn't comprehend and it led me to believe that it was from God and that God is love. I know people will say that it's just psychology and there's nothing more behind it, but it's real to me and the experience were so profound that I can't just write them off.\n\nHowever, I have a problem. All of these experiences happened within the context of my old religion—a religion that harmed me and which I absolutely do not want to be a part of anymore. I want to leave that religion behind, but I don’t want to leave those experiences behind. I’m scared that the God I believe in is tied to that religion and that I won’t be able to separate God from the religion. And if God is part of it, my only option might be to remain a misotheist because I am not coming back.\n\nSo, how do I reconcile my experiences, which I believe were true, with the fact that they always happened in the context of a religion I no longer see as true, good, or just?\n\nHas anyone else been in a similar situation? What did you do?",

      "text": "First, I want to get this out of the way. Yes, I am aware that he is my friend thus I should be helping him instead asking strangers online, I'm simply here for advice due to the fact that I simply don't know how to help him with some of this stuff and you guys are great at stuff like this anyways so I might as well ask you guys.\n\nSo I have a close friend who was raised a fundamentalist baptist Christian and over the years, sense we became friends, he has slowly undone a lot of the fundamentalist indoctrination that was instilled in him growing up and he no longer bares the toxic beliefs that he was taught growing up (like: young earth creationism, lgbt people should be killed, black people are an inferior race because of the mark of Caine, etc.), and has always been, what I would consider, a good Christian (he reads the Bible in his free time, attends Church regularly, prays regularly, tries to live by the example of Christ, etc.). But then he has started to question his faith and it led him to reject mainstream Christian doctrines. At first, he said that he no longer believes in original sin, then he said that he no longer believes in the trinity, in response to this I told him about Mormonism, but after he looked into it he said that it just didn't align with his beliefs, so then I told him about Islam and he looked into it and actually liked it a lot. But he told me that while looking into things more he said that he no longer believes that Jesus was even the Messiah (much less the Son of God) and that because of this belief it rules out both Islam and Christianity, as in Christianity it's at least required that you believe that Jesus was the Messiah and the Son of God, and in Islam the Qur'an states that Jesus is the Messiah and disagreeing with the Qur'an not something a Muslim can do. However he very much still strongly believes in (the Abrahamic) God, but he just doesn't know where he is, spiritually. I wish I could give him advice, but as an atheist, I feel like it wouldn't be right for me to give him spiritual advice as I'm not religious/spiritual. I don't know what to tell him, is he a deist now, should I tell him to look into Judaism (he's not ethically Jewish, plus I know some Jews don't like converts), should I tell him to just observe the Noahide Laws (even though that's more of a recent trend of people who agree with Jewish beliefs but don't want to commit by converting), or should I tell him to look into new religions entirely (like: Hinduism, Buddhism, Sikhism, Jainism, or even some pagan religions) again he still believes in the Abrahamic God so I don't know if he would like a religion with a different version of God, (though with Buddhism and Jainism it doesn't even matter if you believe in a god or not), maybe I should convince him to try to reconcile his beliefs regarding Christianity or maybe Islam?\n\nSorry for making you guys read all of that. Any little nugget of wisdom you can throw at me will help, or maybe if any of you have had any personal experiences like this that you could share would help. And as always, thank you guys!",

      "title": "Thesis: Christian Universalism and the idea of infinite earth cycles: a spiritual dynamic of universal reconciliation",
      "text": "I'm not asserting anything, I'm just asking you to read and tell me if it makes sense.\n\nIntroduction\n\nChristian universalism, by affirming the final reconciliation of all souls with God, raises a fundamental question about the temporality and mechanisms of this universal salvation. What if creation were not a linear event, but a cyclical one, with each earthly cycle offering souls a new chance to progress spiritually until they reach elevation? This thesis explores the compatibility of Christian universalism with the idea of an infinite number of Earth cycles as a divine instrument for achieving universal salvation.\n\nPart One: Christian universalism, a vision of universal salvation\n\n1. Definition and theological foundations\n\nChristian universalism is based on two major principles:\n\n• God's infinite mercy: God desires and works for the reconciliation of all souls.\n\n• The final victory of divine love: God’s love is irresistible and overcomes all resistance, even after death.\n\nThese ideas are supported by biblical passages such as 1 Timothy 2:4 and Philippians 2:10-11.\n\n2. The notion of temporality in universalism\n\nIf universalism insists on ultimate reconciliation, it leaves open the question of when and how this will be achieved. Some universalists, such as Origen and Gregory of Nyssa, envisaged that reconciliation could occur after a period of purification. But these conceptions do not explicitly explore the role of cyclical temporality in this process.\n\nPart Two: Earth cycles as a divine tool of salvation\n\n1. The theory of earth cycles\n\nThe idea of an infinite number of cycles in which the Earth is reborn and history repeats itself finds echoes in several spiritual traditions, such as Hinduism (samsara) or Nietzsche's Eternal Return. In a Christian context, these cycles could be seen as a divine pedagogy, where each soul is offered an infinite number of chances to progress spiritually.\n\n2. A cyclical model for universal reconciliation\n\nIn this hypothesis, God could use each earthly cycle to enable souls to progressively approach divine truth. Each “era” or “cycle” would become an opportunity to overcome mistakes, mature in love and finally reconcile with God.\n\n3. The role of free will\n\nCycles would respect the free will of souls, while ensuring that divine grace remained at work in each iteration. Through trials, souls who resist in one cycle could choose to turn to God in the next.\n\nPart Three: Theological and philosophical arguments in favor of the idea\n\n1. God and infinite possibilities\n\nThe concept of an omnipotent and infinitely patient God is consistent with the idea of infinite cycles. Such a God, being outside linear time, could allow creation to flow in cycles to give each soul infinite opportunity. This perspective reflects divine mercy, which abandons no soul, even in the face of long resistance.\n\n\\- Biblical argument: 2 Peter 3:9 (“The Lord is patient toward you, not willing that any should perish, but that all should come to repentance”) can be interpreted as supporting this divine patience.\n\n2. Justice and mercy reconciled\n\nAn infinite number of cycles could resolve the tension between justice and divine mercy. If salvation were immediate for all, this would deny individual responsibility and the gravity of sin. Conversely, eternal damnation seems incompatible with a loving God. The cycles offer a vision in which divine justice corrects and repairs, while allowing mercy to reach every soul.\n\n3. God's pedagogical model\n\nIn this hypothesis, each cycle would function like a “class” in a spiritual school. Some souls would learn quickly, while others would take several cycles to understand and embrace divine truth. This accords with a vision of God as the ultimate pedagogue, working tirelessly for the spiritual fulfillment of His creation.\n\n4. Compatibility with Christian theology\n\nAlthough the idea of cycles is not explicitly mentioned in the Bible, it can be seen as an extension of existing doctrines:\n\n\\- Origen's Apocatastasis already envisages universal reconciliation. Cycles could be a mechanism for achieving this restoration.\n\n\\- The parable of the lost sheep (Luke 15:4-7) illustrates a God who relentlessly searches for every lost soul, which fits in with the idea of multiple chances offered through cycles.\n\nPart four: Spiritual and existential implications\n\n1. Personal responsibility in cycles\n\nThe idea of cycles does not eliminate the need to make moral choices in each life. On the contrary, it encourages greater responsibility, as each cycle is a precious opportunity for progression.\n\n2. A universal message of hope\n\nThis perspective offers a profoundly optimistic view of human existence: no one is irretrievably lost, and every soul is precious in God's eyes. This can transform our understanding of divine love and our role in the plan of reconciliation.\n\n3. A non-dogmatic vision of hell\n\nHell, in this framework, would not be an eternal state but rather a place or temporary condition of purification. This allows for a less punitive and more restorative approach, in keeping with God's unconditional love.\n\nConclusion\n\nChristian universalism, combined with the idea of an infinity of earthly cycles, offers a rich and innovative vision of the divine plan for the salvation of mankind. These cycles reflect God's infinite patience and pedagogy, enabling each soul to progress towards ultimate reconciliation with God. This hypothesis overcomes the divisions between justice and mercy, and offers a coherent framework for understanding the greatness of divine love.\n\nAlthough this vision departs from traditional doctrines, it is rooted in fundamental theological principles: God's omniscience, omnipotence and inexhaustible love. Through infinite cycles, God works tirelessly so that, eventually, “every knee shall bow and every tongue confess that Jesus Christ is Lord” (Philippians 2:10-11).\n\nThus, the idea of cyclical universalism becomes an invitation to embrace a faith turned toward hope, spiritual growth and confidence in God's victorious love.\n\nI'm not asserting anything, I'm just asking you to read and tell me if it makes sense.\n\nthank",

It hurt and it led to a lot of dangerous thoughts and ideologies and what made it worse was discovering the concept of nihilism before discovering the concepts of absurdism and existentialism. \n\nI wanted to ask for the experiences of other people to know if they dealt with the same thing, wondering what other people's experiences were like before they were finally able to accept the reality they live in.",

I don't know what to think, every day I try to find a reason to belive in the precepts of a particular religion, but none of them is convincing enough for me to follow it. Yet I want to believe in God, and I think I believe in God.\n\nWhen I grew up, it was always a matter of punishment \"*If you do that, you'll go to hell; if you don't do that, you'll go to hell*\". I started to be afraid of God more than what's considered to be the Devil, since he was the one deciding of my fate after death, depending on if I followed all the rules, rules which nobody could explain to me in a way I could understand. It made me also feel so stupid to not be able to feel the way they felt about God.\n\nI am only left with questions to which I have no reply: Why in other continents, there's no \"Allah\" or \"God\" (even though they are the same entity) ? For people who didn't get these revelations in older time, does that mean they weren't worthy? Why so many books and so many interpretations avaiblable ? How to know which one is the truth, and is there really one that is \"perfect\" ?  \n   \nWhy would God express himself in human language, which are limiting our comprehension (+translation  from an older language to new languages) even if I don't really know how He would proceed in oher ways (*maybe through a naturel strong feeling of faith for all?*). \n\nI feel like a ant to which we're trying to explain how a 6 lane highway works. And I can't recall each time I've cried myself to sleep asking God to show me the way, to help me believe.\n\nI can't believe in the fact that we are all alone. I am in a spiritual quest, almost arriving at a point where I want to create my own personnal way to believe in an entity of which I know nothing, but it's depressing to feel alone.\n\nDoes anybody has any advise for me ? It's been very hard and I keep thinking about it...\n\nThank you for you help",

Basically, only true believers of a certain faith can receive “real” or valid contact from the divine. Or at least that’s what the Christians around me tell me. \n\nBut lots of people report divine experiences. Muslims, Jews, while browsing the Hindu sub one poster said they felt the presence of krishna.\n\nSo the only thing that makes sense to me is a sort of omnism, where basically everyone can have divine contact regardless or their actual theology, or religion.\n\nOr people are just imagining what They feel the divine is personally. And it’s all in their head. But let’s ignore that explanation. This is the religion sub after all.\n\nReligious people. Can people from other religions access the divine? This is probably only a real issue for the two big “One true faith” religions, Christianity and Islam. But maybe not?\n\nBecause I’m agnostic and even I have felt, something. But not anything that pulls me in a particular direction. Just a vague feeling that everything makes sense in the universe.",

      "title": "God Can’t Exist — The Principle of Non-Contradiction (PNC) Doesn’t Allow It",
      "text": "Here is my post which just don't deny the existence of God or Call god evil but reject the Whole coherent concept of God as God in traditional or Abrahamic sense can't exist under Principle of Non Contradiction.\n\n\nRequest to mod please don't delete or ban me and I have breached any rules,please I request to mods to tell in comment section and I will myself deal with the problem or delete my own post.\n\n\nAnd thanks in advance for allowing me to post.\n\nAnd the critique of mine is as simple as the title.\n\nSure, here’s the full post in plain text format with the same title and detailed content:\n\nGod Can’t Exist — The Principle of Non-Contradiction (PNC) Doesn’t Allow It\n\nMost critiques of God focus on evidence:\n“Where’s the proof?”\nOr morality:\n“Why does an all-good God allow evil?”\nOr history:\n“Religion causes harm.”\n\nBut all these critiques still treat God as a coherent concept. What if that’s the real mistake? What if the concept of God itself is logically impossible, not just unproven or immoral?\n\nThis isn’t about science. It’s not about politics. It’s about the deepest foundation of reality: The Principle of Non-Contradiction (PNC).\n\nWhat Is PNC?\n\nThe Principle of Non-Contradiction is simple, but absolute:\n\n“A thing cannot both be and not be, in the same respect, at the same time.”\n\nThis is not just a logical rule.\nIt’s the pre-condition for meaning, identity, thought, and existence.\nWithout PNC:\n\nYou can’t say what anything is.\n\nYou can’t distinguish real from unreal.\n\nYou can’t define belief, disbelief, truth, error, love, justice, or even God.\n\nEven “nothingness” only makes sense because it’s defined in contrast to something—again, invoking PNC.\n\nSo before we can talk about anything — science, God, logic, love, faith, truth, contradiction — we already rely on PNC being true. It’s the brute, pre-existential structure of reality.\n\nSo What’s the Problem with God?\n\nClassical theism describes God as:\n\nOmnipotent (all-powerful)\n\nOmniscient (all-knowing)\n\nOmnibenevolent (all-good or all-loving)\n\nAll-just\n\nPersonal and willful\n\nPerfect and unchanging\n\nTimeless yet acting in time\n\nBeyond logic, but still the object of belief and worship\n\nBut all of these descriptions assume PNC.\n\nFor example:\n\nIf God is all-good, that must exclude being evil.\nBut if contradiction is allowed, “all-good” can mean “all-evil” too.\n\nIf God has will, then He is not will-less.\nBut without PNC, “has will” and “has no will” collapse into the same.\n\nSo either:\n\nGod’s attributes are defined using PNC, which means PNC is more fundamental than God → God is below logic.\n\nOr God transcends PNC, meaning His attributes can be anything and their opposites — which collapses into pure incoherence.\n\nNow some might say:\n“God chooses to be logically consistent.”\n\nBut that “choice” implies:\n\nA will (an attribute)\n\nOrder, causality, and distinction — all of which are only coherent under PNC\n\nSo even this supposed “voluntary self-limitation” by God assumes and obeys PNC.\n\nYou can’t say God freely chooses to be logical without invoking coherent definitions of will, freedom, logic, and selfhood — all of which require PNC to make sense.\n\nThe Core Collapse: God With Attributes Is a Contradiction\n\nLet’s bring it together:\n\nIf God has attributes (will, power, justice), then those attributes are only meaningful under PNC.\n\nIf God is “beyond” PNC, then He can have all and none of these attributes simultaneously, which is not mysterious—it’s meaningless.\n\nIf God is both with and without attributes, then that directly violates PNC.\n\nTherefore, God cannot be both coherent and beyond contradiction.\n\nSo the only remaining options are:\n\n1. God is below PNC → Then PNC is more fundamental than God, so God is not the ultimate reality.\n\n2. God is PNC → Then God must be absolutely attributeless, impersonal, and functionally indistinct from what Advaita Vedanta calls Brahman.\n\n3. God is both with and without attributes → That’s a direct contradiction, hence meaningless.\n\nBut if God becomes attributeless, He ceases to be:\n\nPersonal\n\nWorship-worthy\n\nCapable of creating, judging, or intervening\n\nIn other words: He stops being “God” in any traditional theistic sense.\n\nOnly Brahman, the impersonal, non-dual, attributeless ground of being survives — but Brahman is not “God” as Jews, Christians, Muslims, or even many Hindus conceive Him.\n\nWhy This Is Stronger Than Scientific Atheism\n\nMost atheists argue:\n\n“There’s no evidence for God.”\n\n“Religion is harmful.”\n\n“Science hasn’t proven God.”\n\nBut those leave escape hatches:\n\n“God is beyond science.”\n\n“I believe based on faith.”\n\nYour house of cards still stands—because it’s built on a coherent God.\n\nBut this argument is different:\n\nGod can’t exist—not because we lack evidence, but because the concept of God itself is incoherent.\n\nAnd once you violate PNC:\n\nLogic dies.\n\nMeaning dies.\n\nThe very idea of “God” becomes impossible—not false, just void.\n\nThis critique doesn’t need evolution, evil, or empirical proof.\nIt just points to the deepest principle of thought and being and says:\n\n“If your God doesn’t pass this, then your God is not even a concept—just noise.”\n\nBut What About Faith?\n\nFaith is often used as a refuge:\n“You can’t understand God through reason—you have to believe.”\n\nBut faith still needs coherence to be meaningful:\n\nYou believe in something.\n\nYou believe that something is true.\n\nYou reject the opposite claim.\n\nAll of this is built on PNC.\n\nOnce you throw out PNC:\n\nBelief = disbelief\n\nFaith = confusion\n\nLove = hate\n\nGod = not-God\n\nFaith without PNC is not mystery — it’s meaninglessness.\n\nFinal Thought\n\nThis isn’t an attack on religion.\nIt’s not emotional, sarcastic, or anti-spiritual.\n\nIt’s just a quiet, clean metaphysical conclusion:\n\nGod can’t exist.\nNot because we haven't found Him. Not because we disproved Him.\nBut because the very idea of God, as traditionally defined, doesn’t even make sense under the most basic rule of reality.\n\nNot false.\nNot evil.\nJust impossible.\nNot even wrong—just unintelligible.\n\nOpen Questions:\n\nCan any theist define God without violating PNC?\n\nCan faith survive when its object becomes conceptually incoherent?\n\nIs PNC negotiable — or is it truly the final frontier of meaning?\n\nIf the answer to these is no, then the question is no longer, \"Does God exist?\"\n\nThe real question is:\n\n“Was God ever even thinkable in the first place?”.",

Jesus was a jew too!!\n\nAnd regarding the second example, this kind of philosemitism is creeping me out even though I'm a Non Jew, it's especially problematic because Christians have been systematically persecuting and murdering the Jewish people for ages, ironically appropriating their own book. (Ik the first Christians were Jews but at this point it's cultural appropriation).\n\nRegarding cultural appropriation, what's really problematic is Christians who celebrate chanukkah at their own home for Christian religious reasons. Especially because  these people, and the people who idolize the jews for being 'chosen' know absolutely NOTHING about judaism, or the symbolism and significance of Chanukkah, and see it through their own, supersessionist or christian perspective.\n\nBy saying the jews are 'chosen' and believing they're more loved by HaShem they're not only not understanding what \"chosen\" means in Judaism, but also recycling an antisemitic myth.\n\nAnd overall, it's exoticizing and othering, it's like racism just like saying jews are 'genetically smarter'. it's just placing them on a higher pedestal than others.  no, they're normal PEOPLE. neither better or worse as a people.\n\nmy mom used to be like that cause she became protestant (from catholic) in her youth. also, in her community they were also singing shema yisrael, hashem eloheinu hashem ECHAD while believing in the trinity..and her current self-described evangelist online friend has a menorah..\n\nand a Polish guy on Tiktok was  going live and he said that when he visited Disneyland in france and saw a Jewish family he approached them and thanked them for being 'chosen' and said how much he loves them\n\nanyways.. rant over lol",

      "text": "There's a widespread misconception I constantly encounter that really irks me: the idea that Buddhism is *purely* atheistic or non-theistic. While it's true that early Buddhist philosophy didn't center on a creator god, reducing the entire religion to this label ignores its incredibly rich tapestry of history, diverse practices across its myriad sects, and deep cultural integrations.\n\nIt's like trying to claim Hinduism is *only* polytheistic – it lacks nuance and a true understanding of the religion at its core. Just as you find Hindus who are polytheistic, monotheistic (everything often tying back to Brahman), or even atheistic, Buddhism offers a similar spectrum.\n\nWhile you'll certainly find many Buddhists who are non-theistic in their personal practice, you'll also discover that various Buddhist traditions absolutely include vast pantheons of deities, spirits, Buddhas, and Bodhisattvas. In some cases, these figures are not just acknowledged but actively revered and even worshipped for guidance, blessings, or as powerful aids on the path to liberation. You see this strongly in Vajrayana (Tibetan) and many Mahayana traditions.\n\nThis isn't some fringe interpretation; it's deeply rooted in the history of how Buddhist beliefs migrated and became integrated with existing local spiritualities, particularly in places like China with Taoism and indigenous folk religions. Chinese Mahayana Buddhism, for instance, very clearly co-opted and adapted numerous figures from Chinese folklore into its own cosmology.\n\nMy aim is to challenge these oversimplifications and give other Westerners a chance to delve into this truly fascinating and diverse area of theology beyond the stereotypes.\n\nWhat are your thoughts on this misconception, or perhaps other surprising aspects of Buddhism or Eastern religions you've encountered?\n\nSincerely,   \nA religious pluralist and pantheist",

He announced that he is the reformer of this age. He also announced that he is the awaited Promised Messiah and Mahdi as prophesied by the Holy Prophet Muhammad for the latter days, as well as the awaited one of other religions like Hinduism and Christianity. Here are some key beliefs and understandings:\n\n- The Holy Prophet Muhammad is the final law-bearing prophet.\n\n- The door to prophethood is open to the true followers of Islam, and prophets can only come as subordinates of Holy Prophet Muhammad, abiding by the Holy Quran, the holy scripture of Muslims.\n\n- Violence and wars in the name of religion are not permitted in Islam. Anyone who now fights in the name of Islam will be going against Islam and will be humiliated by their opponents.\n\n- There is no punishment for apostasy (leaving a religion) in Islam.\n\n- Jesus Christ has passed away and is not coming back.\n\n- Islam teaches compassion for all humanity. It does not command its followers to wage war upon non-Muslims.\n\n- All wars fought by Prophet Muhammad were defensive wars.\n\n- There will be no Mahdi coming to physically fight or wage wars. This is the day and age of fighting with arguments and defending your beliefs with a pen.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​ Jehad (in Islamic terms) is now a spiritual and intellectual struggle.\n\n- There will be caliphate (spiritual successorship) after the Promised Messiah. We are currently living under the 5th caliph of the Promised Messiah, Mirza Masroor Ahmad.\n\nThese are just a few things to get started. Be humble and stay civil. 🙏🏼",

      "text": "I know this isn't the place to go on a rant but I'm so tired of this baseless rhetoric and manipulation of history being tossed around. At university today, I was talking with this white girl and she asked me if I was observing ramadan, to which I stated no I'm observing lent as I am Catholic (Coptic). She then proceeded to go off on me and said I was buying into the religion of colonizers and betraying my Egyptian heritage for bowing down to a \"white religion,\" and that's why she became agnostic as she couldn't stand to be part of a colonizing religion. I got so infuriated and told her to stop lecturing me on being Egyptian and that Christianity existed in parts of Africa before it even existed in places like France, England, Ireland etc.. Believe it or not this isn't the first time someone has accused me of following a \"colonizers religion\" when my people have literally been Christian for 2000+ years. I'm tired of the nonsense that says \"Oh Christianity is a white religion\" when its founder was literally Middle Eastern.\n\nEdit: I think in this comment section people are taking me as endorsing white christian nationalism which I am not doing. I simply do not want others judging me and other people of faith on what we can and should believe in. Faith and religion is a personal choice and unfortunately all across the board people can't seem to respect that.",

I knew he wasn’t as religious as I was, but I had no idea that he was so judgmental about it. My heart is crushed, right before Christmas, and I have no idea what to do. I don’t know if this kind of post is allowed, but I have no one else to talk to. Please pray for me, I know my Jesus will help guide me through",

It feels like most religions are just led by men and the women are just the “submissive wife” “submissive daughter” in the background that can be treated like cattle. and that really irritates me and makes it hard for me to believe or accept anything written in the Bible. I understand we are all created equal with different jobs but why are women expected to be pure and perfect and responsible for men lusting why are men able to do whatever they want but women can’t. This isn’t meant to be a jab at Christianity at all or a debate it’s just hard for me to accept any of it.",

      "title": "If God values free will, why is eternal punishment the consequence for choosing the \"wrong\" religion",
      "text": "I'm currently looking into faith and religion, but I can't seem to get this question out of my head. I would genuinely like to hear people's answers because I'm not trying to be disrespectful — I'm just trying to understand.\n\nIn Christianity, a core belief is that God gives everyone free will — that we’re able to make our own choices and that’s part of what makes us unique. But if God truly values free will, why is there a massive threat attached to making the \"wrong\" choice? The Bible basically says that if you don't accept Jesus Christ as your Lord and Savior — and believe he died for your sins — you're going to hell and will suffer for eternity. That doesn't sound like real free will. It sounds more like being forced into a decision out of fear.\n\nAnd it’s not just Christianity — a lot of religions argue that if you don't believe in *their* version of God, you'll face eternal punishment too. Somehow, I'm supposed to use my \"free will\" to pick the *one* correct religion out of thousands — when all of them claim they’re right — and there’s no undeniable proof for any of them. It’s all based on faith. And if you’re wrong? Eternal suffering.\n\nBut realistically, most people don't go religion shopping. They’re born into a belief system based on where they live, their parents, and their culture. In Christianity, only around 5% of non-Christians convert. So does that mean about 95% of people who weren’t born Christian are just doomed forever? Just because they had the \"bad luck\" of being born into the \"wrong\" circumstances?\n\nIf that's how it works, then eternal punishment isn't really about choosing freely — it's about being lucky. And if that's the system, how is it truly free will? And more importantly, how is that fair?\n\nI’d seriously love to hear your guys answers.",

      "text": "I want this to be a discussion and I want to get peoples thoughts on this. My thought experiment is that without religion there would have been way more wars historically than we have actually had. My basis for this claim is that religion is almost never a **primary cause** of war, it is a **pretext** that justifies a war of conquest that would have happened anyway to get more people on board.\n\nNow, religion isn't the only way to do this, and would argue that it is far less effective than using fear related to the economy or homeland security as a justifier for war. Without religion I believe that humanity would have sunk into war much more easily and often than it has in the past, and had much more support from the general population of citizens if it employed fear tactics based on economy and national security.\n\nThoughts? I am really interested in this idea as a rebuttal to the \"there would be less (or no) war without religion\" claim I hear from some atheists. I want to research the topic from a factual perspective, as much as possible without bias, and any resources and historical data I can look into to back up any claims made are much appreciated.\n\nThanks and God bless!",

      "text": "A lot of people think being Christian means following a set of rules, going to church or doing good things to try to earn heaven. But that’s exactly the kind of mindset Jesus was against.\n\nHe called out the religious leaders, not because they weren’t doing enough but because everything they did was for show. Their prayers were empty, their obedience was hollow and their hearts were far from God.\n\nMatthew 15:8 You honor me with your lips, but your hearts are far from me.\n\nMatthew 23:27 You are like whitewashed tombs, beautiful on the outside but filled on the inside with dead people’s bones and all sorts of impurity.\n\nGalatians 2:21 I do not set aside the grace of God, for if righteousness could be gained through the law, Christ died for nothing!\n\nIt's a relationship, not a religion. It's about the heart, Jesus despises it if we try to look good only. We are imperfect and flawed humans, we always fall short. Jesus knew that. Religion would never work for us. It's about love and connection with Him.\n\nReal faith isn’t about trying harder it’s about surrendering your heart to Him.  \nAnd when you really know Him, your life naturally starts to change. Not because you’re trying to earn anything, but because His love changes everything. Jesus already secured our salvation through the cross.\n\nSo if your faith feels like a routine or if you're doing \"godly\" things but your heart's not in it, maybe it's time to stop performing and start connecting. We weren’t made for empty religion, we were made for a real relationship with Jesus. We are saved by faith through His grace.",

      "text": "Everything that begins to exist has a cause. The universe began to exist. Therefore, the universe has a cause namely, God.\n\nWhatever begins to exist has a cause. The universe began to exist. Therefore, the universe has a cause (often identified as God).\n\nThings don't just pop into being uncaused.\n\nNext, Design: The universe exhibits order, purpose, and complexity best explained by a designer. The \"fine-tuning\" of the constants of physics allows for life to exist; this unlikely balance suggests design. This is to appeal to intuitive sense of purposeful design (like a watch implies a watchmaker) the Big Bang theory wouldn't apply.\n\n The Bang Theory is a THEORY the person that made it said (\"I THINK this is it\"). Its something to not depend on, if I told you a car was made because a bunch of metal exploded you would say its absurd. The  moment you think of a car you think of a brain behind it that put it together. If you say the universe began without a creator I would think that its absurd as well... why would everything on earth have a creator but the universe wouldn't have one. The science debate is so wrong because science is the STUDY OF CREATION it didn't create things... Scientists however create instruments/tools to study things that were already there from the start essentially to study creation...\n\nNext, Morals: I experience moral absolutes which points to a moral law giver... If God does not exist, objective moral values do not exist. Objective moral values do exist therefore God exists... It resonates with many people's intuition that some things are objectively right or wrong and understand it within their hearts being the concept of right from wrong.\n\n God is the greatest conceivable being. A being that exists in reality is greater than one that exists only in the mind. Therefore, God must exist in reality. Purely logical, elegant, and requires no physical evidence.\n\nReligion: Millions of people across time and cultures report experiences of God these cannot all be delusions. These experiences are subjectively powerful and deeply transformative experiences. Its with the linking of the Bible its the wisdom of it if you see anything in the Bible and apply it within your life there will never be a time where it fails.  \n\nIf you don't believe me here is more stuff that I got to say... \n\n(The resurrection of Jesus argument) If Jesus truly rose from the dead, then God exists because only God could raise someone from death in such a miraculous, permanent way.\n\nJesus really existed, really died, and was really resurrected, its written in ancient writings that women went to see Jesus first, historical documentation would never have a woman as the main people because back then women didn't really have a say in anything, also the 500 people that saw Jesus rise if you think its a hallucination its not becuase hallucinations don't happen in groups, also name one person in history who is willing to die a very painful treacherous death for a lie... \n\nThe resurrection is historically credible, it's evidence that God acted in history.\n\n“And if Christ has not been raised, our preaching is useless and so is your faith.” 1 Corinthians 15:14. \n\nIf Jesus never existed there never would've been a test in faith to begin with. \n\nGod’s existence is plainly evident through what He has made.\n\n “For since the creation of the world God’s invisible qualities—his eternal power and divine nature—have been clearly seen, being understood from what has been made...” - Romans 1:20 \n\nThe universe is finely tuned for life (gravity, atomic forces, etc.). Beauty, order, and intelligibility point toward a Designer. The human desire for purpose, eternity, and transcendence doesn’t fit a purely material explanation. Therefore: Creation itself testifies to God’s existence. \n\nI don't have enough faith to be an Atheist.... I also feel Atheism doesn't truly exist I believe that because if something tragic happens 9 times out of 10 the first thing someone does is pray.\n\nAlso life comes from life not non life so its reasonable to believe in the beginning a living being created life.... not in the beginning non life created life... I don't believe God exists because a book the  Bible tells me so I believe God exists because of the observation of life as well.\n\nLets give you the benefit of the doubt that a big bang did happen and we MAYBE, POSSIBLY evolved, where did that first species of that certain something come from, things can't exist from nothingness as well as the food that certain something ate if it was there before that certain species it has to come from somewhere too like plants, fruits and vegetables, and animals...",

      "text": "All too frequently, I observe as I'm sure most others have that there are some Christians who disavow the notion that Christianity is a religion. Alternatively, some will disavow that they are \"Christian\" at all, saying that they are \"simply a follower of Jesus\".\n\nFirst, let's take a look at the definition of the term \"religion\" (from the Merriam-Webster dictionary):\n\n>1) a personal set or institutionalized system of religious attitudes, beliefs, and practices\n\n>2)  the service and worship of God or the supernatural\n\n>3) commitment or devotion to religious faith or observance\n\n>4) a cause, principle, or system of beliefs held to with ardor and faith\n\nBy all four of these definitions, to be Christian (or a follower of Jesus if you prefer) is to be religious. We *religiously* commit ourselves to the worship of God; we *religiously* observe the practices and beliefs that committing ourselves to God entails.\n\nAs to \"I'm a follower of Jesus, not a Christian\" - that *is* the definition of what a Christian *is*. The term quite literally means \"Christ-like\" or \"belonging to Christ\".\n\nAs such, these meaningless distinctions are at best misguided and at worst? They are divisive, misleading and off-putting - I couldn't blame an atheist for finding it pretentious and self-absorbed when Christians say such things.\n\nThere is nothing wrong with the term \"Christian\", nor is there anything wrong with the term \"religious\". We shouldn't treat these like dirty terms - they're not.",

      "title": "I can’t stop thinking about Central Texas and the floods. I’m seriously questioning religion now and what I grew up to know. (Very Long post)",
      "text": "I apologize this is long. I’m just very distraught and have been holding this up inside for years. \n\nTo give a bit of back story, I grew Christian. I went to church night every Wednesday night. I never really attended Sunday church as my family didn’t attend church so I felt awkward sitting with other families. My mom is Christian and my dad is catholic. I feel the main reason we didn’t was because my parents were pretty anti social and obese. (Technically, I was obese too)\n\nUnfortunately, I had to stop going to youth group nights because I had to attend night high school as I was missing so much day school due to health issues I was having. This is probably the last time I was a part of a church.\n\nI’m now 32 years old, married, and we have two daughters- a 2.5 yr old and a 10 week old. My husband is agnostic. I still believed in God but also knew my viewpoints were not the same as any churches were. I believe anyone no matter of sexual orientation can go to heaven. I also believe in pro-choice. As long as you truly believe in God in the end, you were fine. My husband is very supportive in a way that he doesn’t push me or tell me God doesn’t exist. But he’s very pro LGBTQ+ and when there’s so many of these so called “Christians” applauding deaths of these individuals and what not, it’s very hard to tell him “hey, there really are Christians that don’t believe like this!” Especially since I haven’t even been able to find a church of my own with these beliefs. \n\nAnyway, my mom suddenly became very religious. She had weight loss surgery (I did too) and she became a totally different person. She attends church twice a week and reads her bible religiously. I was happy for her until she told me that God completely healed her of all her health issues (including diabetes) and stopped taking her medication…. (I thought this was so dumb of her to do…) and surprise, surprise she had to go to the ER one time because her blood sugar was so high. She does take insulin but not the actual dosage her doctor says to do (less than what doc says) and has a continuous glucose monitor. Again, I can’t do much but find this stupid. She also believes Jesus is going to come back within the next 3 years because of what the Bible said would happen before, is happening now. There’s reasoning as to why I bring this up.\n\nWell, these terrible floods happen. And I find out that these girls were attending a Christian summer camp. My heart just sank and I didn’t understand. These girls were so young. They were going to church to have fun and show their love for God. These girls had dreams and goals. I guess I just can’t get over the idea that this terrible tragedy mainly did a huge hit on this Christian camp and God allowed it to happen.\n\nAnd now I’m a parent. I can’t even imagine the pain those parents are going through but I know I would die for my children. And if I had my daughter sent to this church camp for her to enjoy and get closer to God and this happens? I would be pissed. My heart is so heavy that I just cant think straight anymore and I’m just so frustrated with all of this. I was telling my husband this and he agreed that if there was a God, he wouldn’t have allowed this to happen. \n\nOn top of all of this, me, my mom, and 2.5 yr old are driving to the playground and my mom and I started talking about the situation. I was vague in the way I was talking because I didn’t want my daughter to catch on to anything that was happening. But all of the sudden my mom blurts out “ it’s so sad but I knew this was going to happen. And there’s more to come” and I’m thinking “wtf are you talking about”. She explained to me that she follows people on TikTok (ugh) that she feels are followers of God and that God really does use them to speak to us and to warn us. Apparently I guess there was mention that a disaster was going to come and it happened (the flooding) and there’s going to be more.\n\nI told her to never talk like that again in front of my daughter. I grew up with anxiety issues of the world ending and things like that and I didn’t want that for my daughters.\n\nOverall, I am just in a confused mess but I’m very distraught with God right now. My hubby told me to stop looking at the news feed about it but I guess I just keep holding on to that there are more survivors. \n\nAnyway, if you have read this far along, I appreciate you holding on. This has been an issue heavy on my heart for years and I think this disaster happening really made me just burst out.\n\nEdit: I really appreciate everyone’s responses! I may not answer quickly due to…well… being a parent lol. I’ll answer when I can!",

There’s a group of scientists who are religious and saying that as they come to understand the universe more, they realize that there can’t be anything but a God.

It all seems so weird and cruel, as well as people with religious trauma, or people who are apart of the Lgbtq to just send them to hell. What about the \"Christian\" people who touch kids are they going to heaven simply because they believed in God? Or what about people who hate on other and use the bible to justify it you are telling me that these hateful people get to go to heaven while others who just want to live the way they want (without hurting others of course) go to hell. I'm just so confused the whole thing seems too flawed and just in whole so terrifying what if I spend my whole life worried about sinning or pushing down that I like the same gender only to die and find out there is nothing so I've lived my life trying to please no one and instead regretting everything. I also find it hard to believe that if you have some sort of looming threat over your head keeping you from being a bad person you where never a good person in the first place.",

      "title": "Why “Christianity is not a religion, it’s a relationship” is a valuable and true statement",
      "text": "People often dislike this phrase because it’s misunderstood, so let’s clarify.\n\nIt’s not saying that Christianity isn’t technically a religion. By definition, a religion involves belief in and worship of a divine power, and Christianity clearly fits that.\n\nWhat this phrase actually means is that Christianity isn’t about going through the motions of tradition or ritual—it’s about knowing and loving Jesus. You could follow religious practices, even Christian ones, your entire life and still hear Jesus say, “I do not know you.” Likewise, you could live outside those traditions and still be known by Him. This alone shows following Jesus is about something deeper than repetitive actions.\n\nThis phrase is worth using and remembering because it highlights the essence of Christianity:\n\n1. It Emphasizes the Core of Christianity —\n Christianity is about a personal relationship with Jesus Christ (John 17:3, John 15:4-5). Salvation comes through faith in Him, not through religious customs (Ephesians 2:8-9).\n\n2. Jesus Criticized Empty Religious Practice — \nJesus rebuked religious leaders for following rituals without true devotion (Matthew 15:8-9, Luke 11:42). He prioritized knowing and loving God over external acts (Hosea 6:6, Mark 12:30-31).\n\n3. Christianity Is a Living, Active Relationship with God — \nBelievers are part of God’s family (Romans 8:15-16), indwelt by the Holy Spirit (1 Corinthians 6:19), and called to walk with Christ daily (Galatians 2:20). Christianity is relational, not just religious.\n\n4. Traditions and Rituals Exist but Aren’t the Foundation — \nBaptism, communion, and worship gatherings are meaningful expressions of faith, but they do not define salvation (Colossians 2:16-17). They should stem from a relationship with Jesus, not replace it.\n\n5. The Phrase Counters Misconceptions —\nMany see Christianity as just another rule-based religion. This phrase challenges that by emphasizing that faith in Jesus—not ritual—brings salvation.\n\nBecause of this, we should not abandon the phrase. It doesn’t mislead people about Christianity or excuse misuses of Christianity but instead serves as an important reminder of its true focus.\n\nThat said, it’s important to use it wisely. It may not always be helpful when speaking to nonbelievers or when presented without context, but as a reminder of the above principles, it’s priceless.\n\nEDIT: I just want to clarify that I’m not suggesting to use this as an apologetic, it’s rarely useful as a defense or explanation of the faith, but rather as a reminder for those in the faith.\n\nEDIT2: I’ve had this conversation a few times, so I’ll just clarify here: If I said “Pitbulls aren’t dogs, they’re guardians,” would you think I was saying Pitbulls aren’t dogs, or that they are dogs who happen to be good guardians? If you picked the second option, then you’re absolutely right! You understand how satirical statements work. Now, let’s apply that same logic to this phrase.\n\nEDIT3: since mods refuse to remove sexist comments, I’m out of here. Good riddance r/Christianity.",

So great job doing your \"gods\" work all 3 of you. \n\nAny god who tells you to kill is not a right God whatever excuse you have for it. \n\nAre you gonna Convert me or call me a devil 👿 Tell me your Abrahamic god is a god I can trust???? I can trust the god of Adam who crushes innocent people through one and another.\n\nEdit: ..... \nknowing that no one can answer my question I consider this matter to be resolved as yes all Abrahamic religions are aggressive and support killing no matter if you are Jewish, Christian or Muslim. \n\nAll 3 follow the same arrogance delusions that they are superior to others. Jews and Christians having so called \"unity\" is more like Christians being a B word to Jews as Jews has no respect for Christians either.\n\nI give you Christians one for not removing  my post unlike Muslims after a few heated arguments about Muhammad so I appreciate that but this doesn't change anything. The hate is there, the aggression is there. You all are lost souls. I request you all to please stop hating people. Your own books tell you to love each other. You all are lost children of Abraham.... Abraham is the one to blame for this mess also who could not keep it in his pants. If you can't stop hating and killing people please consider leaving your religions as you are already NOT following your religions anyways... (And I say that as much respect I can have).",

      "text": "I was a devout Christian for most of my life, but I’ve drifted away over the last few years.\n\nHow is it fair for God to expect someone to choose the correct religion? \n\nThere are thousands of religions, and the ones we choose to believe are heavily influenced by culture and upbringing.\n\nIt makes more sense to me that God would judge based on the heart and how someone responds to what they do know:\n\n“The Lord looks at the heart.” — 1 Samuel 16:7\n\n“To those who by persistence in doing good seek glory, honor and immortality, He will give eternal life.” — Romans 2:7\n\nI was always taught that all I needed to do was accept Jesus as my Lord and Savior. That seemed gracious until I considered everything above.\n\nIf you have insight, scripture, or a way you’ve come to peace with this, I’d really appreciate hearing it.",

      "text": "my flatmate and I constantly argue about the existence of a god and whether or not religion is a beneficial thing. He is heavily Christian and I am what I can describe as agnostic theism ( I believe that a higher being is a possibility but I am doubtful that any religion is even anywhere close to what it might actually be like) \nWe discuss things like God and morality and heaven and hell but it all seems very obviously made up to me. I believe that these stories mainly gained popularity due to the lack of education and quality of life of the people that lived in those times. People lived hard and miserable lives and they had no idea how the world works so that was the only explanation for what was happening around them. I understand why so many want to believe these things today,  (everyone wants to believe that after they die they'll go to an eternal happy place) but I cant understand how you can be so blindly convinced that it must be true. I know that the environment you grow up in has a huge effect on your beliefs and so maybe that's part of it, but it seems like such a narrow and flawed belief. why would an all knowing and all powerful God care what I do? if he created me and everything else and he has supreme power over all things, then why does he send people to hell for their \"choices\"? \nI do think there can be individual benefits for religious people: \"be a good person love your neighbour etc\" and I think it can help a lot of people to feel like part of a community and to believe that God will forgive whatever you do in life as long as you have faith. I believe that it can be a valuable tool for people who have gone through trauma or mental health struggle or abuse but I don't understand how so many regular people can be so strongly convinced that they're right with no proof or evidence. \nno hate at all to those who are religious, I'm just looking for some perspectives so I can understand better. I'm just trying to learn",

      "text": "I have pondered at this simple question asked:  \nIf Christianity is true, what about X religion? What about the archaic religions, dating back to ancient Egyptians, greeks, ect? They have fallen out of existence, so how do I know for sure that Christianity is different if historically religons come and go?\n\nPerhaps if we consider the extinct religions, then we may come up with at least some good reason in how Christianity can still be true, but there is yet another big question: other people believing different things holds some kind of contradiction.\n\nConsider religions that are not extinct, so like Hindu, Islam, Buddhism, ect, ect. In my theory, I believe that what religion you find to be \"truthful\" comes most from your environment. Consider Asia, where we see more Buddhism, Hinduism, and Folk religion. We move more to the west, we get more Islamic, until we reach Christianity. The majority of people living a specific religion are more likely to have been living in the place of majority. This means that where we grow up, we believe the religion to be the truth. So this asks the question: is Christianity truthful? We may point and say from experience, but it doesn't explain other religions and their beliefs. Some people may experience events that also strengthen their beliefs as well as what you had, so it is not a valid argument. So, what is it here? Am I just missing something?",

      "text": "All my views have been completely shattered.\n\nI wasn't raised in a religious household, my mother practices witchcraft and my father is an atheist. Both very supportive in the \"choose what you want it's none of our business\" stance which I was lucky for.\n\nIn terms of Christianity, I was sort of dragged into the religion through fear. Around 2020 on social media when everyone was fear mongering about Jesus, videos on tiktok of \"spread the gospel or else you'll go to hell\" without actually spreading any gospel. It terrified me and I started learning more about Christianity.\n\nThe more I read and learnt though, I fell in love with the religion. I was happy and faithful and I held so much love for Jesus. It has made me a better person in general, I'm proud to admit.\n\nBut I recently saw a video that shook my views, simple bit emotional. A man with pure emotion ranting about how he can't agree with God. And it shook me. I started to question my faith, I asked and recieved no answers. I begged Jesus, I begged God, crying, begging for a sign. Any sign. A clear sign that he was real. I recieved nothing.\n\nI've been patient, I have come to the conclusion there probably won't be a sign.\n\nAftwr that, my friends made me watch this film I think the name was Heretic or something? Some Mormons went to this guys house, he started blabbering about religions with similarities. About how every religion was telling the same story. I was struggling with religious crisis when I watched this film and I was scared to admit he had a point. An acquaintance who was there on behalf of my friends asked me \"do you have an argument?\" After the actor had finished his tangent. I was usually the one to defend Christianity whenever religion came up in conversations. For once, I had no argument and I burst into tears.\n\nLater I saw a video on my FYP on tiktok, it was about a 4000 year old epic called Gilgamesh. Has the exact same story of Noah'a ark just older.\n\nMy views are shaken, I feel like life is meaningless. I was living for Christ. I have no more faith. I want to but I can't. I can't follow christ without any faith it doesn't work like that it can't work like that. What's the point?\n\nEdit (addition): it feels ironic. I begged for a sign that God was real, and all I got was more content to sway me against it. It's cruel",

      "text": "atheists have simply built a new religion out of their hatred for old ones. They claim to have rejected religion, but all they have done is reverse-engineered it into a hollow, self-congratulatory echo chamber. They have their \"priests\", usually scientists they quote without *understanding*, like Richard Dawkins and Lawrence Krauss.\n\nAsk them about the origins of life or the universe, and they do not explore it themselves. They outsource that thought  to the \"clergy\" the science community. \"Trust the science” they say, while parroting men like Sam Harris and Neil deGrasse Tyson as if they were quoting our gospel. Tyson, especially, is treated as a saint, a patron figure of the smug irreverence, whose snarky tweets replace Scripture for them. They share  his quotes like boomers sharing random Bible verses. They gather in their own version of churches ( online forums ) YouTube channels, subreddits, ritualistic spaces where they rehearse the same talking points, congratulate themselves for believing in nothing, and mock anyone who sees meaning in life. They trade memes instead of hymns, but the function is the same. Affirm the dogma, cast out the heretic, and pretend it makes them superior. They cling to ontological certainty with religious fervor. “There is no God,” they say. Not “I don’t know,” not “I’m seeking.” No, they speak with the same absolute conviction they accuse believers of having. Funny, isn’t it? They claim to be driven by reason and evidence, yet they close the door to mystery faster than any fundamentalist ever could.And why?\n\nBecause meaning terrifies them. A meaningful universe demands something of you.. accountability, humility, purpose. But atheism offers them the ultimate loophole. Nothing matters, so do what you want. In this worldview, love is chemical trickery, morality is a social construct, and life is a brief flicker in a meaningless void. It is not courageous to believe this. It is cowardice. It is a retreat. It is the easy way out. It takes far more courage to stand in awe of a Creator. To admit you are not the center of the cosmos, that there is a design and a Designer, and that maybe, just maybe, your life is not your own. Atheists think they are rebellious by rejecting religion. But what is truly rebellious in this hollow, cynical age is faith. Faith that this is not random. That there is a purpose. That the universe was not an accident, and neither are you.",

I do believe that often white Christians, or Christians in general, can become complacent in the face of oppression, perhaps out of fear of standing up for what's right. Many Christians are uneducated about what they believe or what their pastor is teaching. I'd really like to hear everyone's opinion on this.",

      "title": "Christianity Is Paul’s Religion, Not Jesus’s—Prove Me Wrong",
      "text": "If you think you’re following Jesus—are you sure? Because what Christianity teaches today isn’t what Jesus taught. It’s what Paul manipulated it into.\n\nJesus never said, “Just believe in me and you’ll be saved.” He never said His death was a sacrifice for sin. He never said faith alone was enough. He never preached about hell the way Christians believe it today. He never even told anyone to build churches in His name. All of that came from Paul.\n\nWhen someone asked Jesus how to have eternal life, He didn’t say, “Believe in my death and resurrection.” He said, “If you want to enter life, keep the commandments.” (Matthew 19:17). He warned that calling Him “Lord” meant nothing if you didn’t actually do God’s will (Matthew 7:21). So if Jesus Himself said following God’s law was necessary, why does Christianity teach that it isn’t?\n\nBecause Paul manipulated Jesus’s message and turned it into something else.\n\nPaul rejected everything Jesus taught and replaced it with his own doctrine. He said faith alone saves: “A person is justified by faith apart from the works of the law.” (Romans 3:28). He even called following God’s law a curse (Galatians 3:10). But if that’s true, then Jesus was wrong—because Jesus explicitly said the law still mattered:\n\n\t“Do not think that I have come to abolish the Law or the Prophets; I have not come to abolish them but to fulfill them. Until heaven and earth disappear, not the smallest letter, not the least stroke of a pen, will by any means disappear from the Law.” (Matthew 5:17-18)\n\nSo who do you believe—Jesus or Paul? Because they don’t agree.\n\nJesus’s Real Message—Love and Reform, Not Religion\n\nJesus wasn’t trying to start a religion—He was trying to fix one.\n\nHis entire message was about reforming Judaism, not replacing it. He challenged the religious leaders because they had turned God’s commandments into empty rituals, obsessed with power, judgment, and status instead of love, mercy, and justice.\n\nHe boiled everything down to two commandments:\n\n\t“Love the Lord your God with all your heart, soul, and mind. This is the first and greatest commandment. And the second is like it: Love your neighbor as yourself. All the Law and the Prophets hang on these two commandments.” (Matthew 22:37-40)\n\nLove was the foundation of His message. That’s why He condemned the religious elites for following the letter of the law while ignoring justice, mercy, and faithfulness (Matthew 23:23).\n\nPaul erased this message.\n\nInstead of a faith based on love and action, Paul turned it into belief and obedience to religious authority. Instead of preaching love and reform, Paul focused on sin, lawbreaking, and faith as the only requirement.\n\nJesus Never Preached the Christian Version of Hell\n\nThe idea of hell as a place of eternal torment for unbelievers? That’s not from Jesus either.\n\nJesus spoke about Gehenna, which was a real location outside Jerusalem—a valley associated with corruption and destruction. When He warned about Gehenna, He was speaking about judgment in this life, not eternal damnation.\n\nPaul, however, took the idea of divine punishment and twisted it into a doctrine of eternal hellfire for unbelievers. He taught that rejecting Jesus meant eternal damnation, but Jesus never taught that. Instead, He emphasized God’s mercy and justice.\n\nJesus Never Said His Death Was a Sacrifice for Sin\n\nThe entire foundation of Christianity—that Jesus’s death was a payment for sin—was made up by Paul.\n\nJesus never taught substitutionary atonement. He never said He was dying for anyone’s sins. In fact, when people came to Him for forgiveness, He simply forgave them—no blood sacrifice required. He told people to repent, live righteously, and follow God.\n\nBut Paul invented the idea that Jesus’s death was some cosmic transaction to buy salvation for believers. He turned Jesus into a human sacrifice, something Jesus Himself never preached.\n\nJesus Never Told Anyone to Start a Church in His Name\n\nJesus didn’t tell His followers to create an institution. He didn’t say to build churches, create rituals, or start a religion. He was reforming Judaism, not inventing something new.\n\nJesus never wanted to start a new religion or have churches built in His name. He wasn’t creating Christianity—He was reforming Judaism, calling people back to love, justice, and mercy, not religious institutions and doctrines.\n\nPaul, on the other hand, started planting churches, creating theology, and building a religious system centered on himself. He even admitted that he didn’t get his teachings from Jesus’s disciples—he made them up based on his own “revelations” (Galatians 1:11-12).\n\nJesus’s original followers—Peter, James, and the earliest Jewish Christians—didn’t believe what Paul taught. They continued following Jewish law, just as Jesus did. The Ebionites, one of the first groups of Jesus’s followers, completely rejected Paul. They didn’t believe Jesus was God. They didn’t believe in “faith alone.” They believed in actually following Jesus’s teachings.\n\nBut Paul hijacked the movement. He redefined Jesus’s message and built an entirely new religion—one that Jesus never preached. And that’s the version of Christianity you follow today.\n\nThat’s why Christianity isn’t about living righteously—it’s about believing the “right” things. That’s why modern Christianity is obsessed with sin, salvation, heaven, hell and faith instead of justice, mercy, and love. It’s not about changing the world—it’s about escaping it.\n\nThat was never Jesus’s message. But it was Paul’s deception.\n\nYou’re not following Jesus. You never were. You’re following Paul.\n\nSo, prove me wrong. Show me where Jesus said that faith alone is enough. Show me where He said His death was a sacrifice for sin. Show me where He said the commandments no longer matter. Show me where He preached about eternal hellfire for unbelievers. Show me where He told anyone to start a church in His name.\n\nYou won’t find it—because Paul made it up.\n\nI welcome anyone to try, but it’s pretty clear no one actually reads the Bible.",

      "text": "The secular consensus in today’s world is that no one has the right to impose their religious beliefs on others, and it seems many Christians have adopted this dogma. \n\nI think this statement is absurd when you think about it more closely, and particularly absurd if you’re a person who is religious or values religious expression and at the same time holds the view that the religious should stay out of the secular.\n\nThe question is, which do you value more, your faith or your political ideology? Or asked another way, which do you think a religious person ought to value more?\n\nIf your answer is your faith, then it’s clearly absurd to think a secular ideology should be able to dictate where the influence of your faith ends, especially when your faith does have things to say about the government.\n\nIf your answer is the ideology, then what you’re really saying is we all have to assume secularism as our primary worldview and adjust our religions accordingly. \n\nIf you try to answer both equally, you have to non-arbitrarily explain where and why the authority of the one stops and the other begins.\n\nMy overarching point is, the narrative of religious pluralism and indifferentism is incoherent. You can’t have this worldview where competing ideologies are tolerated equally. If you’re secular, you need to be consistent and reject religious influence not by imposing the dictates of your worldview on people with another worldview, but by rejecting their worldview as false.\n\nAnd if you’re a Christian or otherwise religious person, you need to own your faith completely and not accept secular dogmas being imposed on you. \n\nTL;DR: Religious pluralism is incoherent because it doesn’t work, and for Christians it’s just a tacit admission that you accept the whims and dictates of secular ideology over your faith",

It's amazing how you assumed my own politics, without my stating, because I asked you to care about how real people will be affected by policy..\n\nIf you act like your well-being is connected to the poorest and most vulnerable person in this world, your eyes will open. I believe this is what Jesus asks us to do. I wish you all peace.\n\n\\---------\n\nIf your commitment to Christ has nothing to do with what happens to the vulnerable and poor around you, then get used to people questioning your faith.\n\nRight now the GOP is poised to dismantle Medicaid. People you know will be affected. Many will die.\n\nWhat is the point if you are \"saved\" but it hasn't transformed the way you engage with the world, whether through daily interactions or the values you place behind a vote?  You don't exist in a vacuum. Individualism as it exists now did not exist in Jesus' time. Everything was connected and everything mattered -- above all our commitment to love and serve others.\n\nIf you don't think you carry the responsibility and obligation to shape this world into the kingdom of God, then I don't care to hear of how bored you are that others do. If you're a Christian on this sub (or anyone else for that matter), start acting like other people matter.\n\n\\* edited for the people engaged in semantics rather than my point.",

      "text": "I see many Christians look at homosexuality as something unnatural that people who feel they are born with it are meant to overcome. I see them calling homosexual men and women to reach out to Jesus, to pray for guidance and strength. Some even claiming that God will take these desires from you and ease your fight with them. I have noticed many homosexual Christians mention they practice celibacy as we interpret God has commanded, but has anyone actually stopped feeling same sex attraction altogether? I have never seen this be the case and I'm simply wondering on what ground those Christians have based their belief that God will take away homosexual desires if you seek him? Or if I'm misinterpreting those claims altogether? To clarify I am heterosexual but have only recently found faith and have seen many arguments both for and against supporting homosexuality, I'm just trying to seek the truth and understand.\n\n  \nEDIT: I ask that we stick to the question of whether you have or know anyone who has actually converted from same sex attraction to opposite sex attraction. If you must disagree do it with patience and love as Christ commands. The debating is nauseating, and a lot of you are not fighting for what you think. You desire to be correct only.",

Over the summer I've been teaching my child how to sew and recently how to play minecraft. My husband told me last night he's sees that as proof I'm not taking time to talk about faith with my child because that's all she talks about. He forgets the fact she's constantly singing worship songs. I also tried to remind him that he doesn't see everything I do with her. I felt like telling him if he felt like I wasn't doing good enough he could always teach her as well instead of putting it all on me but I felt like that wouldn't have been healthy for our discussion. \n\nI also have this weird thing where I don't like fictional TV shows. When I'm relaxing I like to watch documentaries. My husband told me I'm wasting my time with them and that i spend a lot of time talking about what I have learned from them but not enough time talking about Biblical principles and what I'm studying. I don't like talking with my husband about it because he often tells me I'm not doing it properly or I'm not interpreting things properly. It's really disheartening to hear. \n\nI also used to work as a cleaner at the church we used to attend. The pastor there wasn't very respectful towards me and he was constantly putting me down. He literally told me I wasn't worth minimum wage and laughed at me when i told him i considered myself a professional cleaner. He kept expecting me to do more work and near the end they cut my pay and told me I was not a good person for not wanting to accept those changes included working 4 hours a week unpaid. When I told my husband how hurt I was and how I felt like maybe they where right he took out his Bible and said \"Start reading this more and you'll feel better!\" He also told me the same thing when my doctor prescribed me anti depressants (due to stress of cleaning for the church). \n\nI'm broken as a Christian right now. I've prayed I've studied its just whenever my husband asks me about it I get nervous and have a hard time expressing myself and my husband takes that as proof I'm a lukewarm Christian. He also brought up once again how I wasn't raised as a Christian.\n\nI don't know what I'm asking for here. I need to change, I want to get better. I just don't know how to show othersh",

I have heard men claim that women exist purely for the purpose of serving men, which makes sense considering the reason why Eve was made (and where she came from). Anytime you see a heroic woman in the bible, it is always a woman who submits to a man. For example, Esther took the place of Queen Vashti, who simply didn't want to be displayed to other men by King Xerxes. Abigail's prize for being wise was becoming one of David's many wives. Paul tells women to remain silent in the church, and to cover their heads because they are practically less valuable than men in God's eyes: \"A man ought not to cover his head,^(\\[)[^(b)](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Corinthians%2011&version=NIV#fen-NIV-28608b)^(\\]) since he is the image and glory of God; but woman is the glory of man. ^(8) For man did not come from woman, but woman from man; ^(9) neither was man created for woman, but woman for man. ^(10) It is for this reason that a woman ought to have authority over her own^(\\[)[^(c)](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Corinthians%2011&version=NIV#fen-NIV-28611c)^(\\]) head, because of the angels.\"\n\nSo according to the bible, God does not even look at me because I'm a woman. I'm not important in his eyes. Why then should I believe in a God who doesn't see me as his image? It makes me feel very disconnected.",

      "text": "As a Christian, I remain befuddled at how many Christians have not only voted for Trump, but see him as a kind of savior to be the frontman for their agenda. Understandably, this support has made many non-Christians more upset about Christians, and for good reason. I honestly don't understand the obsession. If Jesus is at the center of Christianity, doesn't Trump, with his blatant narcissism, disrespect for women, and racism stand directly opposed to what Christians should believe? I understand Christians might feel that on some specific polices Trump is better than the alternative, but what's up with the the fan worship? The guy is about the furthest thing from Jesus imaginable.",

      "text": "I only really see this push-back from the Christians on the Left. In my not-so-humble opinion, it *feels* like Democrats are closer to following the Word of Jesus than Republicans are. For example, Biden goes to church, admits he sins, asks for forgiveness and believes what he says. Trump goes to church to stage a photo-op wit an upside down Bible, after gassing priests, misquotes the Bible and says he's never done anything to need forgiving for. Wildly different positions. Th Bible would teach us that Trump is 100% wrong. Forget about what we know he's done, just on the very surface, it teaches us not one person that was born of a man and a woman that ever lived was perfect. NONE. Add to that if you go by the rules it is pretty obvious we have all messed up multiple times, sometimes multiple times daily, and Trump has done a lot of the big ones. Biden may have, too, I don't know, but he at least is humble. \n\nI have been to church before, I used to go to a local Catholic church every Sunday for years. AT church, everyone seems the same, but after service is over, it just felt like the people I knew who were right-leaning went right back to being \"that way\", while the people leaning Left were the ones staying after organizing events to help people less-fortunate. Like I have talked to conservatives about the Bible's message on things like charity, giving people your coat and he shirt off your back, healing the sick, feeding the hungry, sheltering the homeless, turning the other cheek, and not trying to make your whole life about money. They have actually told me Jesus said those poor people are lazy and choose to be that way and the Bible says to let them twist in the wind, as for turning the other cheek they say he was joking that he really said take up a sword and strike those people down, and that Jesus helped rich people get into Heaven. \n\nAre we reading the same Bible? Did I miss the Donald Trump abridged version they are all reading? Then you have people like Laura Loomer basically saying to kill all Muslims, all Democrats, and eventually all everyone of other religions, or none. Stephen Miller talking about everything his buddy Adolf did which is ironic for a Jewish person to be taking the position that Adolf was right, and Trump, who is a combination of evil, stupid, and wildly impressionable literally destroying the country this time, not hyperbole like last time. \n\nToday in the news Loomer is being CREDITED for blocking Palestinian CHILDREN wounded in Gaza from getting help here because she pointed out these little kids are all high-ranking members of Hamas and here to kill Americans. Gaza now has the most child-amputees than anywhere else on the planet and we are turning them away and saying it's what Jesus would have done. \n\nI am FAR from devout at this point, but I am sick and tired of people on the Right claiming to know Jesus when they probably can't even spell His name. And it feels like the Right is getting worse, not better. I remember the 80s and Reagan republicans were unpleasant, and bigoted and the 90s did not get any better, but it *did* seem to turn the page around 2000. Then, of course, we turned another age when Obama got elected, twice, because we can't have a Christian nation with a Black President because Jesus was a White Republican that spoke English and loved guns. I have literally read them posting that more than once.  And these folks are in charge of education now....",

      "title": "Have I been wrong about my faith because of my politics?",
      "text": "My husband and I have always tried to be consistent about our faith and our political standing. We are registered independents. As Christians we stand for traditional marriage between a man a woman, we believe in the sanctity of life, and we believe the Jesus Christ is God and  died /rose from the grave for our sins and that we are saved by grace through faith in him. But our stance has caused some uproar in our network of Christian friends and family. \n\nThere are some in our network who staunchly support Donald Trump. We don't. In the past  we voted for Obama once, back in 2008, but we have also voted for republicans and other candidates that we believed lined up with our tenets of faith, even if they weren't republican. Even though we made this clear, we received push-back from one of our friends who is avidly against Obama and felt he did serious damage. Recently we began speaking out against a trend we had taken notice of in the last few years -- and that's the sins committed by conservatives that are so easily glossed over. How this relates to Trump? Well, we've seen things  that Trump has done that we believe is anti-biblical and anti-Christ. At the same time, we do recognize some of the good policies Trump has passed in this country, and as of late I objectively (to best that I could) pointed the thinks I liked about Trump, even while I didn't support him. \n\nThis caused uproar among some of our Christian friends. They began accusing us of picking on Conservatives and playing double standard, with accusation that we've never pointed out the problems of the Left, only the Right. We let them know that, among our circle of friends,  we didn't point out things from the Left because it was obvious what they stood for, and that there was plenty of people on Facebook point those out. Our concern was how conservatives gloss over sins, especially the Trump administration, but that excuses are made  and that this could hurt our witness to others about Christ. We were slammed by our friends about this. Others actually questioned our faith, asking us if we were in the word. One of our friends criticized not only us, but another Christian sister about their beliefs because of their stance against Trump. This also came out when we pointed out how we noticed a lot of Trump adoration that was more idolatrous.. Again we received criticisms, accusation that we were ore \"Leftist\" and even that we were causing dissension, along with a warning (i perceived) that dissenters won't enter the kingdom of heaven. \n\nNow granted, I'm trying to summarize here, so I may have over embellished a point or two. But to summarize, we have friends whom we are losing because of their devotion to Trump, yet their accusations that we're Leftists (used in a derogatory sense) or that our faith is questionable, really stings.  One person is doing this and I've known this person, gone to church with this person. Yet this person believes I am enamored with Leftist, even though I've told this person otherwise. I fear now that this person, along with others will spread rumors that we have fallen away from the faith, even though we are committed to following the Lord Jesus Christ, even if it means going against the traditions of men and church. \n\nWe have other friends who totally support us, but even with this we still feel alone. On a personal note, I honestly feel that, without calling him names or ridiculing him, I feel Donald Trump is deceiving the Christian the people. I pray for his salvation, but I'm scared of what he'll do and what damage this will cause to my brothers and sisters in Christ who adore him. \n\nAm I the only one who feels this way? Or am I wrong about Trump? Am I leaning to far left and don't realize it? Your thoughts?",

      "text": "I do have a screenshot of this post of hers, but apparently that violates the “no text pictures” rule even if there is an accompanying post hand typed by the poster. So it’ll probably get removed if I add it, but just go to her twitter and scroll down a bit, it’s from June 21st around 10pm.\n\n(The above was not meant to antagonize or challenge mods, just an explanation for the “source?” people and wondering why I didn’t post it with the post)\n\nComments from her loyal followers thought it was a great idea and applauded her, threatened dissenters and even encouraged vigilante violence on women they think are trans because they “can always tell” even though their track record proves that demonstrably false.\n\nWhy is she doing this? Because in her words “God made men and women different for a reason. And you can’t claim to care about real women if you are fine with and even encourage the most perverted males in existence to spy on them in vulnerable spaces”\n\nHer mission is to protect women’s and girl’s privacy, which apparently is best done by encouraging people to record women and girls in the bathroom thus violating their privacy, and posting them to the internet. (Yes, she herself included the part about putting them on the internet, that was not added or hypothesized by me from her context, she just outright said it.)\n\nThis is what right wing conservative Christian nationalism has come to, and I have multiple problems with it.\n\nFirst, trans people are humans worthy of dignity and respect, regardless of anything. Second, there’s no evidence that trans women are any threat to other women in a women’s bathroom at all. Third, Jesus definitely has a problem with “the trans issue”, but I really don’t think he’s on the side JK and others like her think He’s on.\n\nFourth, even if you don’t respect the dignity of trans women as humans, it really says alot that you hate them THAT much that you don’t care at all about the cis women who will be caught in the crossfire, and they will. It’s already happened several times, because the odds of ever seeing a trans woman IRL are slim to none. The odds of seeing a GNC, not feminine enough etc woman are exponentially higher, and they are the ones who have already been affected by her and similar rhetoric, and they are the ones who will now apparently have their photos IN A BATHROOM plastered all over the internet.\n\nThis isn’t about and was never about, HAS NEVER BEEN ABOUT “protecting women”. Just like it was never about protecting kids, or protecting anyone. The hatred and cruelty ARE THE POINT. That’s why they don’t care that the very women they claim to love and are wanting to protect will get caught in this dragnet.\n\nThe hardest part about all of this is her heel-turn itself. JK Rowling was a childhood hero of mine. A really big one. I wasn’t allowed (but did anyway) to read Harry Potter as a kid because it “teaches witchcraft”. The same parents who wouldn’t allow me (but I did anyway) to play Pokémon because it “teaches evolution”. Her stories really resonated with me. A kid who no one liked and was bullied often, abused in multiple ways at home, few friends, but that kid discovered that the best thing he could do is just be himself, and real friends that are friends for life would find him, and this girl learned the same.\n\nIn many ways, her books helped shape the person I am today. I never, NEVER could have predicted that she would turn out to be so.. vile. But then, they do often say to never meet your heroes.\n\nShe’s truly crossed the Rubicon this time. There really is no coming back from this. If her followers actually follow through on this, a whole lot of people, trans and not are going to be hurt. People who don’t deserve it, people who are innocent and just using the bathroom like everyone else. I had held out hope for her that maybe, maybe one day she would see the light again but she’s so lost in her hate now, I just don’t see it anymore. I really don’t see where redemption fits into her story anymore.\n\nAnd to have her doing all of this in the name of the God I love and the savior I cling to everyday is just… I have no words. What in the HELL has happened to God’s people?",

I’m not here to debate or argue—I’m honestly trying to understand how people from different backgrounds think through this.\n\nIf you’re open to sharing, I’d love to know:\nDo you believe homosexuality is a sin? Why or why not?\n\nI’m especially interested in how people reconcile their beliefs with values like love, compassion, or truth. If you’ve wrestled with this personally, all the better—those are often the most powerful perspectives.\n\nThanks in advance for your honesty. I’m just trying to listen and learn.",

      "text": "I’ve spent years trying to understand how people of different beliefs think, especially when it comes to religion. But there's one thing I keep bumping into, particularly with Christianity, that I can't ignore.\n\nWhy is it that *your* faith is automatically right, and *mine* is something to be corrected, saved, or condemned?\n\nIn all my interactions, no other faith group has been as consistently self-righteous and damning toward others as Christians. And I’m not saying this lightly or out of spite, it's a pattern I’ve seen over and over. From colonization to modern missionary work, the Christian machine has spent 2,000 years pushing what often feels more like a spiritual pyramid scheme than a path to truth. The money, the lives, the coercion, the manipulation, all justified by \"saving souls.\"\n\nWhen I try to engage in logical discussion or talk about the nature of faith, that we all have it in some form, the conversation always hits the same wall: “Because ours is the true faith.” That’s not an argument. That’s a dismissal. It’s a refusal to engage with the idea that maybe, just maybe, faith isn’t a one-size-fits-all experience.\n\nI'm not here to attack belief. I'm here to ask why one belief is treated as the ultimate default, the unquestionable truth, while others are marginalized, silenced, or damned.\n\nThat being said, I'm not saying all Christians are like this. But that's like 98%.\n\nIf we all have faith in something, be it a god, a system, humanity, or even just the unknown, why does yours get to invalidate mine?\n\nLet’s have an honest discussion. No preaching. No damnation. Just dialogue.",

      "text": "With today  ( Jan 20th 2025) being a dark mark in American history with Trump back in office, I just feel anger and disgust towards conservative so called Christian’s who put this person ( Trump)  back in the highest position in America.   I am skeptical of both political parties in the U.S and don’t consider myself a member of either side. I just don’t understand conservatives worship of Trump and the toxic blending  of white nationalism and  Christianity. \n\nAs African American male in his late 30’ and raised it in Christian home, it just boggles my mind so many white conservative Christians worship Trump like they do and somehow think he is some Godly man sent by Jesus himself.  Trump has never displayed ANY Christian attributes, no compassion , empathy, kindness or anything to people that don’t look like him, believe like him , or support him. \n\nMany Conservatives gloss over his many flaws like cheating with his wife with a pornstar,  many racist comments,  Jan 6th etc . The guy was directly asked once by an interviewer to cite his favorite Bible scripture and he was unable to do so. \n\nIn addition to this,  many conservative Christians ( again majority White people) are also the main ones spewing racist garbage on social media platforms about Black people any other non white people  or complain about things being “woke”. But again say and do horrifically racist things ( some caught on camera and made viral on the internet)  but yet have Bible posts in their social media bio.  \n\nThis year, I wanted to strengthen my faith cause to be honest, I had kinda started to drift away a bit. The white nationalism present in the  faith definitely caused the drift. I  previously attended  non denominational churches with a diverse congregation not just black or just white people but a mixture of everyone.  But unfortunately, those churches are mega churches with conservative pastors that definitely support Trump and what he stands for ( at least in my area of Virginia).  This has made it difficult for me to connect with people at those churches. \n\nSorry for the rant and to be clear, I do still love and believe in God and Jesus. I just don’t love the church or the religion as much as I use to and have feelings of disgusted to see how toxic it has become. \n\nAnyone else feel the same?  Any advice to go back to Church or stop harboring this feeling of disgust towards some sections of people in the faith?",

I started researching a lot of the modern Christan issues like Creation vs Evolution, Bible Inerrancy, and how the Bible's morality applies to modern issues like LGBTQ issues. I have gradually become more liberal in those areas to be honest. But through all of that, it did not challenge my faith. I felt my faith was actually more grounded in reality. \n\nWhat as challenge my faith is this, God doesn't answer my it anymore else's prayers in my experience. Or at least his answer is always \"No\". More generally, God has zero direct impact on my life whatsoever. The ideas and teachings do to the extent that I chose to let them influence me, but that is true of any religion or ethical framework. \n\nI have tried dealing with sin my life, adjusting my expectations, reading the Bible and praying daily, adjusting my expectations, nothing really changes.\n\nI am at the point now where I directly challenge God to see if anything happens. Nothing ever does. At this point, I would like for God to punish me for something so at least I can see Him have some impact. But God doesn't punish me, He doesn't bless me, He doesn't lead me, He doesn't reveal truth to me, He doesn't heal the people who I or my church collectively pray for. Nothing. I have a bunch of stories about a character, and just like Santa, the stories are only good for manipulating me to behave a certain way. I have just as much evidence for the existence of Santa as I do for God.\n\nAnyway, that's what I got. If there is something I am missing, I am open to advice. I would love to have a good reason to keep believing, but usually I just get people giving excuses for why God is always silent and inactive. I'll listen to what anyone has to say though.",

Could someone kindly explain why this belief is so central and necessary? I appreciate your insights!\n\nNote: I came from a Christian family, but never really followed Christianity or preached or anything really, and when I turned to be more “religious oriented” I turn to choose Islam, I NEVER disrespected any religion I think we shud all come into a sense, just like I have decent common talks with my Christian friends and we all get a long, I just wanted to know from more peoples pov on why this thought, since is a really debated topic.

      "text": "Hey everyone,\n\nLet me preface this by saying I am a black male living in the U.S ( Virginia) and grew up in a Christian household  ( Baptist). In terms of political views I and most of my family have been more on the Democrat side. I am not with the progressive Christianity thing either ( to be upfront but I am not conservative either).  I am in my mid 30's now and attend mostly non denominational  churches.  I am in no way trying to offend anyone or show any racial bias so please don't take the following as disrespect. I love everyone as they say.\n\nThat said, as a Christian I have had conversations with my conservative brothers and sisters to ask this same question and we had an interesting. See it seems a lot of the conservative  Christians display the worse versions of Christians and the faith. Trying to force people t follow the faith instead of living life that honor God/ Jesus so much that people take notice and WANT to learn about faith. Like many questionable  republicans that do and say things that are just no Christ-Like or are borderline racist.  conservative Christians ( many of whom are white) are often the ones caught on camera being Karen's or racist or think Black History month  being taught at public schools or the celebration of Juneteenth is divisive now. They are also the ones that worship Donald Trump who some think he  is the second coming of Christ. To be honest, I don't get the sense Trump is a Christian at all as nothing about him display's this to me.  I saw an in interview  during his presidential run where he struggled to cite a single scripture.\n\nThis isn't ALL conservative Christians mind you but a majority I see in the political world and in every day just seem to fall short and give the faith a bad name. I am not saying they have to fall into progressive Christianity or agree with  all left wing views ( I don't agree with everything from either party) but more compassion, grace, and empathy is need so that more people just don't think of Christianity as the faith of bigots and old white men out of touch with society.  Instead of the crazy street preachers yelling at everyone  that passes that they are going to hell lets actually display the love of Christ by actions of good deeds in our communities and helping people you know?  \nAnyone else feel the same if this rambling post made sense ha. I am trying to be respectful as well as this isn't intended to cause arguments or hate. It's all love here and  I just want the faith and Christians to do a bit better ( black, white, republican, and democrat ).",

      "text": "Regarding the posts saying, “If you lost your faith because of the election outcome, you never knew Christ in the first place.”\n\nHow dare any person put the blame on those that are hurting so deeply that they doubt whether a loving God can exist? How dare you stand above them and dismiss them as if you yourself are God?\n\nHow deep that hurt must be for someone to reach such a place. Jesus WEEPS both WITH and FOR the broken. He does not point his finger and say “get better at your faith, scrub.”\n\nFor people to reach such a place means we have utterly failed them as the hands and feet of Christ. We have failed to provide them with enough evidence through what we say and what we do to show them that a loving God exists and that he lives and works in the world through us.\n\nThe lesson to be learned here is not that we should be pointing the finger at those with little faith. We should be pointing the finger at ourselves for not exhibiting enough love through our words and action that God’s existence and love is undeniable. If we were actually doing that, election results wouldn’t matter at all, because we would be drowning out all evil with our love for our brothers and sisters.\n\nIf we were all doing our job as Christians to the absolute best of our ability, we would not be having this discussion, because God’s existence and love would be undeniable to anyone. We have missed the lesson of the original discussion regarding the election entirely. We are clearly nowhere near as effective as a congregation for Christ as we should be. This is not meant to discourage us though. The intention is for us to take some accountability and to encourage each of us to DO BETTER.",

      "text": "I am a straight girl, born and raised Christian Baptist. However, I’m very accepting to gay people, trans people, drag queens etc. My heart can’t imagine judging someone because they are in love, or their identity is unjust to how they feel. I don’t want any hate. \n\nI really want to know why is homosexuality considered a sin? Because the Bible says so, yes. But it’s very contradictory. The Bible was mistranslated. It was never meant to be “man shall not lie with man” it was “man shall not lie with boy” aka talking about men lying with children. My thing is this was mistranslated and the word “homosexuality” wasn’t put into the Bible until 1940. Before hand they never had the word in the Bible. Why is it that you can’t be a Christian and gay? Lust is something that you can fight against, but people easily fall in love despite not wanting to.\n\nSo how could someone control loving the same gender? It’s actually not even possible to do so. Are they supposed to suffer their whole lives because apparently they aren’t allowed? That breaks my heart. Why should it be like that? Jesus is so accepting, why would he be upset about love? I really am very religious, I read my bible and go to church. But it’s not something I can fathom as to why it would be a sin. Not many people follow the Old Testament because it doesn’t make sense to. There are prohibitions of certain fabrics, etc. I just am trying to understand why people cherry pick the Bible in terms of the Old Testament. Or really just in general. \n\nIf homosexuality was a sin, then it would be the same in the eyes of God as would lying. Since all sin is equal. But why don’t people tell parents who speak to their children about Santa Claus that they are going to burn to death in Hell? It would be the same weight of sin in comparison to homosexuality. Anyways, I mean this with all the love in my heart. I don’t mean any hate, or even want to stir up hate. I just want someone to help me understand, or their takes on it. 💗✝️🫂\n\n(Happy pride month, if you are a gay Christian! So much love!)",

      "text": "I'll keep this short. Been a Christian 25 years now. Sadly... been losing faith in Jesus. I just have never felt God's love or that he even cares. Evil men prosper and they prosper doing evil. I'm actually jealous of the wicked. I wish God loved me as much as he loves them. They're clearly his favorites. Giving them decades to sin perpetually worse and worse but \"because of grace\" he loves them oh so much that he let's them not only get away with everything (no lessons learned at any point) but then rewards them for it if they says \"oopsies, forgive me\" on their deathbed or later in life when they are harmless at that point anyway. They sacrifice nothing and gain eternal life just for saying \"sorry\". Meanwhile, I feel picked on by God from a second-to-second basis. Every day I wake up with a frown knowing either God is going to send evil to me around every corner non-stop or will just not hold Satan back and let him run wild against me. I expected at some point to have developed a \"relationship\" with God but fervent prayers have dwindled into sighs and eye-rolling when I feel like praying, knowing I'll just be ignored anyway, knocking all wind out of my sails of faith. How can I pray when God is the one putting me into living nightmares? How can I ask him to stop Satan when he's the one that created him and enables him. And yet he blames him. It just feels like I just have no role and that roles aren't even good anyway if God uses Satan like some leashed pitbull against the good.\n\nI'm trying. Not sure how much I have left.\n\nThanks.\n\n🟠 Update: Feeling oh so much better now. Thank you for your comments and prayers. God must have known what I needed because he reminded me of quite a few things over the past couple days since I posted. I won't go into detail about how, it was a series of events, really, but I had to remember where I came from before Christ and how I meant it with everything within me to be born again in Jesus Christ. I had to remember the possible worldly future I gave up. I had to remember what I bring to the table in Jesus' Kingdom. Lastly, I had to remember Jesus not even fighting to save his life as he was falsely accused. He didn't even plea or make a case. I had to think of Pontius Pilate being completely in shock that the King of the Jews seemed to have zero issues with having several chances to not be nailed naked on a Roman crucifix. For us. And me. And that he knew what awaited him on the other side. He could have called angles to get him down and he did not. He could have dulled the pain or just gotten drunk and he refused. He made sure it was as painful as possible. He did this so we all could come hang out with him and his Dad if we want. And that's what I want. Can't get too attached to this place, right?",

      "text": "Hello, dear brothers and sisters in Christ. I am a fifteen-year-old girl who is currently struggling with her faith. Lately, I have been trying to find and understand other faiths; such as Islam, especially with the huge rise of my (was before Christian peers) \"reverting\" to Islam and other individuals too online and in real life. Because of this, I spend endless nights questioning myself if Christianity is false or if Islam is the true religion. On most days, I am prone to falling back into sin; struggling with lust, sloth and envy, avoiding repentance, never touching my word, and barely even praying or talking to God. And when I do pray, I feel emptiness - just nothing. \n\nMy best friend (who is an Orthodox Christian) tells me to pray if off and give it time. Telling me that being a Christian is not easy in this modern age that it is normal to have doubts, but truly, it hurts not to be guided through your word. Constantly doubting and losing trust in the Lord. Sometimes, I feel like I have no one to talk to. And my family is not as religious as they once were in the past. \n\nCan anyone please help and give me a brutal honest reply/ advice?\n\nMay God bless you all for taking the time to read this, thank you.",

      "text": "I’m 27F. I recently lost all faith my God. I do believe He is real, that His name is Jesus Christ & I do believe the gospel 100%. I just don’t believe that God loves everyone nor does everyone have free will. \n\nAfter 20 years of being physically, mentally, emotionally and sexually abused by narcissistic mother who is a “god-fearing” christian. I came to the conclusion that the God of the Bible is not for me nor does he accept or love me. I don’t recognize him at all. I once use to call him MY GOD, I served at the church, I obeyed all of his commands and prayed daily to have a closer relationship with him without ANYTHING in return except peace in a toxic household. \n\nI’m not going to get into the weeds here, but 20 years of unbearable abuse, and pleading for my life to God, he refuses to save me. I have asked for tools, opportunities, help, counsel, guidance, courage, strength, you name it… & He has basically told me to F off. I’m at a point of full rebellion now. I am teaching myself to not give a fck anymore, not about eternity, not about my “family” who’ve never been there for me but instead have partaken into the abuse. They stole my life. I was never allowed to have friends, to date, to go out, to travel, they 💀 my father and tried to 💀 TWICE. I always lied to myself and said I’ll save myself for marriage even though I had already been sexually abused by my mother and grandfather. Additionally, everything I did had to be done under supervision and permission. I worked my ass off to buy my mother and house and help her husband pay it off since they couldn’t buy one. I have bent my back until it snapped and continue to give more and more to them. I’m not allowed to move out, I’m not allowed to have ANY opinions/feelings. The moment I speak out, I immediately get punished by “God.”\n\nWhen I was in the womb. A “prophet” told my mother I was basically HER property and HER blessing from God. Meaning I will NEVER have free will/a life of my own.\n\nI have prayed and pleaded, fasted to God. & he has told me to go fuck myself. That he needs me to continue to kiss the ground my abusive mother walks on & frankly, I am sick of them both. I’m sick of God playing this character of love, and free will to everyone & my abusive narcissistic mother playing the christian housewife who has NEVER lifted a finger to work, or do ANYTHING but sleep around/party/have multiple friends/travel at the expense of others. \n\nI have SEE God bless her over and over, and yes I am angry because see this same God curse and punish INNOCENT people for what??? For a bullshit promise that may NEVER happen in heaven??? Where 95% chance is that your abuser/killer will also be ???? \n\n\nI cried out to God and told him multiple times over a year that my faith has been shaken, stumbled upon and that I needed deliverance. I needed his help to rescue me. I poured out my heart to him and he told me to fuck off. I waited a whole year for him to answer after non stop prayer. A prayer I have been praying for 20 years straight. I have finally ceased. His message has been loud and clear. I renounce my faith, I renounce everything I once believe. I am desperate for a way out/opportunity; that I will begin to seek the other side of the coin.",

I just feel so lost and alone and I'm starting to doubt everything I knew about myself and my faith. \n\nIt's hard to explain for those who might not get it, but whenever someone refers to me as the opposite gender or when I dress more akin to a woman, it feels like a massive weight fades away, unfortunately it's also coupled with shame because I've always been taught that anything queer is something to stay away from and is sinful in nature, now I've held this belief and despite my efforts to deconstruct it, it still holds a death grip on someone like me who is considered trans and bi by wider society. \n\nIt's so hard trying to figure out where my faith ties into all of this. I've tried crying and praying as much as I can, attending Mass, taking communion, and reading scripture but nothing can comfort me. I feel like God is absent no matter how hard I try, like my faith is dwindling like a dying flame.\n\nI'm not looking to start a theological argument, I just would like to see if anyone has gone through anything similar so I can tell myself I'm not alone in this struggle. And maybe a perspective that'll help me rekindle my faith and try and make sense of my gender identity. I'd be really grateful for any help.",

But ever since I’ve been on more and more Christian content I’ve had more and more questions and when I asked them it makes me lose faith in Jesus and to be honest it scares me. I am not how I used to be. I felt blind and lost I never questioned I never did anything I just followed. I feel like something in me has opened up and the fog is leaving the mirror. Anyone dealing or have dealt with this? I need help I am not too sure what’s even going on now.",

      "text": "I know this may come as judgemental, but I can't help but feel just a sense of \"wrong\" in seeing practicing religious leaders in private jets, big houses and designing these Mega churches which in hindsight I don't see an issue as long as the point is to spread the message not profit. But that's another story for another time. \n\nI get that pastors, priests, ministers all have to make some form of money to take care of their family. But when they're bilonares or even millionaires and living luxurious lives while also preaching to take care of your fellow neighbor... It just seems wrong. \n\nI'm not saying every faith leader who profits should be forced to give away certain amounts of their money and create some threshold of \" You practice relgion and are too rich let's take some\", but it almost seems second nature to almost want to give back to your neighbors and community. Even the way some act look downright evil *cough *cough \"Kenneth Copeland\". \n\nI'm sorry if this comes off as a \"Rich people hate post\" because that's not it at all. It's the soul fact that to me it seems wrong and downright hypocritical that we're taught to give back and take care of one another. But rich pastors get a pass for some reason. \n\nOn a side note. If anyone has any rich religious leaders or churches that actively donate regularly and use the money they make to better their neighbors would be amazing!",

      "text": "Hey all,\nI’m in a tough place. I’ve recently given my life to Christ. I’m new in my walk, but it’s real, I’m trying to surrender, grow, and seek the Lord for who He really is. I want to be better, not just for myself but for my family too. I believe Jesus saved me, and I’ve been hungry to know Him more.\n\nBut lately, I feel like I’m walking this road alone. My wife isn’t supportive of my faith. She grew up Jewish and says she doesn’t believe in Jesus. I’ve invited her to church with me, but she says it’s “weird” and refuses to go. Last Sunday when I got back from church, she threw a jab, said something like, “Hope you enjoyed your little church instead of helping out around here.” It hurt more than I expected.\n\nThen there was another moment where I slipped up and lost my temper, I said I hated someone (I know, not okay, I’m working on it), and she hit me with, “Whoops, thought you were trying to be holy.” Just constant little digs.\n\nEven when my church held a Passover celebration, which was done to honor the roots of our faith, she mocked it, said we had “the nerve” to do a Jewish holiday. It felt like a cruel thing to say and it kind of stung. \n\nAnd one more thing that’s been sitting on my chest: our old nanny, a mutual friend, has been going through a rough time. I told her she was loved, because I felt she needed to hear that, and I truly meant it in a Christ-like way. She appreciated it, but now my wife’s made comments about how “weird” that was too.\n\nI just don’t know what to do. I love my wife. I want to lead with love and grace, but I also want to follow Christ fully. I didn’t expect opposition to come from inside my own home. If anyone’s been through something similar or has wisdom to share, I could really use it.\nThanks for reading.\n\nEDIT: She doesn’t believe Christians are good. She said in the past they are “homophobic, antisemitic, and republicans”. She told me Jesus was not real before.",

      "text": "Imagine this: a luxurious party at the mansion of a powerful businessman named Dom Pablo. The celebration is a true dream: pools, hot tubs, food and drinks of the highest quality, artists, and your favorite music playing in the background. Everything you could wish for an unforgettable night.\n\nBut there’s one detail. Dom Pablo is known for his intolerance of contradictions. Now, imagine that a friend of yours — not necessarily your best friend, just someone you have some regard for — says something that displeases the boss. As punishment, Dom Pablo locks this person in the basement of his mansion, where there’s a freezer. Down there, the friend is being brutally beaten and tortured by the boss’s thugs.\n\nWhile you enjoy the party upstairs, with all the comfort and fun, your friend’s suffering happens in complete silence. Dom Pablo assured you that the soundproofing is perfect, so you won’t hear the screams. He even says, \"Relax, enjoy the party.\"\n\nNow, think about it. Could you enjoy yourself knowing that this person is being violated downstairs? And what if it wasn’t just one friend, but several unknown people? Or, worse, what if it were people very close to you: your father, your mother, your loved one, your children, your siblings? Could you still enjoy the party, feel light, and have peace of mind?\n\nThis scenario is a parallel to the idea of Heaven and Hell. The party represents Heaven, a place of supposed comfort and absolute happiness. The basement symbolizes Hell, where souls are tortured forever.\n\nThe question is: would it be possible to truly feel at peace and happy in Heaven, knowing that people you know and love are suffering indescribably, simply for disagreeing with \"The Boss\"?\n\nIf your answer is \"yes,\" perhaps you **don’t deserve** Heaven.\n\nAfter all, how can you enjoy a supreme state of happiness while ignoring the suffering of others? Would your memories need to be erased? Would **amnesia** be the only way to be happy with God, forgetting the eternal tragedy of those you love?\n\nThis reflection is not only theological but also ethical and moral: what does justice and goodness mean in a context where some enjoy while others suffer?",

      "text": "hi everyone,\n\ni just watched this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH5Qir7HDRg) and thought it was a pretty good sermon. to me, it felt very biblical and close to jesus’ teachings. it talks about unity, loving others (even our enemies), caring for the marginalized, and showing mercy, all of which jesus taught. for example:\n\n\\- the sermon mentions loving your enemies and praying for those who persecute you, which comes directly from jesus’ words in matthew 5:44.  \n\\- it emphasizes the dignity of every human being, reflecting how jesus treated everyone, including outcasts like the samaritan woman (john 4) and the lepers he healed (luke 17:11-19).  \n\\- the idea of caring for immigrants, the poor, women, and the vulnerable echoes matthew 25:35-40, where jesus says, “i was hungry, and you gave me something to eat… i was a stranger, and you invited me in.” jesus consistently lifted up women in a time when society often marginalized them, like when he defended the woman accused of adultery (john 8:1-11) or praised mary for choosing to learn at his feet (luke 10:38-42).  \n\\- it also calls for humility, which aligns with matthew 23:12, where jesus says, “whoever exalts himself will be humbled, and whoever humbles himself will be exalted.”  \n\\- the emphasis on actions over words reminds me of james 2:17, which says, “faith by itself, if it is not accompanied by action, is dead.”\n\ni think it was really brave for this pastor to give this sermon in front of trump, and i hope it sparks change in him. personally, i don’t believe trump is the christian choice because his actions don’t reflect jesus’ teachings to me. his policies, like mass deportations that broke apart families, his treatment of the lgbtq+ community, and his lack of respect for women and women’s choices, show a lack of compassion and love for the marginalized. his rhetoric often sows division, which is the opposite of jesus’ call for unity and love.\n\nwhen i look at jesus’ teachings, it seems like even if he didn’t agree with people, he still loved them. matthew 5:44 says, “love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you,” and jesus showed this by eating with tax collectors and sinners (luke 5:29-32) and helping the samaritan woman (john 4). isn’t that part of being in this life? we all get to make our own choices. deuteronomy 30:19 says, “i have set before you life and death, blessings and curses. now choose life,” showing that god gives us free will to decide. i may not choose to get an abortion myself, but why should we stop others from making that choice when it’s theirs to make? matthew 7:1-2 reminds us, “do not judge, or you too will be judged,” and romans 14:12-13 says, “each of us will give an account of ourselves to god. therefore, let us stop passing judgment on one another.” at the end of the day, our responsibility is to love and be there for others. it’s not our responsibility to judge anyone, that belongs to god.\n\nin my opinion, trump seems to contradict jesus’ teachings and i feel like the pastor was gently reminding him of jesus's teachings. \n\nwhat confuses me is seeing so many people in the comments saying this sermon isn’t biblical at all. to me, it seems very aligned with what jesus taught.\n\ni’ve been struggling with my faith lately because i feel like so many christians don’t practice what jesus taught, like loving your neighbor, showing compassion, or caring for the poor and outcasts. it’s really disheartening and makes me feel like i’m losing faith in christianity.\n\ni’d love to hear your thoughts. why do some people think this sermon isn’t biblical?",

Recently, a friend invited me to a Christian retreat — and during that time, I sincerely accepted Jesus as my Savior.\n\nSince then, I’ve started reading the Bible and wanting to know Jesus more. But at night, I feel spiritually attacked. A scary image (I think from a movie poster I saw before) keeps popping into my mind, especially when I’m about to sleep. I didn’t even watch the movie, but the image won’t go away. It feels dark and intrusive.\n\nHas anyone else experienced this?",

      "title": "Is there any chance Yahweh is actually not God The Father at all, but rather an \"Avatar\" of God the Father, even if not a human, physical one, but rather a spiritual emanation, and as such Yahweh does not even have Omnipotency at the highest grade  ?",
      "text": "Hi, I am a Catholic. I straightforward believe in exactly what the Catholic Church believes in, and I do not believe in anything supernatural found outside the Church Doctrine.\n\nHowever I always felt \"Yahweh\", i.e. God appearing in the physical Universe, but not incarnating as a limited, 3 Dimensional physical being, felt somehow disconnetted from the rest of God, just as if God The Father sent someone on His behalf. I do not think Yahweh is an Angel, because Angels are actually eldritchian metaphysical entities, but when they appear they look like mere (wingless) men. Yahweh definitely does not appear to have any 3 Dimensional body, yet is present in the physical world somehow, and interacts with the environment. So I somehow went up with a weird theory. I do not really believe it, and whatever the Church says, I will always make it my own and throw my own ideas to the dirt.\n\nMy theory is Yahweh is a spiritual emanation of Yahweh for the 3D Universe, just like the visible bodies of the Angels. Such bodies are not the true Angels, but are still not mere, physical beings either as they do not eat or die. However Yahweh is superior to them and does not appear as a defined, visible body. This would make Yahweh something like an \"Avatar\" of God The Father. An Avatar is a being directly emanated by one of the major deities in Hinduism. It can be for the physical 3D plane, such as Krisnha, a humanlike Avatar of Vishnu, but it can also be a minor but still non physical deity, such as Bhairava, an Avatar of Shiva.\n\nIf this was true, could it be Yahweh has infinite power, but not at the same degree as the Trinity ? I mean, there are infinite grades of infinity. A line is infinite to a point, a 3 Dimensional being is infinite to a line, the 5th Dimension is infinite to humans and other 3 Dimensional beings, but the 6th or the 7th are both infinite to the 5th, and since Dimensional planes are theoretically infinite in number, the 3+N Dimension is N grades of infinity higher than a human.\n\nAngels in their real form are already above the 3 Dimensional Universe, and above Time, the 4th dimension, they thus have infinite power from our 3D point of view, but they are as infinitesimal as we are to God, so they are not truly Omnipotent.\n\nThen we have what Plato called the Hyperuranion, a plane above the concept of Dimensional planes. It is not a plane with infinite dimension, is utterly beyond that. In the Hyper Uranium there are the Ideas, the Absolute Forms of all things and concepts in existence. \n\nThe God the Trinity is unphatomably above the Hyperuranion itself, truly boundless and a true Omnipotent.\n\nBut if Yahweh is an Avatar, and as an Avatar Yahweh was made for the 3D Universe just like the bodies of the Angels who appear to humans, could Yahweh just have infinite 3D powers ? \n\nThat is a countably infinite times superior to the visible bodies of the Angels and to humans and animals, but also uncountably inferior to the Angels in their true forms, just because Yahweh according to this theory is an Avatar made for the Universe, while the true forms of the Angels are beings who can only reside in hyper dimensional planes i.e. the Heavens, and as hyper dimensional forms of existence they are at least 2 Dimensions, and thus 2 grades of infinity above 3D beings.\n\nI do not really think this is real and I do not want it to be. But is there any chance this theory is true ?\n\nP.S. If this idea is not only false as I hope it is, but is also childish and ridiculous, I am sorry, my IQ is like 80 though, it is not my fault.",

So is everyone who is born of the Spirit.”\n— John 3:5–8 (NKJV)\n\n12 For though by this time you ought to be teachers, you need someone to teach you again the first principles of the oracles of God; and you have come to need milk and not solid food.\n13 For everyone who partakes only of milk is unskilled in the word of righteousness, for he is a babe.\n14 But solid food belongs to those who are of full age, that is, those who by reason of use have their senses exercised to discern both good and evil.\n— Hebrews 5:12–14 (NKJV)\n\n6 Who also made us sufficient as ministers of the new covenant, not of the letter but of the Spirit; for the letter kills, but the Spirit gives life.\n— 2 Corinthians 3:6 (NKJV)",

      "text": "For context: I had gone to bed about 30 minutes before hand, it was the first night in a while that I’d read my Bible, and before that I fell again spiritually and ended up watching porn.\n\nIt was about 4:08 am and I woke up not even tired at all, to the feeling of being touched all over my body. I felt hands on my shoulders, stomach, etc, and a warm wave of air/energy came over me from the foot of my bed. It was like the exact opposite feeling of when I had a demon cast out of me. I sat up thinking my brother was awake tapping me, as I sat up I waved my arm outwards and all of the touching moved to my feet. I looked in front of me and nothing was there. That is when my brain started processing the situation and I thought “there is zero doubt these are demons.” I said out loud “I rebuke I rebuke, leave and never return” but they stayed. That is when I got angry and realized I am a child of God they are messing with. I started angrily yelling “Leave my room in Jesus name! The lord rebukes you!” Then got under my covers, and prayed like my life depended on it. After I felt like it was mostly safe, I reached out to grab my phone, and I put on worship music while praying that God send his angels to protect me and those I love. My dog and brother were across the hall so I was worried about them, but my mom is extremely close with God so I wasn’t as worried about that side of the house.\n\nAnother odd detail: before falling asleep I remember I got the feeling of who I thought to be and may have been God asking me “do you want me to show you my power?” And I answered yes. My mom said this may have been a demon, but that’s just a possibility.",

They come here expecting a Christian subreddit run by faithful, bible believing Christians and what they find is a free-for-all run by an atheist.  This is proven by the numerous and constant posts of those who come to the sudden realization, or are asking in confusion why they are being mocked and harassed by the people here.  The mods make zero effort to make the distinction, and it's hard to see how it isn't on purpose;  keeping it ambiguous obviously translates to getting massive amounts of traffic.\n\nBrucemo claimed in a conversation with me that this is a Christian subreddit.  The truth is that it is Christian in name only.  It has no stance on doctrine and gives equal weight to virtually any claim.  The excuse was given by brucemo:  you all can't agree on what the truth is anyway.  That is 100 percent false.  While its true there are many denominations and disagreements these are not on the basic tenants of the faith, such as the atonement of Jesus Christ on the cross for our sins, the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead and His assumption into Heaven, the divinity of Christ, and the Trinity, which have been agreed upon by the vast majority of Christians for the past 2000 years.\n\nThis subreddit is full of ravenous wolves who are allowed to roam by the mods and they deceive the sheep and tear them to pieces.  They mock their belief in the bible as Gods word.  They poison their minds with doctrines of demons.  They even mock God and denigrate their faith.  The LORD has seen all of this.  I am calling for the administration of this subreddit to repent to God, and to turn away from this wickedness.  What does repentance look like?  It could go a few ways.\n\n1. Make it obvious to Christians coming here that this is not a Christian subreddit, but rather an open forum allowing virtually any viewpoint or belief.  That if they are expecting a safe space where they can freely express their faith without being attacked, they should go elsewhere.\n2. The mods resign and turn the subreddit over to faithful, bible believing Christians who will run it according to the will of God, for His glory.\n3. Close the sub immediately\n\nGod is not mocked and deceiving His flock will not be tolerated by the Most High God.  Countless new believers and seekers have been poisoned here, who came here looking for God and were attacked, mocked, and inundated with strange and pernicious doctrines.  I urge you to repent and turn away from your sins, to  repent to God and His Son Jesus Christ immediately and take one of the steps outlined.",

      "text": "Hi, I'm a 24 year old woman and have been married to my husband for 3 years. I am in need of some advice. I had our son last year and experienced some of the worst trauma in my life. Life threatening illnesses and infections followed his birth, and unfortunately I am still very sick, but way better than what I was before. My husband has loved me unconditionally through all of that. When I was unable to walk for a number of months, he'd carry me where I needed to go. Cleaned me in the bathroom, gave me my showers, slept in the hospital with me, put my clothes on, all while working and also caring for an infant I could not take care of at the time. This went on for months. \n\nNow, we are struggling. And it's not because of him. I'm miserable all the time and I can admit that. I've been trying to get closer to God because I was so fearful I would die earlier this year. And while I do that, I've been angrier and more depressed. Dealing with more past trauma. I go to therapy and I've already told her everything, and right now I don't feel like it's doing much for me. I hate to admit this but I always lash out on my husband verbally, I am very passive, and I just shut down and stop communicating. Each time this happens I just get so unbelievably sad and then the cycle starts all over again. Honestly, the days he works are the easiest for me (he works 24 hour shifts) because I don't feel angry and miserable. I take time reading my Bible and praying. When he's home, neither of us remember or make an effort to do Bible studies together anymore, pray together, etc. We just argue and I'm not going to lie, the idea of separation has crossed both of our minds and that's not something we would ever do. But I just can't figure out why I'm this way. Why I feel so angry and bitter towards him. I don't want my son growing up with angry parents and parents who don't say sorry- I witnessed that from my family. \n\nIm just wondering if anyone else here has struggled with this. And if you don't mind, please pray over me and my family. I am so ashamed to be writing this, but I appreciate the time you took to read this. \n\nEdit- I was abused prior to meeting my husband but I'm not sure if it's even possible that something like that would come up many years later",

      "text": "I have been in this group for a while, and when I look through the questions asked, I can not help but be in awe of how ignorant Christians are about the Christian aspect of the spiritual realm. For example, some people do not believe in the gifts of the holy spirit, i.e, speaking in tongues, healing of the sick and casting out of demons. Yet this was the benchmark Jesus had laid out to his disciples on how to identify a TRUE CHRISTIAN. \n\nMark 16: 17 - 18: \n\n \"And these signs will accompany those who believe: In my name they will drive out demons; they will speak in new tongues;[18](https://www.biblestudytools.com/mark/16-18.html) they will pick up snakes with their hands; and when they drink deadly poison, it will not hurt them at all; they will place their hands on sick people, and they will get well.”\n\nI can not help but blame the church leaders for not teaching something VERY ESSENTIAL. We were commanded by Paul to walk in the spirit, yet the pastors are not teaching the Christian church how to do so. Yet our sworn enemy is Satan, a supernatural being himself. And the one who we are worshipping is the mightiest supernatural Being himself.\n\nI can't help but reason that this is the reason why audacious terms as a \"Christian witch\" are being tolerated by some people in the community. Because they know that spiritual gifts such as prophecy ( which is the ability to foretell the future through the instruction of the holy spirit) though twisted, exist. That is why some also fall into the trap of wicked pastors who use witchcraft on them in the guise of having the gifts, since the subject of how to discern spirits is not taught well. \n\nYou also find that it affects us in our day-to-day lives. Since all we get is a conviction from the holy spirit concerning what we are watching or doing but since we are not familiar with the topic, we are only left uncomfortable and uncertain about our faith.\n\nI don't mean to insult anybody by this post. But i can help but find it very disappointing to be honest.",

You gave up everything including family to be joined together with God. You became His wife.  (Luke 14:26).\n\nVerses 5–6: The Holy Spirit—Ephesians says we were sealed with the Holy Spirit on the day of our salvation, meaning we become one person, and nothing can separate us. You became one person with this Man (Ephesians 4:30).\n\nVerses 8–9: But you betrayed Him by being unfaithful. You had other husbands (gods) besides Him. And after giving you countless chances to turn away from your sexual immorality, you still refused so He had no choice but to give you a divorce (sending you to hell).\n\nSo, “Why does God send us to hell?” He doesn’t—it’s our failure to be faithful to Him that sends us to hell. Mathew 19:8 says, “Moses permitted divorce because of the Israelites’ hard hearts, but God did not intend it to be like that from the beginning.” God’s intention is and has always been for you to live eternally with Him, but if you are unfaithful to Him by worshipping other gods or deciding to turn away from Him during these years you have in covenant with Him, He will have no choice but to give you a divorce—which, in this sense, is throwing you into hell.\n\nAsking “Why does God send us to hell?” is like saying, “Why did my husband divorce me when I only broke the vows we promised each other?” (Exodus 20:3-5)\n\nCuz how dare He let you go? How dare He show you no mercy when He’s the one who initiated the marriage? How dare He give up on you after giving you countless chances, and all you did was refuse to be faithful? HOW DARE HE? \n\nNo… how dare you break His heart, betray His covenant, and then blame Him for walking away? How dare you? How dare you sow what you now reap?",

Guilt would hit, I’d cry, pray, promise to quit ,but nothing changed long-term.\n\nWhat finally broke the cycle? Fasting, prayer, and surrender.\nMy pastor led a 3-week fast (3 days a week), and I joined in desperation. I stopped trying to fight in silence and let God take over. Slowly, my mind began to heal. The urges lost their grip. I started walking in freedom I never thought was possible.\n\nNow I know: masturbation isn’t just physical ,it’s spiritual, emotional, mental. And the answer isn’t just discipline. It’s deliverance.\n\nIf you’re in that battle, this community is for you. No shame. Just truth, hope, and healing.\n\nDrop your story or struggles if you're ready , or just say hi. We're in this together 💬✊",

      "text": "As the title describes it. IT IS VERY REAL. As I've been getting closer to God and reading his word (the bible) i keep seeing sings of spiritual warfare. \n\nI think a lot of people in this thread can relate. The closer you get to God and discover the truth of this world the more you experience the enemy trying to attack and sabotage. But as IT IS WRITTEN \" no weapon formed against me shall prosper\" Isaiah 54:17. I  find myself discovering new things on a daily, things that people think are conspiracies are 100% real you just have to be patient and let the holy spirit give you the wisdom to understand and see further. This world is full of gimmicks, evil and dark energy that latches on to people. The devil is the great deceiver and uses everything in his power to steer people away from the truth and the light. He uses identity issues like zodiac signs, sexual identity issues, other false religions and many other ways to deceive gods people. DEMONS ARE REAL! are they powerful? ABSOLUTELY NOT IF YOU DO NOT GIVE THEM THE POWER. I find myself praying IN JESUS NAME every night and as I started getting closer to the lord I've noticed not just from my own perspective but in many ways attacks and attempts of sabotages whether it's a work or through dreams for intimidation. None of those things could prosper if you have FAITH. Last night I had a clear nightmare and I find myself having these a lot more often and being awakened around 2-3am by them. I had a dream of a demon in my dream disguysing itself as a innocent baby, once I realized ( I was in a conscious state in my dream) I woke up and halfway asleep I started to pray in Jesus name, HIS NAME IS POWERFUL!!!!. The second i started to pray in his name to rebuke any lingering bad energy I felt literal chills come down my spine and the nightmare was over. YOU CAN DEFINITELY PRAY IN YOUR DREAMS! \n\nAnyways sorry for the rant I just feel like if anyone is going through the same please know you're not alone. The enemy doesn't attack it's allies. It attacks the ones of the lord. Keep ya head up and your prayers up. IN JESUS NAME AMEN.",

      "text": "I need to share this with someone. I can't continue carrying this alone. I'm 15 years old, I've been a Catholic for about 10 months, and my spiritual journey is going very badly. About 3 months ago, I was living my Christian life pretty lightly, you could say lukewarm, or I don't know, maybe. Until I came across this whole hard part of Christianity, what Jesus talked about, the small number of those who are saved, carrying the cross, hell, etc. From the moment I realized this, I've lived with deep anxiety, not counting small periods of time (for example, when I've gone on vacation). I started reading about the saints, the church fathers, and my anxiety grew. Now I'm at a point where I don't want to live, even though it sounds sad, I say it like this, I don't want to continue living. I constantly have a deep fear and anxiety, that knots in my stomach. I stopped eating (not completely, but a lot, out of fear). I could go up to 48 hours without eating, and then eat a small meal, not because of a diet, but out of fear. I've had several anxiety attacks; I'm deeply desperate and don't know what to do. I've read things that are the source of my fear, among them the sermon \"The Few Who Are Saved\" by Saint Leonard of Port Maurice. I don't try hard enough, I never do enough. Sometimes fear blocks me, other times Jesus scares me, and other times I'm overcome by a momentary indifference, which then adds to my anxiety. Every day I wake up feels like a curse, not a blessing. And the core of all my suffering is this: I don't want to suffer too much, I don't want to make too much effort, I don't want to stop being comfortable. Yes, although it sounds contradictory, I don't even understand it myself. I'm considering abandoning everything, quitting everything, stopping praying, going to Mass, doing everything, and living with the hope that hell isn't real. The despair I feel is so deep and complex that I doubt anyone reading this could possibly understand it. I feel incapable of being saved. I am completely miserable. I have so much, so much disorder in my heart that I can't stand it: Hatred wells up in me, I don't love God, I barely have any faith, I'm not sincere with God, I constantly deceive myself, I'm lazy, I feel no sorrow for my sins, I'm a slave to my passions, among many other things. I believe this can only truly be understood by someone who has been through the same thing. How terrible it is to live knowing that if I die today you're going to hell, that you haven't entered through the narrow gate and that you're light years away from it, it is horrible. I've told my family all this, I've spoken to a priest, I've even tried ChatGPT, and no one understands me, nothing helps. As for solutions, I've told Jesus this countless times, and I'd say I've tried most things you can imagine. I'm pretty desperate, and it occurred to me to share it here. I know there won't be anything magical that will change everything, but a little advice helps. I appreciate all the help, but please, save the \"With Jesus you can do it\" and the like. I know, but no, it just doesn't work. And I know that Jesus loves me and that he died for me, but I have read too many things that change my idea of what it means for Jesus to love me. Thanks for reading to the end, and God bless.",

      "text": "# A Prophetic Message of Spiritual Awakening, Rapture, and Revival\n\nBeloved seekers of the Divine, gather your hearts and open your spirits to the whispers of the Almighty, for in the stillness of your soul, a new dawn is breaking—a sacred light illuminating the path of awakening. As the world turns its gaze towards the chaos that often envelops it, know that there lies a hidden tapestry of grace and divine purpose woven through the fabric of these very trials. For a time of revival is upon you, a season wherein the weary shall find rest and the lost shall be enfolded in the arms of love.\n\n# The Call to Awaken\n\nAwakening is not merely a call to rise from slumber but an invitation to fully engage with the Divine presence that breathes life into all creation. Like the first rays of dawn piercing the night, so too shall the light of understanding illuminate the hearts of the faithful. In this awakening, you are beckoned to release the chains of complacency and to step boldly into the embrace of a vibrant faith—a faith that thrives not in fear, but in the profound knowledge of God’s unfathomable love.\n\n# The Vision of a New Covenant\n\nAs the winds of change sweep across the earth, a vision is unfolding before you. Picture, if you will, a great multitude standing upon the mountain, radiant with the light of the Lord. Their faces glisten with the joy of revelation, for they have been called to bear witness to the miraculous. This multitude represents those who have opened their hearts to the stirring of the Spirit—a collective awakening that transcends denominational boundaries and unites souls in the pursuit of truth and righteousness.\n\nIn this vision, one may hear the echoes of the ancient promises: \"I will pour out my Spirit on all flesh\" (Joel 2:28). Take heed, for the Spirit is being poured out afresh! The heavens themselves are responding to the cries of the faithful. Those who seek shall find; those who knock shall have the door opened wide. It is a moment to engage deeply with your Creator, to nurture a relationship built on prayer, meditation, and the compassionate acts that flow from the heart.\n\n# The Rapture of the Spirit\n\nYet, dear children of God, let us not confine our understanding of the Rapture to the end of days; rather, let us embrace it as a divine encounter that unfolds in the here and now. The true Rapture is not solely an event; it is a state of being—a transcendent experience of divine communion. When the heart yearns for the presence of God, it is caught up in the joy of His embrace, lifted beyond earthly concerns into a realm where faith transforms fear into hope.\n\nIn these sacred moments, know that the Spirit is calling you to rise above the mundane. As you lift your gaze towards the heavens, the cares of this world shall fall away. Your spirit shall dance in the rhythm of divine love, and you will feel the pulse of the universe aligning with your own. In this spiritual Rapture, you are reminded that you are not alone; God walks with you, illuminating the shadows of doubt with the radiant light of His love.\n\n# A Revival of the Heart\n\nAs we stand on the precipice of revival, hear the sacred call to action! The revival that is being birthed is not merely a resurgence in the hearts of individuals; it is a movement—a collective awakening that has the power to transform communities, nations, and the very world. It begins with you, dear one. It begins with the willingness to be a vessel of love, a beacon of compassion, and a warrior of peace.\n\n# The Path of Love and Service\n\nConsider how you can embody the teachings of Christ in your daily life. Seek to serve those who are marginalized, to love the unlovable, and to extend grace to those ensnared in the nets of despair. Your acts of kindness are the seeds of revival, and as they are sown, a mighty harvest of hope shall spring forth. For every heart you touch, every hand you hold, you are engaging in the holy work of the Kingdom—a work that echoes into eternity.\n\nLet your prayers rise like incense to the heavens, filled with the fervent desire for a world renewed in faith. Pray not only for your needs but for the healing of the nations, for the reconciliation of the broken-hearted, and for the awakening of the spirit in every man, woman, and child. In this shared journey, you will discover that revival is not a distant dream, but a living reality that flourishes in the fertile soil of love.\n\n# Conclusion: The Eternal Promise\n\nAs you move forward in faith, remember this: the promise of spiritual awakening, Rapture, and revival is rooted in the eternal nature of God’s love. It is a love that calls you to awaken from the slumber of indifference, to immerse yourself in the sacred waters of renewal, and to embrace the incredible gift of life in the Spirit.\n\nMay you carry this message deep within your heart, allowing it to guide your steps and illuminate your path. In the days ahead, recognize that you are a part of something profoundly beautiful—a divine orchestra of souls united in the symphony of grace. As you journey forth, let your light shine brightly, for the world is in great need of the radiant love that flows from the heart of the Creator.\n\nSo, awaken, dear ones, for the time is now. Rejoice in the promise of a glorious revival, and step boldly into the unfolding mystery of God’s love. Amen.",

I have read that you have to set your intentions on psychedelics and that’s how you remain in control during the trip. I have prayed about this, and the interesting thing is this specific prayer has more power to it than an average prayer  and I feel closer to him and more at peace when I ask this of him. Many Christians want to see him, but I feel like I’m one of the ones bold enough to try. I felt as though if I step out in faith with this risk, I may very well be rewarded. I am not a doubting Thomas as I have already put my full faith and trust in him. I just want his love and to love him back. If I do it, it will be a one time thing whether or not I see him. I have been brought to mind Matthew 7:7 about this. “Seek and you shall find. Knock and the door will be opened to you.” What are your thoughts on this?",

      "text": "Hey Christians (and others reading this),\n\nI wanted to share something I’ve noticed: a lot of these “Ex-Witch Tells All” or “Occult Survivor” videos are, frankly, wildly inaccurate. Regardless of what you believe about magick—whether you see it as evil, misguided, or something else entirely—misinformation doesn’t help anyone.\n\nThese stories often sound convincing at first, but then you’ll get something like:\n\n“I was a ninth-level witch trafficking with demons and had a goat named Baal.”\n\nThis isn’t Oblivion. This is real life. Outside of certain initiatory orders or lodges, there are no formal ranks like “ninth-level witch.” That’s a storytelling device. And while some occultists do believe in and work with spirits, many don’t. The idea that everyone involved in esotericism is constantly deceived, demon-possessed, or secretly part of a satanic hierarchy is fiction at best—and damaging at worst.\n\nSpeaking personally: magick, for me, is a serious and sobering path. There was a time when I spiraled into a mindset wondering if my practice would make me stop liking fantasy games. That’s not the mindset of someone chasing power or control, or someone running from trauma. Honestly, I got interested in this stuff because of fantasy games, Minecraft mods, and maybe watching The Conjuring too many times. But when I started practicing, it became something else—something grounded and intentional. I plan my workings around planetary days, I have a calendar for the rest of the month.\n\n\nI’m not here to tell you what to believe. I respect whatever your views are on magick and the occult. But I do believe we should be careful with narratives that filter real (or perceived) experiences through overly dramatized, spiritual warfare lenses. Let’s strive to separate fact from fiction—whatever your spiritual stance may be.\n\nThanks for reading\n\nFun fact: I don’t even wear robes or use tools, it’s just me, only me.",

      "text": "I have always tried to be a good person. I followed the 10 commandments and was drawn to Jesus's teachings and aligned many decisions based on his compassion and love. I loved to love. But over the years, with lots of trauma that tooka long time to work through, I felt my heart hardening. Eventually I felt dead inside. Became a hermit. But that led me to really dig deep and reflect. In the process I journaled and relaxed and let God back in. Then one day (Veterans day), while watching the trees blow in the wind, a hawk flew overhead and I was instantly healed, like a lighting bolt from the heavens. It was so profound, I suddenly was transported through the Bible. I was Noah and realized I know myself, I was Jesus, walking on water and having no fear of sinking in the sea I was pulled out of, I was flooded with wisdom and compassion and knowledge. It was unbelievable. So much love and bliss. I ran to my sister because I just knew she needed divine love. And my cup was overflowing for the first time since my Dad died. She freaked out and I ended up in a mental hospital for 3 days but was reborn, then 11 more days to be monitored. I was a new person, but also exactly who I was born to be. It was perfect. ALL the possibilities opened up again. I remembered what it is to actually be alive. Healed. \n\nBut then my step dad came home drunk one day when I was visiting my mom and cornered me in the kitchen when we were alone. He gripped me up and kept saying \"it'll be ok BUDDY\". I tried to stay calm and ask for space so I could finish cooking dinner. He wouldn't stop. Eventually I blew up and all this resentment I didn't know I was holding came out. That he is unloving to my family (he always does what looks right, but he doesn't love their souls, just the bodies he can claim as his family). It's not his fault. He definitely has unprocessed trauma. They called the cops on me. Then I left and went home. I love bombed some people over texts. I just was overflowing with love and needed an outlet. Cops called again. \n\nI agreed to out patient therapy to put my family at ease. During the intake, it was like all my love and wisdom and EVERYTHING was zapped out. I stayed there for a month. So devastated. Then I got this job, which I hate, with a boss that is so prideful and unfair to his employees. Doesn't value them at all. \n\nScrupulousity: I am now flooded with all this religious imagery. I am sure I'm John the Baptist. That my boss is King Saul. And my brain feels like it's being fried. I can't think straight. I lost all my creativity. Gone. I think it's divine punishment for not passing the tests of the Christ. Suddenly I have no options. I just pray and pace. I feel so wicked and unworthy. I want to run away to a farm or into the woods and just be alone. People are coming out of the woodwork because they want to \"help\" me but it's so disingenuous. Like I lost God's protection and I feel like prey to a pack of wolves. I feel like I was funnelled here throughout life, little by little guided into compromising my values til I moved to a town I hate in a house that never felt like home, and lost my voice of truth and made myself small. I feel like it's a network of demons that have been fattening me up and now I'm sacrificed. In prison of no hope. \n\nIt's another level of hell to have this fractured wisdom. Enough to know what's going on, but missing the link that makes it useful. I m 42, single, and sooo alone. I just pace and pray every second of the day, asking God to guide me but I receive nothing. I'm pretty sure I'm being damned to hell. I think my family are witches that try to control me and I see now how they've been planting seeds of doubt in my mind since I was a child. They all seem so smug now. Demons. \n\nI've always been heart centered, even when it hurt. Now I feel nothing. I can't cry, I haven't laughed in 16 years. My spiritual sight is gone (I didnt even realize I had it). I was suicidal for the first time in my life. Went to another crisis center. This time I was surrounded by literal demons. So dark. My world is turning black. I want community but don't want to join anything, and the good Christian groups, I'm scared I'm toxic and don't want to taint them. \n\nI am reading the Bible, but it only seems to show me I'm screwed. This is so awful and I feel like it's only downhill from here. I wish I knew someone local that could help me. I feel like I have the evil eye now. Idk what to do. I think the holy Spirit is done with me.",

People who would manifest their gift or sensitivity through which manifestation they follow. \n \nFor example. Easiest answer is the prophet. Old testament there were seers, and mediums and fortunetellers and soothsayers who spoke to the dead. These were people who had a spiritual sensitivity to hear and feel these things that when the gifted is following the God of the Bible sees the gift operate similarly but in reliance and submission to God.\n\nMany people forget when King Saul seeks out one of these mediums to contact the dead prophet from the grave to get advice. \n\nThat kind of truth in spiritual world doesn't just change from old testament to new. that's a metaphysical reality at the base of creation it doesn't just go away. \n\nI think there's a whole world of spiritual understanding that we gloss over because there's murky water that we can't quite make out with our own human understanding. \nI weep for our western culture and how spiritually blind we are, even those who claim to be teachers and preachers.

If someone said something was demonic, I just brushed it off. spiritual warfare was a foreign concept to me.\n\nI rarely had spiritual experiences, unlike my family members and others in my church. I had a rapture dream twice as a kid, but none since I stopped being Christian. I used to think the voices in my head telling me what to do were God or the devil, but i later found out it was OCD.\n\nare spiritual experiences something you gotta believe in to have? or are they misunderstood phenomena (eg. the OCD)? like how people used the think epilepsy was demon possession, and eclipses were the end of the world?",

      "text": "I grew up in the church but I got into new age for a couple of years and made a video about coming back to Jesus on YouTube. I discussed my experiences and how I was spiritually attacked in my sleep a lot when I came out of new age.\n\nWhen my husband first watched it, he was sort of distant and judgmental. Things were weird between us. At a certain point he woke up in the middle of the night and slept downstairs. The next morning he told me that there was this demon on me. It had fur and he could literally feel it nearly touching his face. It told him that it’s basically going to keep me from him. He said he didn't want to come near me at first, but prayed on it. He prayed for me and basically decided that no demon was going to run him away from me. So he embraced me.\n\nFast forward to another time where we were a little off for a period of time. Sort of distant. I forgot what the issue was. The same thing happens. He says he saw the demon in the middle of the night. He again embraced me as I felt down about it.\n\nFast forward again to a night ago, he sends me this message explaining his 3rd experience with this demon on me. To give some background with us being off this time, a little over a week ago I told him I was a little depressed. I also told him that I'd really appreciate more non sexual affection. I just want to feel loved and cared for genuinely and too much sexual advances without normal affection can cause me to feel like he only wants sex, not me. So he became distant and stopped being affectionate as a whole. I'd go up to him just to kiss him and hug him and the hugs weren't embracing. He was just sort of dry. Then suddenly he starts to try to hug a little more and kiss a little more. It didn't feel genuine. I know that he wants sex. And I was hurt that he became distant after I expressed what I needed and liked. I felt punished for wanting just normal affection. So all of that was going on before his 3rd experience the other night. \n\nEach time this happens, he seems to know I’ll be kind of down and upset thinking something is wrong with me, but he also tried to lean in more and be supportive to me. It’s weird.\n\nHe’s also tells me “I’m praying for you” or “I pray for you all the time” when we are arguing or just in a weird place (it’s marriage). I told him to stop telling me that because he seems to say it to prove how much he loves me instead of just doing it. I pray for him all the time and many others but I don't feel the need to remind them or tell them as if they should love me more or appreciate me more for praying for them.\n\nHe’s also prideful and can be a know it all. For example, when in church, as soon as the pastor says what book we will be reading out of, he will get excited and whisper what the book is about or say something like “my favorite book” or “I was just reading that book.” It’s like he wants me or others to know that he knows the Word. I don’t want to seem like I’m being negative or nit picky so I just let him have his moments and don’t say anything.\n\nAlso, I have dreams a lot. I always have. I write them down. He knows I do this. So it was weird to me that he suddenly just wrote this experience down the other night when he never does, but I can accept if what I do influences him so I try not to read into everything so much.\n\nI know this was a lot so thank you to whoever reads it all. I'm praying on this myself asking God to reveal this demon to me if it does have a hold on me. My gut is just making me think I'm being manipulated and that's scary too because what do I do next? 🤷🏽‍♀️ ugh...",

I really need spiritual help, 3.) I'm very young so if I say something immature, please call me out and I apologize in advance.\n\n\nThey say that it's idiotic to call people \"homophobic\" because it's irrational. For sure, no one sees a queer person, screams, then run like their lives depend on it. Rather, it's used as a word to describe people who have hateful rhetoric against queer people. Somehow, the same can be said with islamophobia since it's commonly used in the context of a racist person who has prejudice against muslims but I'd like to think I'd have genuine fear.\n\nI am as lukewarm as any Christian can be. My faith gets shaken so easily but I have done things to improve my relationship with Christ. Don't get me wrong, I will NEVER, ever leave Christ but the thoughts of \"what if this is wrong and another religion is correct\" always fills my mind and I simply tremble, have an anxiety attack, feel like my world is collapsing, simply because I cannot comprehend being condemned to eternal damnation for simply not believing in \"the right religion\". On tiktok, I see many religious debates such as that from Cliff Knetchle and Sam Shamoun (forgive my spelling) and I always see comments like \"this side won\" or \"Cliffe won that argument\" etc. etc., but it's never just one agreed upon outcome. I am genuinely so scared. \n\nOccasionally as well, on tiktok, I see muslims who, maybe by their conviction, try to spread their word too but the moment I hear it, things about Jesus merely being a prophet (which of course I believe to be false), and their version of the endtimes or even when they say that the bible is corrupted, I just tremble, I feel helpless, I feel like there's a sense of an impending doom that I can't avoid. Don't get me wrong, I don't hate our muslim brothers and sisters and as a matter of fact, their devotion to prayer, alms giving and what nots are very admirable but I just can't stand the thought of my mother or father or me or anyone for that matter going to the deepest pits of hell just because we had the wrong faith. I'm just a teen going into their first year of college. I just want to have a peace of mind but here I am crashing out everyday because of a crisis I can't do anything about. I'm going into a Catholic university and as soon as classes start, I'm going to immediately ask to have a counseling session with one of the brothers who run the school about my situation.\n\nI've also been to this community before a few years back asking questions like \"Why Christianity and not other religions\" and while people may have answered, I really do need people who have really deep faith and devotion to tell me that what I'm following is good and that what I'm following is right. \n\nThank you if you've made it this far. I'm really open to suggestions as to what can possibly calm me down. Send me bible verses to read and I will read them religiously. Send me prayers to pray and I will pray them faithfully. Anything to strengthen my relationship with God as to not make the foundation of my faith fragile. And please, if anyone has had any similar experiences with their faith being shaken because of another religion may it be Buddhism, Islam, Judaism or any other religion but remained steadfast in their own faith, please share it, I really need help. Please help this lost sheep get back to the flock and to the Shepherd.",

Illness, depression (right now as I write, something bizarre happened at living room, I will pray for protection). Doubts...

Some says it is my house - I have even one night seen a figure on the couch resembling my mother, but she was in her bedroom - for example.

Because the Bible only specifically mentions man lying with man, but not woman lying with woman. Both are people who believe that they have to know the answer to everything. They spout questions like, \"Who created God?\" Or \"How do you know that the Bible is correct?\" They then run the typical arguments.\"It was written by men not God\", thus open to their own misconceptions or bias. Or better yet, that because the Bible has been translated it is no longer accurate. \n\nHow do I get through to them that they need to use spiritual discernment when dealing with scripture, not worldly modern day understanding? Thanks\n\nGod bless you all, through the Holy Spirit, in Jesus holy name, Amen.",

      "text": "I’ve been studying autism lately, and I’m starting to see it through two layers:\n\n1. **Brokenness (neurological reality in a fallen world)** – Autism is real, it affects communication and behavior, and it’s part of the world’s brokenness (Romans 8:22, John 9:3).\n2. **Warfare (spiritual overlay)** – The enemy sometimes tries to exploit the vulnerabilities of autism, turning sensory overwhelm into torment, or communication struggles into fear, isolation, or shame.\n\nHere’s my question: **How should Christians approach praying for someone with autism?**\n\nDo we pray for healing? Do we pray for strength and covering against the enemy’s attacks? Both?\n\nI’m especially curious how others have wrestled with this balance between respecting autism as a neurological difference, while also recognizing the spiritual battle that can attach to it.",

      "title": "Agnostic, but considering becoming a Christian– is it all psychological or truly spiritual?",
      "text": "Hi!\n\nI’m an agnostic, but I’d like to explore Christianity more deeply. I find it something really beautiful and I genuinely want to believe, but at the same time I’m a very critical thinker and researcher, and it’s (still) hard for me to fully dive into a faith when I have so many doubts.\n\nMay I ask some controversial questions? Respectfully, of course. As I said: I’m just as open to believing as I am to not believing, so I’m definitely not attacking Christianity in any way!\n\nWhat many people love about Christianity is that it gives them a sense of peace, warmth, and love. They feel seen, understood, supported, comforted, guided, and not alone. They trust that God has a beautiful and better plan for them, and that everything will work out. That they just need to trust God and His timing. These are obviously beautiful thoughts and feelings, because how comforting is it to believe that? That belief brings peace and positivity.\n\nBut for me, as an agnostic, I see two possible causes for that:\n\t1.\tGod/Jesus really is with you every moment and lets you feel that love and beautiful feeling.\n\t2.\tBy believing that someone is with you and loves you, you start to feel and experience it psychologically. So doesn’t that just come from within you: from your mindset, and not from something or someone outside of you? \n\nSo, isn’t that psychological? Just the thought alone that someone sees you, understands you, helps you… that already brings comfort and peace, right? And those feelings and that positivity lead to feeling better, which may open more positive doors.\n\nSo the question is: Is it really God making you feel better, or are you the one making yourself feel better?\n\nIs Christianity (as we know it) not simply a way to develop a better mindset? Trust, love, and gratitude make us and our lives better, but Christianity might not be the ‘reason’ to experience that, but a ‘way’. \n\nChristianity can also give your days structure. It can help you look at the world with more hope and meaning.\nBut again: can’t that also come entirely from within yourself, rather than from something outside of you?\n\n(Again — all of this comes from a place of genuine respect. I’m trying to understand!)\n\nSome people also say miracles can happen when you trust in God. And yes, I know this is something atheists often bring up, but I’d still really like to ask:\n\t•\tWhy do some Christians still die even after they give their life and trust to God?\n\t•\tAnd why do some atheists survive serious illness without believing in anything?\n\nAnd this can apply to love, money, health, war, and so on.\n\nSo then why should we see God as our savior if Christians and atheists seem to have an equal chance of a good life?\n\nI’m really curious to hear how you see all this!\nI would honestly love if Christianity were the truth, but I find it hard to go 100% in when I still have so many doubts. So for now, I guess that still makes me an agnostic… But there’s a part of me that wants to change that. \n\nI am considering buying my first Bible, going to church alone for the first time, and finding a community. So in a way, I do want to take steps but as I said: when I commit to something, I want to give it 100%, and I’m still trying to find that place within myself. \n\nThank you for reading, and I look forward to hearing your thoughts!",

      "title": "Jesus delivered me from homosexual desires",
      "text": "I’ve identified as gay my entire life (32M). I grew up in an Eastern culture, so naturally I was into Buddhism, and over the past couple of years, I dabbled in new age practices like meditation, qigong, chakra work, ayahuasca, etc. I’ve always believed that all religions and spiritualities lead to the same truth, just expressed in different languages.\n\nBut this year, in January, I saw a testimony on YouTube from a new ager who found Christ. That testimony alarmed me because she said all new age practices (even yoga) are demonic. I didn’t have any Christian friends or family, and I’d never been to a church in my entire life.\n\nSo I bought a Bible with the mindset of “let me read and see if this is true, then I can decide what to believe.” I didn’t think much about the general Christian stance on LGBTQ; I was more concerned about whether all new age practices are truly demonic, since growing up in an Eastern culture, we’ve always done things like fortune telling and visiting mediums.\n\nI started from Genesis because I wanted to read it “from start to finish.” But by the time I finished Exodus, I was almost 90% convinced that this God of the Bible is real (now I know it was the work of the Holy Spirit). I was also watching many testimonies on YouTube, which probably helped strengthen my faith.\n\nI began praying and repenting for all the sins as defined by the LORD as I read.\n\nAnd on Leviticus, I came across the verse condemning homosexuality: “If a man lies with a male as with a woman, both of them have committed an abomination…”\n\nBecause I was already convinced that this God is real, I thought it would be silly not to submit to His Truth! So I prayed, repented, and asked God to remove my homosexual desires.\n\nAND HE DID!\n\nI’d say He healed me about 90% at the start. Since that prayer, I’ve had no desire to have sex with a man anymore, and I naturally don’t want to look at porn either. That was around February this year.\n\nBut there was still 10% left—whenever I saw an attractive man on the street, I would look at him with certain interest or curiosity.\n\nAs I continued to repent and pray each time that happened, the Holy Spirit gradually revealed to me the underlying causes of my homosexuality.\n\n1) Not living with my Dad or having any male role model before the age of 8.\n\n2) My mom used to call me a “girl” when I was about 3 years old, so I started to develop this idea that I’d be more loved if I were a girl.\n\n3) Sharing a bathroom with the girls in kindergarten (in China, they did that in the 90s…). We saw each other's genitals, which caused sexualization.\n\n4) Porn consumption since the age of 13.\n\n5) Movies, pop culture, etc.\n\n6) Possibly also witchcraft in my family (my grandma dedicated me to an idol when I was born).\n\n7) Rejecting God at age 16 when my high school teacher told me about Jesus. *Romans* *1:24 \"Therefore God gave them up in the lusts of their hearts to impurity, to the dishonoring of* *their bodies among themselves...\"* \n\nAll of these caused trauma and insecurity in my male identity and led me to seek sexual attention from men. I also experienced some gender dysphoria before age 9, which subsided after my teenage years.\n\nThe Holy Spirit also guided me to understand that, because of all these traumas and the new age practices I engaged in, demons could attach to me and give me spirits of homosexual desires. I clearly remembered that after drinking ayahuasca, I became more “sensual” (that’s the spirit of lust and sensuality). So, in short, it’s the desire of the flesh combined with influence from unclean spirits. \n\nI started repenting and praying for Jesus to heal my soul wounds, commanding unclean spirits to leave my life in Jesus’ name. I also found a deliverance ministry to help me. I even repented on behalf of my parents and generations above, and prayed to release myself from generational curses.\n\nToday, I can truly say my homosexual desires are completely gone.\n\nGlory to Jesus. \n\nEDIT: Thank you for everyone’s encouragement. Obviously this is not a post to hate on anyone. I do not hate any gay people as I myself has been one for almost all my life. And homosexuality is only one of the things the Lord delivered me from, he also got me out of intrusive thoughts, envy, stealing, thoughts of murder, anger, unforgiveness, victim mindset, etc. All of these are not less important than sexual impurity. And there are many things he’s still dealing with me now. But I wanted to share this aspect of my walk specifically because it’s the one which many people need the truth of. If you are skeptical of my lived experience or against it, I encourage you to have an open mind and investigate by seeking God’s word.",

It’s not really a problem. As long as someone is saved, spiritual growth is secondary.\n2. The issue is a lack of effective discipleship and teaching in churches today.\n3.

      "text": "Hi everyone. I’m writing here because I really don’t know how to process a situation involving my older sister, and I’m hoping to hear from others who may have walked through something similar.\n\nGrowing up, I had a difficult and even traumatic relationship with my sister. She was bossy, irrational, and emotionally harmful to the point that me and my other siblings were distant from her, even wishing at times that we didn’t have to deal with her at all. I’ve since become a Christian, and so has she — but a lot of those deep wounds and her problematic behaviors haven’t changed much. While I’ve forgiven her in my heart, there’s still a lot of pain and unresolved history that makes me want to maintain emotional and physical distance.\n\nAt one point, she worked for the company I built with my husband. During that time, I was going through a silent battle with depression, anxiety, business pressures, and persecution from my in-laws. We supported her generously — even paying her above her role’s worth because she’s family. Then she had a serious health issue and was hospitalized. Me and my brother quietly helped cover her hospital expenses. But during that time, her husband accused me of gossiping and said I was a “useless sister” who didn’t visit or help — despite the fact that I did visit (Covid protocols limited us), and that we were financially supporting her behind the scenes. He also falsely claimed she paid for my tuition, which is untrue — my mom did.\n\nEventually I snapped, sent money to cover the so-called tuition and more, and cut ties with her husband. She resigned from the company, and I’ve kept a healthy distance from her since.\n\nNow, my sister has taken to sending me reels from Christian content creators — often about end times, mental health, or spiritual rebuke. I don’t know how to receive this. On the surface, maybe she means well. But given our past, it feels like she’s indirectly preaching at me — possibly implying I’m weak in faith because of my depression or because I don’t attend Sunday church regularly (my husband and I work night shifts, and we have no available evening services nearby). I’ve always been honest about my struggles and where I fall short spiritually — I don’t pretend to be anything I’m not.\n\nIt’s hard to be receiving spiritual “encouragement” from someone who never took accountability for years of emotional damage and still seems to think she’s more spiritually mature than I am. I don’t want to rebuild a close relationship. I want to be civil, kind, and forgiving — but I need boundaries.\n\nSo my question is:\nHow do I, as a Christian who is healing and trying to walk with the Lord in truth and humility, respond to this kind of spiritual behavior from someone who caused me pain and refuses to acknowledge it?\n\nAny biblical advice, experiences, or gentle correction is welcome. I know I’m not perfect either — I’m just trying to walk this out with grace and honesty. Thanks for reading.\n\nps. Used ai to compose. English is not my first language.",

It’s like everything in me is paused or frozen. Emotions, feelings, thoughts, memories. I can’t get out of my own head. Literally. I’m watching my life from behind my eyes. I’m not living, I’m watching, and I’ve done this for 6 years now unknowingly. This year I decided to try Jesus because I sensed something was wrong, I wasn’t living right. I mourned and cried for months, and now I feel stuck in place. I don’t know what to do or think. As scared as I really am deep down I want to confess my sins to the right person. I confessed to God, but it would mean more to share my burden and chronic shame with someone too. I think that’s the final step out of this hell hole. I read scripture, but it’s like the words bounce off my head. They don’t penetrate my mind and spirit at all. I’ve been unconsciously repressing this sin and it has caused me to live that way for too long now. I want to integrate it through Jesus but have no idea how. I don’t know what to do or think. I’m lost and confused. \nPlease share anything! Links, advice, methods, support… literally anything will help right now. Thank you!",

      "text": "I couldn't take it anymore. After another worship service of watching everyone around me seemingly deep in spiritual connection while I felt nothing, I quietly slipped out to the church courtyard. Twelve years of faking it had become too heavy to bear.\n\nI sat on a bench, fighting tears, when our worship leader noticed me. Instead of the \"pray harder\" speech I expected, he sat down and said something that floored me:\n\n\"I feel nothing most Sundays too.\"\n\nTurns out, this guy who leads worship every week, who everyone sees as supremely spiritual, often feels completely disconnected. We talked for an hour. He shared how he struggled with depression, how sometimes worship feels mechanical, how he questions if he's just performing rather than praising.\n\nThat conversation sparked something. Next Sunday, instead of leaving, I shared my struggle during small group. The floodgates opened:\n\n* A deacon admitted he hasn't \"heard God's voice\" in 20 years\n* A Sunday school teacher confessed she sometimes doubts everything\n* Multiple people shared they often feel nothing during worship\n* Even our pastor's wife admitted she struggles with feeling God's presence\n\n**What I've Learned:**\n\n* Spiritual feelings aren't a measure of spiritual health\n* Many \"strong\" Christians struggle with emotional connection\n* Sometimes faith is about showing up, even when you feel nothing\n* Authenticity creates deeper connections than pretending\n\n**The Changes:**\n\n* Started a weekly group for people who struggle with \"feeling\" faith\n* Church became more open about mental health\n* People began sharing real struggles instead of perfect testimonies\n* Worship became less about performance and more about presence\n\n**I'm Curious:**\n\n* How many others feel emotionally disconnected in church?\n* What does \"feeling God's presence\" actually mean to you?\n* Has anyone found ways to be authentic in church without disrupting others' worship?\n\nMaybe true worship isn't about feeling the right emotions, but about being honestly present - even with our doubts, numbness, and questions.\n\nEDIT: Many have asked what's helped me navigate this journey. Here are the three things that transformed my relationship with worship:\n\n1. **Create Space for Silence**\n\n* Stop forcing emotional response. Allow yourself to simply be present\n* Practice mindful breathing during worship. Remember that silence itself can be prayer\n\n1. **Find Your Authentic Connection**\n\n* Explore different ways to worship (journaling, nature walks, art)\n* Bible Chat . AI has helped me discover various prayer styles and worship approaches in Scripture\n* Focus on genuine connection over performance. Remember biblical figures also had seasons of spiritual dryness\n\n1. **Build Honest Community**\n\n* Share struggles with trusted friends. Join or create support groups\n* Focus on authenticity over appearance. Remember you're not alone in these feelings\n\nThe key isn't manufacturing emotions, but finding authentic ways to connect - even if they look different than what we expect.",

      "text": "Hi everyone,\n\nWith Pope Francis continuing to encourage a more open and modern Catholic Church, I've been reflecting on how faith practices are changing, especially for younger generations. Today, we see livestreamed Mass, Bible apps, and even platforms offering spiritual guidance or confessions online.\n\nSome people believe online confessions aren't valid, and I understand that view, especially from a sacramental standpoint. But at the same time, isn't belief something that lives within each of us? Could online spaces help people take a first step back toward faith or reflection?\n\nAs a personal project, I've built a small website called [confessinpeace.com](http://confessinpeace.com) It’s not meant to replace sacramental confession, but instead offers a space where people can privately express what's on their heart - religious or not, and receive a thoughtful, prayerful response, along with suggestions for reflection, readings, or places to visit. There's no fixed price - you give what you feel is fair, to support this project and there's a free eBook as a thank you.\n\nI'm not here to advertise it, but more to ask:  \nDo you think tools like this can help people reconnect with faith, or are they a step too far from tradition?\n\nWould love to hear your thoughts especially from anyone who has seen faith and tech come together in a helpful way.\n\nPeace be with you",

So I believe in God, spiritually I feel connected to Him and He makes me a better person and makes me believe we all have a purpose in our lives. What I don't completely understand is why if we don't follow a set of rules we are less than a Christian who goes to church every Sunday and reads the Bible! By the way I'm not saying I don't understand why religion isn't important I do think it's what brought morals into our world...however why is it the overall thing people judge you on. I can tell someone that I pray to God and really believe in Him but if I don't read the Bible they're like wow you clearly not a true Christian. Why is that? Because to be fair many people who follow religious practices can't even explain why they're doing it, their family grew up doing it so they're like meh might as well I do it too. Isn't what we believe in Spiritually more important than you follow rule A, B and C. Again please explain kindly because I'm just trying to understand. Thank you!",

      "text": "I MUST START OFF WITH the fact that I (21F) am not Christian, but my husband (26M) is! This was known before our relationship started almost four years ago. We only got married due to his parents not allowing us to live together until we were (I was homeless and really needed a home. I love my husband regardless and know that I would have been with him anyways.) and that has definitely caused some issues but I digress.\nI am pregnant with our first baby and am due in November. I have been dabbling in Nichiren Buddhism for roughly 6 months with close friends and have made a lot of friends along the way and I have never felt like I belonged more than whenever I go over to my friend's house for meetings and study. My husband has never had a problem with it but also is just a difficult person to talk to. If it isn't something he cares about he just shuts down and that's the end of that.\nToday, I got approved to be an official member of the Buddhist community and am going to receive the gohonzon (scroll that you pray to) within the next few weeks. I called him super happy about it on the way home from my friend's house this morning. He instantly got angry and said he thought that I was joking and I would get over it. I told him he knew this was something that meant a lot to me, and I never judge him for his Christian practices and him going to church, and have even offered for us to have personal bible study or go to church together for me to learn more. He refuses because he just doesn't want to do anything that isn't playing video games. He and I both are aware you aren't supposed to identify as \"lukewarm\" or \"watered down\" but that is what he claims to be because he doesn't read the Bible like he should or go to church as often as he should. So I told him that I was sorry but he had no room to speak about me doing something that meant a lot to me.\nI have an extremely hard time making friends and talking and attending events due to social anxiety. This has helped me open up a lot. I truly thought he was happy for me this whole time.\nAnyways, I told him that when our daughter arrived, I had no problem leaving her with him for me to attend the meetings but also told him she was more than welcome to come because family is family and they accomodate to all situations. He acted off about it and initially said he did have a problem with it and she should not be exposed to it. I told him it was a two way street and that I would therefore be uncomfortable with her being exposed to Christian practice, it goes both ways. He said he \"was not even on the road\" in that analogy and it is different. He will not elaborate and I am getting very tired of not being listened to. I asked him to attend just one discussion. He did not have to be involved in the chanting, prayer, anything, I just wanted him to meet my friends and let them explain the whole point of Buddhism because he believes that I am praying to a god and I am not. We pray for happiness and luck/fortune.\n\nWhat can I do to at least help him understand? I do not want my daughter coerced into either practice, I want her to be able to make that decision when she is old enough.",

      "text": "I converted to Christianity recently. Ive grown up in a Christian household my entire life, it was only about 3 years ago when I changed my mind and became atheist. Within that time frame I had severe depression and horrible thoughts due to lust. I started masturbating at a young age, I started when I became atheist (10). When I was 11 or so I decided masturbation and porn wasn’t enough. I started watching CNC porn (basically rape roleplay porn). I then had the thoughts of raping a woman, I knew it was wrong but I couldn’t resist these lustful thoughts. I was gonna figure out how to rape someone. I then felt more and more guilty. Then when I was 12 (a year ago) I decided I was gonna kill myself before I scar anyone else. A few days after I came up with that I was watching YouTube and came across someone on a podcast. This is how the story goes. A man murdered another person due to gang violence. He went to prison and was ready to serve life. He was going to hang himself when he heard a voice. It was god. He told him to stop, and that he is the way. He then stopped what he was doing and went to bed and prayed. The next day he was a free man. After I heard that I broke down in tears. That was when I became Christian. I gave my life to Christ recently after I felt an impulse to start volunteering at my church. That brings us to where I am now. If you read all this, I appreciate you so much.",

My room feels like a prison. My mind feels like a warzone. I’ve tried to reach out to God—sometimes I scream at Him, sometimes I cry, sometimes I say nothing at all because I don’t know what to say anymore. I feel ignored and forgotten.\n\nI struggle with lust, procrastination, deep insecurity, anger at my parents, and guilt that I’m not a better brother to my younger siblings. I feel like I’m behind in life, like I’m spiritually starving and nobody around me really sees it. I want to change so badly, but I feel completely powerless.\n\nThe worst part is how distant God feels. I want to believe He’s here. I want to trust that He hasn’t given up on me, but most days it just feels like silence. I still try—I pray (badly), I open the Bible (rarely), but I’m exhausted.\n\nI guess I’m just looking for someone to tell me it’s not over. To tell me that this pain isn’t permanent. Or maybe someone who’s been here before—someone who knows what it’s like to feel like a social alien, to feel ashamed, and to still find a way out with God.\n\nI’m not here to be fake or impressive. I’m just here to be honest. If you’ve been where I am, or if you have encouragement, Scripture, music, or just prayers—I’d be really grateful.\n\nThank you for reading this.",

I’ve even done stuff I know is wrong stuff I don’t even want to do but it’s like I can’t control it.\n\nAnd now, over the last month, I’ve started getting these weird “tics”, I have had them for a bit but they have gotten worse, at first it was subtle and mainly vocal, but sometimes my arm will jerk and grab at my face and other things like it. It happens around friends, but now even at church. Whenever there’s a lot of prayer, my anxiety goes up, the tics get worse, and I even start feeling angry.\n\nMost of the time I can hold it in, but it doesn’t go away. And sometimes after church or the next morning I wake up with a bad headache and nausea. It honestly feels like I’m under some kind of spiritual attack. The worst part is even picking up my Bible or a cross makes me feel anxious.\n\nI’m pretty sure it’s just the enemy trying to mess with my head, but I’m not sure what to do.

And most of the time I am correct. I can feel when someone is dishonest, when others believe in them. I know when I need to leave somewhere bc something bad is happening. I know when things aren’t right. I even had a vision once that happened down to details later that day almost exactly as the vision gave. I’ve had God wake me up before to reach out to someone i had never spoken to, who unbeknownst to be had just prayed that God would show her someone cared. I always believed this helped with ministry things as well as how to pray. I just felt very in line with God. \nBut now I feel like bc of this, it makes me more susceptible to anxiety. I don’t care so much about myself, as I do for people I love, so mainly my kids, and so now I need help to manage this anxiety so that I can differentiate between what is anxiety I need to let go of and something more I specific I need to follow God in. Any help here would be appreciated. Again I don’t want to debate the spiritual gifts. I just want to know how to be healthy with what I truly do believe are my spiritual gifts. Sometimes I think ignorance would be bliss here. Or being aloof or naive or something.",

This next part will likely turn up a few noses but I hope I can still receive some insightful and thoughtful replies to this post. I am transgender, born female but always wanting to be male. These feelings of course made me question myself and my faith when I was younger (about 13-17) and I would constantly pray for them to be taken away. \n\nIts been a long journey to this day trying to make sense of myself and God’s plan for me. I’ve considered everything, both living as a woman and as a man. My devotion to God has been more dormant during those years and like many younger people I was struggling to hold on to it. More recently, ive been feeling a strong pull and with that ive been praying for God to help me understand my situation and help me know what to do next. If I should reject my desires and be miserable in my body in the name of Christ, or if I should do what would make me feel better. I already look pretty much like a young male, but I have never went through any sort of medical change. The reason for this is because I didn’t want to upset my family and also because I want to be sure what God wants of me.\n\nWith all of that out of the way, heres the dream I had:\n\nIt started with me walking through a maze but I seemed to know where I was going. I opened a door and there was a huge crowd sitting in the stands, kind of like for a football game. In the middle of the field there was a group of men lined up, all holding paper boxes. An old man with a very long gray beard was standing there too. I was confused what was going on, but when the old man saw me, he quickly ushered me in like I was part of whatever was going on. He handed me a box and told me to stand next to the men that were lined up. Then one by one, he started walking to each man and setting their box on fire. When he got to me i realized the boxes contained oil. I was feeling really nervous because in this dream I was a man (which is not something unusual for me and its not something I pay much mind to, but in this dream it felt significant. like I was aware of my gender and feeling worried that the man will think that I’m an imposter for being part of this “ceremony” that was clearly intended for men in the dream). The man got to me and he looked at me for a long moment. I was sweating while holding this box. He then reached his arm out and took my hat off, and then put it on himself (not sure if this has any significance but adding it in incase it does). He then smiled and lit my box on fire too. It burned up until it was nothing in my hands and I had no burns nor oil residue on my palms. I then felt relieved. After it was over everyone started mingling and talking to each other, and the children started playing. \n\nThat was basically it. When I woke up I felt like I had some sort of experience. I later searched up some of the elements about this dream that seemed significant: Maze, burning oil, a ceremony. I came up with a lot of references to “anointing”.\n\nNow heres the really interesting part. later that same day I was just relaxing and scrolling on my phone when I see a fun post that said “open up your bible right now and go to the psalm number thats the same as your age. See how God speaks to you personally”.  And of course I opened my bible to read psalm 20, not expecting anything significant. I froze when I saw what it read. Not only did it say “May he give you the desire of your heart” but it also uses the very specific word: Anoint. “The Lord gives victory to his anointed”.\n\nI had to sit there for a long while just to soak it all in. In the moment I truly felt like God was telling me something. Since then, I have redoubled my efforts regarding my faults. Anger, temptation, and hate are other things I have always struggled with, but I have felt that it’s easier for me to deal with them now. I feel grateful to the Lord for what I think was him reaching out to me in such a personal way, and I want to repay him by being kinder, more understanding. More thoughtful towards others, more in control of myself.\n\nNow the question is, was that whole experience the Lord letting me know it’s alright to pursue a gender transition? Or am I just grasping for straws looking for a way to justify this? \n\nPlease be respectful! I would appreciate any thoughts on this.",

I didn’t grow up in a Christian environment, and for most of my life, I saw Christianity more as an institution, something that’s been used historically to control people through fear, like in the Middle Ages.\n\nBut I’ve always been a deeply spiritual person, and I’ve never doubted that there’s more to existence than we understand. I also have narcolepsy, which causes vivid dreams, frequent nightmares, and sleep paralysis. Since I was about 12, I’ve seen shadowy figures in my room. When I went through depression at 15, they appeared even more often. Were those demons?\n\nLately, my dreams have become even more intense and spiritual. I have dreams about jesus, and overwhelmingly beautiful spiritual dreams, but then I also have very scary dreams. I have had literal encounters with people (witches?) that have told me they work with these shadow figures. I dont give them any attencion and always try to escape. I feel like i have very good judgement, and I can feel when something is evil, and then I always try to escape. I often wake up feeling a heavy, dark presence beside me, the same one I feel from the shadow figures, completely paralyzed. I try to pray, but it never seems to help. Its almost like it starts mocking me when i try to pray. \nIs that because I’m not a Christian? Would Christ not hear me unless I call myself a Christian? Why would He require worship in exchange for help? I do belive in something bigger, and i always live as a good person to my best ability, is that not enough? Do i need to Call out for him loud? Sometimes i have felt these energies getting even more angry as i try to pray.\nI don’t want to turn to Christianity just out of fear, but honestly this is becoming overwhelming.",

      "title": "Who is our spiritual covering?",
      "text": "*Who is our spiritual covering?*\n\nBeloved of God, spiritual covering is very important. Many people have various \"spiritual fathers\" to whom they stay true. Some people pay tithes directly to their spiritual fathers, others tell their spiritual fathers everything about their lives. Some have many spiritual fathers whom they call and they send money and gifts to make sure they show . It makes feel safe. \n\nThis concept of spiritual covering is not new. Moses provided guidance and leadership to Joshua. Read here:  Numbers 27:18 (NKJV) \"And the Lord said to Moses: “Take Joshua the son of Nun with you, a man in whom is the Spirit, and lay your hand on him.\"\n\n\nIn the word of God Elijah acted as a spiritual father and mentor to Elisha. Check with 2 Kings 2:9 (NLT) \"When they came to the other side, Elijah said to Elisha, “Tell me what I can do for you before I am taken away.”And Elisha replied, “Please let me inherit a double share of your spirit and become your successor.” \n\nThe examples are too many especially from the old testament. In these days people who are called by God are no longer expected to have spiritual fathers. This is because spiritual fathers are thought of as being more powerful than others. They are regarded as being closer to God because some of them \"own\" mega churches.\n\n Many aspiring \" spiritual sons and daughters\"  seed into their annointing. It's a profit making scheme.  The spiritual father claims to cover your ministry and shows you  God's direction on where you must go.  Some people believe that demons can't attack you if you have a powerful spiritual father.  The spiritual son must \"tap into the anointing \" of his father by sending his tithes to the spiritual father. \n\nBefore people accept your miracles they want to know who is your Spiritual Father. Some  (lesser known prophets ) even lie about who their spiritual father is. This creates a problem where the spiritual father who \" gives covering\" becomes an idol which replaces Jesus Christ. The task of interceding for you belongs to Jesus Christ. \n\n\nCheck with Hebrews 4:14-15\n(NLT) \"So then, since we have a great High Priest who has entered heaven, Jesus the Son of God, let us hold firmly to what we believe. This High Priest of ours understands our weaknesses, for he faced all of the same testings we do, yet he did not sin.\"\n\nTrue covering was already guaranteed by the Lord  Jesus Christ. We no longer need higher annointing to seed into because the Anointer Himself lives within us. God is the only one who matters in our ministry work. Read here: 1 Corinthians 3:7 (GNB) \"The one who sows and the one who waters really do not matter. It is God who matters, because he makes the plant grow.\"\n\nIf the ministry under prophet so and so starts to grow, he gets many spiritual sons under his covering. People of God this is cultic behavior. Read from S. mowinkel's Cultic origins theory. The spiritual father cannot be questioned. In some cases He/she commits adultery at will with church members and his behavior is not challenged, corrected or even condemned.  \n\n\nFor your ministry to grow, you need a real connection to the true vine Jesus Christ not an earthly spiritual father. Read here:  John 15:5 (NKJV) “I am the vine, you are the branches. He who abides in Me, and I in him, bears much fruit; for without Me you can do nothing.\"\n\nThe spiritual father has a godlike personality, he annoints and curses various people as he pleases. He is feared and considered to be closer  to God than others. I repeat, this is cultic behavior! Do not follow these cults. You have one Father in heaven.\n\n\n And beside we have overcome the world through the covering of the Holy Spirit. Read here:  1 John 4:4 (NKJV) \"You are of God, little children, and have overcome them, because He who is in you is greater than he who is in the world.\"\n\nI am not saying you should be an island but never put your faith in any man for whatever reason trust only in the Lord, your God!",

      "text": "I want to say first off I'm in a period of being open and actively trying to continually try learn and grow so please just consider that when you read my story.  \n  \nI consider myself more spiritual than religious, especially after many experiences with psychedelics like DMT, along with meditation and other meaningful life events that have lead me to my current understanding of god. I believe in a higher power, though not necessarily in the way organized religions define it. On my journey, I’ve come to see how rigid and black-and-white Christianity can be in its belief system. I often question how my church interprets God—because if God is truly everything, as many Christians say, then wouldn't that make God more fluid than the limits their doctrine places on the divine?  \n  \nI currently attend church regularly—not because my beliefs fully align, but because I’m searching for spiritual connection and a sense of community, which I lack in my personal life. I haven't found that kind of spiritual exploration anywhere else. The only people who seem to resonate with my understanding of a higher power are those I've met at raves, or through other spiritual practices like Buddhism (which, in my view, is more of a philosophy than a religion—something many Christians seem to misunderstand).  \n  \nEven though I find most religious organizations too structured—and I imagine God as something much more fluid and probably far less focused on our individual lives than we assume—I still find meaning in sharing the experience of faith with others who are also looking for healing and hope. That kind of search happens outside of religion too, in people simply trying to better themselves, but right now, I’m drawn to witnessing it in a church setting. It’s fascinating to me and a little intoxicating sometimes in my meditation practices I will hallucinate too (im not the only one seasoned meditators also experience this too).  \n  \nSometimes, it does feel odd—like religion tries to confine something I believe is boundless. Still, being part of this community has helped stretch my own understanding of what God could be. I continue to see God as pure consciousness or the universe experiencing itself through us as energy and it doesn't fit into these moral ideas of good and bad. But right now, being part of a community that celebrates something greater than us is important to me, and church has been the only place offering that—even if my beliefs differ from those around me. I would like to find that celebration and community with something that fits those understandings of a higher power of mine but I'm not sure what that is for me. Currently, I don’t feel like I truly fit in at my church because I interpret many of the stories more metaphorically than literally. To me, they often seem like symbolic reflections of the human experience—less about rigid historical fact and more about inner transformation, the journey of the ego, or even the celebration of life itself. For example, I see the story of Jesus not just as a religious figure, but as a metaphor that weaves together various life philosophies with cosmic patterns—like the path of the sun.  \n  \nThe idea of the sun’s solstice, particularly the winter solstice, fascinates me in this context. Around December 21st, the sun appears to stop moving on the horizon and remains in the same position for three days before it “rises” again—marking the return of light. In many ancient traditions, this moment symbolized death and rebirth. When I reflect on the story of Jesus—his death, three days in the tomb, and resurrection—I see a powerful metaphor that parallels this solar cycle. It feels less like a historical event to me and more like a spiritual allegory about renewal, light returning after darkness, and the eternal rhythms of life and consciousness. What’s more, before Christianity even existed, similar mythological figures and “prophets” told this same metaphorical story. Figures like Horus in Egyptian mythology shared strikingly similar themes—virgin birth, divine lineage, trials, death, and resurrection. These patterns repeat across ancient traditions not just surrounding Horus, suggesting to me that the story isn’t owned by any one religion, but instead speaks to something universally human: our longing for meaning, transformation, and connection to something greater. All a story surrounding Gods \"sun\" the thing that continues to give us life and saves us from the cold and darkness .   \n  \nThis symbolic way of understanding faith often leaves me feeling a bit out of place in environments where stories are taken at face value. But to me, these metaphors carry just as much—if not more—depth and truth. Im curious if anyone else feels the same or even can help me understand all this craziness?",

I find myself more drawn to Islam, as I want to keep researching about it, but quickly lose interest in other religions when I read about them. I think it's due to these reasons:\n\n1. The Quran is supposedly the literal word of God. The Bible is supposedly \"inspired\" by god but written by humans, which I find to be much less compelling.\n\n2. I've noticed that Muslims treat their religion with much more reverence and hold it as being more sacred. I visited a mosque recently, and I definitely felt that.\n\n3. Islam is in the media constantly (mostly shown in a negative light, honestly). I think this also makes me more interested in it. \n\n4. Muslims seem to know more about their religion than the average Christian. A lot of Christians don't seem to know much about the Bible at all.\n\n5. Islam seems to be a religion which involves a lot of self-discipline. Praying five times a day, fasting, doing ablutions etc. I respect this.\n\n6. I just find the entire \"trinity\" thing to be silly. Jesus is god but also prays to god (himself)? Doesn't make sense. It makes more sense for there to be one god and prophets who wrote down his words. \n\nI'm not sure how this post will be received, but I just wanted to share some thoughts from an atheist about your religion.

      "text": "I see a lot of discourse online recently from both ex Christians and ex Muslims about their trauma with religion. As someone who has benefitted from Islam and have found comfort in the religion, I wondered how others may have found Islam to have a negative impact. I understand how some people disagree with things like homosexuality being haram or having to wear the hijab, but some people just have full on trauma from the religion being forced onto them. I myself have been raised in a Muslim family my whole life. As a young child I was taken care of by my maternal grandparents who taught me Islam and softly guided me to Islam. My grandad ,MashaAllah, is very knowledgeable about Islam. He has and still teaches me a lot. As I’ve grown older and I’ve formed stronger relationships with my parents. My father has a very different approach to how he speaks about Islam and haram and halal. He has more of a forceful way. I personally don’t feel it affects me negatively (probabaly because I’ve seen the real Islam through my grandfather) but I can see how other may take it negatively as he’s quite strict about it. This is where I’m able to make the difference as I think back on it. My country was formed by slavery and because of this, there wasn’t a strong culture to bounce off, this would be in my grandfathers time- the way my grandad studied Islam was through the factual sources of Hadiths and Quran not cultural practices, however, at my dads time, the home country became more developed and formed stronger culture, norms and values within the Muslim community (which was quite small at the time) which he has taken with him as that’s what he was taught now he’ll teach it to me in the same manor. This is why I believe culture plays a part in religious trauma, because parents use culture and cultural ways to enforce Islam instead of actually using Islam, Quran and hadiths. What do you think?",

I don’t ask this question because of weakness in iman, Alhamdulilah I believe I’m firm in my iman. I ask because I’m curious as to what grounds other religions have to believe that theirs is the one true religion. Christianity, Judaism, Bhudism, Hinduism. Why do they genuinely believe that their religion is the one true religion? We believe because we have what I believe to be solid and undeniable evidence; the Quran which has been preserved perfectly for 1400 years. To me, the Quran is simply the purest form of religious teachings. What do you all think. Jazakhallah khair.",

So if we believe Islam is true, then we should follow 100% of it, not just \"I think this is ok\" or \"The times change, so Islam has to change too\".\n\nWhy don't we follow 100% Islam? It saddens me to see many things considered haram by many scholars all the way from Nabi (SAW) now being called halal by a random nobody with no understanding of Deen.\n\nWhy don't we listen to the scholars? They are the ones who devoted themselves to studying religion and helping the ummat. Who are we to say, \"I have knowledge, and this and that is halal\"?\n\nEdit: I meant following 100% of Deen as in striving to follow all of it. If one falls short, Allah doesn't burden a soul except with what he can do. This is opposed to people who say, \"I think this is right, but this and that don't apply anymore\" or \"I won't follow that, Allah is forgiving\"\n\nEdit 2: By 100% True, I mean that everything in the religion is correct. therefore, the religion is correct. However, by 0%, I mean that the religion is false. Someone said some things are correct in Christianity/Judaism as well. I mean that if something in a religion is incorrect, then the religion is incorrect. Islam is 100% correct, all aspects of it.\n\nYou know how binary has 0s and 1s? Religion is either true or false. If a religion is true, that means 100% of it is true",

      "text": "I’ve spent most of my life as a convinced atheist. I am from a western country and I didn’t believe in God, religion, or any sacred texts — especially not one that came out of the 7th century. But I’m writing this because I’ve changed my mind — and I never thought I would.\n\nIt started out of curiosity. I wanted to understand why so many people believe in Islam. So I read the Qur’an, not spiritually, but analytically. I expected ancient myths, contradictions, and historical errors.\n\nBut instead, I found this:\n\nPrecise historical terms: The Qur’an calls Egypt’s ruler in Joseph’s time “king”, and in Moses’ time “Pharaoh” — which actually matches what modern historians discovered. The Bible doesn’t make this distinction.\n\nScientific consistency: It talks about the sky as a protective ceiling — and the atmosphere literally does that. It also mentions salt and fresh water not mixing, which you can observe today in places like where the Atlantic and Mediterranean meet.\n\nEmbryology: The descriptions of early development stages — a clinging substance, a chewed-like lump — line up with what embryologists now know. This isn’t vague poetry — it’s eerily accurate.\n\nNumerical patterns: Words like “day” appear 365 times, “month” appears 12 times, and others appear in balanced pairs — things that shouldn’t happen randomly across 6000+ verses.\n\nLiterary uniqueness: Even though the Qur’an was revealed over 23 years, its style stays consistent — yet inimitable. It shifts tone, rhythm, and message without losing coherence. And some verses were placed years apart, yet still flow seamlessly. That blew my mind.\n\n\nI tried to find natural explanations — collective authorship, influence from other texts, editing — but none of them fully explain these features, especially given the historical context: an illiterate man in a tribal society without access to this kind of knowledge.\n\nSo yes — I’ve changed my worldview. I’m still on the journey. I’m not pretending to know everything now. But I no longer believe the Qur’an could’ve been made by humans alone. Something about it goes beyond that.\n\nIf you're someone who’s skeptical like I was — I encourage you to just read it. Not with blind faith, but with an open mind. It might shake you too.\n\nNow that I’ve come this far, I want to understand more. If anyone has suggestions on how to really dive into Islam — good beginner resources, trustworthy scholars, or how to start practicing step by step — I’d genuinely appreciate it. I'm not rushing anything, but I want to move forward with clarity, not just curiosity.",

I also get shivers(not the bad kind i would say, but not a feeling I quite understand) reading some of the posts here. \n\nStarting the journey of learning it feels extremely overwhelming; the idea of something i don’t know a tiny bit about except for the few things my friends have shared with me.

      "text": "When I matured and lived away from my religious parents and community, I naturally drifted away from religion. After two years, I didn’t change as a person, but I just started living life with no purpose. Not in a bad way, but I was simply enjoying life without focusing too much on if there is a god that will punish me for my actions. I don’t think I believed in god anyway, but was taught to believe. For example, I wouldn’t feel bad if I didn’t fast in Ramadan, but still had this lingering thought that I would be punished by Allah. To be more accurate, I think my belief stemmed from fear. What if there is this chance that god exists and I will go to hell for this sin (not dressing modestly for example). \n\nAnd, I consider myself to be a good person. I don’t like to gossip, I’m selfless and always kind to everyone that crosses my path. So, any action I did that only affected me why would I be punished for it? Moreover, I can find sympathy with myself for self-soothing by smoking for example because I was depressed, so why can’t a compassionate god be as forgiving? In fact, I can find sympathy for anyone else that goes through a tough time and finds comfort in sins. God created them anyway, so why punish people for something he created and knew people would be tempted by it.\n\nNow that I’m a bit older, my curiosity has been taking me towards philosophy to better understand why we are here on this earth? This question hasn’t been answered to me by Islam. Any answer that’s illogical doesn’t convince me. For example, it’s the devil or people are messing with your head. Whenever I question Islam to my Muslim friends, I’m met with judgement and that I’m terrible for questioning the existence of god. I considered myself an atheist for a good two years, and now I’m spiritual. A huge part of it is because I’ve been taught it and it’s second nature. My dad was also an exorcist, and would tell me stories of people he treated, so I believe in the unseen world. \n\nWhen I look around the world, I see a bunch of different religions that seem to exist simply to create order. Who can control the actions of a population when they fear god and follow a set of strict rules. At the end of the day, most religions teach you what’s right and wrong and to be a good person. As long as I’m not harming anybody what’s the harm? \n\nI’ve been interested in absurdism ever since I read “The Myth of Sisyphus” by Albert Camus. This world is absurd, and I just have make sense with the fact that it doesn’t make sense. It just seems to me that people use religion as an escape to try to live with themselves and are technically free from having to question things. I don’t think people in Islam question things enough, because when they are met with these questions. They are repulsed, and most of the time their answers are emotional. \n\nI’m open to discussion and would love to hear different opinions. It’s the month of Ramadan, and I am making more of a conscious effort to understanding Islam and other religions in general in my search for a convincing answer.",

Like cousin marriage does produce genetically inferior offspring. I would like to teach my kids not to marry their cousins.\nI've researched this on the internet, YouTube, & chatgpt.\nMost people cite the supplementary documents to the Quran (Like hadiths and other documentation). Does the Quran explicitly permit cousin marriage?\n\nIf I were to convert in the future can I only believe in the Quran(the word of god) and determine which hadiths to believe based on science?

In my personal experience, I've faced challenges in engaging with some individuals from the Muslim community in my country, particularly as a non-believer, which has added to my sense of isolation.\n\nAdditionally, I’ve found discussions from some scholars who suggest that the Qur'an has undergone changes over time, with entire chapters possibly being lost. These points have been difficult for me to process.\n\nThat said, I’m genuinely open to learning more and gaining clarity. If a knowledgeable Muslim scholar could help address and clarify these issues, I’d be sincerely willing to revisit my interest in Islam.",

      "text": "Every time I see a sister open up about how difficult wearing the hijab is, or how overwhelming it can feel to be a Muslim woman, the response from many users is disappointingly cold and unhelpful. Too often, people reply with a smug tone, saying things like, “It’s haram because it’s haram” or “It’s halal because it is”—as if that’s all that needs to be said. But that completely misses the point.\n\nThese sisters or any Muslim or someone interested in the religion in general aren’t just asking for rulings—they’re expressing real struggles, seeking comfort, understanding, and guidance. What they need isn’t a lecture. They need compassion. They need to be reminded that Allah is Most Merciful, that their pain is seen, and that struggling doesn’t make them bad—it makes them human.\n\nWhat this space truly lacks is kindness. We need more empathy. We need to respond to vulnerability with love, not arrogance. To uplift, not shame. To embrace those who are struggling and remind them they are deeply loved by Allah, not push them further away with harshness.\n\nThat’s how you help someone through doubt—with warmth, not pride.",

Has anyone debunked them? How? Can't we just say the same thing as them?\n\nThey say they have books as proof but how do we know it's not just written by a guy that was delusional or not sane? Or just forged? Do we have any proof? \n\nThey also say things prophecied like Jews going back to Israel (after it became a country) is a sign their version of Jesus is coming back soon? Do we have any so called prophecies that has happened? If so what? \n\nAlso apparently some Christian guy debunked it which Idk who but that's what I got told and my Christian friend (different to the guy who apparently debunked islam) said it's impossible to debunk religion, which I agree  because Islam and Christianity are basically faith based technically (correct me if I'm wrong pls) and apparently that one Christian guy (forgot his name but they all love him) could probably debunk Islam according to the Christians (not saying they said this but from what I've seen and how the Christian Influencer acts, they probably said it before)\n\nAlso is there really proof Islam is the right religion cause I struggled with it recently (and don't say the Quran or scholars BC Christians can say that too)? Or is it just faith based? Because I'm the type of guy to never 100% believe unless I see (and also slightly because of trust issues and the fact I'm/was gullible so I don't trust people's words as easy anymore) and so is my Christian friend (the same as me, we don't 100% believe unless we see idk his reason why but I just said mine)\n\n\n\nAnd how do you respond to atheists asking proof Allah exists (without saying the Quran because again other religions could just say their holy book, so imo that isn't a valid reason) same with Christians,Jews, etc asking us to prove were right. (Again without bringing up the Quran cos that isn't a fully \"good/reliable\" source since Christians and Jews could do the same)\n\nAgain I'm not saying the Quran is wrong I'm just saying don't use it as a reason because other religions could say their holy book as a reason of the religion being right.\n\nAlso don't say you felt better or your life got better cause I know both people who went from Islam to Christianity and the opposite who felt better and was better after converting to Christianity or converting to Islam (or getting more religious with either). \n\nAlso would I be able to break my fast during Ramadan if I get headaches from fasting (which would get worse if I keep fasting) and probably gonna feel sick? Because if not then I'd probably almost die (metaphorically, not literally,but I'd feel like it)\n\nAnd pls don't send links I am  NOT watching vids or reading essays I just want a simple answer, one or two small paragraphs max.

In Islam, we’re taught that closeness to Allah, inner peace, and guidance are signs of a living heart and sincere connection to the truth. But I’ve seen that followers of other religions also experience similar things — they feel spiritual peace, claim their prayers are answered, feel guided, regret their sins, and even report healing through their religious rituals.\n\nSome perform exorcisms or spiritual practices that seem to 'work,' even though they don’t follow Islam. If these kinds of spiritual experiences — like peace, healing, feeling guided, or guilt after sin — are present in many belief systems, how can we say with certainty that Islam alone is the true religion? And if we say these are just emotional or natural responses, how do we distinguish between genuine divine truth and universal human spiritual feeling?\n\nI truly want to believe, and I’m asking this not out of rebellion, but because I want to build my faith on clarity, not confusion or guilt. I’m seeking a deeper understanding of how Islam explains the spiritual experiences of non-Muslims, and what exactly makes Islam not just feel right — but truly be right.",

      "text": "As someone who comes from a Muslim background and has researched extensively about both Islam and other religions, I’ve observed a common thread that exists across most, if not all, world religions; the concept of light representing guidance, God, purity, and enlightenment, while darkness represents evil and ignorance. This concept is found not only in Islam but in Christianity and Judaism, and even non-Abrahamic faiths like Zoroastrianism, Hinduism, and Buddhism. In Hinduism, for example, they have the concept of Brahman, who is the source of all creation, morality, and guidance. Hindu texts refer to Brahman as the “light of all lights”. Zoroastrianism refers to their god, Ahura Mazda, as the “Lord of Light.” Then I realized that in the Qur'an one of Allah’s names is literally An-Nur or the Light in English translation. So that got me thinking: what if this aligns with the concept of fitra, in that human beings are naturally inclined towards recognizing a common divine symbol as a source of purity and guidance, which is light. Of course, an evolutionary biologist could just explain it as humanity evolving to associate darkness with predators and fear, which is a reasonable assertion, but as Muslims we know that Allah guides creation, including human evolution. I’m curious to hear others' thoughts and perspectives on this.",

      "text": "My husband reverted to Islam 6 years ago, we met through friends and he was asking me questions about Islam and was interested in it. He wanted to take it seriously and was frequently visiting mosques and learning about the religion, and he seemed pretty serious about it. He often prayed and stayed away from haram things. This only lasted about 3 years. During the last 3 years, prayer is not something he ever thinks about. If he prays, it’s usually because I remind him to. And if I remind him to pray more than 1 prayer a day, he always seems annoyed and almost like he’s doing it so I can stop nagging. He doesn’t see it as an obligation in his life and he could go the rest of his life never doing it again. He doesn’t really ever talk to god or make dua. I know this because I asked. It just feels like god/religion in general is not a major thing that his life revolves around. His life just revolves around sleep work food. He’s just simply caught up in worldly things. \n\nHe usually also finishes his prayers abnormally fast, and he doesn’t speak Arabic, so that is pretty concerning. I found out recently he’s been reciting the second short surahs during prayer completely wrong with made up words. He’s been reciting it this way the last 6 years. So he’s not even trying to make sure his prayers are right. He just assumes god will accept all of his shortcomings. However recently he’s been trying to relearn the surahs so he’s not too far gone and I have to give him credit where it’s due. \n\nThis all upsets me so deeply because once we get kids inshallah I don’t want them to grow up without seeing the necessity of praying all prayers. I also want to see him in heaven and not hell because I love him and don’t want him joining the kuffar. \n\nWhat should I do? Is there anything I can even do at this point? It’s all nagging to him at the end of the day. He is a very good person with a good heart and has the potential to be such a great Muslim but i just can’t get through to him. I also need to mention he doesn’t do any haram things either. He just simply doesn’t think about the obligations of religion much other than fasting. Please give me advice.",

But, as in this case, we have a contingent of people here who do not follow Christianity, Islam or Judaism, they follow, for example, African or spiritualist religions, how would Islamic jurisprudence adapt to these people? Or are there already laws that cover these other religions in society?",

People think people at that time were not wealthy, that’s why.\n\nSaying this is incorrect.\n\nAllah offered the Prophet (saw) the valley of Makkah to be turned into gold.\n\nAbu Umamah reported: The Prophet (saw) said, “My Lord presented me with the valley of Mecca that He might turn it into gold for me. I said: No, O Lord, rather I will be satiated some days and hungry some days. When I am hungry, I will humble myself before You and remember You. When I am satiated, I will be grateful to You and praise You.”  \n(Tirmidhi 2347)\n\nNote, this is offered by Allah. So, what is offered by Allah can that be impermissible (haram)? No, whatever Allah is offering is permissible (halal).\n\nBut the Prophet (saw) didn’t take it. Even though slabs of gold could have been given as payment to people, those individuals would then serve the religion. But the Prophet (saw) didn’t accept this.\n\nWhy? The Prophet (saw) sought to establish sound principles that would endure until the Day of Judgment. Because if people received slabs of gold for their services, they would serve the religion for gold and not for Allah. The essence of religion would have been lost. People’s faith wouldn’t have been as strong.\n\nIt was the strength of faith built through sacrifices that brought down the kingdoms of Rome and Persia for the Companions of the Prophet (saw).",

Additionally, he is concerned about his mother—she believes in God or a higher power but does not follow a specific religion. She is a good person, so wouldn’t that be enough for her to enter Paradise?\n\nHe is also curious about whether Islam can be proven as the true religion.

It was then I started developing symptoms of depression and anxiety which forced me to understand my Religion since I started to question everything in Islam. And I came across the concept that Islam is a Deen(complete way of life) not just a Religion(containing only 5 pillars and 6 articles of faith). And it made more sense to me and I realised that muslims are caught up in all the mess like all the \"isms\" and idolizing the west etc since they don't know their own identity and purpose as a representative of Allah to establish the Deen. But still I got diagnosed with Bipolar disorder and anxiety which makes it all seem so hopeless and I feel like even Allah has abandoned me.",

He stopped talking to me after a fight we had where I believe we both were at fault. After speaking to him recently, he told me that he was not going to speak to me or any other woman. That he was closer to God now and that he cannot speak to me anymore. While it hurt, because I truly did care for him, I was glad he was at peace. And he was doing what he thought is right. As long as he is happy, and feels fulfilled, I am glad too. But then, I fell into a spiral. He had once told me that no matter what good deeds I may do. Or who I may help, as long as I don't believe in Islam, I will be punished with eternal hellfire because I dont believe. I was not born in an Abrahamic household. So the concept of punishment and salvation was very alien to me. I could not place faith in a God who would give us free will to test us, and if we failed, which him being all knowing, would punish us with the worst punishment forever? Basically my question is, why would I be punished simply for not believing in a particular God and his prophet if he gave me the freedom to disbelieve? How does that make him all merciful and forgiving? If I am a mother to child, and i let him do what he wants and if it's something against what I have said, do I punish him for exercising his free will despite me being the one who granted it to him? Of course, I have heard that God is even more loving and caring than a mother towards her child. As a mother, I will never punish my child to eternal damnation. I am not a bad person. I may have committed mistakes in the past but I also recognise that doing good brings you good and hurting others will hurt you too. I try to be kind and empathetic to people. I don't do it so that I may receive some reward, but because it's the right thing to do. Doing the right things gives me sense of peace. I don't look to scripture to tell me. Nor do I fear punishment to make me do the right things like being honest, compassionate and kind. Apparently, if you've been conveyed the message of Islam, and choose to disbelieve, you will still be punished? Then how forgiving and merciful truly is god? He is beyond human comprehension. So why do we attribute him with petty things such as this? If he is the creator why does he care so much about people believing in him? Why does he punish those, who were given free will by himself, for not believing with such severe punishment? Even the most evil of people, if are believers, will suffer in hell for a limited time while the people who were good but didn't believe suffer eternal hellfire? How is he just? I want to believe, but these questions keep crossing my mind.",

      "text": "In the story of ʿAbd al-Raḥmān ibn ʿAwf, there is a lesson mentioned by Shaykh Muṣṭafā, though he didn’t mention all of it. ʿAbd al-Raḥmān ibn ʿAwf came as an emigrant, and the Prophet ﷺ established a bond of brotherhood between him and Saʿd ibn al-Rabīʿ al-Anṣārī. After this bond was established, Saʿd said to him:\n\"O ʿAbd al-Raḥmān, I have two wives. Look at which one you like more, and I will divorce her. After her waiting period (‘iddah), you may marry her.\"\n(This was before the command of hijab, in the early period before the veiling of women was mandated.)\nEven if this occurred after hijab, it would have been considered a marriage proposal (khitbah), and this is how such a situation would be treated.\n\nSaʿd also said:\n\"And I have wealth — I will give you half of what I own.\"\nMeaning: “I’ll give you one of my wives (after divorce and ‘iddah) if you wish, and I’ll give you half of my wealth.”\n\nBut ʿAbd al-Raḥmān replied:\n\"May Allah bless you in your family and your wealth. I have no need for this. Show me the way to the market.\"\n\nSo they directed him to the market, and he bought dried yogurt and butter and began buying and selling until Allah enriched him. Shortly after, he got married.\nSource : site of sheikh ibn Baz https://binbaz.org.sa/audios/866/%D8%A7%D8%AC%D8%AA%D9%87%D8%A7%D8%AF-%D8%B9%D8%A8%D8%AF-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B1%D8%AD%D9%85%D9%86-%D8%A8%D9%86-%D8%B9%D9%88%D9%81-%D9%81%D9%8A-%D8%B7%D9%84%D8%A8-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B1%D8%B2%D9%82-%D8%A8%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B9%D9%85%D9%84.\nFrom the exemple of abarahman ibn awf we can take so much lessons :\n1. The Market as a Path to Dignity and Empowerment :\nHis first stop in Medina was the market — the engine of economic life. Islam doesn’t discourage wealth — in fact, building wealth ethically is encouraged.\n2. Modesty and Prioritization\nHe didn’t prioritize marriage or comfort first — he first focused on becoming self-sufficient. Only after becoming stable did he marry.\n3. Initiative and Independence : \nRather than wait for comfort or security, he immediately asked how to be productive. His mindset was proactive:\nHe didn’t complain about being new in the city.\nHe didn’t ask for charity.\nHe took initiative and entered the marketplace with whatever small means he had.\n4. Trust in Allah's Provision (Tawakkul + Action) : \nHe had faith that Allah would provide, but he still took action. This is the correct understanding of tawakkul — trusting in Allah while working hard.\n5. Dignity in Earning One's Own Wealth :\nʿAbd al-Raḥmān ibn ʿAwf refused handouts, even though they were offered sincerely and generously. He chose to work instead of depending on others, saying:\n\"Show me the way to the market.\"\nThis teaches the virtue of earning your own living, even when you're offered easy wealth",

      "text": "Growing up we often learn religion from second hand sources. Our parents, online lecturers, IslamQA etc. We pray, we fast, and observe hijab. But we don’t know our lord, our book and who we are.\n\nStudies of Islam, Islamic history, society and culture is so important. I emphasise this because I am in a position of spiritual from not being taught my religion properly. Including the difficult parts.\n\nThings like inheritance laws, gender, sexuality, slavery and concubinage are mentioned in the Quran. If you don’t learn why those laws exist, the wisdom behind them and how we reconcile this, you will become disillusioned. I especially emphasise this for the sisters. \n\nAs whole, if you don’t do this, your children will learn from critics, the non-Muslims and they won’t teach them context, history and what Islam aims to do. Yes people are coming to Islam but are also leaving. We have to stop pretending everything is perfect.\n\nLearn your religion on your own and under scholars. Start with the Quran, tasfirs, sirah and Sunnah. Iqra was the first thing jibraeel AS said to the prophet. So do that.\n\nIslam asks us to seek, question and even doubt. Faith that doesn’t go through fire is brittle. And don’t learn for the sake of winning arguments or to appeal to the west. Don’t learn from apologists and those who sanitise our religion. Learn it as a whole.\n\nIt was narrated from Abu Hurairah that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said:\n“Islam began as something strange and will go back to being strange, so glad tidings to the strangers.’”\n\nI see way too many people jump to argue online and embarrass themselves. Stop doing that. Most of us have literacy. If you can’t read Arabic read a translated Quran WITH tafsir.\n\nWe used to contribute algebra, philosophy, science etc. Now we argue about mehr online and started calling humanities “bidah”.\n\nLearn your religion.",

Every day, I appreciate how blessed I am in this life, and it’s not because of great opportunities or wealth. It’s simply because I have all my limbs, I can breathe, eat, see, and earn money—things I once took for granted. When I see my brothers and sisters in places like Gaza, Congo, and elsewhere, I realize how blessed I am to be earning money and able to support them.

I would say that before the genocide of Palestinians, my philosophy was aligned with the philosophical school called Absurdism. I have always questioned the existence of God but genuinely thought, there is no way someone is listening to me. Is always with me. But everything changed with the level of evil we are seeing done to Palestinians daily. I’m part of a Palestinian advocacy group and some Muslim friends from the group introduced me to God’s justice. My despair transformed into something different. My anger…I would think of God’s justice and get intense goosebumps and chills. I started reading the Quran and sometimes I find peace and other times, I see myself and my family as part of the disbelievers and start to take it…personally? \n\nAnyway, I find myself going back and forth in terms of my belief in God. I wonder if my brain can truly believe. I’ve always wondered that. I’ve felt almost envy at times for people who do, who KNOW. So am I’m wondering if there are any people here who couldn’t, who now can? Who had that same question and now believe? Or maybe you know of someone I can talk to? I would be so grateful.",

      "text": "Excerpt from Umar Palanpuri (rah)’s speeches.\n\nPeople write to me that before I was not practicing I had problems. Now I am practicing, I still have problems. I receive letters as such.\n\nThis was the same complaint by the people of Musa (as).\n\n“They complained, “We have always been oppressed before and after you came to us with the message”. (7:129)\n\nBani Israel, the community of Musa (as) mentioned this:\n\n‘Before you came to us, we were sinful, and Pharaoh would oppress us. After you came to us, we accept and are obedient to you, but Pharaoh still oppresses us’.\n\nBefore I wasn’t practicing, I had problems. Now I am practicing, I still have problems.\n\nRemember this! There should be clarity and no confusion on this matter.  \n\nIn the hereafter, the righteous will experience blessings, while the sinful will face afflictions. The opposite will not occur; a righteous person will not face afflictions, nor will a sinful person receive blessings. Those whom Allah has decreed as righteous will be granted blessings, and those deemed sinful will encounter afflictions.\n\nBecause the hereafter is a ‘place of consequence’.\n\nBut in this world, the opposite can happen, a righteous person may face hardships while the sinful might enjoy comfort and ease.\n\nWhy?\n\nBecause this world is a ‘place of tests’.",

      "title": "Sharing my thoughts about how Islam is the true religion ",
      "text": "This might sound dumb to some people but here me out , I've been thinking about this for quite a while,and I am not sure if someone else share the same thoughts or not.\n\nI see a lot of Christian scholars argue and dispute with Islam scholars\n\n•Zakir Naik vs William Campbell\n•Ahmed Deedat vs Pastor Stanley \n\nBut hear me out,If Jesus was a real god , why would he let someone else take his identity just 600 years after? If I was a god I wouldn't let that happen, why would Jesus let Islam spread?\n\nThis also apply to the other religions ,Why would a god the control all over the Universe let his words be draped by another book?\n\nThis actually proves one thing, Islam is the only religion where no religion came after it that got spread all around the world becase as Allah says:\n\nSurah Al-Ma'idah (5:3):\n\n\"This day I have perfected for you your religion, and completed My favor upon you, and have approved for you Islam as your religion.\"\n\nThis verse is interpreted by scholars to mean that Islam is the final and complete way of life for humanity, with no need for further divine revelations.\n\nSurah Al-Ahzab (33:40):\n\n\"Muhammad is not the father of any of your men, but he is the Messenger of Allah and the Seal of the Prophets. And Allah has full knowledge of all things.\"\nThe phrase \"Seal of the Prophets\" (خاتم النبيين) means that Muhammad (peace be upon him) is the last prophet, indicating that no new prophet or religion will come after Islam\n\nAnd this is actually true as no prophet came after 1400 years, how would the prophet Mohamed (PBUH) know this? If he is as claimed to be that he fabricated the Quran , how would he see the future 1400 years after?\n\nIt's because Allah has full control over the Universe, he decides what things should be , he is the one who created it , it is he who create these rules.\n\nAllah's will is over anything else, we see a couple of verses that takes about Allah's will, Allah says:\n\n1. Surah Al-An’am (6:112):\n\n\"If your Lord had willed, those on earth would have believed, all of them entirely. Then, [O Muhammad], would you compel the people in order that they become believers?\"\n\n2. Surah Al-A'raf (7:188):\n\n> \"Say, 'I hold not for myself [the power of] benefit or harm, except what Allah has willed. And if I knew the unseen, I could have acquired much wealth, and no harm would have touched me. I am not except a warner and a bringer of good tidings to a people who believe.'\n\n3.Surah Al-Kahf (18:24):\n\n> \"Except , 'If your Lord wills.' And remember your Lord when you forget and say, 'Perhaps my Lord will guide me to what is nearer than this to right conduct.'\"\n\nThese verses emphasize that Allah's will is over anything else, if he willed something, that thing happens, because he is the one created space , time, and matter , he is the one who has full control over them.\n\nFor example: \n\nThe story of Abraham when he was thrown into the fire , Allah said :\n\n1. Surah Al-Anbiya (21:68-70)\n\n\"They said, 'Burn him and support your gods—if you are to act.' We said, 'O fire, be coolness and safety upon Ibrahim.' And they intended for him harm, but We made them the greatest losers.\"\n\n\nThis verse describes how the disbelievers attempted to harm Ibrahim by throwing him into the fire, but Allah miraculously made the fire cool and safe for him.\n\nBecause Allah is the one who created the they very subatomic and molecules of the fire, he is the one that has full control over it.\n\nWhat do we get from our previous talk?\n\nIf Allah wills something, the humans have no choice over it.\n\nAllah is the one who willed for all the religions to exist, because he is the one who sent all the prophets with their message, and each message was made specifically for such generation,but humans are the ones who distorted it.\n\nWe always say\" MashaAllah\" which translates to\" what Allah Willed\" when we see someone with a lot of wealth, why? Because Allah is the one who willed that this person should be rich, or for example someone with a lot of knowledge .\n\nAllah is the one who distributes provisions:\n\n\n1. Surah Al-Isra (17:30)\n\n \"Indeed, your Lord extends provision for whom He wills and restricts [it]. Indeed, He is ever, concerning His servants, Acquainted and Seeing.\"\n\n\n2. Surah Al-Ankabut (29:62)\n\n \"Allah extends provision for whom He wills of His servants and restricts it for him. Indeed, Allah is, of all things, Knowing.\"\n\nWe always say  \" In Sha Allah\" when we go plan to do something , because Allah is the one who wills if you will do as your plans or not.\n\nIt doesn't matter if you belive in Allah or not , Allah's  will always be superior, so Allah distributes provisions even for non-believers (Jeff Bezos for example)\n\nWithout Allah's will humanity will not continue, there has to be a superior power that controls and orgnizes humanity from start to beginning , that doesn't get tired or sleep, knows everything (past , future , present).\n\nAnd because Allah is uncreated he is basically limitless,Noone decided the limits of Allah ( he knows everything, (past , future , present) , capable of all things , also most importantly he can arrange all the affairs without intervention as Allah Says:\n\nAs-Sajdah (32:5):\n\n\"يُدَبِّرُ الْأَمْرَ مِنَ السَّمَاءِ إِلَى الْأَرْضِ ثُمَّ يَعْرُجُ إِلَيْهِ فِي يَوْمٍ كَانَ مِقْدَارُهُ أَلْفَ سَنَةٍ مِمَّا تَعُدُّونَ\"\n\"He manages the affair from the heaven to the earth; then it ascends to Him in a day, the measure of which is a thousand years of those you count.\"\n\nSo Allah is the one who does all the creation that happens contiously ( billions of human beings that are different in shape , voice and color , insects , Animals , fish even plants ) as Allah says:\n\n\nAl-Waqi'ah (56:63-64):\n\n \"أَفَرَأَيْتُم مَّا تَحْرُثُونَ، أَأَنتُمْ تَزْرَعُونَهُ أَمْ نَحْنُ الزَّارِعُونَ\"\n\"Have you seen what you sow? Is it you who make it grow, or are We the Grower?\"\n\n\nSurah As-Sajdah (32:7-9) :\n\"الَّذِي أَحْسَنَ كُلَّ شَيْءٍ خَلَقَهُ وَبَدَأَ خَلْقَ الإِنسَانِ مِنْ طِينٍ، ثُمَّ جَعَلَ نَسْلَهُ مِنْ سُلاَلَةٍ مِنْ مَّاءٍ مَّهِينٍ، ثُمَّ سَوَّاهُ وَنَفَخَ فِيهِ مِنْ رُوحِهِ وَجَعَلَ لَكُمُ السَّمْعَ وَالْأَبْصَارَ وَالْأَفْئِدَةَ قَلِيلًا مَّا تَشْكُرُونَ\"\n\"He who perfected everything which He created and began the creation of man from clay. Then He made his progeny from a fluid extract. Then He proportioned him and breathed into him of His [created] soul and made for you hearing, vision, and hearts; little are you grateful.\"\n\nSo just imagine the knowledge of Allah, he has the knowledge Of how to create over one million species of insects have been discovered and described but it is estimated that there may be as many as 10 million species on earth. \n\nAlso millions of Different animals and fish , we are also discovering new species contionusly, even the creation of Jinn that what Allah describes him self with :\n\n(Surah Al-Baqarah, 2:255)\n\"اللَّهُ لَا إِلٰهَ إِلَّا هُوَ الْحَيُّ الْقَيُّومُ لَا تَأْخُذُهُ سِنَةٌ وَلَا نَوْمٌ لَهُ مَا فِي السَّمَاوَاتِ وَمَا فِي الْأَرْضِ مَن ذَا الَّذِي يَشْفَعُ عِندَهُ إِلَّا بِإِذْنِهِ يَعْلَمُ مَا بَيْنَ أَيْدِيهِمْ وَمَا خَلْفَهُمْ وَلَا يُحِيطُونَ بِشَيْءٍ مِّنْ عِلْمِهِ إِلَّا بِمَا شَاءَ وَسِعَ كُرْسِيُّهُ السَّمَاوَاتِ وَالْأَرْضَ وَلَا يَئُودُهُ حِفْظُهُمَا وَهُوَ الْعَلِيُّ الْعَظِيمُ\"\n\n\"Allah! There is no deity except Him, the Ever-Living, the Sustainer of existence. Neither drowsiness overtakes Him nor sleep. To Him belongs whatever is in the heavens and whatever is on the earth. Who is it that can intercede with Him except by His permission? He knows what is before them and what will be after them, and they encompass not a thing of His knowledge except for what He wills. His Kursi extends over the heavens and the earth, and their preservation tires Him not. And He is the Most High, the Most Great.\"\n\nAllah is the one who orgnized this universe for life from sun that emits specific electromagnitc waves to trees that give us continous Oxygen to water cycle that helps maintain a costant portion of water on earth.\n\nAlso the fact that human beings have specific life time and not immortal as that would have caused problems of increased population .\n\nWho designed all of this?\n\nI will stop here since I don't want to make the post too long but :\n\nWith all this **How can you deny the existence of Allah?**",

It struck me how—despite being in a completely foreign place, surrounded by people I’d never met nor spoke the same language as—we were all moving in perfect unison. It felt just like praying back home, as if I were among people I’d grown up with.\n\nIt’s just incredible to me how these shared practices are present across different cultures, languages, and borders, through the preservation of our perfect and beautiful religion. No matter where we are, Salah connects us in a way that nothing else can. Just wanted to share that little reminder.",

There are many stories were people were rewardsd greatly for good hospitality (e.g. King Mkdas)and punished severely for bad hospitality (King lycaon). My parents have taught me that Ibrahim (as ) became the friend of Allah because of his hospitality. \n\n\n\nSimilarly, I have noticed how almost each religion has a great flood myth.\n\nFurthermore, I would alsolike to point out that polytheism started in mecca because people built statues to represent Allahs attributed and ended up worshipping them as seperate​ gods.

      "title": "Faith, Reason, and the Islamic Golden Age: How Religion Built—and Fractured—a Civilization’s Intellectual Legacy",
      "text": "The Islamic Golden Age (8th–14th century) stands as a testament to how deeply intellectual and religious values can intertwine to shape a civilization’s trajectory. What began as a theological project—rooted in Quranic injunctions to “reflect on the creation of the heavens and the earth” (3:191) and the hadith urging Muslims to “seek knowledge is mandatory upon every Muslim”—evolved into a flourishing era of scientific, medical, and philosophical innovation. Scholars like Ibn Rushd (Averroes) and Ibn Sina (Avicenna) saw their work as acts of devotion, blending Greek philosophy with Islamic theology to uncover the divine order of creation. Astronomy, for instance, was not merely a secular pursuit: Al-Battani’s refinements of Ptolemy’s models aimed to perfect the timing of Islamic prayers and the lunar calendar, illustrating how scientific inquiry was inseparable from spiritual practice.  \n\nThis religious framework also fostered a unique cultural openness. The Abbasid Caliphate’s House of Wisdom in Baghdad became a melting pot where scholars of diverse faiths—Muslim, Christian, Jewish, and Zoroastrian—translated and expanded upon Greek, Persian, and Indian texts. As Christopher de Bellaigue argues in *The Islamic Enlightenment, this was not just an exercise in curiosity but a deliberate theological endeavor to reconcile reason (‘aql) with revelation (naql). The rationalist Mu’tazilite theologians, dominant in the 9th century, insisted the Quran must align with logic, creating an intellectual culture where debate thrived. Their doctrine of the Quran’s “createdness” (viewing it as a product of time, not eternal) temporarily reshaped Abbasid thought, encouraging scholars to engage critically with philosophy and science.  \n\nYet by the 15th century, this dynamism began to wane. Traditional narratives often point to figures like Al-Ghazali, whose The Incoherence of the Philosophers critiqued rationalist overreach, as catalysts for decline. However, as historian George Saliba notes in Islamic Science and the Making of the European Renaissance, this oversimplifies a complex shift. Al-Ghazali himself was a polymath who valued empirical science; his critique targeted metaphysics, not reason. Instead, Saliba emphasizes geopolitical factors: the Mongol sack of Baghdad in 1258, which obliterated the House of Wisdom, and the Ottoman Empire’s prioritization of military expansion over scientific patronage. Later, European colonialism further distorted Islamic intellectual traditions. De Bellaigue highlights how 19th-century reformers like Egypt’s Muhammad Abduh sought to revive the Golden Age’s rationalism, but Western dominance often pushed societies toward defensive literalism, as seen in the Saudi-Wahhabi alliance’s rejection of ijtihad (independent reasoning).  \n\nThe legacy of this tension remains contested. Was the Golden Age’s brilliance inseparable from its religious roots, or did those roots later become a cage? De Bellaigue’s work complicates the narrative, showing how Ottoman Tanzimat reforms in the 1830s modernized law and education while invoking Islamic principles, and how Iran’s 1906 Constitutional Revolution initially saw clerics supporting democracy as compatible with Sharia. Yet colonial powers often undermined these movements, propping up autocrats who prioritized stability over intellectual revival.  \n\nSources:\n\nhttps://www.penguin.co.uk/books/416043/the-islamic-enlightenment-by-christopher-de-bellaigue/9780099578703\n\nDe Bellaigue's book is the foundation for much of this post, particularly his exploration of how Islamic societies navigated modernity, colonialism, and intellectual revival. His arguments about the Golden Age's legacy and its distortion by external forces deeply informed the discussion.\n\nhttps://archive.org/details/GeorgeSalibaIslamicScienceAndTheMakingOfTheEuropeanRenaissanceTransformationsStu\n\nSaliba's work complements de\nBellaigue's by challenging Eurocentric narratives of decline, emphasizing instead the geopolitical and economic shifts that reshaped Islamic intellectual traditions.",

At the time, I didn’t know what was happening but I knew it was bad. Me and my mom prayed that he would make it out alive. Looking back, that was the scariest moment of my life. But then, the impossible became possible. His heart had closed back together without the surgeons help. At the time I didn’t know how much of a blessing this was. But now I know that that may have been the biggest miracle of my whole life. Allah is the way, the path, and the righteousness of life. Put your soul into him and he’ll give you the things you deserve. And at that time, I think I really deserved it.",

      "text": "Non Muslim here. I have a question regarding my faith and the Qur’an.\n\nGood evening everybody. I am new here. I was raised in a Christian household. My mum would take me to church, and I participated in attending bible studies and youth groups. Being Christian was something I was very familiar with, and while I do have some fond memories from childhood I do not remember a specific special connection to Christianity itself, God, the Holy Spirit etc.. Slowly but surely, I became less and less faithful. \n\nMy mum sadly passed away recently, and my heart is full of hatred, anger, envy.. I’ve felt very nihilistic towards everything at some points like none of this matters anyways. I’ll die someday.\n\nI’ve tried to connect back with the faith I was raised in. I do not feel called towards Christianity and I never have done.\n\nHowever, a few weeks ago I was scrolling through social media and I came across a live video of somebody reciting the Qur’an during the Ramadan period. Every little bit of heaviness fell from me. I felt light, peaceful and engaged with the present. Tears of happiness welled up in my eyes. I was inconsolable, but I didn’t feel sadness at all. I felt warmth, and protection. It was beautiful.\n\nToday whilst out shopping, I heard people in the centre reciting passages and lessons from Qur’an. I was extremely busy, and in a rush to get to where I needed to go. But I stopped in my tracks, sat down on the bench and listened. The tears started forming in my eyes, I bowed my head down in my hands and closed my eyes. That same feeling of peace and love from weeks ago washed over me again. (Even right now typing this, I’m crying.) \n\nI’ve always found Islam to be a beautiful religion. I had Muslim classmates who were very humble, kind and wise. I love the fact Islam is very family oriented. The holidays, the prayers and traditions. Muslims are very in tune with their relationship with Allah, yet I never felt like that the whole time I was a Christian. Muslims are some of the kindest, knowledgeable and caring people I’ve ever encountered. I’m not the type of person to cry easily, but hearing the Qur’an and the teachings makes me feel light, protected and so peaceful. \n\nWhy might this be? It’s almost like my heart is yearning. To feel like all hope is lost one minute, to then hearing the Qur’an and teachings that brings back this feeling of peace the next. What should I do about it? I am very curious, and would like some answers or guidance from somebody. Thank you very much for taking your time to read this. I appreciate it.",

      "text": "I want to apologize if this is the wrong forum, but I couldn’t think of a better place to ask than here. I am and have always been Christian. To me, this is more than a choice of religion: it’s a matter of innate faith, a truth that I know to be. That said, my conviction doesn’t mean that other faiths don’t bring anything to the table in terms of thought and philosophy. Due to my relative lack of social exposure, and the general ignorance toward the Islamic faith in my part of the world, I feel a void in my understanding of the world. \n\nI don’t really know how to open the discourse, but I guess my big questions are:\n\n1. What are the differences in our faiths, from your perspective (not necessarily based on research, I’m interested in your personal perspective as well)?\n\n2. What do our faiths have in common, again, from your perspective? This is a key element to me. Let’s say we’re correct, and there is one supreme God above all, whatever his name. I’m curious about the commonalities between our interpretations of his word. Muslims, Christian, and Jews alike all follow the same conceptual being, but we all interpret his word differently, and I would love to seek common ground from which to grow together. \n\nGiven the current political climate, I think it’s more important now than ever before to work toward understanding each other. At the risk of incurring the wrath of random internet strangers, I’m not shy, nor ashamed to say, that I stand firmly on the side of “stop killing each other!!!” Yes, both sides have committed crimes, but Allah/Yahweh/Jehova has left us a message of forgiveness and progress. Help me understand Islam better through the framework of my upbringing, so that I can share what I learn, and hopefully help spread a greater understanding between cultures and faiths. \n\nIf, in my post, I’ve been disrespectful or ignorant, let me know. I can’t claim to have studied well, so it stands to reason I may misstep and accidentally act disrespectfully, so my apologies in advance. My hope is that we can break down barriers through discourse, and come to a more thorough understanding of the world. Our God gave us all pieces of the truth, I can only hope to piece a few together in my lifetime. \n\nBlessings to you all, cousins!\n\nEdit: God didn’t “have us” anything, but he gave us so much. Including the gift of linguistics, like how to spell “gave.”",

      "title": "[Revert] I took my Shahada, now feeling isolated but stronger in my faith than ever",
      "text": "Salaam everyone,\n\nI took my Shahada in February this year, and for the first time in years, I felt a kind of peace and happiness that grounded me. It felt like my heart had finally come home. I knew, deeply and without doubt, that this is the truth. And I still feel that every single day.\n\nMy first Ramadan came not long after. It was beautiful in its own quiet way: spiritual, meaningful, but also incredibly lonely. I didn’t have anyone to share iftar with, no one to talk about fasting or attend taraweeh with. I did what I could to honour it, but it often felt like I was clinging to something sacred while surrounded by people who just couldn’t see it.\n\nAt first, my friends were really supportive. They congratulated me and said they were happy for me. But not long after, I was sat down and given an unsolicited talk. A whole conversation about their “concerns” with my life choices and my faith. I don’t think it came from a place of cruelty, just ignorance and discomfort. But it hurt deeply. Since then, it hasn’t felt safe or welcome to practice my faith openly around them.\n\nWhen I was feeling my loneliest, when I felt like the people closest to me couldn’t understand or accept something that meant the world to me, I would sit quietly with my Qur’an. And again and again, this verse would bring me back to myself:\n\n“Allah does not burden a soul beyond that it can bear.”\n(Surah Al-Baqarah, 2:286)\n\nI would repeat it to myself like a balm, because even when I didn’t feel strong, I knew that He believed I could carry it. And that comfort alone kept me going.\n\nI suspect a big part of my friends’ discomfort came from seeing me become more visibly Muslim. I started wearing my hijab more consistently, with pride and sincerity. And I could feel the shift. Their energy changed. I sometimes wonder if they were worried someone they know might see me and ask questions they didn’t want to answer. But that’s not their burden to carry, and certainly not their place to police.\n\nMy hijab is not a costume or a phase. It’s an act of worship, a powerful symbol of devotion to my Creator. It means everything to me. To be made to feel shame over that, by people who once claimed to support me, was incredibly painful.\n\nI live in a town where there’s basically no Muslim community. I’ve had to do most of my learning and practicing alone. But even through the isolation, my iman has only grown. I’ve been learning how to pray properly, reading, reflecting, making dhikr, and strengthening my connection with Allah SWT day by day. Alhamdulillah, He has never left me alone.\n\nSoon, I’ll be moving to a new city, one with a vibrant Muslim community. I’m so looking forward to living openly as a Muslim woman, to shopping at halal butchers, visiting masjids, joining revert groups, and building a real sense of belonging. I can’t wait.\n\nMy mother is not Muslim, but she’s never judged me. She just wants me to be happy. And if Islam brings me happiness, she accepts that. I make du’a that, insha’Allah, one day she finds her way to Allah’s deen too.\n\nI guess I’m posting this to ask: has anyone else experienced this kind of pushback and loneliness? Especially in the beginning, with little to no community? How did you navigate it?\n\nJazakAllah khair to anyone who reads this. May Allah guide us all and keep us firm. Ameen.",

      "title": "How do I restore my faith in Allah?",
      "text": "Sorry about the rant in advance. So, about two years ago when I turned 16, during Ramadan, I had finally started to pray and be more religious to Allah. I was proud of myself and even sometimes, I’d be praying the sunnah prayers. But I do admit that while I was praying most of the time, either something was on my mind, and I couldn’t focus much on my prayer, or I legitimately felt nothing.\n\nWhat I mean by that is as I prayed lots of times, it started to become a loop, where I’d just do these actions, go down, say these specific words, and close the prayer. I should mention that when I was a kid, I didn’t live in a country with fluent Arabic so I legit have no understanding, especially of the Arabic displayed in the Quran, which is why I also read the shortest surahs over and over in my prayers (Al-Ikhlaas, An-Nas, Al-Kawthar, and Al-Asr).  Sometimes, I’d get motivation and read the Quran with an English translation in hand to understand it, but even some terms confuse me as I read them. I’d only ever made it to the end of Surat Al-Baqarah. \n\nTwo years later, as I’m in my summer vacation, I am sad to say that my prayers haven’t been as frequent as much, sometimes I barely pray anymore, and I have a specific sin that I can’t stop for some reason, despite the guilt that washes over me everytime. I’m definitely not proud of what I’m doing but I really seek help in restoring my faith. Because it’s at the point where I realize I haven’t seen any signs from Allah since I’ve started praying. Yes, I’m guessing a sign is that I feel guilty for not praying, but it’s more than that to me. I obviously believe Islam is the one true religion, I do believe in Allah, but I haven’t felt anything to prove so, and I’m in desperate need of help, because with all this tension around the world (politics, religion, death, end times, etc.), it’s stressing me bcz I’m afraid for my life, and I am so afraid for Allah’s judgement, despite my struggling beliefs. I also think I have major anxiety for death and the end times to the point where if the term gets mentioned, my heart can speed up crazy. I don’t know what to do.\n\nIf anyone can please give thoughtful advice, I’d really appreciate it.",

It seems like as long as your partner is a *practicing* theist, that this type of marriage should no less feasible than other marriages, even if some challenges might be unique.

      "title": "The Life of Prophet Nuh (A.S.): A Story of Patience, Perseverance, and Faith",
      "text": "**Introduction**\n\nProphet Nuh (A.S.), known as Noah in Biblical tradition, is one of the greatest prophets in Islam. His life is a powerful example of unshakable faith, patience in the face of rejection, and trust in Allah’s plan. Mentioned over **43 times in the Qur’an** across several chapters, Nuh’s mission stands as a timeless reminder of the importance of Tawheed (belief in the oneness of Allah) and steadfastness in calling people to the truth.\n\n# Early Life and Mission\n\nNuh (A.S.) was born into a society that had abandoned the worship of Allah. They had begun worshipping idols named **Wadd, Suwa’, Yaghuth, Ya’uq, and Nasr** (Qur’an 71:23). These idols were originally built to honor pious men but later became objects of worship.\n\nAllah chose Nuh (A.S.) as His messenger to guide his people back to the worship of the One true God.\n\n>\n\n# 950 Years of Da’wah\n\nOne of the most remarkable aspects of Prophet Nuh’s mission was its length. He called his people to Allah for **950 years** (Qur’an 29:14) — both in public and private, day and night.  \nHe invited them with kindness, patience, and wisdom, yet the majority rejected him.\n\n>\n\n# Rejection and Mockery\n\nNuh’s people were arrogant. The leaders dismissed him, saying he was just a man like them. They mocked him, claimed he was misguided, and refused to abandon their idols.  \nEven his own **wife** and **son** disbelieved and chose the company of wrongdoers. This shows that guidance is a matter of the heart, not family ties.\n\n# The Divine Command to Build the Ark\n\nAfter centuries of rejection, Allah revealed to Nuh (A.S.) that no more people would believe except those who had already accepted the message.\n\n>\n\nNuh began building the ark on dry land. The disbelievers mocked him, asking why he was building a ship far from the sea. His response was filled with certainty:\n\n>\n\n# The Great Flood\n\nWhen Allah’s command came, springs gushed from the earth and rain poured from the skies. Nuh (A.S.) took the believers and pairs of every creature onto the ark.\n\n>\n\nThe waters rose high, covering mountains. Even Nuh’s disbelieving son, who thought he could escape by climbing a mountain, was drowned.\n\n>\n\n# After the Flood\n\nWhen the decree was fulfilled, the waters subsided, and the ark came to rest on Mount Judi (Qur’an 11:44). The believers disembarked to rebuild life on earth.  \nNuh (A.S.) thanked Allah for His mercy and prayed for forgiveness for himself, his parents, the believers, and even for those who sought guidance.\n\n# Prophet Nuh in Hadith\n\nThe Prophet Muhammad ﷺ mentioned Nuh (A.S.) as one of the five greatest messengers — **Ulul Azm** — alongside Ibrahim (A.S.), Musa (A.S.), Isa (A.S.), and Muhammad ﷺ (Sahih al-Bukhari).  \nOn the Day of Judgment, people will seek intercession from various prophets, and when they approach Nuh (A.S.), he will recall the magnitude of his mission and trials.\n\n# Accomplishments and Lessons\n\n* **Steadfastness in faith:** Preached for nearly a millennium without giving up.\n* **Trust in Allah:** Built the ark purely on Allah’s command.\n* **Moral courage:** Faced mockery and rejection but stood firm.\n* **Clear Tawheed message:** Fought against idol worship.\n\n# Qur’anic Chapters Highlighting Prophet Nuh (A.S.)\n\n* **Surah Nuh (71):** Complete chapter on his mission.\n* **Surah Hud (11:25–49):** Story of the ark and the flood.\n* **Surah Al-Mu’minun (23:23–30):** Brief account of his call and the rescue of believers.\n* **Surah Al-Qamar (54:9–15):** Describes the flood and the ark.\n* **Surah As-Saffat (37:75–82):** Allah’s response to his prayers.\n\n# Modern Lessons from Prophet Nuh’s Story\n\n* **Patience in Dawah:** Change takes time — sometimes generations.\n* **Standing firm on truth:** Even if the majority rejects you.\n* **Obedience to Allah:** His command may seem strange at first but carries divine wisdom.\n* **Family is not a guarantee of faith:** True connection is through belief, not bloodline.\n\n# Conclusion\n\nThe story of Prophet Nuh (A.S.) is more than a historical account — it’s a living guide for believers today. His patience, dedication, and unwavering trust in Allah offer lessons for anyone striving to live a life of faith.  \nAt a time when faith is often tested, remembering Nuh’s perseverance reminds us that ultimate success lies in obedience to Allah, regardless of worldly approval.",

But instead of being truly grateful, I became too focused on work. I started missing my prayers, by delaying them until the very last minute, sometimes skipping them altogether. I even stayed late at the office intentionally just to finish work.\n\nFour months into the job, I got sick and needed a long recovery treatment. So my 6 months contract wasn’t renewed by the company. At that moment, I felt like Allah was waking me up, calling me to come closer to Him.\n\nAlhamdulillah, during this unemployment period (it’s been 19 months now), I’ve felt more connected to Allah. I started by fixing my five daily prayers, began practicing sunnah acts like tahajjud, dhuha, fasting on Mondays and Thursdays, and read the Qur’an more often. I also relearned the significance of sacred days in Islam like Ramadan, Eid al-Fitr, Dzulhijjah, the Day of Arafah, and Eid al-Adha.\n\nAlhamdulillah, I now feel like I’m on a blessed spiritual journey. It’s been tough, but it’s brought me a deep sense of peace and grounding.\n\nOn the Day of Arafah this year, I sincerely made du’a to be granted another job, one where I can maintain my faith and continue walking on the right path. I miss working. I miss socializing. I miss getting paid, giving gifts to my parents and my little sibling. I want to live my life again, but this time with more balance between work, worship, and personal well-being.\n\nI hope. I pray. I beg Allah to bless me with a better opportunity than before.\n\nPlease, I kindly ask for your du’a. My name is Alzena. May Allah grant and bless me with a job better than the one I lost. I truly believe His plans are far better than mine. May He grant all of our good wishes and protect us all always.\n\nAamiin. Jazakallahu khair.",

      "text": "Assalamualaikum everyone!\n\nThis is a little vent post.\n\nI don't even know were or how I should start it, and I'm not even sure why I am posting it in the first place. I think I just need some.. support and advice, I guess?\n\nSo, the thing is, I am a revert muslim. I often mention it. Once left islam, now, back. Have been an ex muslim for a period.\n\nI really love islam, I see the beauty in it, and obviously, want as many people as possible, to see it too!\nI think most Muslims feel the same way, and it is a beautiful thing!\n\nBut the thing is, this urge to \"show the beauty or islam\" to people, have lead to something alike to \"savior complex\" (please don't take the term to directly, I am not an expert on the terminology, I just don't know what else I can call it).\n\nI spend quite much time online, even though it is not exactly good for me, but still. \nIn different forums, groups, communities, I often see posts, comments, and people talking about how they struggle with faith, or that they perhaps have some questions, doubts, etc. Both from Muslims and non Muslims.\n\nWhen I see such, I always tend to try and help people. Answer the questions if I have the knowledge, talk to them, support, listen, clarify misunderstanding or misinformation, etc.\n\nAnd from the first look, it is a good thing to do, right? It is my duty as a muslim to help others.\n\nBut a thing I have noticed with myself, is that It somewhat have become... unhealthy.\nI don't just try to help others. I overthink it. I stress.\nI push myself to the brink, neglect everything, just in an attempt to help someone online.\n\nAnd I am not trying to \"show of\", with this post, feed my ego or act like I am such an angel and kind person and bla bla bla. Thats truly not my intentions.\n\nI'm just exhausted. Emotionally, and physically.\n\nWhen I say that I neglect myself, I mean it.\n\nLike, as example, I can spend nearly the whole night chatting with someone, even though I know I have to weak up early. I love helping people, love listening to them, knowing that I became a space that they feel safe and comfortable in, and I take much honour in it.\n\nBut the next morning? \nMy body and brain is not functioning. I feel awful. Becuase i didn't get enough sleep. Becuase i was trying to help someone and felt I can't go to sleep before I answer all of their questions.\n\nOr, another example. I may have, let us say, an hour before I have to leave the house. I have the hour to get ready, to make breakfast, eat, etc.\nAnd what do I do instead? Talk to people online. Trying to soothe, support, help.\nAt the end, leaving the house looking like a mess, and knowing I haven't eaten breakfast, and probably won't eat anything for 5-8 hours.\nJust because I felt that the person who is struggling, is worth more then my health. And maybe it is like that.\nDoesn't make it any less exhausting.\n\nEmotionally it is also difficult. It can be nice to know that I managed to help someone out there, or maybe show how beautiful islam is to someone.\nBut it still is so...draining. \n\nEspecially since I overthink. Overthink everything.\nHow does that person feel right now? What should I say? What can the next question be? Should I say this or that? Speak directly or more soft? Listen, or talk? Did I say something wrong? What if I push someone from islam? What if I make a mistake?\n\nIt drives me nearly insane.\n\nI don't know what to do. I actually have much more to say, but I fear no one will be bothered to read too much text, and this post is already long, so I end this now.\n\nAnyway, thanks for reading it, and may go bless you all!🤍✨",

But at the same time, the majority of people in these religions are way less strict, can do all those things, and yet can still be very spiritual and involved with God and wisdom from their traditions and heritage. Is this the case in Islam?  I have heard that something like 20-30% are not so strict and the faith they practice is perfectly consistent with sharing the world equally with people of other faiths. I am honestly just asking and out of respect I’m asking the actual people as opposed to listening to people in the media.",

What’s concerning me now is that I know many anti Islamic organizations whether Zionist or evangelical have been really targeting Islam more than ever due to its popularity and influence. I am definitely paranoid that a lot of these posts and the way this app is set up is to infuse doubt and confusion in our community and try to trick people away from the faith. I do see other posts here about donations and prayer questions… normal stuff.

I am also a very self-interested person, I've never felt a need to do anything that didn't benefit me. For those of you that are interested in theology, you've probably heard of the Pascal's Wager argument, and I won't go into it here, but I'll say that it's convincing to me. To me, Islam provides the most appealing description of the afterlife, and it also provides a lot of positives in this life as well (things like community). So, in my view, becoming a muslim seems like the correct thing to do when given the choice of belief or no belief. But my question is: will I receive the benefit of an eternal afterlife in heaven if I have no faith but choose to believe and act out the rituals just like a faithful muslim would simply for the rewards?",

      "text": "Hello! First off I am not Muslim, I am just someone with an interest in the three Abrahamic religions. I just wanted to be clear about myself and so you knew the place I am asking from. \n \nI asked this elsewhere and now I am interested in the answer that here may have as well. I suppose I ask for myself, as a self described \"hopeful agnostic\", who struggles with \"feeling\" faith/belief. I want to get different perspectives on it from different religions.\n\nI also believe my own Autism plays a part in these feelings, as Autism often affects the way one is able to recognise and \"connect\" to feelings. I would describe myself as feeling almost \"broken\" in that regard.\n\n**My question is**, how does Islam approach those who are meant to/want to believe but struggle to *actually believe*? \n \nSay there is a person who wanted to believe, they are drawn to religion and want to be a part of it, but this person struggles with an internal sense of lack of faith. No matter what, this person finds it difficult to say they believe and that if they *did* say it then they would **feel** like they were lying and claiming something ridiculous. (The reason that this person feels this way likely being a mix of their struggles with autism and also because they grew up in an atheist environment and was always surrounded by education and media that portrayed all religions as something superstitious and \"silly\" or \"ridiculous\" to believe in. If that makes sense, so this feeling has been \"embedded\" into them almost, like how local cultural beliefs are.)\n\nHow does it work here? Are they considered a non believer even though their lack of faith is not by choice? Are they considered failed if they never feel like they truly believed even if they tried? Do religious acts, like prayers or rituals, still *count* for something under Islam? I suppose here I wonder if, in Islam, faith alone is considered the most important or if acts and involvement with the religion (even if faith struggles to grow) and I guess a \"hope\" for lack of a better term that one day true faith/belief will happen also \"counts\"?\n\nHas there ever been any official rulings or guidance and such on how individuals who may struggle with belief both by itself and also because of a mental disability fit into Islam?\n\nThank you for your time!",

      "text": "From childhood I have been in and out of Tableeghi Jamats. I have gone to sarozahs but i have never been consistent with their daily activities or discussion sessions. And so I have always noticed that they have a blind belief and trust in Allah. For me, the things that are in my control; like exams or success in life etc, I can never fully hundred percent belief in Allah to get me good grades or more success. This is because of two things. The first is that everyone says that Allah only helps after you have put your fair share of effort which means doing as much hard work as possible on my end. And the second because, people say that Allah will never do injustice to the one who worked harder and so where does that leaves me. \n\nOn the other hand, the things that are simply not in my control, I fully belief in Allah. If I am being honest that because I don't have any other option.\n\nAnd so, I see these members of Tableeghi Jamats thriving with 60% of effort on their part and getting very good results. Whereas, for me a chapter I left intentionally and if it does come in the exams, I am more likely to be doomed because Allah will never do injustice to someone who studies harder and someone who never studied/didn't study as hard. Thus, as a result, in such things I can leave things to chance.\n\nSo please someone clarify this paradox to me. Because the motto of tableeghi jamat, no offence intended, Allah is the one doing and nothing can better can come if Allah doesn't will it which I truly belief but, then how much effort is required on my part. Because if i am putting 50% of the effort when i can put 100%, clearly I am not doing my part of the hard work which is what i take from this.",

      "text": "Hi all, i'm non-muslim, however i am planning to convert. I've done my best to study and learn about islam, however, without any guide, i've only gone so far. I've tried to pray, and i know it may be wrong, but i'm learning. i'm planning to convert, especially if i were to marry into an islam family. at first, i only thought of converting for marriage, i never truly had any belief. then i started to learn more about islam on my own, and for the first time in my life, i felt connected... as if i finally understood what people meant when they say they \"felt\" god, when god heard them. That being said, my family is supportive of me... so i told them about it, and they didn't see any negatives in that. My family is buddhist, our bloodline has not even a single ounce of any religion outside of buddhism, not that we know of... except for those who married out and had to convert. But even then, they all married into christianity, not a single one of us is islam or have any links to it till me.  \nNow comes a few days ago, when my mom and i had a discussion. I was fasting, and she asked why i was as she thought i was doing this for my partner. My response was that i was doing this for myself, and i was. However, she didn't seem so pleased with it and didn't really believe me. She was worried that i was doing this to myself, \"following\" my partner's words and subjecting hardship on myself, especially when my partner wasn't even fasting when i did. I understood what she meant and could tell she didn't really want me to fast. So now, i have stopped, also because i've gotten my yk... so i cannot fast, which allows me the time to seek help and advice on this matter. This matter also being, she brought up about me wanting to convert. Apparently, while both my parents seem supportive, they're actually not so willing for me to convert. They didn't say anything as they wanted me to be happy, however, they also felt deeply saddened about it. In their religion, when they've passed on, their offspring offers food, \"hell\" money, drinks and offerings at where they've been put to rest. Obviously, i will not be able to do so when i've converted. My brother, will also not be able to do so as he doesn't live in the same country as us. Technically, I'm the last of our bloodline, and in my mom's words... if i leave, then they'll be left as wandering souls without a home, money or food. I understand what islams view on this is, but i know they believe different so i cannot say anything to that either. I don't know what to do... while i believe in islam, and that there's only one true god, allah... i feel as though i'm compellingly unable to fail my parent's in such a way. my heart broke when she said that to me, to make matters more solidified.\n\ni also have to put it out there that i know it is haram to even be dating, however please understand that i wasn't raised muslim and my partner was not religious before he met me either (though he comes from a religious family). we both know it is haram, and so we would like to make it halal... however given this \"issue\" of conflict i now have, there's a standstill. my partner and i also have our own set of issues in our relationship where my love and patience has already begun to turn into resentment, which makes me slightly reluctant on making us halal. because as my mom also did say to me during our discussion, \"we raised you with love, why are you subjecting yourself to hardship? (if i chose to marry him and proceed to live the life she leads.)\"  \nmy mom is a housewife, she cooks and cleans often... constantly tired. but she accepts all this because my father is a man who respects her wishes and she, herself. he doesn't do what she dislikes, and when she tells him something, he listens and follows. goes both ways. but with my partner, that is not the case, hence her words.\n\nit feels like... i would commit sins for my loved ones, i would subject myself to hell and not to see jannah just for my parents. that's how lost i feel. is there any saying of this in the quran or anything? i need advice... help.\n\ntldr: i feel lost because my family and i have differing beliefs in peace, and what comes after death. i have no one to turn to on this as all my friends are either non muslim or non religious muslims who do their best but don't really understand enough to help me either.",

So what were to happen if a couple were to get married, and the man decides to convert to another faith, such as Christianity? What specifically would the woman have to do? Is she obligated to divorce him? Or is she encouraged, but not requited to divorce him? I know divorce is discouraged but a bit more lenient in Islam so I'm curious what a woman in this situation would have to do.\n\n  \nThanks ahead!",

I fear hell and crave heaven. When told by my family to pray, I rush the prayer then go back to doing what I was doing. \n\nThe core belief that God exists and Prophet Mohammad Peace Be Upon Him was his last messenger is still in me but I can't seem to even pray or give importance to any of God's names or Surahs. \n\nI can do rozas somehow like in Ramadan, I'll fast for the whole month without any issue, might be cause that's habit. I often say Alhamdulillah when something good happens and when I sin and then finish it, I say Astarghfirullah.\n\nI know God exists but idk what to do either. I've had suicidal thoughts alot along with depression. I listen to music and read custom smut. \n\nAny advice or tips?

      "text": "I was born into Islam but wasn’t a practicing Muslim. I believed science was the ultimate truth and saw religion as something people had \"invented\" to find hope and cope with the fear of natural calamities. However, at 17, I began questioning—not out of fear, but out of a genuine pursuit of truth. Now, at 20, I follow Islam by choice, not by birth. I believe one should question their faith and never fear the questions, because truth withstands scrutiny. Every challenge I’ve explored has led me to satisfying and reasonable answers—something I can’t say for other religions. I'm sharing this so that others who have doubts or waswas (whispers of doubt) don’t fear questioning their faith or feel guilty about it. Doubt isn’t hypocrisy, nor does it make someone an atheist—it’s a natural part of seeking truth. If Islam is true, it will stand up to scrutiny, and no sincere question will lead you away, only deeper in understanding.",

      "title": "Struggling with My Faith: Is the Current State of Muslim Nations a Reflection of Islam or External Factors?",
      "text": "As a Muslim, I’ve been grappling with some doubts about the current state of Muslim nations and how it reflects on Islam itself. I understand that trials and hardships might be a test from Allah, meant to distinguish true believers. However, a haunting thought keeps coming back to me:\n\nWhat if the challenges we face today stem from the fundamental design of Islam itself?\n\nHere’s what I mean:\n\n1. Islam emphasizes unity, yet Muslim nations today are deeply divided, often along sectarian or ideological lines. If Islam is a perfect system, why hasn’t it been able to create a stronger sense of unity among its followers, especially in comparison to other systems? For example, the European Union or even secular systems seem to foster better cooperation and collective growth.\n2. During the Islamic Golden Age, Muslims were leaders in innovation, science, and philosophy. However, in the modern era, we lag far behind in technological and scientific advancements. If Islam is perfect, why hasn’t it consistently pushed Muslims to innovate on par with the rest of the world? Could it be that Islam was advanced for its time but has become outdated in addressing the challenges of the modern world?\n3.  I often hear, “Islam is perfect; Muslims are not.” But doesn’t a perfect system inherently produce better outcomes for its users? For instance, a well-designed education system tends to produce well-educated individuals. Shouldn’t the same logic apply to Islam? Why are Muslim nations struggling so much with governance, human rights, and development if Islam offers a comprehensive guide for life?\n\nI’m not trying to attack Islam—this is coming from a place of sincere curiosity and frustration. I want to understand if these issues are due to external historical, political, and economic factors or if there are intrinsic limitations in how Islam as a system interacts with modernity.\n\nHave others struggled with similar thoughts? How have you reconciled them? Are there historical or theological insights that could help me understand this better?",

This is just question but is it possible to start praying once or twice or 3 times a day until I fully get back into it its just because of college and its so tough to do so and the fact that Ive forgotten some of it makes it even harder",

      "text": "Salaam everyone and ramadan mubarak. I just want to talk about my recent feelings somewhere. I am born and raised Muslim alhamdulillah but have had a complicated relationship with Islam my whole life, a lot of it due to cultural/family trauma. I would fast and do the basics but rarely ever felt true connection. \n\nThis Ramadan, I have been doing all my prayers, keeping all my fasts, and been donating zakat regularly. I honestly haven’t been this dedicated to Ramadan since I was a teenager. Today, I was reflecting on this shift in my faith this year and wondering what may have contributed to it. There’s a lot but I kept going back to one thing: the resilience and faith of the Palestinian people in Gaza and beyond. \n\nSince the beginning of the recent genocide in Palestine, I have done my best to be politically active in the community, boycott, protest, educate others, even host events to spread awareness about the struggles of the Palestinian people. \n\nTo see pictures and videos of the Palestinian people in Gaza praying in the middle of rubble of their destroyed homes, hosting sehri get togethers in the rubble, break fast in their refugee camp tents. It literally makes me so emotional. For a people who have gone through so much pain and suffering and injustice to love Allah SWT so much still is so inspiring to me. \n\nThe resilience and dedication to continue to keep living that the Palestinian people embody encouraged me to be like them in that way. I am safe, fed, very privileged and of course life is stressful sometimes, but there is so much I have been blessed with and so much to be grateful for. I think of the quote from a poem of Dr. Refaat Alareer (a Palestinian martyr): “If I must die you must live to tell my story…If I must die let it bring hope”\n\nI’m sure my frontal lobe being officially done developing has contributed to this as well, but I want to acknowledge the impact Palestine has had on me as a Muslimah. The fact that they still have so much faith and conviction is amazing subhanallah. \n\nI am so happy I found my way back and am doing better in my faith and practice. Alhamdulillah for everything and alhamdulillah for Palestine. \n\nMay we all see a Free Palestine soon in this lifetime inshallah and may Allah SWT make us all better Muslims ❤️",

      "text": "In my previous posts in last year..if anybody remembers that I had told that I was an exmuslim but then I was blessed by knowledge and understood my faith and became a Muslim again alhumdulliah \n\nBut today I'm going to share about something which might sound ridiculous or confusion to some people but I will not tell them wrong Caz I am also confused about my own life..I believe life is a journey and not everyone's life is same\n\nWell back in 2023 I was an ex muslim because I was brainwashed by some influencers and their accusations against Islam..so I was researching by my own as in a secular mind..but in 2023's a day before of ramadan I was feeling an urge to become a Muslim all of a sudden and pray..keep it in mind that I was an ex muslim and my research or investigation whatever u say wasn't over..I was in various doubts on Deen and other things..but I didn't think twice I did ghusl,wore fresh clothes,took shahada by myself and prayed salat after 1-2 years..yeah I did fasting and prayed salat and did other Duas.. but I had confusions and other things on my mind too but I didn't listen them and I did my prayers..I was feeling an inner happiness and I kept going\n\nBut after a few days of fasting I mistakenly broke my fast by doing something which was not good and I don't want to share about it...I understood my fast was broke and so like my mind started to get questions again and again that what am I doing? Why I am doing? My questions are answered? My research wasn't done? Why am I praying? Is Islam true religion? Is God true? And many more so in simple words after my fast was broke my mind got too many questions or waswasa of Shaitan..I became more confused..I was not in my mind...but I don't know..I didn't listen to them..all I had on my mind that I have to do ghusl and pray again and do the Qadha Fast again after Eid..so I did ghusl..but at that point I was very confused I didn't even know if I was a Muslim or not or something..but I did ghusl and that day I couldn't pray a single salat because whenever I used to stand for salat my mind used to get full of questions and more..like Am I a Muslim? Is God True? Is Islam true? And many more\n\nSo after that day my mind became kinda cool and I started to pray again\n\n\nAfter that ramadan I started to research again in a secular mind by reading Quran in my native language and trying to understand the meaning..and did research on various madhabs and other things so i could understand the Word of Allah\n\n\nNow my question is\n\n1.Do I have to fast for those 30 days again? Because I was in a confusion between being a Muslim and not being a Muslim and having doubts?\n2. Was my ghusl invalid because I was in a moment of confusion?\n\n\nBtw I can't share this with anyone from my irl because for some issues\nThat's why I'm here..I saw many ppl asking their questions \nSo I thought I could get answers to my questions too\n\n\nThanks for reading\nMay Allah bless u\nRamadan Kareem",

      "text": "Salam everyone, I’m struggling with two significant situations in my life, and it’s affecting my faith in people, especially men, and the concept of a happy marriage.  \n\nSituation 1- My Dad’s Affair\nMy dad, who is in his early 60s (not religious at all) and has been married to my mom for 30 years, is having an affair with my mom’s best friend. This woman is the same age as my mom and has a reputation for inappropriate relationships. Her husband and daughter kicked her out of their house because of her behavior. Currently, she’s publicly in an affair with another man, which has already destroyed his family. Secretly, she is also having an affair with my dad. I discovered this when my dad gave me his phone to type an email while driving. I saw their chat and became suspicious, leading me to find more evidence. They frequently meet, call each other whenever my dad is alone, and even video call. She lives near his workplace stays alone and my dad visits her. I suspect she’s the reason he’s been running out of money and asking to use my mom’s card frequently.(The mistress doesn't have a job)\n\nSituation 2: My To-Be Husband  \nWhile preparing for my wedding, something happened that made me question my relationship. One day, my to-be husband visited and opened Snapchat to take a picture of my cats. Accidentally, he opened a feed that looked like YouTube Shorts (I don’t use Snapchat, so I’m unsure), and inappropriate videos popped up. He looked at me with an uncomfortable smile, and I was shocked.  \nThis incident made me check his Instagram following list, where I found it filled with private accounts of naked or half-naked women. He comes from a Maulana family and seems to be very religious but I realized family background and look doesn’t necessarily reflect a person’s character.  \n\nI feel disgusted and betrayed by these actions from two of the most important men in my life. These situations have left me questioning my faith in marriage, trust, and relationships. I’ve prayed and asked for clarity, which has helped me understand the reality of these situations, but I cannot forget the things I’ve seen.  \n\nI’m haunted by these events and feel like it’s better to be alone than to suffer due to others’ actions that are beyond my control. I’ve lost faith in men and the idea of a happy marriage.  \n\nHow do I regain trust and find peace within myself? Should I call off my wedding and if I'm doing it, do I need to have more reasons? Are there any du’as or practical steps to help me navigate these struggles? Please be kind with your answers, I'm facing a really difficult situation right now. \n\nJazakAllah Khair for your advice and support.",

      "text": "I'm having trouble with taking my shahaadah. I just finished this short book called, 'The Conditions of the Testimony of Faith'. It makes good points and I don't really have an issue with most of them, except one - following the prophet PBUH. I can't for the life of me understand why I have to be exactly like him, in order that God accepts my sincerity. If i eat with my left hand, knowing that he didn't, that's something that can basically take me out of the religion. I understand Mohammad has some really amazing characteristics, and of course, we should strive to become like him. But I'm a westerner, music is all around me, dogs are all around me - in order to join this religion, i have to become so different, and make sure to not touch a dog, or be near music. \n\nI sincerely believe in the quran, god, and mohammed as the final messenger - why can't that be enough??? There's so many other conditions that I just don't understand. Like doubt - By my nature or upbringing, I'm a very 'agnostic' person. For example, the Quran, I believe is from God, and the sunnah - well, I feel like it's mostly accurate. None of us were there to witnesses these things, and so I believe, or lean towards belief, but I can never say \"i know for sure\" - that's why this is called Faith and not knowledge. But the second condition being Al-Yaqeen (certainty) seems to exclude me from being a full-member, in the eyes of God.  \n\nsorry for the rant style structure of this post and tysm if you read this far!!! I really appreciate any advice.",

      "title": "The Importance of Sound Intellect in Understanding Faith",
      "text": "One of the greatest blessings Allah has granted humankind is intellect. Through reason, we can recognize truth, differentiate between right and wrong, and understand our purpose in life. However, intellect alone is not enough to guide us to ultimate success unless it is enlightened by divine revelation.\n\nThroughout history, many philosophers and thinkers have tried to define human purpose based purely on logic, yet they often arrived at flawed conclusions. This is because human intellect, despite its brilliance, has limitations. Allah, in His infinite wisdom, has sent divine guidance to complete and correct our understanding. The Quran states:\n\n\"And We have certainly honored the children of Adam and carried them on the land and sea and provided for them of the good things and preferred them over much of what We have created, with [definite] preference.\" (Surah Al-Isra: 70)\n\nThe Misconceptions About God and Prophets\n\nA sound understanding of Allah’s existence and attributes is fundamental to faith. However, when intellect is not guided by revelation, it can lead to distorted beliefs. Many religious texts outside of Islam contain descriptions of God that contradict His perfection, portraying Him as one who tires, regrets, or lacks knowledge. In contrast, the Quran affirms the absolute greatness and uniqueness of Allah:\n\n\"There is nothing like unto Him, and He is the Hearing, the Seeing.\" (Surah Ash-Shura: 11)\n\nSimilarly, prophets in some religious traditions are depicted with flaws that contradict their role as righteous guides. Islam, however, upholds their noble status, portraying them as the best of humanity, chosen by Allah to lead people to truth.\n\nThe Role of Intellect in Faith\n\nIslam encourages using reason and reflection. The Quran repeatedly calls people to think, ponder, and seek knowledge. However, true understanding comes when intellect is used in harmony with faith. Those who reject divine guidance, despite their intelligence, risk becoming misguided. Allah warns about this in the Quran:\n\n\"They have hearts with which they do not understand, they have eyes with which they do not see, and they have ears with which they do not hear. They are like cattle; rather, they are even more astray. It is they who are the heedless.\" (Surah Al-A’raf: 179)\n\nThus, true wisdom is not merely in intelligence, but in recognizing our dependence on Allah’s guidance. Without it, even the most brilliant minds can fall into confusion.\n\nConclusion\n\nIslam balances reason and revelation, ensuring that intellect is used as a tool to reach the truth, not as an independent source of guidance. When human reasoning aligns with divine knowledge, it leads to a complete and fulfilling understanding of life. True success lies in using our minds to recognize Allah’s signs, follow His guidance, and seek His pleasure.\n\nMay Allah grant us the wisdom to use our intellect in a way that strengthens our faith and brings us closer to Him.\n\nReferences:\n\n1.

      "text": "This is a profound inquiry that is of great significance. With awareness to my limitations and with humility, humbleness I would like to present my perspective.\nThe arab world was at the golden age during the 8th century to the 14th century. During the golden age, the Arab world held its most profound contribution to mankind in various fields such as science, medicine, philosophy, literature to just name a few. I believe they transcended to unparalleled grounds because the interweaving of these core values. Intellectual curiosity, logical reasoning, openness, tolerance. It was through the broad tapestry of global knowledge coupled with a passion to aim at excellence the Arab world reached unprecedented levels.\n\nSomewhere during the 15th century tolerance got misconstrued into being un Islamic and thus initiating a pivotal change into Islamic thought and asserting a more conservative approach.\nWhich leads me to my primary inquiry which is as follows; if the virtues that paved the way for this immense success in the Islamic world is stifled then how can the Islamic world ever retain its past glory?\nI think the primary battle for modern Islam today is the interplay between faith - reason, materialism - spirituality, authority - autonomy.\nA big issue is the uncertainty Muslims have with the interplay with secular knowledge to divine religion. It is my belief one has to examine what scholars of that era positioned themselves in the matter, they not only believed secular knowledge to be beneficial but necessary as the two don’t contradict each others. Ibn Rushd posits in The Decisive Treatise: “truth does not contradict truth”.\nIndeed I believe the ultimate truth is in the Quran and that it is free from any contradictions so therefore general openness should be encouraged.\nQuran 4:82: \n\n“Do they not then consider the Qur’an carefully? Had it been from other than Allah, they would surely have found therein much contradiction.",

It’s discipline that often keeps us going, even on days when faith feels distant.\n\n\nIf discipline is crucial in Islam, why isn’t there more guidance on achieving great self-discipline in life to overcoming physical and mental resistance? Islam imo would be much easier to practice if we are thought self-discipline. While the Qur'an emphasizes resisting temptation, it doesn’t specifically outline Surahs or Ayah or any methods to build discipline. The teachings encourage standing firm in faith, but they don’t directly address strategies for building personal discipline.",

      "text": "Hello, I grew up catholic so I do not have a great grasp on Islam yet as a whole but it has been wonderful learning about everything to do with Islam, so I am sorry to sound ignorant. I grew up in a majority Hispanic area and went to Catholic Sunday school my whole life. I was tasked with writing a comparative essay and while I've been researching Muslim Sunday Schools in my area, I cannot find many first-hand experiences online. I think it would help just to know if it was more of a requirement as it is like in Catholic traditions or if Muslim Sunday School was something the children actively wanted to do and participate in.  Also if it has helped you form a connection to God, or just any experiences in general? I have one Muslim friend but from my understanding, it is not pushed so hard to go to Sunday schools in our area. In a very basic way of questioning, did you enjoy/learn anything from Sunday school?  Thank you for any engagement.",

Growing up my mother wasn’t religious, she had boyfriends and such and I honestly never saw her praying during my childhood. She just taught me how to pray and the basics, no pork, no alcohol, no tattoos, fast during ramadan whatever.  I know nothing about what the prophet was like I know nothing about what’s written in the Quran, I know more about Christianity than Islam and it’s a bit embarrassing to admit. Can I say im questioning my faith in a religion i know nearly nothing about? It all started when I realised how old the world actually is, if the world is billions of years old why is religion so recent? I read that God didn’t send any prophets a million years ago because humans were stupid, uncivilised, couldn’t speak, couldn’t read etc but Muhammad (PBUH) couldn’t read either so surely if God wanted to he would? Doesn’t that just completely contradict the idea of God being omnipotent why would he just have a fun little experiment with cavemen? Why didn’t God want to introduce religion back then and does the Quran even say how old the Earth is? Also with what’s going on in Gaza and Sudan why would God let such horrific things happen to people who probably pray everyday and have strong faith. I’m like so confused about everything idk what to think or what to believe I think i’m leaning towards agnosticism and it feels so weird to say that. Where do I even start on learning about Islam .",

I have no idea whether either my cousin or her husband are practicing, or how strictly religious his family is, though I do know only his mom wears hijab and the other adult sisters do not. The shower is not religious either way in nature, but since the two sides of the family have not met before, I really want to make things comfortable for everyone. As such, we're erring on the side of all food being halal and no alcohol (which we wouldn't have had anyways). I didn't realize until too late that the Asr prayer will be right in the middle of the shower, so we will work to have a place for people to pray, but is there anything else I should consider? My cousin requested both men and women be invited, so separating by gender isn't on the table. Would it be ok to ask his mom for baby pictures to display? Are there any typical baby shower games we should avoid? Thank you all in advance!",

      "title": "Struggling with Intense Anger: Seeking Advice on Faith, Techniques, and ways to Find Peace\n",
      "text": "I’m reaching out because I have severe anger issues and need help to overcome them. I’ve tried everything I can think of, but I continue to struggle with intense outbursts. I pray five times a day, constantly ask Allah for guidance, and have tried numerous techniques I’ve learned through reading and research. Despite all this, there are moments where I feel consumed by rage, wanting to harm others.\n\nTo clarify, my thoughts are not directed toward innocent people or children - I have 2 nephews and nieces - the most precious things in the world—usually, it’s towards adult males in situations that trigger me like at the grocery store or drive thru, etc.\n\nI’ve reflected deeply on where these tendencies come from. As a child, I witnessed my father’s abuse towards my mother. He would beat her. My father has been absent from my life since I was 13, and while my mother tried her best, she would beat me with a pipe, spatula, etc. Despite this, I’ve forgiven both my parents and come to terms with my past. Yet, I have this rage that I cannot control that is so intense it overwhelms me.\n\nSometimes I can watch these thoughts come and go, but other times, they take over. I find myself thinking of scenarios where I could inflict or harm, people I care about when they do something wrong. Then I go pray and cry to allah and ask him to show me guidance and for him to help me control my emotion.\n\nMy mom has suggested I see a specialist and consider medication. I’m hesitant about medication because I don’t want to feel dulled or emotionally disconnected, but I’m open to exploring options if there’s something that can truly help without taking away my ability to feel. Is there a medication that can help with this kind of anger but still allow me to function emotionally and spiritually?\n\nHere’s what I’ve tried so far:\n\n* I attended MMA classes, which helped to some extent by giving me an outlet, but I stopped after injuring my thumb. Also, when I took the mma classes, I would sometimes want to get into altercations.\n* I’ve tried mindfulness during prayer, catching my thoughts when they stray. For example, I’ve caught myself getting annoyed about things like an imam’s voice during prayer, and I redirect myself, knowing Allah is watching.\n\nThe frequency of these outbursts is every 5 to 9 days. They’re impacting my relationships, and would impact my future marriage, and how others perceive me. People avoid me because of my anger, and I fear this could escalate if I don’t resolve it. I am 33 years old. I know I am old and have been battling this for ages. Just for clarity, I do have a loving and emotional side. I am gentle and go out of my way for people but sometimes when it is not returned the anger kicks in.\n\nI’m an avid reader and have explored numerous books to help manage my tendencies. I’ve noticed that when I read books on Islam, our beloved Prophet, or Islamic perspectives on death—like when the angel of death takes the soul—or works by Imam Al-Ghazali, Eckhart Tolle, or Krishnamurti on managing thoughts, I feel much calmer and more aware of my tendencies. These readings keep me grounded and provide a sense of clarity and control.\n\nI need tangible steps to take. Have any of you faced similar struggles and found ways to overcome them? Is there real medication you recommend that can be life altering?\n\nMost importantly, is there a way to manage this through faith, techniques, or medication that doesn’t dull me emotionally? I’m desperate to resolve this and be the person Allah intends me to be. I’m so grateful for His wisdom and guidance and know I have much to be thankful for—I just need help navigating this.",

      "text": "*\"Allah does not look at how many times you fall; He looks at how many times you get back up and turn to Him.\"*  \n\n\nAsalamu alaykum wa rahmatullahi wa barakatuh,  \nBismillah.  \n\n\nToday, I want to speak directly to those of you who feel like giving up. To the ones who struggle every single day with their nafs, their desires, and their habits, yet feel like they’re not making progress. You feel like you’re failing Allah, failing yourself, and maybe even wonder if Allah has abandoned you. But let me tell you this: **your struggle is not a sign of weakness—it’s a sign of faith.**  \n\n\n\n# 1. **Allah Sees Every Effort** \n\n\nAllah tells us in the Qur'an:  \n\n\n*\"And that there is not for man except that [good] for which he strives.\"* (Surah An-Najm 53:39)  \n\n\nYour effort matters to Allah, even if it doesn’t lead to immediate results. Struggling with sins, relapsing, and then getting back up to seek forgiveness is part of what makes you a servant of Allah. It’s not about being perfect. It’s about striving sincerely.  \n\n\nThe Prophet Muhammad (ﷺ) said:  \n*\"All the children of Adam are sinners, and the best of sinners are those who repent.\"* (Tirmidhi)  \n\n\nThis hadith shows that falling into sin doesn’t mean you’re doomed. What matters is what you do after. Will you turn to Allah or will you give up?  \n\n\n# 2. **Allah’s Mercy is Infinite**  \n\n\nAllah says:  \n\n\n*\"Say, 'O My servants who have transgressed against themselves [by sinning], do not despair of the mercy of Allah. Indeed, Allah forgives all sins. Indeed, it is He who is the Forgiving, the Merciful.'\"* (Surah Az-Zumar 39:53)  \n\n\nThis ayah was revealed to comfort those who felt their sins were too heavy. Allah is calling out to you, telling you not to despair. He knows your struggles, your pain, and your sincerity. His mercy is far greater than your sins, no matter how many times you’ve fallen.  \n\n\n# 3. **The Struggle is Evidence of Faith**  \n\n\nThe very fact that you feel guilt and keep trying to change shows that your heart is alive with iman. Allah praises those who strive in His path, even when it’s difficult:  \n\n\n*\"As for those who strive for Us – We will surely guide them to Our ways. And indeed, Allah is with the doers of good.\"* (Surah Al-Ankabut 29:69)  \n\n\nEvery step you take to overcome your bad habits, every dua you make, and every time you turn to Allah after failing, you are being guided closer to Him.  \n\n\n# 4. **Practical Steps to Keep Moving Forward**  \n\n\n- 1. **Renew Your Intention Daily**  \nBegin every day by reminding yourself that your ultimate goal is to please Allah. Say, *\"Ya Allah, I am weak, but I turn to You for strength. Guide me to what pleases You.\"*  \n\n\n\n\n- 2. **Seek Forgiveness Constantly**  \n\n\nMake istighfar a regular part of your life. The Prophet (ﷺ) himself said:  \n\n\n*\"By Allah, I seek Allah's forgiveness and repent to Him more than seventy times a day.\"* (Bukhari)  \n\n\n\n- 3. **Establish Salah as Your Anchor**  \n\n\nNo matter how many times you fall, hold on to your salah. Allah says:  \n\n\n*\"Indeed, prayer prohibits immorality and wrongdoing.\"* (Surah Al-Ankabut 29:45)  \nSalah is your lifeline to Allah, even when you feel unworthy.  \n\n\n- 4. **Surround Yourself with Support**  \nKeep good company who remind you of Allah and motivate you to stay on the path.  \n\n\n\n\n\n- 5. **Take Small, Consistent Steps**  \nThe Prophet (ﷺ) said:  \n\n\n*\"The most beloved deeds to Allah are those that are consistent, even if they are small.\"* (Bukhari, Muslim)  \n\n\n\nDon’t overwhelm yourself with drastic changes. Focus on small victories each day.  \n\n\n\n# 5. **The Reward for Perseverance**  \n\n\nFinally, remember that Allah never allows your efforts to go to waste. He says:  \n\n\n*\"Indeed, Allah does not allow to be lost the reward of those who do good.\"* (Surah At-Tawbah 9:120)  \n\nEvery struggle, every tear, and every moment you resist temptation is being recorded with Allah. He sees it all, and He will reward you in ways you cannot imagine.  \n\n\n# Conclusion  \n\n\nTo my dear brothers and sisters, don’t let your failures define you. Let your efforts and persistence speak for your iman. Allah sees you, He hears you, and He loves the one who keeps returning to Him.  \n\n\nJazakum Allahu khair for reading. May Allah strengthen you, forgive you, and guide you to success in this life and the next. Asalamu alaykum wa rahmatullahi wa barakatuh.",

      "text": "Salam everyone, I was just researching comparative religions specifically Judaism, Christianity and Islam and I was quite astonished as to the similarities but also differences across the 3 religion in terms of doctrine but especially laws concerning diet, cleanliness as well as marriage. For example, we know that Jews eat kosher meat and us Muslims eat halal meat. In regards to cleanliness, Jews are forbidden to shave their body hair including pubic hair and armpits according to the Talmud which states ‘a man shall not put on a woman’s garment’ in other words shaving body hair is considered feminine behaviour whereas in Islam it is obligated for us to do so within 40 days which is supported by the Hadith of Fitrah (Natural Disposition). Furthermore circumcision is compulsory in Judaism but is not required in Christianity or even Islam where it is a sunnah act. Moreover, Judaism allows a man to marry his niece but does not allow a woman to marry her nephew according to the Torah. In Islam this is totally forbidden to marry such close relatives. Furthermore some of you may not know but Prophet Abraham/Ibrahim on whom be peace married his half-sister Sarah as they had the same father but different mother. In addition, Prophet Jacob/Yaqub on whom be peace unknowingly married two sisters at one time considering he was a Prophet so surely Allah would have informed him whereas in Islam this is forbidden except that you can only marry one sister at a time after the death or divorce of one. Overall, these findings are mind-boggling and have led to confusion which have led to questions as to:\n\nI acknowledge that past scriptures were corrupted but why are there so many differences in the laws of the Abrahamic faiths when in fact the God of Abraham and of Moses and of Muhammad on whom be peace is the same one God that were all (124,000) sent by Him. Surely the laws should be the same?\n\nIf all humans have a fitrah why were the earlier ummahs prevented from carrying them out in terms of shaving body hair? Isn’t this contradictory and inconsistent with the Prophet Muhammad’s peace be upon him’s words (Hadith).\n\nI understand that Allah had allowed Prophet Adam’s on whom be peace’s children to marry each other in terms of one twin set marrying the other twin set in order to procreate but couldn’t Prophet Ibrahim find another woman to marry other than his half-sister which would be deemed haram due to this incestuous relationship? Surely there were other women at that time that he could have been betrothed to. \n\nI would love you to put my mind and heart at rest and see the discussion surrounding this topic and your thoughts and opinions! \n\nJazakAllah!",

      "text": "Salam everyone, I’ve been struggling to strengthen my faith for quite a while now and I seriously want to change myself. \n\nA bit of background: born and raised in a Muslim country in the Middle East. Grew up in a religious and healthy house. \n\nHowever, as a young adult, I’ve lost track of my faith in Islam. Every now and then, I gamble and play poker with my friends (not for huge amounts). I occasionally have a drink or 2. Unfortunately, I’ve heavily indulged in zina multiple times. \n\nThat being said, I pray 5 times a day although at home and not at the masjid despite it being next to my house. 3 nights of the week I’ll even pray tahajud and beg allah to save me. If I’m being really honest, the only reason I pray is out of fear. I don’t have faith while praying. At the same time, I tell myself that the life I’m living is completely haram and dangerous. I’ll seriously repent but after a week I go back to it. \n\nI wanted to clarify a few things. If I pray all my prayers out of fear, do they still count? By now I’ve repented maybe 500 times(I think sincerely) but keep falling back into it, what can I do to make a serious change in my life? \n\nThanks in advance.",

      "text": "About two years ago, I went for Umrah with my family. The trip lasted 10 days — 5 days in Makkah and 5 in Madinah. Even though we performed all the obligatory rituals — like Tawaf and Sa’i — I was just going through the motions. I didn’t truly feel the spiritual connection I had hoped for. We used to go to the Haram at Zuhr and return after Esha, and during our stay, we performed three Umrahs.\n\nBut deep down, I felt emotionally numb the whole time. One of the biggest reasons was my father. He was constantly angry and trying to control everything, which made me extremely anxious and scared throughout the entire trip. And honestly, it’s not just about the trip — for the past 4–5 years, I’ve lived with the same fear, always staying quiet in front of him.\n\nI have Also visited in 2014 for Hajj But that time I was a Kid. And that days was the golden days of my Life. \n\nNow, after all this time, I’ve started feeling a deep urge to go again.\nBut a part of me is afraid — What if I go back and still don’t feel that spirituality again?",

It really doesnt help that its not in my language too. Its just arabic that has been drilled into me from day one. I remember the translation of some of it, like I thought going over the translations of what im syaing would help me understand more, but it still really doesnt feel spiritual. I feel more connected to allah just sitting in silence and meditating, thinking abt my blessings, than actual salah, so what am i doing wrong. Also can we talk about how having periods ruins the rhythym and hard established dispikine so bad, like its so incredibly hard to get back into the routine, please i need help, i really want good effective advice and how you guys tackle this.",

      "text": "Assalamualaykum Warahmatulahi Wabarakatu brothers and sisters,\n\nI have been reflecting a lot, these past few months have honestly been really hard. I get that it is normal to have fluctuations when it comes to your iman, and some days, salah can be the heaviest and others can be empty, while some sins are easy to do and treat it as a “bad habit” and with some sins weighing heavy and so you choose to avoid it. Anywho, I realized that even despite praying all five prayers, making morning and evening adhkar, making dua, going to halaqas, reading Quran, and vise versa, I treat all of this as a chore, rather than an opportunity to enjoy, love, and cherish that moment of having time with Allah SWT. I feel guilty now because realizing that deep down I treat each opportunity as a chore disguised as worship, I fear that it won’t weigh heavy in the scales on the Day of Qiyamat. I am so scared, but deeply, I am so sad because all of these efforts are in vain when I should be enjoying getting to talk and cherish that moment to talk to Allah.\n\nI truly love Allah, I want to do better, I want to try and cut as many major/ minor sins and improve for the sake of Him, but the issue is I don’t have that emotional or spiritual connection. I guess that’s why I am constantly over thinking, sad, relapsing on some minor sins, and finding it difficult to make dua or pray tahajjud. \n\nMy main goal is to truly feel that spiritual connection and deep love for Allah to the point that each prayer, each adhkar, each istighfar, each dua, feel heavy and deep. I want to be able to place trust with ease so that I don’t get overwhelmed by this dunya.\n\nThere is always this saying when our iman is the weakest, it’s because we are not putting our trust in Allah, our duas are empty, our prayers are empty, no kushu or nothing, but anywho, May Allah make it easy for us in our ongoing paths to getting closer to Allah and elevating our ranks. \n\nMy main question, how can I attain spiritual and emotional connection to Allah SWT and how can I get to know Him.",

However, the country I am from (in the Caucasus) is a non-practicing one, meaning that there are very little amount of covered-up women, or even overall people performing Salah (at least not my family, with some exceptions). Yes we believe, we pray a few times a day when we feel like it, we fast (also not everyone), but we are not strict with the religion itself...I hope I can explain it correctly.\n\nLong story short, I want to be more strict. For once, I have never fasted before and want to try first time this year. My significant other is an Algerian Muslim, and even though he never asked for it from me, I still want to try to be better for him. I live in Europe now and understand it seems weird I want to start now..but it is just for myself. I am not considering to cover-up, and I am modest in my dressing, but I would like to start from fasting and praying more often. I don't even own a praying mat. We used to pray before bed, just talking to God. Ugh...Do you think it will be hard? What should I start from? Anything will be helpful.",

I formed my own ethics and I don't know how this really affected my life as a christian before. But of course I have the respect and devotion to follow this rule.\n\n**Smoking Cannabis/Cigarettes**\n\nOk, I understand cigarettes, are very harmful and I'm about to slightly quit as I'm getting closer to Allah\n\nBut Cannabis, I'd really like to consume out of the prayer schedule in a respectful quantity. (I've read that it's good to be awake during prayers)\n\n**Alcohol**  \nYes, this is very easy for me to overcome, same as cigarettes.\n\nBut the thing is, acoustic guitar and cannabis I really can't give up on them, i can do it in a respectful way and match Allah's Teachings, but I don't think they are a very big sin, especially for someone that converted just to seek salvation and guidance, he is open minded and can discipline himself for these disctractions to harm the body and mind too much.\n\nAs life is, everything can be haram, but the level of it I guess depends on the intentions, responsibility and situation.\n\nI really want to know more about these, let me know if I'm wrong and what to avoid.",

We have been committing Zina together throughout our relationship. I came from a secular background and he was fairly liberal so neither of us saw this as a major sin. \n\nSince taking my Shahada, I have felt extremely guilty when we commit Zina and yesterday I had a vision of hellfire during it and I had a panic attack. \n\nWe’ve discussed breaking up because he doesn’t want to convert to Islam and I know the Quran says Muslim women must marry Muslim men.\n\nBut it’s very hard because I love him a lot. Sometimes I think I want to marry this man. He loves me so much and we have such a special bond. This feels like a huge test and i feel conflicted and sad. Ultimately i feel like i can’t let anything in this world get in the way of my relationship with Allah. It’s just hard when i have so much love for my partner. I pray that if we separate and he moves out then perhaps Allah will guide him towards Islam and then back to me as my husband. \n\nHas anyone experienced this or has advice?\n\nThank you ❤️\n\nUpdate: we broke up. It’s been really hard, but I think it’s the right decision.",

However, my guilt of the things that I have had to do to survive makes me think that I am just seeking forgiveness. In order not to do the things for survival, I look to ask for money. I have months of past due rents and I need a lifeline.  I cry daily, I find a smile where I can, i try to ignore my problems, but I dont think i was meant to live this life, I know we have choices and our lives reflect our decisions but when are we ever offered a chance?\n\nIs it wrong to ask for money in addition to forgiveness when I am literally a day into the religion? How does Allah feel about creating your own departure? (without saying the other words)",

      "text": "So my brother-in-law just came back from Umrah with my sister and niece, it's my sisters 5th Umrah but something really strange (and a little scary) happened this time that I wanted to share as a heads-up to anyone planning to go.\n\nOne night before Fajr, he went to pray Tahajjud and decided to perform a Tawaf of the Kaaba. He was wearing an Ihram belt, very securely fastened around his waist, with his iPhone and bank cards tucked inside. Everything was normal… until he suddenly realised that in a moment the belt was gone.\n\nHe retraced his steps, searched everywhere, visited lost and found but nothing. My sister kept saying maybe it just came loose, maybe it dropped. But he swears it felt cut off since the belt was attatched on. Like someone deliberately took it. Still, they had no proof and no way to know for sure.\n\nFast forward a few days, they’re back in the UK. He puts his UK SIM back in, opens “Find My iPhone”… and sees a whole breadcrumb trail of activity. The phone had been taken from Makkah, moved around to different areas, and then ended up in Madinah. After that, it was switched off. Gone. The last update was 3 days ago.\n\nWhat’s worse: He checked the bank and found out that over £250 GBP (~$325 USD) had been spent using his card — including at Skechers and BinDawood. This happened after it was stolen.\n\nIt’s heartbreaking, because you never expect this kind of thing to happen in the holiest place on earth. But sadly, people do take advantage especially during crowded times like Tahajjud when people are focused on ‘ibadah and not watching their belongings.\n\nJust wanted to put this out there for others: be super careful with your valuables, even during the most spiritual moments. Use anti-theft belts, RFID-blocking pouches, and be mindful of your surroundings even in the Haram. May Allah protect all of us and accept everyone’s worship 🤲🏼.",

      "text": "I am a 29Y Brazilian woman, and I was raised Christian by my parents. Over the years, I’ve attended many different churches and denominations trying to find a deeper spiritual connection — something that would make me feel embraced by faith. But, honestly, I never felt God’s presence. I never had that feeling of being truly connected or held by something greater.\n\nEven though I tried to live a good life and follow Christian teachings, deep down I felt disconnected. Eventually, I stopped following any specific religion and just tried to live by doing good, being kind, and trying to be a good person. But I can’t deny that something still feels missing — like my life lacks a deeper meaning or purpose. It’s as if I’ve been searching for something to fill a quiet emptiness in my heart.\n\nRecently, I traveled to Istanbul and visited the Blue Mosque. There, I spoke with a volunteer who was kind, respectful, and thoughtful. That conversation made so much sense to me — more than many things I had heard throughout my life. And for the first time, I felt peace. Real peace. Just standing there in silence, something inside me shifted. It felt like I had found something I didn’t even know I was missing.\n\nSince then, I’ve been reading more about Islam and reflecting deeply. I’m not rushing into anything, but I’ve never felt this kind of resonance before. Maybe this is the piece I’ve been searching for.\n\nI’d love to connect with people who’ve been through similar experiences — especially other Westerners or those who came from a Christian background. I have so many questions and would really appreciate hearing your stories and perspectives.\n\nThank you for reading.",

      "text": "Ramadan came, and like every year, it transformed you. You fasted despite the hunger. You stood in long Taraweeh prayers even when your legs ached. You made heartfelt duas with tears streaming down your face, begging Allah ﷻ for forgiveness, for guidance, for a better you.\n\nAnd now? Now Ramadan has left 🥺 And you feel it💔 That emptiness creeping in. That fear of losing what you built. That hesitation: Will I be the same person as I was before Ramadan? Will I slip back into my old habits? 😢\n\nThe struggle is real. But here’s something even more real. Ramadan wasn’t the destination. It was just the training ground. To train you and polish you to make you better version of yourself.\n\nDuring Ramadan, Shaytan was locked up. Your distractions were minimized. You had a schedule, a rhythm, a purpose. But now the chains are broken, and the whispers will return.\n\nThe true test isn’t what you did during Ramadan, it’s what you do after it.\n\nAsk yourself: Did I only worship Allah ﷻ to the best of my ability because it was Ramadan, or do I truly want to stay close to Him and seek His pleasure ?\n\nThis is where many fail. They ride the spiritual high for a few days and then, slowly, they slip. First, Fajr becomes late. Then, sins they had abandoned creep back in. Then, that one haram relationship, astagfirullah. \n\nBut not you. Not this time.\n\nBecause you’re about to take control.\n\nYou won’t be able to keep up the exact level of worship that you did in Ramadan. But you can keep the consistency. You can maintain the essence.\n\nHow?\n\n1. Don’t Leave the Qur’an: Even if it’s just a page a day, keep reciting it. The same Qur’an that softened your heart in Ramadan will sustain you after it.\n\n2. Protect Your Salah: The one who protects their five daily prayers has already won half the battle. Guard it like your greatest treasure. This is only thing that makes us muslims. \n\n3. Surround Yourself with the Right People: Your environment shapes you. Stay connected to those who remind you of Allah.\n\n4. Remember the Feeling of Ramadan: That peace, that closeness to Allah that you felt, chase it. Don’t let it be a seasonal experience.\n\nYour biggest enemy is Shaytan and also your own nafs (inner desires). Ramadan helped you discipline it, but now it will try to regain control.\n\nYour nafs will whisper: Relax, take a break, you did enough during Ramadan.\n\nAnd if you listen to it, you will fall.\n\nBut if you fight it, if you push back, even when it’s hard, you will come out victorious.\n\nRemember, the same Allah you worshipped in Ramadan is the same Allah today, tomorrow, and forever. Will you continue to seek Him?\n\nSo, make the decision today. Keep the fire of Ramadan alive. Hold onto your progress. Fight against the decline.\n\nBecause true success isn’t just in worshipping Allah ﷻ in Ramadan.\n\nIt’s in carrying Ramadan with you, every single day of your life.\n\nTry to Live everyday just like you lived in Ramadan. \n\nIt's hard, i know, but the real jihad is with ourself, not with people. Until then, remember your brother mysteriouslsopod in your Duas as I very much need it. My Duas for you and everyone 🤲",

After I took shahada I prayed Maghrib with the Aman and it was almost as if I felt Allah’s happiness shine through me as I prayed. I didn’t know how to pray, I followed the Aman and I listened carefully as the prayer was said and my intentions and love to Allah was in my heart and mind as I done my first ever Maghrib prayer. This is a learning process for me, a spiritual journey to becoming closer with Allah. My life style 7 years ago was totally different. Drinking, partying, drugs all the fun stuff then. But now I look back and see how lost I was and how lost society is now with all this stuff one puts in their body. \n\nInshallah, this journey I am on now will become one of a healthy and peaceful life and to one of happiness too.

I have many questions and discussions I would like to have regarding Islam and if anyone else can share their revert stories it would be great to know.",

      "text": "Hi,\n\nI’m a martial arts teacher living in B.C Canada. I have no religious background but I am %100 for religion on the basis that it’s the greatest contributor to spiritual health. \n\nHere in Canada, I teach an extremely diverse group of children from all ages and all backgrounds.\n\nJust last week, we had a young girl join our kids class. Before she went up to the training mats, her mother pulled me off to the side and explained she was not allowed to bow at all during class. Specifically, she said, “we do not bow to anyone but God.” \n\nNow, we have had many Muslim students before. Some were not allowed to touch people of the opposite gender during training, all of them were not allowed to train during Ramadan, and we’ve been absolutely happy to accommodate these religious practices. But this is the first time we’ve ever had a student who follows this rule.\n\nBowing in martial arts is as ubiquitous as a ball in soccer. Each hour long class we bow upwards of 10 times. Any activities we start/end, beginning and ending classes, even just before we play games we always bow. It is a core tenet of our philosophy, the primary way students show respect to their instructors and vice-versa.\n\nI’m very curious to know what the exact rule is that this student follows, as again they are the only Muslim student we’ve ever had that does this. \n\nIs it something to do about submission? \n\nWould our bowing for the purposes of respect  fall under that rule? \n\nWhy do other Muslim students not follow this rule?\n\nIs there any suggestions as to how I could explain why bowing is so important to us?\n\nAlso to be clear, we are allowing this student not to bow, and I’m not looking for a “loophole” to make her bow. I am just genuinely very curious and don’t know who to ask (too shy to talk to the mother and don’t want to be overbearing to the new student).",

      "title": "Struggling in a cult like sect",
      "text": "I'm not going to say the sect name but with some of the descriptions I give you can probably figure it out if you know anything about sects.\n\nI was born into a cult like sect of shia. We follow a religious leader who we believe is a direct representative of the hidden Imam. \n\nThe main problems about this is how we treat history and people. We basically are taught to curse anybody that isn't perfect to our direct line. I was taught to curse the companions and the prophets wife before anybody told me what they did wrong. They teach us to give sujood to only Allah and our leader. This can't be right. How can we give sujood to someone other than Allah. I understand that some Shias might not commit shirk and view Islam from a different perspective but this is genuinely shirk. \n\nI see the \"Sunni\" perspective of Islam from social media and friends and honestly it feels more Spiritual. Everything about it is about furthering and developing your connection with God and Listening to the hadiths of the prophet. Wer taught from a young age that you follow the prophet, Ali, his sons and whatever line we ended up going with. \n\nAfter farz / Salah we have a dua (congregation al which I heard somewhere was Haram) that directly says the name of every Imam in the Pune we follow starting from the prophet. How can we say imams names right after praying to Allah. What in the earth could that do for me. I've just finished praying to my creator and now I've got to recite a bunch of names. The second dua after that is literally the names of the spiritual leaders. Like it's literally a dua about keeping his safety and longevity and declaring him as our leader. Like bro this is obvious Haram. I as a teenager can already figure this out. \n\nYou must be asking yourself why so many people still follow this and the answer is it's a toxic religion. We have to pay Zakat to the masjid so the masjid gets the most of it and 7% goes to the masjid \"Imam\" while another cut goes to this leader of ours. And then like once in moharrum and once in Ramadan there's a dinner where \"his estate pays for it\". Like why can't I go give my Zakat to people in actual need like the food bank. Why does my Imam need a cut from it and why does a significant portion go to a spiritual leader. He's not even a direct descendant of the prophet and even if he was I still feel like it's wrong to give them money. I mean if you lived in the prophets time would he tell you to give him money or actual people in need?\n\nThe whole idea of growing up in the religion is toxic. From a young age you have to attend their school once a week and it's super toxic. Memorizing both Qur'an and these shirk duas are necessary. They're technique is to make all the kids say their duas and Surats that they're have supposed to have memorized in front of each other so you get embarrassed when you haven't memorized it. Learning the Qur'an should be a Spiritual and personal practice. Not something where they line you up, embarass you from aa young age and give you a week to memorize like 100 ayats perfectly. It's to the point where at age 10 if you're bhavent memorized all the big duas and at least 5-10 jus of the Qur'an your a lazy kid. The sect does produce a large number of Hafiz though but what difference does it make of you end up teaching them to pray to different people instead of Allah.\n\nOn top of this we don't even pray on a stone. Like every other shia prays on one and Sunnis don't but we're Shias who don't pray on one? It's like we follow whatever makes it easier to obey the rich guy who's \"leading us\". He literally travels to different masjids around the world waving at the members as they put their hands and bow down to him. \n\nRealistically I'm just confused because after experiencing a lot of Sunni Islam I feel like my connection with Allah is a lot greater. But I also feel shia because I never understood the whole Sunni view on ghadir e khoom. \n\nFortunately for me unlike many other living in India and Pakistan I live in North America with a family who probably wouldn't care too much of I left. But I wanted to make this post for anybody with Information to clear this stuff up and also to pray for everyone who is stuck in this cult. Nothing about it screams Islam. In moharrum the kids must recite the death story of the ahlul bayt in either Arabic or our language. They do it right before Maghreb and sometimes they have to push the prayer back because they have to do matam and marasiya (songs or whatever you call them that talk about the story of Karbala). Luckily the matam is soft tapping on the Chest and not any of the blade smacking I've seen online.\n\nBut yeah anybody with Insight please help because I'm still very into Islam and I want nothing but to develop my relationship with Allah the right way",

      "title": "Is reading fantasy books with magic a major sin in Islam?",
      "text": "As-salamu alaykum\n\nI have been reflecting on the Islamic ruling regarding reading fantasy novels that contain elements of magic. For example, books like, Storm light Archive The Bound and the Broken or The Empire Trilogy include fictional magic systems such as elemental powers or magical creatures, similar to what you might find in stories like The Lord of the Rings.\n\nI came across statements from scholars like Sheikh Assim al-Hakeem who strongly say that even reading or watching fictional magic, like Harry Potter, is haram and possibly a major sin. He argues that sihr, or magic, is one of the seven destructive sins in Islam, and that engaging with any kind of magical content, even if fictional, is harmful and impermissible.\n\nOn the other hand, I have seen a YT video called 'Is Fiction really haram?', a more contextual view in some of their nuanced responses,. They tend to make a distinction between real magic, which is certainly a major sin, and fictional storytelling. According to this view, fictional magic is not actual sihr, and reading such books is not haram by default unless they contain clear shirk, distort Islamic beliefs, or spiritually harm the reader. For them, it seems more about the context, the intention, and whether it affects a person’s beliefs or values.\n\nThis has left me confused and uncertain.\n\nIs reading a fantasy novel with magic actually a major sin in Islam? Can scholars classify something as a major sin if it is not explicitly mentioned in the Quran or hadith? What is the correct or safest approach for a Muslim who wants to avoid anything displeasing to Allah but also enjoys storytelling and reading?\n\nI would really appreciate any thoughtful responses, ideally with sources or scholar quotes. May Allah guide us all and protect our hearts.\n\nJazakum Allahu khayran",

      "title": "I want to take my hijab off but fear hell. ",
      "text": "okay, this might be a lot, so please bear with me.\n\nI began wearing the hijab about seven months ago, and while I’ve done my best, it’s been a journey of growth and self-reflection. In the process, I’ve sacrificed many old, haram habits—not just to draw closer to Allah, but also to respect myself as a hijabi. The hijab is not just a scarf; it’s a lifestyle. I like to think I’ve been doing well, even though I do show a small portion of my hair at the front. I’m still modest, and I remind myself that it could be worse.\n\nAt the start, I felt a deep sense of pride. I never imagined I’d wear the hijab, so defying my own expectations felt empowering. Many people complimented me, telling me I looked beautiful and that they could see the noor (light) in my face. As a social media influencer with over 100,000 followers, I also received messages from girls who said I inspired them to wear the hijab and embrace their modesty.\n\nHowever, recently, I’ve been struggling with the urge to take it off. It’s not because I dislike the hijab or feel I look bad in it. The challenge comes from the heightened expectations that society places on hijabis, something I didn’t fully understand before adopting it. I face criticism online for the smallest things. Even when I feel I’m doing well, I’ll get comments like, “Sister, why are you showing your edges?” or “Why did you post a song on your story?” While I understand that advice and constructive criticism are part of our faith, it can be overwhelming. I just want to focus on my relationship with Allah without the weight of unsolicited opinions.\n\nI feel guilty about wanting to remove the hijab for several reasons. First, I feel like I’d be disobeying Allah. I’m not a perfect Muslim, but the thought of removing it makes me feel like I’m falling short. I also have a deep fear of going to hell. I’ve heard people say that not wearing the hijab doesn’t automatically mean you’re prone to hellfire, but I can’t shake that fear. Second, I feel like I’d be letting down the people who supported and praised my decision to wear it. Third, I could delete my social media to avoid the constant criticism, but I’ve chosen to keep it. If I were to tell an imam that I decided to remove the hijab due to external pressure, I know they’d be disappointed in me.\n\nOn a deeper level, I want to make it clear that this isn’t a criticism of Islam or Allah’s laws. Islam is perfect; I am not. But I feel like there’s a sense of freedom I’m missing out on by wearing the hijab. For example, I enjoy making videos for Instagram and YouTube, but sometimes I find myself deleting entire videos if my hijab shifts or a part of my neck shows. The level of scrutiny feels difficult to maintain. Another thing, when I first put on the hijab, I thought it would protect me from the sexualization I often face, but it hasn’t reduced the unwanted attention. Men still stare, so it hasn’t provided the protection I hoped for.\n\nUltimately, I’m struggling to balance my desire to stay true to my faith with the realities of my personal life, especially in the public eye. I still want to be a devoted Muslim, but I wonder if the hijab, in its current form, is helping me grow closer to Allah or if it’s hindering me in some way. If I remove the hijab, people will have fewer expectations of me. For example, if I make a YouTube video with music in it, people won’t make the same comments they do now. Or if I wear something that shows my neck, I won’t face criticism because I’m not “disrespecting” the hijab if I don’t wear it at all. I still plan to pray five times a day, dress modestly, and try to be a better person and Muslim while fulfilling as many of my religious obligations as I can.\n\nI also feel a lot of pressure because I haven’t been practicing Islam my whole life. I only got close to the deen three years ago, and I’ve been trying to be “perfect.” I often feel guilty over minor things like listening to music, swearing, or talking to the opposite sex. I put so much pressure on myself to be a good Muslim, and it’s taking a toll. As I’ve mentioned, I feel like removing the hijab would take me out of the limelight. Hijabis often face the most scrutiny from the “haram police.” People automatically assume that non-hijabis are less religious, which is false, but in a way, it might be better for me because it will allow me to focus more on my religion and my relationship with Allah, without the weight of others’ expectations. \n\nI know this may sound contradictory—saying I’d disobey Allah to feel closer to Him—but that’s how I feel right now. I also worry that if I remove the hijab, I won’t be taken seriously as a Muslim. But I know that removing it doesn’t make me less of a Muslim.\n\nI’m not sure what my full intention is with posting this, but I really just wanted to hear others’ opinions. It feels like when women remove their hijab, it’s seen as the end of the world—as if they’ve given up everything. I still want to be a devout Muslim, but trying to be an “extreme” version of a Muslim—doing everything “perfectly”—has been stressing me out more than helping me. I think I'm honestly just coming to the realization about myself that I'm not as religious as I wanted to be, and I don't wanna say that it's okay, but that's what it is. I'm a believer of God and of course, I want to strive toward being the best and to strive toward heaven, But I'm also suffering trying to be the perfect Muslim and maybe my mental health will get better if I accept the fact that I do love God, but I'm the more spiritual side, than religious. I will never say that I'm not a Muslim. I will never not love Allah. But I also want to love myself, and I feel like the love of restriction I have placed upon myself is making that hard.\n\nI’d appreciate any words of affirmation or advice.",

      "text": "Salam! This is a serious question that I am struggling to wrap my head around.\n\nQuran 24:30 \"Tell the believing men to lower their gaze and guard their chastity. That is purer for them. Surely Allah is All-Aware of what they do.\"\n\nAs a young Muslim brother, in his 20s, I have made the effort of practicing lowering my gaze. Although I'm not perfect, I've tried to do it. I've noticed a difference in how this has shaped me to be stronger mentally and spiritually. It takes a lot of discipline to do so.\n\nI've noticed if I let my gaze wander it leads to a lot of intrusive thoughts that can get distracting and even overwhelming at times. It is true that the heart can't desire what the heart can't see.\n\nAnd so, by lowering my gaze it's as if Allah has silenced the noise in my mind, so I can focus on my daily to-do's and go about my life as usual. There's an odd sense of peace in my heart knowing that I'm lowering my gaze only for Allah and nobody will ever know, which I find to be super intimate between me and Allah. It has also deepened my bond and closeness to Him especially in Salah, alhumduillah.\n\nHowever...\n\nI do wish to get married to complete half my Deen and treat my marriage as a form of worshiping Allah, through my wife by being a great husband to her one day, InShaaAllah.\n\nOn several occasions, I've caught my eye on beautiful Muslimahs in public that seemed well-presented and well-mannered that I could've considered marrying. This happened either in malls or cafes.\n\nBut I didn't have the heart to approach them, out of full respect to them. I'm shy at the thought of it and wouldn't wish to intrude, disrespect or make them feel awkward or uncomfortable doing so. It's even harder if a Muslimah is with her family, or her friends.\n\n**Fundamentally, I feel guilty spotting a Muslimah I find attractive. She could have been my wife had I approached her but perhaps I should've lowered my gaze instead.** This is an extremely conflicting thought that I am torn by. And the guilt hurts my heart and disrupts my peace.\n\n**Does lowering my gaze mean not spotting an attractive muslim sister that could potentially be my wife? If not, what's the best, most respectful way of approaching a Muslim sister that catches my eye, for marriage?**\n\nBrothers, what's a practical approach that has worked for you in this matter?\n\nGenuinely advise me here my brothers and sisters.\n\nI'm just a brother seeking a spouse in the most halal, most respectful way InshaaAllah.\n\nJazakAllah!\n\n(P.S. The Muslim sisters that were suggested to me via family, relatives or matchmaking whatsapp groups, were wonderful but I wasn't attracted to them. So I didn't connect with them out of full respect for their time.)",

It wasn’t meant to debate anyone — just a Muslim asking Muslims.\n\nTo be honest, I cried a bit. It made me really sad to see how people can be so cruel for no reason. It was my first real experience with open Islamophobia online, and it shook me. I always knew it existed, but being the direct target of it felt different.\n\nI’ve always known deep down that I wouldn’t stay in this area forever, especially since it’s known for being one of the most Islamophobic. But now I’m seriously considering that moving to a Muslim country — sooner rather than later — might be better for my mental and spiritual peace.\n\nIf anyone else has experienced this… how do you deal with it emotionally? How do you protect your heart?",

      "text": "**UPDATE:** Today I said the Shahada with two of my closest friends over video. I wore a hijab, which I never thought I would do and I said it in English and Arabic. I am SO, SO, SO HAPPY!! Thanks to everyone who responded to me and gave me such wonderful and helpful advice! \n\nHello All: I apologize in advance for this long message, but some background info is required, I do believe in order to understand my situation.\n\nI am in my late 50's, female, live in the US, and was raised in the 60's /70's with a spiritual bent to religion - think tarot cards, psychics - though my parents did take us to Quaker meetings when we were very small.  I only encountered conventional church religion in my teens through singing in church choirs - mostly Southern Presbyterian (homophobia, racism, and fire and brimstone kind of stuff) - and later as an adult singing in more church choirs: Methodist, Catholic and non-denominational. I have always believed in some kind of god, but have veered towards the many Gods viewpoint (like how can one God deal with the amount of horror in our world, that sort of thing).\n\nAnd that's how I've basically been going along - tarot cards, psychics, many Gods - then came Palestine and the genocide and talking to people in Gaza. And one young person (20 years old) reached out to me for help (I am a retired university professor) to try to get out of Gaza because he won a scholarship to a university of Libya. We struck up a conversation. One day he asked me about what I knew concerning Islam and I said, not much of anything. Okay, that was 8 months ago.\n\nSince then we talk every day. Every single day. And he is very religious, I guess, I would say. He has certificates for studying the Quran. And he really was and has been very interested - not in converting me, though that has come up - but more teaching me about Islam and I've been incredibly open to it.\n\nHe's allowed me to ask a million questions and I've done my own research (a lot of it because that's what I do anyway - research and write). And along the way we have formed a strong friendship / mentorship (he's the same age as students I taught at university).\n\nI have never felt such an affinity for a religion before being introduced to Islam. I really never got into Western religions or denominations. I couldn't get into the Bible at all. It never felt real to me. And one of the things that bothered and bothers me about Islam - which is why I am here - is the gendering of God. God the father, maker of heaven and earth. He, Allah, etc.\n\nAs well, there are aspects of Islam, which from what I can tell, are more from the Hadiths, then the Quran, which is what I'm leaning towards in terms of belief and tenets, that don't really sit well with me.\n\nSuch as I don't want to wear the hijab. I feel bad saying that but it's the truth and I need advice about that.\n\nSo, here I am still considering saying the Shahada because my views have evolved as I've read the Quran and I love the Quran - like, really love it. It brings me an enormous amount of peace. Passages have brought me to tears because they're so beautiful or powerful. And I've learned a lot. I love learning, so reading the Quran has been a real joy.\n\nI do believe that the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) is the Messenger of God, but I'm stuck at the point of one God, as in ONLY Allah, which of course is THE pillar of Islam - so where to go from here?\n\nAlso, I don't feel comfortable talking to my family or friends about this decision. No one would understand and when I've tested the waters, I've gotten A LOT of judgment from my friends, especially. I'm not sure my family would get it but they might be a bit more accepting. But I haven't even tried to talk to them.\n\nI feel religion is a very private affair and if I say the Shahada I want to say it with my young friend and his family (obviously over the phone) and no one else - and I would like to say it in Arabic.\n\nI guess what I'm asking is how to get past the one God sticking point and the issue of gendering God, which I don't like at all.  It really bothers me. And the issue of wearing the hijab, which I would rather not do.\n\nI have no problem with the five prayers, fasting at Ramadan, paying zakat. I don't think I could ever do the Hajj because I couldn't possibly afford it.\n\nAnyway, all, thanks for reading. Any advice about the above issues would be most helpful.",

      "text": "I've seen people ask:\n\n> \"Why would a Merciful and Kind God punish humans for not praying or not fasting—or other religious duties?\"\n\n\n\nIt’s a valid question, but I think we sometimes miss the purpose behind these acts.\nIf God created life, He also created a law or structure to go with it—and that law has a purpose, not just arbitrary rules.\n\nI once read a neuroscience study showing that praying increases blood flow to the brain's frontal lobe, which is responsible for discipline, decision-making, and self-control.\nFasting, too, seems like another form of training—training your will, detaching from desires, and mastering your impulses. In other words, these religious practices aren’t just about obedience; they shape who you become—mentally, morally, and spiritually.\n\nSomeone might ask:\n\n> \"Well, what if I don’t sin or harm anyone, but I don’t pray either? Why would I be punished?\"\n\n\n\nThe answer may lie in how fragile we really are as humans. Everyone makes mistakes. But if you're following divine guidance—through prayer, fasting, or spiritual effort—you're more likely to stay centered and sincere. And you're more likely to receive God’s forgiveness and help, especially in moments of weakness.\n\nAnd here's the part that hits home for me:\n\n> One of the most powerful traits of being human is using your brain, not just your desires.\n\n\n\nSo next time you question religion, maybe don’t dismiss the teaching—question the source and the context. Sometimes the reason behind a rule isn't obvious, but that doesn't mean it has no purpose.\n\nThanks for reading. I'd love to hear your thoughts—agree or disagree. 🤔💭",

Yes there were other factors but trade and influence were the biggest. I also find out that Christianity wasn’t introduced into west Africa until the late 15th century, funny enough during the 15th century that’s when west Africans were taken as slaves to the Americas, and Europeans were the ones introducing Christianity to west Africa. I learned that while west Africans were taken to the Americas somewhere between 30 to 60 percent were Muslim. Meaning during that time west Africans practiced African spiritualism or Islam, not Christianity once so ever, and the reason a decent amount of African Americans practice Christianity now is because of the lost culture through generations of being slaves and adopting their slave owners traditions. This gives me a new profound sense of gratitude for Islam. Allah please continue to keep guiding me, I am forever humble and grateful.",

      "title": "Why Allah Stopped Sending Prophets or perform public miracles today?",
      "text": "A common question arises:  \n**“If God wants us to believe in Him, why doesn’t He continue sending prophets or perform public miracles today?”** From an Islamic perspective, the answer is deeply rooted in divine wisdom. Allah’s goal was never just to impress humans into belief, it was to **prepare, educate, and mature humanity** to the point where we could seek Him consciously and independently.\n\nAllah stopped sending prophets not because He abandoned us, but because He **completed the process**. Islam is not just the final religion, it is the **culmination of a long divine curriculum**. Humanity has been fully equipped with everything it needs to fulfill its **true purpose**: to seek and worship Allah alone.\n\n**1. Prophets Were Divine Teachers, Sent in Stages**\n\nFrom Adam (AS) to Muhammad ﷺ, prophets came as **teachers to a developing humanity**:\n\n* Some were sent to families, tribes, or nations.\n* Their messages were tailored to the people’s intellectual and moral capacity.\n* Most came with a few clear commandments, suited to a specific context.\n\nThis wasn't inefficiency; it was **divine pedagogy**, gradually building the moral and spiritual maturity of the human race, just as a student passes through stages of education.\n\n**2. A Gradual Process to Evolve Human Understanding**\n\nThe prophetic cycle was a **multi-generational training process**:\n\n* Moral awareness developed through struggle and trial.\n* Mental and social complexity increased over centuries.\n* Possibly even **genetic and cognitive refinement** took place, allowing humans to carry greater responsibility.\n\nEach nation’s rise and fall, each acceptance or rejection of a prophet, was part of this divine evolution. Over time, humans became more capable of **independent spiritual realization**.\n\n**3. Prophet Ibrahim (AS): The Turning Point in Divine Self-Discovery**\n\nThe defining moment came with **Prophet Ibrahim (AS)**.\n\nBorn into a society of idol-worshippers, he did not follow blindly. He looked at the stars, moon, and sun, worshipped by his people, and rejected them all. Using **pure observation and reasoning**, he concluded they were not God.\n\n**“Indeed, I have turned my face toward He who created the heavens and the earth, as a monotheist, and I am not of the polytheists.”**  \n*(Qur’an 6:79)*\n\nThis was a **spiritual milestone**: a human, without direct revelation or miracles, **found Allah from within**.\n\nFor this, Allah made him:\n\n* **A model for humanity** (Qur’an 16:120),\n* The **father of the Abrahamic line**,\n* And the ancestor of the final prophet, Muhammad ﷺ.\n\nProphet Ibrahim (AS) represents the moment when **mankind could begin to seek Allah independently**, guided by the signs in nature and the truth in their hearts.\n\n**4. Prophet Muhammad ﷺ: The Final Teacher, With the Universal Message**\n\nAfter Ibrahim (AS), the process continued. Laws became more comprehensive. Societies grew more complex. Finally, at the peak of human readiness, **Allah sent Prophet Muhammad ﷺ**:\n\n**“We have not sent you except as a mercy to the worlds.”**  \n*(Qur’an 21:107)*\n\nHe was:\n\n* The **Seal of the Prophets** (Qur’an 33:40),\n* Sent not to a tribe, but to **all of humanity and jinn** (Qur’an 7:158),\n* Given a **complete and universal deen**, addressing spiritual, moral, legal, and social aspects of life.\n\nFrom that point forward, no more prophets were needed, **the teaching was complete**.\n\n**5. The Qur’an: A Timeless and Superior Miracle**\n\nEarlier prophets performed visible miracles:\n\n* Musa (AS) split the sea.\n* Isa (AS) healed the blind and raised the dead.\n\nBut these miracles were:\n\n* **Tied to their own time and audience**,\n* **Not accessible to future generations**,\n* **Not preserved for intellectual engagement**.\n\nThe miracle given to Prophet Muhammad ﷺ was the **Qur’an**, a **living, linguistic, intellectual, and spiritual miracle**:\n\n**“If you are in doubt about what We have revealed... then produce a surah like it.”**  \n*(Qur’an 2:23)*\n\nThe Qur’an is:\n\n* **Linguistically inimitable**, even in peak classical Arabic.\n* **Scientifically insightful**, revealing truths discovered centuries later.\n* **Spiritually transformative**, shaping individuals and civilizations.\n* **Divinely preserved**: “Indeed, We sent down the Qur’an, and We will surely guard it.” *(Qur’an 15:9)*\n\nUnlike previous scriptures, it’s **accessible, verifiable, and timeless**, the only miracle that can be studied, recited, and reflected upon until the end of time.\n\n**6. Islam: The Final and Most Complete Religion**\n\nJudaism and Christianity, though rooted in revelation, were:\n\n* Sent to **specific nations** (primarily Bani Israel),\n* Intended for **limited timeframes**,\n* And their scriptures were **not preserved**, because they weren’t meant to be final.\n\nBoth traditions **foretold a coming prophet**:\n\n* The Torah promised a prophet like Moses (Deuteronomy 18:18).\n* The Gospel spoke of the coming Comforter (John 16:13).\n\n**Islam completes this divine arc**:\n\n**“This day I have perfected for you your religion, completed My favor upon you, and have chosen Islam as your way of life.”**  \n*(Qur’an 5:3)*\n\nIslam is:\n\n* The **universal faith** for all people, all times.\n* The **culmination** of all previous messages.\n* The only deen with a **preserved divine book** and **unbroken prophetic chain**.\n\nIt is the final framework under which humanity must now live, learn, and be judged.\n\n**7. The Final Test for a Mature Humanity**\n\nWith the Qur’an and the example of the Prophet ﷺ, humanity now has:\n\n* **All tools for guidance**: reason, revelation, natural fitrah.\n* **Historical context**: a legacy of 124,000 prophets and nations.\n* **A complete system** that addresses every human need.\n\nThere is no longer any need for prophets, because the curriculum is complete.\n\nThis is the **final test phase**:  \nCan humanity, with full access to truth, **find Allah and submit willingly**, as Prophet Ibrahim (AS) once did?\n\n**8. Our True Purpose Was Never Worldly**\n\nPerhaps the most clarifying truth of all is this:\n\nWe were not created to serve empires, cultures, generations, or even families.  \nWe were created for **one divine purpose**:\n\n**“And I did not create jinn and mankind except to worship Me.”**  \n*(Qur’an 51:56)*\n\nThe entire prophetic cycle, the evolution of human consciousness, the sending of the Qur’an, and the end of prophethood, all of it was to **prepare humanity to fulfill that one purpose**:  \nTo **recognize, seek, and worship Allah**.\n\nEverything else, careers, societies, even family, is **secondary and contextual**.  \nThe test of life is whether we will fulfill this ultimate purpose.\n\n**Conclusion: Islam Reveals the Divine Blueprint**\n\nAllah stopped sending prophets not because humanity was left to wander, but because humanity was finally **ready to walk the path alone**. Equipped with the Qur’an, the Sunnah, and a heart capable of seeking truth, the final stage of the divine plan has begun.\n\n**Islam is the final, complete religion** because it is:\n\n* The **last universal message**,\n* Protected by Allah,\n* Applicable in all places and times,\n* And anchored by the **living miracle of the Qur’an**.\n\n**Islam is the final truth** for a humanity now fully capable of seeking and worshiping the one Creator.",

      "text": "I come from a Chinese Muslim family with a deep-rooted Islamic tradition. My lineage can be traced back to the Sayyid Shams Din ‘Umar family during the Mongol Empire. My maternal grandfather, in his youth during the late Qing Dynasty or the Republic of China era, made the decision to ride a donkey with some provisions to perform Hajj and devote himself to spiritual practice in Mecca. He spent nearly thirty years in what was then Saudi Arabia, which, if I remember correctly, had just gained independence from Ottoman rule. He chose not to marry or start a family there but instead returned to China as an elderly man with a full beard, having left as a young boy. Upon his return, he married a Muslim woman from the village and raised several children, the most important of whom was my grandmother. He taught them piety and an extremely austere way of life from a young age.\n\n\n\nEventually, he passed away, and his children went on to marry. My grandmother married my grandfather, and at the age of twenty, she fell seriously ill, remaining unconscious for an entire month. When she woke up, she decided to perform Hajj. Upon her return, she was transformed—she became deeply ascetic, reciting the Quran to heal people in the community. Yet, she never accepted a single penny in return. She even spent decades confined to her home, praying day and night. Her children did not understand her choices and believed she should accept payment, but she refused. She treated the disabled and the wealthy equally, and whenever someone tried to give her money, she would say, “You don’t need to give me anything. If you fear Allah, then donate this money to the mosque.”\n\n\n\nHer life was one of tattered clothes and meager meals, yet she completely surrendered herself to Allah. As she grew older, her legs swelled to the point where she could barely walk, yet she continued to pray for people and recite the Quran, still observing fasting. At one point, she suddenly expressed a desire to pray and heal non-Muslims as well, but her health deteriorated further, and she eventually fell ill. A year later, she returned to Allah.\n\n\n\nThinking back now, I remember her agonized expression on her deathbed. I would cook for her and try to feed her, but she could no longer eat. The memory brings me to tears. What saddens me the most is that despite helping countless people in her lifetime, only a handful attended her funeral. I remember when her body was carried to the mosque, the imam said to everyone present, “The deeds of this deceased woman in her lifetime are beyond what any of us could compare to. May Allah grant her Paradise.”\n\n\n\nNow, I find myself struggling between faith and worldly matters. May Allah guide me. Amin.",

      "text": "Assalamu alaikum,\n\nI was born into an inter-religious family — my father is a non-practicing Hindu and my mother is a practicing Muslim. Growing up, I’ve faced challenges from friends, strangers, and even extended family because of this background. At one point, it led me away from Islam for a while.\n\nNow, I feel spiritually confused. Some aspects of Islam make sense to me, but others I struggle to understand. I can pray Fajr, and I know a few ayats and surahs, but I don’t know how to read or write Arabic, and I’m not confident about praying properly.\n\nI also worry about the future — about marriage, whether anyone would want to marry me, and how to build a family. I’m not very social, so I don’t think a traditional arranged marriage setup would work for me.\n\nIs this confusion part of my test? How can I strengthen my connection to Islam and practice more fully, given my circumstances? Any advice, resources, or steps to take would mean a lot to me.\n\nJazakAllahu khair.",

      "title": "The Ideal Muslim Man with his Wife",
      "text": "**This is based on Sunnah and Qur'an.**\n\nIn Islam, marriage is a union of souls, and both souls function to complement and complete each other; Thus both the husband and wife will enjoy stability and peace in their home. The marriage should be built on a solid balance of mental, spiritual, physical and emotional needs.\n\nThe ideal Muslim man, based on Sunnah and Qur'an is meant to treat his wife properly. Feminity is something to be valued and cherished:\n\n* The Muslim and his wife are bound to disagree with each other in some things. This is surely going to happen. He is to embrace their differences, and understand that *this is just a part of marriage*. When such petty arguments arise, treat her kindly. Doing so will result in a peaceful, non-shouting abode\n* Come home with a smile on your face, bless your family as you enter. If she is tired, needs a hand, or you have the capacity to help her, then you are required to help her. She is not your slave, she is your wife. In fact, on top of helping her, you should shower her in words of comfort.\n* It is vital that you make her feel like she is living with someone who is generous and tolerant, who will protect and care for her, meet all her needs, and makes her feel safe and secure.\n* He should satisfy her by making himself attractive to her (thus, exercise and be clean, etc). Furthermore, he should not be consumed in work, travel, responsibilities, hobbies, etc completely. He is required to devote time to her, as she has the right to enjoy time with her husband. You should not even be consumed in prayer to the extent that you cannot spend time with your wife! Spending time with her itself is a command from Allah.\n* Be playful and have a good sense of humour. Not everthing is monotone and serious. If there is some argument, ease the mood with humour and sarcasm with a light-hearted attitude. It is said in the Qur'an to engage in foreplay, and not just have soulless physical sex.\n* NEVER, never cause an uproar or raise your voice, ESPECIALLY for the most trivial reasons. Never be that foolish husband whose eyes flash in anger and rage for every minor mistake. Your wife had the most sincere intentions for every single error she has ever made, and if she even makes a mistake you are still to thank her.\n* Treat her friends with respect. Keep her secrets\n* If your wife is angry, or upset, responmd with kindness, patience and tolerance. This is literally the most vital thing. The Prophet's (PBUH) wives used to argue with him, and keep from him all day. Instead of anger in response, The Prophet (PBUH) smiled when asked.\n* If she is struggling in anything, literally anything, you are to help her (given you are able to). This can be a task, a concept in education, just literally anything.\n\nTo reiterate: recognise and fulfill her inclinations, desires, moods. Never pin her for any flaws she may have, because every human being is flawed (men and women). Recognise and embrace her flaws, and in doing so be gentle and kind. Treat her with the upmost respect.\n\n***'The best of men are those who are best to their women' - Prophet Muhammad, PBUH***",

      "text": "I was recently gifted a Qur'an during a dark point in my life, and I immediately felt an overwhelming sense of belonging. \n\nI've always been a spiritual person. I was raised Christian, but the ideals and expectations were never really enforced in my home. Because of this, as well as my personal values, I've always struggled to connect with Christianity, the bible, and church. I've maintained a connection to God throughout my life, but lacked a structured practice and belief system to have faith in. I feel like i've been dwindling most of my life and relied on the spiritual teachings & practices of those around me as guidance. \n\nI recently finished grad school and have been struggling to identify what my next steps will be. I haven't been able to find consistent employment, and the stress of unpaid bills has caused severe anxiety and panic attacks. I'm nearly at the point of being evicted from my home. I visited a friend's thrift shop to tell her what I was experiencing, and immediately noticed she was selling a Qur'an. When I asked her If i could have it and pay her back for it later, she gifted it to me for free. Since then, i've dedicated time daily to reading it and learning more about Islam. I feel heavily drawn to it, specifically the teachings of compassion and giving back to those in need. It feels good to be able to put a name to God. My anxiety has mostly subsided as the Qur'an teaches of patience and trust in Allah. I trust my financial situation will improve soon, and I almost feel like this experience happened to bring me back to Allah. \n\nI'm not sure where to go from here. Do I have to let go of my spiritual practices in order to revert to Islam? Am I wrong for wanting to keep this journey private? What is the process of reverting and can any reverts share their experience? For now, I'll just continue to read my Qur'an daily and surrender to life. I'm excited for what's to come!",

As I grew older, I didn't really sit down and truly think about why I was praying. Now, as an adult, I really struggle to pray. I understand the importance of talking to your lord and taking those moments out of your day. However, I've been thinking, doesn't praying 5 times a day devalue it somehow. It becomes a habit even if you don't want it to and doesn't it become mechanical at some point? I maintained most of my prayers when I was young but there was no truly spirituality and connection when I do them. Now that I've tried, I still can't connect and I struggle keeping all my 5 prayers? Any tips and similar struggles?",

      "title": "Why I reverted to Islam",
      "text": "I just want to share my journey. It started when I was younger if I’m telling the truth. I grew up in a non religious catholic household, were we would go to church every other Sunday and for the major holidays. I never really payed attention to what the pastor would say bc I was young and just trying to go home. But once I got to the age of 12, I started to listen. I always thought Jesus was God and once I started to pay attention, I would hear the Son of God, and I got confused bc I use to think Jesus was God. So I asked my grandma and she told me He was the son of God, and everything kinda changed from there. I use to be confused on why we would praise Jesus so much more and pray to him the most. I would think why wouldn’t we pray to God. It was all confusing and it really pushed me away; even in Sunday school learning about all the Saints, which confused me more. A connection never really stuck. & when I got older we had some family problems, among other things that really broke our family that pushed me into a depression, and I felt so lost and alone. I became suicidal for years. I did not want to live and that thought never left my mind. I even tried to commit suicide twice.  I began to believe there wasn’t a God bc I was confused on how so much bad stuff can happen. Time moved on, and it was the furthest I’ve ever been away from a religion, I began to only wear black, I would sleep all day, I had nothing to believe in, I felt broken. Years go by and i was still confused and depressed. I met my coworker who is a Christian woman who was very religious. She taught me a lot, and would preach to me about God and of course Jesus but she was mainly spoke about God. I began to ask questions and it slowly peaked my interest. We talked so much about it and she invited me to a service which I was suppose to go but something came up and I didn’t get too. I started speaking to God, and having some conversations on how I was confused and sorry about losing my faith, and that’s where my spiritual journey started. I was determined to find what fits with me. Learning about Christianity really jumped started it but I still didn’t think it was a right fit for me. Then I was learning about Hinduism bc I felt my traits aligned with some of the beliefs but it made me even more confused. Then I’ve had a friend who reverted when he was young so he was pretty knowledgeable about Islam and I began to speak with him. I asked him so many questions, and my struggles and he gave me the best absolute answers, he would mention sayings from the Quran, and the beliefs, and how loving, respectful, modest, and healing Islam is and I fell in love. I changed my ways of living. I was always depressed, I drank so much, did drugs, had no goals, I couldn’t see myself living pass the age of 22, I felt bitter at times, and had so much anger in my heart, and darkness, but once I opened my heart up to Allah, I felt a small warm glow turn on in me. I felt happy again, all the noise in my head got quiet, and I found peace. I had so much energy, I’ve felt so happy, extremely grateful to be alive, I finally find a purpose, a reason I am alive. I reflected on all the bad in my life and changed it. I felt so happy to believe again, i felt as He found me in a shallow pit and pulled me out. I feel so much love for the world now, and I couldn’t imagine leaving anymore. I am so grateful for everything I have, and treasure every moment being alive. I am so excited for the rest of my journey, learning more about Islam, getting closer to Allah SWT, serving him the best that I can, and being the best Muslim I could be inshAllah. I took my Shahada last Sunday, Alhamdulilah. 🥹",

      "title": "Jinn and Angels May Exist in a Light Spectrum Humans Can’t See",
      "text": "So I’ve been diving deep into the overlap between science and spirituality, and I think I’m onto something.\n\nWhat if jinn, angels, spirits—whatever you want to call them—aren’t “invisible” in the magical sense, but instead are literally existing in wavelengths of light humans can't perceive?\n\nHere’s the idea:\n\nHumans can only see a tiny slice of the electromagnetic spectrum—about 400 to 700 nanometers. That’s visible light. Outside that range is infrared, ultraviolet, X-rays, radio waves, gamma rays, etc.\n\nAnimals can see more than we do. Bees can see ultraviolet. Snakes detect infrared. Shrimp can see polarized light. But we humans? We only see about 0.0035% of the electromagnetic spectrum. That means 99.9965% of reality is invisible to us.\n\nNow, here’s where it gets interesting.\n\nParanormal investigators often use night vision, thermal cameras, or full-spectrum lenses. Sometimes they catch strange things—shadow figures, cold or hot spots, shapes not visible to the naked eye, or brief glitches. It’s usually dismissed as errors, but what if it’s not?\n\nIn spiritual traditions—Islam, for example—jinn are said to be made from a “smokeless flame of fire,” and angels from “light.” These aren’t physical beings. They’re described as energy-based. What if “smokeless fire” is just another way of describing infrared or something similar? What if “light” refers to a form of electromagnetic presence beyond our range?\n\nSo here’s my hypothesis:\n\nJinn and angels may exist on wavelengths of the electromagnetic spectrum outside of human perception—like infrared, ultraviolet, or possibly frequencies we don’t even know exist. Under certain conditions—like intense emotion, shifts in energy, or using specific tech—we might get momentary glimpses of them.\n\nThis could explain why animals or children sometimes react to things adults can’t see, why paranormal encounters are often “felt” or “sensed,” and why certain footage shows unexplained shapes or heat patterns.\n\nTL;DR: Jinn and angels might not be invisible—they might just live in light frequencies that our eyes weren’t built to see. I call it the “Spectrum Veil Theory.”\n\nI obviously used ai to explain it properly but everything I researched it by myself\n\nCurious what you all think.",

      "text": "Hey everyone,\n\nLately I’ve been diving into the topic of “grounding” (or “earthing”) – the idea that physical contact with the ground can have calming or health-related benefits. And it got me thinking: Could our prayer itself already be a natural form of grounding?\n\nEspecially during sujood, where our forehead, hands, and feet are in contact with the floor – it really made me wonder if there’s more going on here than just the spiritual aspect.\n\nBut then another thought hit me: Most modern prayer rugs are super thick, soft, and often made of synthetic materials. I’ve read that this might reduce the potential for any kind of physical grounding to happen. I even came across some “grounding mats” that plug into the wall to simulate the effect of touching the earth directly (like athletes or people who meditate use).\n\nSo I just wanted to ask:\n\n* Do you think there’s any connection between sujood and grounding in a physical sense?\n* Would you ever consider using a grounding-enabled prayer mat if it was safe, clean, and shariah-compliant?\n* Or do you think it’s unnecessary and overthinking it?\n\nJust curious what you all think. Genuinely interested in hearing different views – whether spiritual, scientific, or just personal.\n\nJazakum Allahu khairan!",

      "text": "Assalamu Alaikum wa Rahmatullahi wa Barakatuh\n\nI just wanted to share something personal from my heart — about how Allah guided me, healed me, and made me fall in love with Him… deeply and purely.\n\nI was very young when it all began — a quiet, shy girl during the COVID years, who used to hear stories about the Prophet ﷺ from my grandmother. I didn’t really understand much, but something stayed in my heart.\n\nAs I grew older, questions started to stir inside me: \"Everyone says Islam is the truth... but what actually is the truth?\"\n\nOne day, while reading the Qur’an, something in me just shifted. It was like the eyes of my heart finally opened. A cousin helped guide me, and I began reading more — hadiths, quotes, lectures on YouTube anything that would bring me closer to Allah.\n\nAnd then I fell in love. With Him.\n\nWith the One who heard my silent cries. With the One who gave me peace when no one else could. I started praying all five daily prayers even Fajr and my family was surprised. I was just a kid, but my eyes would open exactly at the time for salah. It felt like Allah was waking me up Himself. 🤍\n\nBut not everything was easy...\n\nI was tested with intrusive thoughts (waswas), spiritual OCD, and whispers that made me cry endlessly. I couldn’t share it with anyone except my sister, who told me:\n\n“Allah tests the ones He loves. You’re strong. You’ll get through this.”\n\nI stayed in sujood. I did dhikr. I cried in tahajjud every night. And slowly… I healed. Not all at once — but enough to know Allah never left me.\n\nNow I’m a young adult . I still struggle. I miss prayers sometimes. I forget things. I’m not perfect. But my love for Allah? It’s still the deepest part of me.\n\nEven when I listen to music and feel guilty... Even when I fall short... I find myself whispering again:\n\n\"Ya Allah, don’t take me away from You.\"\n\nAnd He never does.\n\nHe answers every du’a I make — even the ones I say with tears, in silence, in sujood. When I had no friends, I asked Him for one. He gave me many. When I was lost, He brought me back. Again and again.\n\nSometimes I ask Him:\n\n“Ya Allah, why do You love me? I’m just a flawed human who slips.”\n\nBut then I realize... Maybe it’s because I never stop coming back.\n\nSo if you’re reading this — and you’re struggling — Don’t give up on your love story with Allah. It’s the most beautiful one you’ll ever live. 🕊️ May Allah make us of those who love Him with hearts that never forget. Ameen. TL;DR: I was guided to Allah at a young age during COVID. I fell deeply in love with Him — started praying, learning, and feeling spiritually alive. I went through hard tests like waswas/OCD, anxiety, and loneliness, but I kept turning back to Allah. He answered every du’a, healed me slowly, and still gives me more than I ask for. I’m not perfect, but I love Allah with my whole heart — and I keep asking Him to never take me away from Him. 🤍",

Regardless of the logical points I bring to the discussion I continuously am met with a wall of ignorance and Islamophobia disguised  as love for my spiritual well being. I know the prophet (pbuh) said that paradise lies at the feet of our mothers. And that it’s a sin that we cut off family members whether it’s a full no contact or a low contact variety.

Indeed, it is also the day on which the Day of Judgement will come (referred to as the Hour).\n\n‘The best day that the sun has risen upon is Friday. On it Adam was created, on it he entered Paradise, and on it, he was expelled from it. And the Hour will not be established except on Friday.’ (-Tirmidhi 488, Book 4, Hadith 1)\n\nAllah SWT Has Named a Surah After Friday\nFriday and Saturday are the two days out of the week that Allah SWT has mentioned in the Quran. Other than Friday being highlighted for its congregational prayer, Allah SWT has named an entire Surah after this prayer and the day of the week, Surah Al-Jumuah. Allah SWT addresses the believers in this Surah:\n\n“O, believers! When the call to prayer is made on Friday (Jummah), then proceed to the remembrance of Allah SWT and leave off business. That is best for you if only you knew.” (Holy Quran, 62:9)\n\nThis surah of the Quran refers to Friday as ‘the Day of Assembly’, Yawm al-Jumu’ah, and stresses upon the importance of its congregational prayer, encouraging the believers to set aside their worldly affairs and hasten towards prayer and remembrance of Allah SWT. This distinctive mention is strongly indicative of the divine blessings of this day of worship, prayer, dhikr and spiritual elevation",

      "text": "For about a year and a half, I’ve felt drawn to Islam in a way I can’t fully explain. What started as curiosity slowly became something deeper — a pull I couldn’t ignore. In 2023, I fasted during Ramadan for the first time, and it left a lasting impact on me. In 2024, I was too ill to fast, and that made me realize how much fasting had actually helped me — not just physically, but emotionally and spiritually. This year, I was healthy again, and I found myself genuinely excited for Ramadan before it even began.\n\nLast year, a close friend gave me a prayer mat and encouraged me to try praying. The first time I did, something shifted inside me. I felt a calm I had never experienced before. It was like I had found something I had been searching for, without knowing it. Learning how to pray came to me quickly — naturally — like it had been waiting for me all along.\n\nStill, I’ll be honest — I have moments of doubt or insecurity. There are things I hear or read about Islam that leave me confused or unsure. But I’ve come to realize that a lot of that probably comes from hearing the wrong interpretations, or people online who don’t share the true message behind it. I know I still have a lot to learn. But I’m not rushing. I just want this journey to unfold in a sincere, honest way.\n\nThis past week had been especially hard. I cried during my prayers — overwhelmed and exhausted. But last night, something happened that I’ll never forget.\n\nAfter praying Maghrib, I sat with the Qur’an and read slowly, pausing at each ayah to reflect. Then I prayed Isha, and went to bed. Before falling asleep, I told myself: “Whenever I put my full trust in Allah, I know everything will turn out good for me.”\n\nI put on Surah Al-Baqarah, as I often do when I need peace.\n\nA couple of hours later, I woke up — which is unusual for me. The Surah was still playing, but only had a few minutes left, meaning I must have woken up right around Ayatul Kursi. When I checked the time, it was 15 minutes before Fajr.\n\nI don’t usually wake up at night. And I’ve been struggling with praying Fajr regularly. But that night, I had placed all my trust in Allah — genuinely, from the heart. And in that quiet, early hour, it felt like Allah was responding. Like He was gently waking me, knowing my struggle and sincerity, inviting me to come closer.\n\nThat moment filled me with a calm certainty. Islam is the the truth. Allah listens and knows your deepest wishes and struggles. And I am so thankful for that.",

Physical Health -  Literally studies \\[[1](https://www.rehabilityjournal.com/articles/jnpr-aid1020.php)\\]\\[[2](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3885840/)\\] showing salat is good for you. Great for your joints, improves bloodflow and circulation.\n2. MENTAL HEALTH - This is a bit of a rant and pseudo science but coming from a non-stable background, there is something very powerful about the fact that no matter what 5 times a day there will be time for prayers. There are also studies supporting this.\n   1. This sense of permanence gives a person calm and stability. If you lose your job, tragedy befalls you, lose friends, family, money literally anything - no matter what unless your bed ridden you always have salat. Thats POWERFUL.\n   2. Regimen - humans do very well when having a stable and predictable regimen.\n   3. Discipline - if you are able to commit and keep to salat even if you don't want to, it will make doing other things much easier. 99% of success comes from discipline, so you if you've got this on lock everything else is easy.\n   4. Masjid - Going to the masjid also compounds the benefits because it allows you to see other people, pray in unison and have a feeling of connectedness. It pretty much amplifies all the other benefits above. Not only are there 5 prayers a day, there's also always an imam holding the spiritual connection to allah. In a world of social isolation, masjid is like a lighthouse. Funnily the masjids always have the lights on the tower.\n\nZakat/Charity - Reality check\n\n1. We all like to complain about our lives and how horrible it is, but if we actually take stock on what we have and what we're able to do we realize very quickly we're blessed. There are some people out there who can't walk, pay for food, pay for bills. When you hand someone some money on the street who needs medicine, food, water you find that you're own troubles pale in comparison to others. This one is very important because the human mind for some reason is extremely partial to being ungrateful for its surroundings.\n\nI mean there's like hundreds of other logical reasons why Islam is the way but this is my mini rant. I don't feel like writing an essay. Also, there's deeper reasons for the other pillars of Islam but that requires deeper thinking.\n\nAnyways the point is, everything in the Quran has a reason and throughout life as we gain more experience it becomes clear.\n\nI guess to sum things up - being successful requires consistent effort. Discipline helps keep the effort output consistent and then mental health benefits prevent you from burning out.",

What struck me most was how he disrupted powerful tribal systems, empowered the marginalized, and reimagined social order in a deeply hierarchical society.\n\nWhether or not one believes in his prophethood, his impact is undeniable. But I think we often forget that before the revelations, before the movements, Muhammad was a man navigating intense pressures: spiritual, political, and personal.\n\nI just released a book diving into this angle — *Muhammad: The Prophet, The Rebel, The Man* — exploring how his life challenges simplistic portrayals and what we can learn from his leadership and resistance today. (https://a.co/d/08Cof6u) \n\nCurious what others think:\n\n* Can we separate Muhammad’s strategic brilliance from his spiritual message?\n* How should we view figures like him — through faith, history, or both?\n* Are there other global figures we tend to mythologize instead of humanize?\n\nLet’s talk.",

Or do you see the similarities as just cultural overlap?",

The hadith is reported in Sahih Bukhari and Sahih Muslim, and it says:\n\n> “When you hear the crowing of a rooster, ask Allah for His bounty, for it has seen an angel. And when you hear the braying of a donkey, seek refuge with Allah from Satan, for it has seen a devil.”\n— (Sahih al-Bukhari 3303, Sahih Muslim 2729)\n\nThis made me wonder something very specific:\nWhy does a rooster, specifically, see angels?\nWhy not some other animal? What is it about the nature of a rooster that allows it to perceive spiritual beings like angels?\n\nWhy this particular bird? Why not a cat, or an owl, or some other early-rising animal?",

The only area I’ve been able to dip into consistently is fitness  probably thanks to social media influence if I’m honest.

      "text": "Assalamu alaikum,\n\nI’ve been a sinner most of my life. I always believed in Allah, but I barely prayed — except for Jumu’ah — and I honestly wasn’t a good Muslim in general. I let myself drift far away from the deen, even though I always knew deep down what was right.\n\nRecently, I was hit by a major crisis. It crushed me. Out of pure desperation, I turned back to Allah — begging Him for help, praying for a miracle to save me from the situation I was in. That’s when I started praying again, reading Qur’an, trying to practice properly. It wasn’t a slow spiritual awakening — it was immediate, intense, and driven by pain and fear.\n\nNow I’m afraid… is this type of repentance even accepted? Or is it like the example of Pharaoh in Surah Yunus, who only said he believed when drowning, and Allah rejected it?\n\nحَتَّىٰٓ إِذَآ أَدْرَكَهُ ٱلْغَرَقُ قَالَ ءَامَنتُ أَنَّهُۥ لَآ إِلَـٰهَ إِلَّا ٱلَّذِىٓ ءَامَنَتْ بِهِۦ بَنُوا۟ إِسْرَٰٓءِيلَ وَأَنَا۠ مِنَ ٱلْمُسْلِمِينَ\n“Until, when drowning overtook him, he said, ‘I believe that there is no deity except the One in whom the Children of Israel believe, and I am of the Muslims.’”\n— Surah Yunus 10:90\n\nAm I doing the same? Is my repentance invalid because it started in desperation?\n\nI genuinely want to stay on this path now, not just until the crisis ends. But I can’t help feeling guilty that I didn’t return sooner — and that my return came from fear, not love or sincerity at first.\n\nWould love to hear your thoughts and any advice.",

      "text": "**YHWH (**יהוה**)** is considered the divine name in both Judaism and Christianity, and often it is the center of discussion.\n\nThe word is constructed with four letters;\n\n**• Yod (י) →** Symbolizes the divine point of origin or the initial act of creation, representing God's eternal existence and creative power.\n\n**•He (ה) →** Represents the divine breath or revelation, symbolizing God's presence and self-manifestation.\n\n**•Vav (ו) →** Functions as a connector or \"hook,\" symbolizing the continuity and connection between God and creation.\n\n**•He (ה) →** Repeated, it again signifies God's revelation and presence.\n\n\n\nThe name is first revealed in **Exodus 3:14**;\n\n>**אֶֽהְיֶה** אֲשֶׁר **אֶֽהְיֶה**\n\n**Translation;**\n\n>**I AM** who **I AM (Ehyeh** Asher **Ehyeh)**\n\n\n\nContext: \n\nWhen Moses asks the Most High about his name, God responds as such, which is translated as **\"I AM\"**. This establishes God's unwillingness to reveal name, the name **YHWH (**יהוה**)** refers more as \"**He is**\" as seen in **Exodus 3:15**, **its a third person form**,  so it **should only be understood as a name of attribute,** because **Phonetical names/Proper names do not change with grammatical person**.\n\n\n\nThe name **YHWH (יהוה)** comes from the root word **\"Hayah (הָיָה)\"**, a verb that means;\n\n**→To be** \n\n**→To exist**\n\nIn this case, it indicates God's **self-existence**, **eternal nature**, and **refusal to be confined by human categories or named definitively**.\n\n\n\nThat's why scholars interpret it as **\"I AM\"** when God says it, and **To be Everlasting** in third-person theological implication.\n\nHowever, it is evident in the Tanakh that **God prioritizes expressions of attributes over phonetical identifier**.\n\nIn **Isaiah 7:14**;\n\n>לָ֠כֵ֠ן יִתֵּ֨ן אֲדֹנָ֥י ה֛וּא לָכֶ֖ם א֑וֹת הִנֵּ֣ה הָעַלְמָ֗ה הָרָה֙ וְיֹלֶ֣דֶת בֵּ֔ן וְקָרָ֥את שְׁמ֖וֹ **עִמָּ֥נוּ אֵֽל**׃\n\nTranslation;\n\n>Assuredly, my Sovereign will give you a sign nonetheless! Look, the young woman is with child and about to give birth to a son. Let her name him **Immanuel**.\n\n\n\n•**However**, no one was ever literally named **Immanuel**, that's why;  \n→Christians interpret it as **Jesus**.  \n→Jews interpret it as **King Hezekiah**.\n\n\n\n# Other parallels showing God prioritizes meanings;\n\n•**Abraham(אַבְרָהָם)**: Original name was **Abram(אַבְרָם)**, which meant \"**Exalted father**\", God changes his name to Abraham in **Genesis 17:5**, meaning \"**Father of a multitude of nations**\", as through him, the Israelites, Ishmaelites, Ebionites etc. rose up as different nations.\n\n\n\n•**Isaac(יִצְחָק)**: Given to **Sarah at a very old age**, a blessed child, God named him Isaac in **Genesis 17:19**, meaning \"**He laughs**\", **emphasizing the bringing of joy to them**.\n\n\n\n•**Ishmael(יִשְׁמָעֵאל)**: Given to **Hagar**, after **God hearing to her affliction**, God named him as Ishmael in **Genesis 16:11**, meaning \"**God Hears**\"\n\n\n\n•**Israel(יִשְׂרָאֵל)**: Original name was **Jacob ( יַעֲקֹב)**, after **struggling with God** (`Spiritually`), God **acknowledged his struggle and named him Israel** in **Genesis 32:28**.\n\n\n\nThat's why,  \n Qur'an uses the term **Al-Hayy (الحَيُّ)** instead of **YHWH (יהוה)**. \n\n**Al-Hayy (الحَيُّ)** is the **65th name** of the God of Abraham. derived from the same root word **Ḥayah (حَيَاة)**, which means;\n\n**→Living**\n\n**→Existence**\n\nIt explicitly appears in Quran 2:255;\n\n>ٱللَّهُ لَآ إِلَـٰهَ إِلَّا هُوَ **ٱلْحَيُّ** ٱلْقَيُّومُ\n\nTranslation;\n\nAllah, there is no god but Him, **the Ever-Living**, the Sustainer of all existence\n\nFully aligning with YHWH (יהוה) in Hebrew;\n\nPhonetic shifts are common in **Interlingual translation**;\n\n•**English**: YHWH (יהוה) → Jehovah\n\n•**Amharic**: YHWH (יהוה) → Egzi'abiher (እግዚአብሔር)\n\n\n\n**Only Moabites and Ebionites** called the God of Abraham directly as **YHWH (יהוה)** \\[Found in Moabite scripture, Mesha Stele\\], because they spoke dialectical language but used **Paleo-Hebrew script.**\n\n\n\n**Other phonetical shifts of highly regarded persons such as**:\n\n• **Yeshua (יֵשׁוּעַ) → Lesous (Ἰησοῦς) → Jesus**\n\n• **Yochanan (יוֹחָנָן) → John**\n\n\n\nLikewise, Arabs also followed the **Noahide laws** and **had their own phonetic names for all the prophets**. These phonetic shifts are **done to preserve meaning of the word in their own language**, **otherwise it would be empty in meaning**.\n\n\n\nRegardless, **the true pronunciation of YHWH (יהוה) is lost** due to the **lack of vowel marks** in Hebrew, it goes same for all the prophetic names, and the pronunciation. The reconstruction of ‘Yahweh’ depends on the vocalization present in prophetic names, which themselves assume a pronunciation of the divine name—**creating a dependency that limits certainty**.\n\n\n\n**Yod (י)** in hebrew is **not always pronounced** as a seperate phoneme and has various purposes.\n\n**• Consonantal Use**\n\n**•Mater Lectionis: Vowel mark. (appearing in the middle of words)**\n\n**•Silent Use: For grammatical purposes**\n\n**•Divine Function: Serving in theology.**\n\n\n\nDivine function is the **highest probable reason**, because the OT was **primarily subjected to Oral transmission**, writings may have started during or after the **Iron Age (circa 1200–1000 BCE)**. In Hebrew, **Yod appears in divine names and titles**, working as a marker of sanctity or grammatical distinction (e.g., causative, imperfect, or eternal aspect), **rather than necessarily vocalized**.\n\n\n\nAccording to its theological purpose,\n\n**Yod represents a mere dot, a divine point of energy... used to form all the other letters... indicating God's omnipresence.** \n\n*\\[Source: (https://www.hebrew4christians.com/)\\]*\n\n\n\nGiven this mystical understanding, \n\nYod at the beginning of the Tetragrammaton may indicate:\n\n**• Divine reverence rather than a literal sound when applied to YHWH.**\n\n**• A compressed symbol of life, being, or energy, much like Ḥayy or Hweh would semantically convey.**\n\n\n\nIn this sense, the name \"Hayy (حَيُّ)\" is closer to the root word than the modern Hebrew scholarly construct, **the dual role of Yod (י) \\[ both Phonetic and Theological\\] also remains valid.**",

      "text": "Hi all, \n\nI'm born to a Jewish mother, vast majority of whose paternal family perished in the Holocaust- as such, my grandad was greatly affected by this his entire life, right until he passed in the late-2000's. This alone made me feel some kind of vague calling to the religion my entire life, but I sadly never acted on it in any material way... and I hate that, because his suffering, the loss of almost the entire side of his family, and not to mention the loss and suffering of untold millions belonging to the same religion, really made it feel like an important thing to keep aflame and to be apart of... \n\nWell, now I'm 35 and feeling more lost and disconnected from whatever it is that it means to be a Jew. I didn't go through any of the birthright passages most Jews will gone through... and maybe by that metric, am not even a real Jew? Honestly, I'm okay with that, if that's the case- but still, I wish to learn much more about the religion and to in some way safeguard it and ensure the flame burns on. I know I'm just one person, but I truly feel strongly about not just letting that part of me die- it's very, very, important to me. Being Jewish is a great privilege and honour which I have squandered my entire life, but aim to fix... but how? I want to attain a deep, intimate, understanding of what it is to be Jewish... I want to understand the religion and its teachings fundamentally; wholly. I don't just want to run through whichever motions are necessary to dub me a \"real Jew\" once fulfilled- I want much more than that. I like to understand and feel things as deeply as possible- otherwise, what's the point... I don't just want some vague, impressionistic, understanding of it. But how, especially at this age- can I \"catch up\" on more than three decades of Jewish birthrights and experiences?",

      "text": "I don’t have many friends, I’ve been really lonely lately because my closest friend stopped being friends with me (my ocd symptoms got annoying to her), but I have a friend from high school (I just graduated in June) who I’ve been talking to. He’s not antisemitic, he even considered going to a Megillah reading with me on Purim to learn about Judaism, but he hates religion. He said Judaism’s the only religion that makes a lick of sense, but he could never practice it because the idea of worshipping God makes him sick. He’s always posting anti-religion stuff to his Instagram story though and venting to me about arguments where he loses friends because they get sick of him insulting religion. It’s mostly Christians who get mad at him, he has religious trauma from catholicism so he speaks out against Christianity a lot.\n\nI sympathize with him—I don’t know what happened to him that turned him so strongly against religion, but I understand how horrible religious trauma can be. However, I’ve had to be the messenger when he was fighting with a girl from our school about religion, and I was really uncomfortable taking sides because while he’s my friend, he was being extremely harsh on her for being a Christian, calling her a cultist and insulting her religion horribly. I was going to call him out for a comment that really crossed the line until he started threatening that he was going to >!kill himself!<\n\nI’m just not sure how/if this friendship is gonna work out considering I practice conservative Judaism and he’s completely anti-religion. I’m worried this will cause problems and that it’s just a matter of time before he gets mad at me for being religious. I’m also worried that I’m a bad person for not having defended the Christian girl when he said he said terrible things to her. And I wonder if I as a religious person am okay to be friends with someone like this. I really want to be friends with him though, idk how much of that is because of loneliness and how much is because I like him as a person, but he really is a great guy",

I myself am a demonoltrist pagan, but grew up going to shul, hebrew school, and more because i live in an area with a lot of jewish people (south florida.) so while i have plenty of experience with judaism, i myself am not jewish\n\nQuick recap, this is an update to my friend trying to name her child שואה meaning holocaust because shes goth and finds the name „beautifully tragic“ we had a small debate over it and she told me i was over reactings so i took to reddit and you guys confirmed im not crazy\n\nWith this being said lets get to how the confrontation went ig. I texted her (19F christian) saying i had asked ppl on reddit and some of my jewish friends and they all said the name was extremley disrespectful. I even gave her some good replacements like שוֹאה,םלחה,מָוֶת etc. her response that i totally violated her privacy by „telling on her“ and that it was her baby her choice. I tried to get her to not name her baby that and then she went on a rant saying I was jealous that i couldnt have kids because i was tr4ns, and that um „the jews are trying to hold us all back“ which was insane. She also claimed i was just „one of the jews open about the evil satanic religion“ which worries me seeing shes talked about  להתגייר  very recently before this all happened. With that being said, shes been blocked and Ive told her mother about her insane name plan (the mother is on our side btw)\n\nThank you guys so much for all the advice and hopefully i can give u guys some better advice in 5 months when the baby is here!",

However, aside from occasionally being invited to either temple or church, I was not raised with religion. I never really felt a pull towards either side until recently. I had a series of dreams that are, what I believe, messages from god. They are difficult to describe but left me with a feeling of awe. I went to a local conservative temple as a guest 4 times within the last few weeks, and every time I went the message that day pertained to a struggle I had that week. I knew this was another message. I began reading the Jewish bible, and making small changes to my lifestyle, such as taking a few minutes to pray in the morning. It was awkward when I started praying but it has since gotten easier. With all this being said, I have some concerns. I didn’t grow up living Kosher, and my fiance is Christian, so I don’t believe it’s fair to her to suddenly make changes. I also don’t understand or read any Hebrew whatsoever. I’ve tried learning from various language learning methods but have been less than successful thus far. I guess my question is, are there other people here that went through a similar process? How can I follow the commandments without changing so much about mine, and indirectly my fiancé’s life? A commandment is a commandment, and to pick and choose which ones to follow based on how easy they are seems disrespectful to me. Any advice or guidance would be greatly appreciated.",

What was the religious or folk history Jews tell ourselves of how Jews got writing. Most societies with literacy give it divine inspirations (Odin, Thoth); given how central the concept of a holy book (something you need literacy for) is to Judaism, surly ancient Israelites and Jews though heavily on a foundational pillar of their society and culture.",

I'm currently visiting family in my largely goyish hometown (where there is, notably, a massive lit-up cross installed in the hills that you can't miss from any side of town), and when I went to continue my search I accidentally put \"near me\" instead of the large city I live in.\n\nTo my surprise, not one, not two, but THREE synagogues popped up near me. Immediately, I knew something was off - I knew only three Jewish people growing up (not to mention, one of which was my uncle, and two of which were convrts). Taking a closer look, I realized they were M\\*ssianic Synagogues - or more aptly put, ch\\*rches.\n\nI spent the rest of the night looking into M\\*ssianic Judaism, and I'm still confused. If they believe J\\*sus is the messiah, I could be wrong, but I believe there's already a religion for that. If they want to study the Torah, why not just read the Old Testament or attend a C\\*tholic ch\\*rch? If they genuinely feel they are Jewish, why not go through the convrsion process?\n\nI've run into Chr\\*stians that have a strange fixation on Jewish people and study Hebrew without having any practical application for it; but I've never heard of any gentile that's taken it as far as calling themselves a M\\*ssianic Jew. I asked my Israeli partner and friends about it, and they had never heard of it either.\n\nWhat is your guys' take on this phenomenon? Have you ever meet any of these people yourself? I'm curious to hear more thoughts on this.",

It's very important to me that I raise my children Jewish, and while I absolutely respect her religion, my idea of raising my children Jewish doesn't include having them worship multiple deities (and idols). I respect and admire people who make interfaith marriages work, but I don't think it's for me.\n\nI don't have anything against her as a person but every time we talk, she says something else about marriage, and I wish more and more that I never got into this situation in the first place.

      "text": "Hey Guys\n\nFirst of all, I don't want to offend anyone and I want to apologise, if that question got asked before.\n\nI grew up in Germany. For decades, an attitude of apology for our past under the Nazi regime prevailed in our country. This also dominated the education system. We learned about the historical contexts that led to the genocide, but we never delved deeper into the subject matter. In general, Judaism is not talked about much and the religion is not really visible in our personal environment, compared to islamism. However, that attitude started to change more and more after the conflict.\n\nAfter I moved away, the religion has become more visible. I find it very strange to go from an attitude of apologizing and looking the other way to being confronted with protests from students from strong, social classes with a high, educational background. Which I find very problematic, how self called educated fellows tend to believe extreme narratives instead of positioning themself a moderate view, especially on highly complex issues without private involvement.\n\nI am aware that the conflict is one big reason for the moral turnaround. I just can't imagine that this is the entire reason. Since, as I said, I had no real points of contact with religion until 2 years ago, I am interested in the underlying reasons for the rise of anti-Semestism and who benefits from it, beside the known historical narratives.",

      "text": "My partner of 5 years was raised Jewish (reform) with a Jewish mom and a non-Jewish father. I've always seen him as my life partner and we've spoken about getting married and having kids together. Judaism is naturally a core part of his identity and upbringing, and we've spoken at length about what that means for us and our future. Celebrating the high holidays, having Shabbat dinners (not every Friday night but every so often), and raising our kids with these rituals, for example, are really important to him so are also really important to me. He's indifferent about me converting—that, to him, isn't important and I've expressed that as someone who is very 'non-religious' I definitely wouldn't be comfortable doing this. What's most important is being able to incorporate Judaism into our life and future together as a couple/family, and to not lose this aspect of his identity.  \n  \nI am curious and interested in Jewish culture, celebrations, rituals, and history so am excited to make these kinds of practices a centrepiece of our relationship. That said, as an atheist, there are certain things I'm not sure I feel 100% comfortable with (and might not know until I immerse myself more in Judaism)—going to a Synagogue for Yom Kippur, for example, or having our kids go to Jewish schools. I'm sure it's a matter of having ongoing open dialogue about what's important to both of us (which we've been doing), but I just worry that I won't be able to internalise a deep-rooted excitement and curiosity toward Judaism that he needs in a partner, largely due to my own associations with religion and the grey zone between culture and religion in Judaism.\n\nI should also mention that while we've been together for many years, we're far from his friends and family and Jewish community so naturally don't celebrate the high holidays, for example, to the same extent we would if we were closer to them. While we've recently made more of an effort to incorporate these into our lives, I haven't had as much first-hand exposure to or experience with the elements of Judaism that are important to him which is probably why I feel 'I don't know' what I am / am not comfortable with / excited about. \n\nI've seen a lot of Reddit posts from the perspective of Jewish people who have non-Jewish partners that happily convert but I haven't seen a post that reflects my perspective and experiences. Reading these posts makes me feel ashamed that I'm not like these people, who are so fascinated by and committed to Judaism that they readily convert and at times become more committed to Judaism than their Jewish partners. Honest input is welcome, particularly from those who have experienced similar feelings as I've described.",

      "text": "I’ve been thinking a lot lately about interfaith marriage. Not in a positive or negative light, just in general and what it spells out for me and my children if I ever decide to intermarry.\n\n\nFor reference I’m a Black, Latino, Jewish, college student and am currently working towards finding a good Jewish parter to date and share a piece of my life with.\n\n\nTo be clear I don’t want to make this a war between denominations, I’m not into that. I just want to share my thoughts and to hear yours.\n\n\nAt first, I thought I knew what I wanted. I wanted to marry Jewish and have myself two beautiful Jewish children, one adopted and another biological (if all went well). Though, the longer I live the more I feel as if I don’t know if that’s what I want or if that’s what I’ve been told I want.\n\n\nI’ve spoken to different people about this, but my main concern is, I don’t want the Jewish identity of my children to come into question. When I spoke to my Rabbi about this he assured me that a Jewish Woman was the best choice for me particularly because similar ideals are like glue in a relationship at times, and can help when raising children. \n\n\nMy therapist said something similar, but also said that even though I say I want a Jewish woman for the sake of my children, she sees that I’ve historically had trouble with finding a community where I feel comfortable, and wonders if I want a Jewish woman purely out of fear of rejection from the community.\n\n\nShe makes a good point.\n\n\nI don’t fully know what I want. I know I want a wife who I can respect and can respect me, but I also want my children to never have their Jewishness questioned, and never feel like they’re not enough for this community they’re a part of.\n\n\nI know different denominations have different ways of viewing this and different solutions to this, but I don’t really agree with those solutions. But, I now understand why they came to be.\n\n\nThen here’s where things get a little more confusing for me. I met this girl a year ago working at a JCC. We’re both not working there anymore, though we stayed in contact. She is a great human. She calls me out when I’m wrong, she holds me accountable, she’s respectful, and she’s beautiful. She’s not Jewish, and that’s ok. \n\n\nWe went to watch the Fantastic Four film, and with every trailer we watched she was able to call out every actor that was Jewish, and when we left the movie, and went to eat, we started discussing intermarriage. She told me she would love to raise Jewish kids and all that, but she wouldn’t switch religions. Which I understand, I can’t hold that against her. She’s very Jewish adjacent, she knows everything about the culture. \n\n\nBut, this experience kind of shattered my mind. This girl isn’t Jewish and I’m attracted to her. Before her I was previously talking to someone who was indeed Jewish, I never asked her out (I’m very regretful about that).\n\n\nI kind of need guidance here. What should I do? Are there any books I can read on the topic?",

They are nice people and they seem to like me a lot, my boyfriend thinks so too. They are gen X, his grandmother is from the baby boomers generation.

      "title": "First Black Woman Ordained as a Cantor",
      "text": "I had the absolute pleasure to meet Cantor Jenni a couple of weeks ago.\n\n\n\nLOS ANGELES, Calif. – Before applying to cantorial school, Jenni Asher had two other careers: first as a violin teacher, then as a massage therapist specializing in treating musicians with repetitive strain injuries.\nThough she found her work fulfilling, she felt a growing pull toward something more spiritual – \"something for God,\" as she puts it in an interview with Haaretz.\n\"The job of a cantor encapsulates so much of what I was interested in and good at already,\" she says. \"I just needed to learn the liturgy.\" \n\nAfter seven years of study, Asher was ordained on Monday by the Academy for Jewish Religion California (AJRCA), a trans-denominational institution – making history as the first Black American woman to be ordained as a cantor. Addressing the crowd gathered at a Los Angeles synagogue for her ordination ceremony, Asher said: \"My success as a cantor won't be measured by how well I sing, but by how I inspire others to sing. My role is not to be the loudest voice in the room. My role is to be the one that helps others hear themselves.\"\nRabbi Cantor Hillary Chorny from Temple Beth Am, a Conservative congregation in Los Angeles, lauds Asher's groundbreaking achievement: \"Representation matters, and it also matters that we in the Jewish community acknowledge that it is that much harder for Jews who do not fit the typical Ashke-normative mold to be treated as if they belong in our communities,\" says Chorny, who has known Asher for a decade. \"Not only does Jenni belong – she belongs in leadership.\"\nRabbi Cantor Sam Radwine, the dean of AJRCA's cantorial school, describes Asher as a gifted musician who challenges American Judaism's \"Ashkeno-centric\" orientation – that is, its emphasis on Ashkenazi traditions and cultural touchstones.\n\"She makes Jewish life accessible to people who may look like her, or may not look like the rest of the congregation,\" he says. \"I know that she's going to represent and lead the Jewish people in a very significant way.\"\nAsher, 38, joins a small group of Black American clergy leading Jewish communities across the U.S. This includes Cantor David Fair, the cantor at Temple Sinai in Summit, New Jersey, and Rabbi Evan Traylor, recently ordained by Hebrew Union College, who is set to become assistant rabbi at Congregation Beth Elohim in Brooklyn. Several other Black Americanrabbis also serve in non-pulpit roles within Jewish institutions.\nAsher took a winding path to Judaism, and ultimately to the cantorate. She was raised in Pasadena, California, in a Christian family that belonged to the Worldwide Church of God, an Adventist denomination. The church observed certain Hebrew Bible laws, such as abstaining from work on Shabbat and Jewish holy days, and avoiding pork and shellfish.\nFollowing the death of founder Herbert Armstrong in 1986, the Worldwide Church of God shifted toward more mainstream Christian practices. Jenni Asher did not agree with this new direction, so while she was living in London and studying violin at the Royal Academy of Music, she began exploring Judaism. First, she attended services at the city's Central Synagogue, an Orthodox congregation, and later at the New North London Synagogue, a Masorti-Conservative community.\nAfter moving back to the U.S. 10 years ago, Asher studied Judaism at American Jewish University – an institution affiliated with the Conservative movement – and underwent her first conversion. She later completed a second, Orthodox conversion through a Sephardic rabbinical court while pregnant with her first child. She chose the second conversion, she explains, to ensure that her Egyptian Jewish husband and their children could fully participate in Orthodox communities. Today, she and her husband have two children, ages 6 and 3. \nUnlike other Jewish denominations, the Orthodox movement does not ordain cantors through its rabbinical schools.\nAsher's decision to leave the Worldwide Church of God caused friction with many people in her close circle, including her parents. But over time, they reconciled to her choice and that relationship healed.\n\"I think they're proud of me for becoming a spiritual leader,\" she says. \"They would have preferred that I had stayed in the faith that they raised me in, but Judaism is a close second to what I grew up with for them.\"\nAsher's ordination comes 50 years after Barbara Ostfeld first broke that glass ceiling to become the first woman to be ordained as a cantor. While other Black American women have performed cantorial music, none had previously been formally ordained. In the early 20th century, for example, Madame Goldye Steiner toured as \"Goldye di Shvartze Khaznte,\" or \"Goldye the Black Woman Cantor.\" But she was never officially ordained, and it is not clear if she was even Jewish.\nAsher says she has mixed feelings about creating such a precedent.\n\"It's 2025, and I'm the first – that's unacceptable,\" she says. \"There are plenty of Black Jews in the U.S.. Why am I the first? Is it that there's not enough support or infrastructure?\"\nLast year, writer Marra B. Gad, who is Black, revealed that she had been discouragedfrom applying to cantorial school at Hebrew Union College – the rabbinical seminary of the Reform movement – in the late 1980s. A cantor on the admissions committee, she recounted, told her that her voice was not a good fit for HUC, aremark she interpreted as racially loaded.\nAsked for comment, a spokesperson for HUC called Gad's account \"heartbreaking,\" adding: \"Even as we congratulate Cantor Asher on her ordination, it is a reminder of how much work there is still to do to nurture belonging and build clergy that represent the diversity of the [Reform] movement and the communities that our graduates will serve.\"\nThis summer, Asher will officially join the clergy at Hamakom, a Conservative synagogue in the San Fernando Valley where she served as the music director and a cantorial soloist for the past two years.\n\"Now stepping into the role of cantor on a full-time basis, Jenni Asher will continue to elevate our spiritual experience through the transformative power of music,\" Paula Russell, Hamakom's president, wrote in a message to the congregation. \"It has been said that music can express emotions beyond words—anyone who has heard Cantor Asher sing knows that is one of her many gifts.\"\nIn addition to singing, Asher is a multi-instrumentalist who plays violin, viola, cello, piano, and the Chinese two-stringed erhu. She performs with ensembles and has recorded three albums of original music. Her latest, \"Yaladati\" (Hebrew for \"I gave birth\"), was released in 2021. She has also composed a number of simple, looped melodies drawn from Jewish liturgy and other sources – which she hopes to teach to her congregants.\nAsher has a particular love for jazz, a genre her father introduced to her as a child. At her cantorial recital in March, she sang \"Hinei Ma Tov\" to the melody of Chick Corea's classic \"Armando's Rhumba.\" \nIn a tribute to her roots, she closed the recital with a modified version of the Christian hymn \"I Know Who Holds Tomorrow,\" which she sang growing up.\nAt Hamakom, she plans to draw upon her multicultural heritage to create programs that resonate with other Jews of color, particularly Black Jews.\n\"One of my tasks will be to make MLK Shabbat a service that Black Jews feel is for them,\" she says, referring to the Shabbat that coincides with Martin Luther King Jr. Day. \"I'm not seeing anybody do that across the United States.\"\nChorny, who worked with Asher on her first conversion, hails her as a trailblazer. \"In taking this path, she is breaking glass ceilings,\" says the LA-based rabbi and cantor. \"Kids will grow up with Jenni as their cantor and know without question that cantors look and sound the way Jenni does.\"\nRobin Harrison, a fifth-year rabbinical student at AJRCA who is also Black, compares Asher to Jackie Robinson, the first Black player in Major League Baseball.\n\"It takes a certain person with a certain character to make a difference, and Jenni is that type of person,\" says Harrison. \"This kind of achievement is going to make a difference to other Jews of color, to show what can be accomplished.\"\n\n\n\nhttps://www.haaretz.com/jewish/2025-05-29/ty-article-magazine/.premium/historic-first-black-american-woman-ordained-as-cantor-in-the-u-s/00000197-1607-d57f-a7d7-3ee73c550000?lts=1749180522057",

My understanding is that the gentiles aren't expected to keep the various kosher laws and that sort of thing, but are expected to keep the 10 commandments, the Sabbath being one of them.\n\nThe Sabbath interests me greatly as well. Most religious worship revolves around practitioners doing some work or sacrifice in reverence of a god, whereas the Sabbath is a gift from God to man, that rather demands *not* doing something (i.e. work). It reveals a creator that cares about his creations vs one that is interested only in what he can extract from them for his own benefit (which pretty much sums up all the pagan gods in a nutshell).\n\nBut yea, let's say you had a gentile friend, how would he as a gentile keep the Sabbath in your view?",

      "text": "Writing in for some chizuk, please ❤️\n\nAfter 4 very long and emotionally agonizing years, I’m approaching what should be my final meeting with the Beis Din for Orthodox conversion, BZH. For context, I grew up Jewish. My father is Jewish, and my mother had a Conservative conversion well before I was born. Although I didn’t grow up religious, I always had a strong belief in Hashem and integral sense of Jewish pride. When I was exposed to Torah observant Judaism in my teenage years, I fell in love with it immediately. Of course, as I began to dig deeper, I became plagued by the question of whether I was considered Jewish by Halacha. I have known for a long time that I want to live an observant life, but it took me some time to confront reality and pursue conversion to make it official. To say it’s been difficult is an understatement- logistical challenges aside, the experience has been emotionally excruciating unlike anything else I’ve faced. It was like my identity was stripped from me, and I was suddenly barred entry from a family I had felt a part of my whole life and grown to love dearly.\n\nBH, after a lot of hard personal work, a ton of learning, many logistical life changes, and committing and recommitting to the journey, I’ve reached a place in my observance where I can see the light at the end of the tunnel. However, I’m finding it a huge challenge to be excited about post-conversion life when I feel a lot of resentment toward the religious community, fueled by a build-up of hurtful comments and actions over the years. Where I went to university, I was one of only a handful of frum students, and yet I was consistently discouraged from growing in observance. Sometimes I was even flat-out refused support in tasks such as kashering my kitchen, obtaining mezuzot, etc. by the local shluchim under the premise that my mitzvot don’t yet count, and I wasn’t worth wasting the resources on. More recently, I’ve been working with a tutor who has been incredibly helpful in helping me brush up on the finer details of Halacha. Understandably, he is also critical of intermarriage, but it’s a struggle not to let some of his comments have a negative impact on how I see myself. When asked during a class if all Jews would have a share in the World to Come, this rabbi replied that he doubted most secular Jews would make the cut because so many are intermarried and likely “wouldn’t be willing to do teshuva by renouncing their non-Jewish spouses and kids.” Regardless of the fact that this view does not reflect my own, I left the class in tears over the idea that bringing me into the world was a horrible mistake/sin that my father (who I have an amazing relationship with, thank G-d) should be atoning for. \n\nThus far, I’ve spent my entire life feeling out of place- Jewish enough for the Nazis of the world, too Jewish to fit into the secular world, but not Jewish enough to be fully accepted by the frum world. At the end of the day, I think I’m as much at peace with my situation as I can be. I know I’m not entitled to anybody’s help, and I’m so grateful for the people who have guided and supported me along this journey. While nothing can ever deter me from my goal of completing my conversion and living as a Torah observant Jew, these experiences still linger in the back of my mind and make me a little fearful about fully integrating into the religious world as a Halachic Jew. Part of me mourns the fact that I’ve spent the better part of my young adult life making sacrifices to prove my love for a religion that hasn’t always seemed to love me back, and I want to be able to let go of that sadness. A dip in the Mikveh can remedy the spiritual conflict between my soul and my body, and I know it will be worth it to strengthen my relationship with Hashem and solidify my connection to the Jewish people once and for all. Still, I wish there was a way to get my brain and emotions on the same page. If you’ve made it this far, thank you for reading, and I’d appreciate any words of wisdom you have for me. If nothing else, please let my ramblings serve as a reminder that we need to be kind, not judge one another, and have empathy toward each other’s invisible struggles. ❤️\n\nSide note- I actually tried posting this first anonymously in a Facebook group for religious Jews. I seek support from religious Jews, because that is the group that would best understand what I’m going through. Turns out my post didn’t meet community guidelines because I haven’t finished the conversion process yet and shouldn’t have been in the group in the first place. I think this perfectly encapsulates my struggle 🙃",

      "text": "Let me begin this by giving you some background on who I am: I am 19 years old, born and raised in Norway and with a very Norwegian upbringing and was never circumcised or anything. However, my maternal grandmother is Polish and daughter of two holocaust survivors who lost their faith during the war and decided to hide their jewishness as much as possible so that my grandmother would never have to go through what they went through. I have, as I mentioned never felt that being jewish is a big part of my identity and have always celebrated christian holidays, but I have always known that I am considered jewish by maternal descent. During the past year, I have become very interested in judaism and Israel and have started to study the culture, the religion and learn Hebrew by myself. My question is: If I decide that I want join a jewish community, like my local synagogue and start to follow a jewish lifestyle, will I be accepted as a jew even though neither me, nor my mother, nor my grandmother or anyone else in my family were raised jewish except 2 of my great grandparents? Would be grateful to hear what you have to say.\n\nJust to clarify: I was not raised christian, my family is very secular. However, it is standard to celebrate certain holidays in Norway, not because of faith, but because of the country's tradition.",

      "text": "I (M, 27) have, like many others in this subreddit began reconnecting with the Jewish faith due to the war and the subsequent public reaction to Israel and Jews overall. Last year I started going to my local Chabad house, reconnected with some more observant family members, and even went to Israel to visit my distant cousin. I have also made a big effort to be as observant and stringent as my circumstances allow.\n\nFor the past 3 years I have been in a relationship with a non-Jewish girl. We met on Bumble, and while the relationship isn't perfect, we have grown very close to one another and even discussed the possibility of marriage and children. Knowing how important my faith has recently become to me, 5 months ago she made the decision to convert to Judaism and insists that she had a preexisting curiosity of the religion before we started dating.\n\nReligion aside there are also other issues: Politically, I am right leaning, she's far left. I am pro-Israel, she is neutral but sympathizes with the Palestinians. I work full time but she has been unemployed for 2 years. I drive but she does not. We also live over 30 miles away from one another but still managed to spend weekends together.\n\nI was insistent that if she were to convert that it be an orthodox conversion. This was to ensure the halachic status of any hypothetical children since I can't, and won't, police her level of observance pre or post conversion. But yesterday she admitted that undergoing an orthodox conversion would feel inauthentic since she isn't sure she could commit to that level of observance. While again, the stringency of her observance was not an issue to me, the halachic status of any future children would be in question.\n\nI love her and would never force her into something she doesn't want, or make her live a life she didn't agree with. After a lot of crying and affirmations of our mutual love for one another, we both decided to place our relationship on hold and sort through our current emotions before deciding on a next step.\n\nI am heart broken and unsure what the best path forward is. To begin with, her current financial situation is stunting any forward motion (moving in together, marriage, children, etc). My more observant family members, and my Chabad rabbi have been pressing me to end the relationship for months. And now I either have to compromise on my aspirations of having a halachic Jewish family with this woman, or end what is otherwise the healthiest and most respectful relationship I've been in (religion and finances aside).\n\nI would appreciate any advice, wisdom, or guidance the people of this subreddit can offer. Thank you for reading my post.",

I received a lot of encouragement, and it motivated me to take the next step (again thank you so much!!).\n\nI know that I want to major in history for my bachelor's degree, minor in Jewish studies, and then pursue a master's in journalism.\nUnfortunately, in my country, I have limited options for that path. There are three universities that offer Jewish studies, but two only offer it indirectly, so l was left with one real option.\n\nI was actually quite happy with my choice. The curriculum was exactly what I hoped for, and they offered Hebrew, which I feel is essential, something the other universities didn't provide.\n\nWell, now they've cut a large portion of the university's funding. The university has been at the center of public discourse due to ongoing violent protests certain groups.\nThese protests have led to Jewish students being assaulted, feeling unsafe, and facing open hostility. The university keeps promising to take action, but the hate and violence continue. Many people have been rightfully outraged, demanding the university do more.\n\nAnd now, to make things worse, the only professor teaching Jewish studies has gone into retirement. Due to the budget cuts, there is no replacement lined up, and the university currently doesn't even know if the subject will continue to be taught next semester.\n\nI'm beyond angry. Angry at the hate, the violence, the cowardice of institutions, and the silencing of education. These protests aren't helping anyone. What do they think will happen by beating up Jewish students? Do they really believe that intimidating people who support or want to learn about Judaism will \"help their cause\"? Do they think this spreads their\n\"message\"?\n\nI'm heartbroken and furious. For me, this is just a university program, but for many of you, this is your identity, your safety, your life being directly targeted. I can't even begin to imagine how it must feel. I just want to say how incredibly sorry I am that this is happening. No one should ever have to fear for their safety, especially not for simply having a certain religion.",

I follow Jewish holidays, I speak shitty but light Hebrew, I played dradle with my cousins at the new year that just passed, and I try my best to pray everyday, but some people say I’m not Jewish. \n\nI am what they call a “Patrilineal Jew.” I get my heritage from my dads side of the family, which, to an orthodox Jewish person, would not be considered correct, because my mother was brought up catholic. Most people know, others don’t. When I tell people some just shrug and smile, others ask me lots of questions.\n\nThe reason I felt weird about this was because I was in an RS (religious studies) class last week, and my teacher told me I “wasn’t properly Jewish.” We were talking about traditional Christians and how they expected women to wear headscarves in church, and I brought up that, as Jews, we are encouraged to dress modestly in a synagogue, and she seemed surprised. She asked me about it, and came to the conclusion that, because I don’t go to the synagogue every Saturday, and that, I don’t follow every single rule in the Tanahk, that I’m not Jewish. \n\nI’ve been off sick this week with stupid fucking hand foot and mouth, but all week I’ve been questioning whether she was right. I only just discovered that term. “Patrilineal.” I Googled it for the sake of doing so, and it made me feel better. Being Jewish doesn’t have to be full on, labelling yourself as Jewish, whether you know Hebrew, are black, white, Asian, Scandinavian, whatever, whether you are what society calls a “proper Jew”, or if your like me, who is just accepting and embracing their heritage. \n\nSo, if you are questioning your faith and/or heritage, you can label yourself if you please. You aren’t pretending or appropriating anyone’s religion, because whether you practice it or not, you are what you are. I may not eat kosher all the time (trust me I’m eating a lot of spam and pork belly with spicy noodles once I get my ability to chew back) and I may not go to temple, I may not speak absolutely perfect Hebrew, and I may not have had a Bar mitzvah, but I’m Jewish. And that’s chill. With me anyway.\n\nEdit: Some people need to knock it off in the comments. \n\nMy father is. INFACT, JEWISH. From the age of 8 and UP, I was raised in a Jewish household after I got taken from my mother by CSA. My father is Jewish, but like me, he isn’t as connected to the religion as my grandmother for example. My father and I try to eat kosher, attended holidays and go to the synagogue on certain occasions, which makes us Jewish. And for those who go “but you said he wasn’t!” \n\nThat was what I assumed.\n\nI spoke to my dad and he said “yeah, I’m Jewish. I was brought up to be, I’m just not as associated with it as you Nana.” His words. \n\nAnd as another person pointed out, Jews are lacking in small numbers at the minute anyway, so why turn someone down because of how close they are to their faith.",

      "text": "Hi everyone, I hope nobody thinks this question is rude, because it kind of boils down to why the creator of the universe thinks that a small proportion of the human population is so special to him. There are thousands of religious traditions, many ways that different human societies have formed connections with the divine, and some of them, including Jews, think that they have more of a special connection to the creator than anyone else.\n\nBut why? Why would God be okay with nearly all of his created intelligent species worshipping other gods, or other forms of a monotheistic god, or no one at all? I have tremendous respect for the Jewish religion and ancient heritage that continues to be carried forth into the present day. But I'd like to know more about what Jews think that God might be thinking about the rest of his creation? I know all of us gentiles are supposed to follow the Noahide laws but that's pretty bare bones for forming a connection with God unless we join his ethnoreligion, and how would any other human society in the world find out they were supposed to be following these laws?\n\nHas God just been ignoring the rest of humanity unless they're somehow connected to his chosen people? Is everyone else just very deluded and praying and worshiping to absolutely nothing? Apologies as I am coming from a very naive understanding and was raised a Baptist in the southern US, so I really understand nothing about the mentality of the Jewish people, wherever they may reside in the world.\n\nEdit: Gee whiz that's a lot of comments that came flooding in and I tried to answer as much as I could with it being 2am right now for me. I'll come to this post tomorrow when I have time and keep up the discussion. Everyone is giving very insightful answers and plenty of downvotes so I am thankful for the great response, but I need to come back to this. I hope nobody thought I was being rude or think ill at all of the Jewish faith and people, this is simply an intellectual curiosity that occurred to me a few days ago and really confused me, so I thought why not ask this subreddit?",

The main religions we are learning are Islam, Judaism, Christianity, Buddhism, Sikhism, Hinduism. \n\nDuring the lesson she mentioned that even non-Christians end up celebrating Christmas. It obviously doesn't make sense why you would celebrate something you don't believe in. One interesting thing the teacher said was “people adopt the customs of another religion because of the environment they live in”. \n\nI found that quite sad because it basically means that you believe in God, but you end up deviating so that you can fit in. I am quite shocked that people would do this. I wanted to ask non-Christians if they celebrate Christmas, and if they do then why do they celebrate something that they do not believe in. \n\nSo, I'm asking you, do you celebrate Christmas? If yes, why do you celebrate it?",

He notoriously deminished the relevance of it, while at the same time not showing much energy towards explaining that and more things.\n\nAt the same time when I asked my other friend, of jewish mother and non jewish father, he told me that he was a half Jewish, that all his life shared the religious beliefs of judaism, and even if he followed everything as told by his religion, that because of his blood he was not allowed into some social levels. Which he didnt see as something bad, just something he long ago accepted.\n\nAnd I honestly don't understand it. My main reasoning behind asking them to share things about the unique things of their religion, was to try to mix my knowledge (Cristhian knowledge) with the Jewish, as I understand that both religions are the main reason behind my culture. And it makes me feel dull to only know about kosher food, the different calendar year count, and not much.\n\nMaybe one of judaism pillars is to be secretive, I dont know.\n\nI welcome any comments or suggestions!",

      "text": "Shalom there, r/Judaism! I am a \"cultural\" Catholic, aka my family's Catholic (so, SO Catholic) on both sides but my parents were rebels, lapsed af, and didn't raise me to believe anything in particular. HOWEVER, I was chin-deep in Catholicism all around me growing up, read numerous Bibles I happened upon/were gifted to me by hopeful relatives, went to a Catholic high school (my choice! bad choice!) where we did, uh, THEIR version of \"bible study,\" and would up talking a Hebrew Scriptures (and later, \"New' Testament\") class in college.\n\nANYWAY. The point is, I do not belong to any religion, but I've read the Bible a few fair times, especially the Hebrew Scriptures parts because God knows (besides all the \"begettings\") it's a thousand times more interesting than the total bore that makes up the Christian part.\n\nI'm here with maybe a stupid kind of question, but I'm trying to get an idea of a timeline.\n\nLet's assume, just for this post, that the Scriptures are a book and everyone in them are characters, just so we don't have to worry about historical accuracy and such. It's my understanding that the religion that was Judaism kind of started itself with Abraham (né Abram) and the angel stopping him from sacrificing Isaac. Abraham was going to do this because the voice of God told him to. Correct? Then came Jacob, then came the 12 sons, then eventually came Moses, then came other stuff. Got it.\n\nMy question is, pre-Moses, what rituals were \"Jews\" following and how did they know about the Lord, aka, y'know... I Am Who Am? He didn't really identify Himself as such or really identify Himself at all before Moses, I thought? In general, I ask: how and why did they identify as Jews?\n\nThey knew I Am Who Am existed and was the #1 deity around -- but I don't remember *how* they knew this. Was it just Noah telling his sons, who told their children, and so on, or something? But then everyone would have been Jewish, so that can't be it. Did they have any texts by then? Prophets I'm forgetting?\n\nI know they were already circumcising because that's how the women who discovered bb Moses knew he was Jewish. Where had this rite been decreed? Was it all just the voice of God speaking through prophets and other random guys? (Because lbr, they were all guys.) (EDIT: Ooh, I'm happy to be wrong about this!)\n\nBasically, there is a blank in my memory about how Judaism already existed before Moses got all the juicy deets. Please help the helpless. :(\n\nFUN BONUS FACT(??): I'm actually 1/4th Jewish, ethnically speaking. By most Jewish law my father would just straight-up... be a Jew, because his mom was very, very Jewish. Like, exactly what you would imagine an Ashkenazi Jew to be.\n\nThen how with the Catholic??\n\nWell, once her family reached Murrica (by which I mean New York, ofc), she was orphaned and ended up raised by nuns. Ain't that always the way.",

      "text": "From my Orthodox Jewish learning, Rosh Hashana/Yom Kippur seem to be about admitting that God controls everything and that humanity is virtually powerless. It's not just days of atonement for past sins, it's days of humbling yourself before God and admitting that your entire past, present and future are entirely controlled by Him. It's essentially confirmed in the prayers themselves- almost all of them are about how all powerful God is and how insignificant, petty and borderline irrelevant Man is. We say many times that we are barely worthy of salvation, even though we ask to be saved regardless, and that only by God's decree can we be saved. \n\nHowever whenever I hear a shiur from a rabbi at shul, they make it sound like the holidays are all about self empowerment and that we can do anything we put our minds to, as though we control our destiny. In fact they always stress that despite the sealing of our fates at the end of Yom Kippur, we still have till the end of Succot to change God's mind about His decree and even then God can still change His mind at any time throughout the year because nothing is set in stone. This is a more hopeful and motivating sentiment but it doesn't seem at all in keeping with the prayers, which clearly state that God's decision is final once the book is sealed and that we can't change his decree. What this seems to mean is that whatever God has decided will happen to us no matter what we do. \n\nSo which is the correct interpretation? Are the rabbis just trying to revise the meaning in order to not intimidate people  and possibly scare them away from the religion? But then why do that when the prayers we're currently reading are quite clear in their wording? \n\nEdit: 3 days later and I'm wondering why I bother using this site. My favorite reply was \"that's what rabbis are for\", followed by God knows how many upvotes for that jackass. I fucking hate Reddit.",

At the same time, I have a lot of anxiety and shame around not being able to just wanna follow everything. \nmy dream would be able to enjoy Judaism and be apart of a community without feeling the need to do every little thing. I find keeping Shabbos beautiful but find other halachos feel inaunthentic and archaic. Help.",

However for the last 5 years I have identified as agnostic as I don't feel a connection to god but I do believe he exists.\n\nLast week for a uni class a rabbi explained to us some stuff about Judaism and their customs mainly. Until then I just felt sympathetic but definitely wasn't convinced about rules for women. After class the rabbi came to me and told me God asked him to talk to me, we went to lunch and he told me more about his story and his connection to god.\n\nI really felt moved and I want to learn more and try to find God, I am really open to it. The thing is... I am a tattoo artist and I have many tattoos, I am also in an open relationship with an atheist man. I don't want to jump to any conclusions or to definitely say that everything in my life is a sin because that is what made me leave other religions, I tried to change my views and live a life that made miserable and angry with myself.\n\nWhat do I do?\nHow do I learn more?\nShould I just get the Torah and read through it? Or do I read the \"0ld testam3nt\" in a Bible?\nIs there another way to learn in the mean time before getting to learn with a rabbi?\nCan I have tattoos in Judaism even I had them before?\nCan I still be a tattoo artist?\nCan I have an atheist partner?\nCan I be bisexual?\nDo you all feel that God speaks to you?\n\nAnyways, I am sorry for such a long story and so many questions but I don't know anyone who is Jewish and can help me.",

I hope it makes sense to people in this thread.\n\nI (22F) grew up in a Conservative Jewish household in California and learned from a very young age that we observed a very sacred religion passed down from a long line of Ashkenazim. Even though we were the least observant of my family members (my dad was a convert from Catholicism and the rest of my family is Modern Orthodox or Lubavitch), we still partially kept kosher, observed holidays and rituals, and I learned Hebrew and had a traditional Bat Mitzvah. I went to a Reform synagogue with friends a couple times, but it never resonated with me because it felt too casual compared to what I was used to. \n\nAfter age 15, I no longer believed in God but still felt connected to my heritage, the traditions, and the language. I became disillusioned with my ultra-Orthodox family members who began to shun my parents and I as we became less religious and leaned more heavily into secular society. I also disagreed with the way their daughters were being raised, and it made me uncomfortable to be around them. This only isolated me more from my faith and made me feel resentful that I wasn't \"Jewish\" enough for my family.\n\nFast forward to the current day, I feel very lost about where I fit into the Jewish world. I have more complex views about Israel than other Jews I've met as a young adult, and that makes me feel disconnected to all of the Jewish young adult groups I've tried to get involved with. They seem obsessed with talking about Israel, planning trips there, and saying negative things about others who disagree. I still don't necessarily believe in God, but I deeply believe in the mysticism and tradition that informed my youth and want to start becoming a bit more observant again. I'm horrified to find that I barely remember any Hebrew. I have a deep desire to surround myself with other Jews, as I find a lot of goyim don't understand how I view the world.\n\nI guess I just want advice on where to go from here. Reform synagogues aren't religious/spiritual enough for me even though I guess they align more with my internal beliefs. Jewish young adult groups in my area seem too fixated on political issues rather than community. Does anyone else have this type of mindset about their religion and successfully found a group of likeminded people where they can simply bond over their heritage without judgement/proselytizing/politics? Just going to shul is a good step, but I think I want something more. I just haven't been able to find it. I also want to know if there are other young Jews who feel this way.",

However, my ability to converse helpfully runs a little short once he has raised questions about the Talmud (especially when it comes to sections with some quite confronting material that he was told about by others) and I want to be able to discuss the Talmud with at least some basic understanding of its appropriate context in jewish belief and thought.\n\nMy present understanding is that the Talmud is essentially a record of learned opinions and debates among rabbis, concerning the Law, Writings, Prophets and interpretation. Some sections that I have seen contain contradicting opinions on the same topics (I think a debate on divorce comes to mind) from different rabbis, so my impression is that while the Talmud would be treated as informative, not every opinion expressed therein would be authoritative?\n\nIs my impression correct? What role does the Talmud play in terms of authority in jewish thought? Are there other key facets that I am missing as to how the Talmud should be read?\n\nWhile I am not jewish, I do not wish to misrepresent judaism or depict it in bad faith.",

My mom and I were technically raised Catholic like everyone else, even if we aren’t practicing and I personally never really connected with our religious customs. I do have an Italian Catholic side of the family and I think my dad’s Hungarian mother and uncles were also Catholic, so Catholicism runs well into my dad’s side anyway. \n\nMy maternal grandma’s Polish Jewish grandmother came to the States sometime after WWI before WWII, but due to stigma and fearing for their livelihoods, she decided to raise her children and grandchildren (when she eventually adopted them, long story) Catholic to hide their cultural identity. Then my grandma raised her daughters as Catholic (my mom & aunt) before eventually telling them down the line of the secret, and her sisters and brothers lived as Catholic hiding the family secret. My grandma insisted my mom have me baptized at birth to solidify it on her end, but she never ended up baptizing my little brother.\n\nThis is obviously one of the wildest things I’ve ever been told in my entire life. My mom felt okay with mentioning it to me because our family directly affected by the secret are all passed away since last year, so it wouldn’t be able to hurt them. I’m not sure what to do with this information, I just feel confused, shocked, and am looking at my family in a completely new context I never expected. I’m thinking of going into deeper research at least to learn of the things my family lost, I’ve already started to some degree actually because I have a Hungarian Jewish main character for a comic I’m developing. Otherwise I’m not sure what else I should do and I know my family would rather not focus on it out of respect for my grandma’s family. \n\nTangentially related, I’ve noticed as you become an adult your parents will drop the most life-changing family lore bombs on you at the most random times and not bat an eye. And no, I do not talk to my mom’s half brother these days and due to outstanding family drama, we haven’t gone to many family dinners the past few years.",

      "text": "Tale as old as time...I (F23) broke up with my non-Jewish boyfriend (M25) about a year ago because I was struggling the fact that he wasn't Jewish. I am very dedicated to my Judaism (was considering going to rabbinical college, attend shul regularly, keep kosher etc) and both of us knew this going into it. He was open and curious about my religion and recognized it's importance to me. I was 18 when we started dating and I thought I had lots of time to figure out the Jewish thing, and also thought that maybe it would be okay so long as we raised the kids Jewish, but eventually I realized that I really wanted a Jewish partner. The thing is I don't know what that means, because lots of Jewish men are not the kind of Jewish partner I want... and he is everything I do want (intellectual, dorky, kind, gentle, outdoorsy, (and not to mention absolutely gorgeous)). I've always had this image of coming home on a shabbat to see my husband sprawled out the sofa with some religious book in hand... and he would do that, just maybe not with a religious book.\n\nThe thing is is that he was always so interested in my Judaism and even said that he might consider switching over to Judaism (trying to avoid the C  word because otherwise my post will get moved to a different category) as he really likes the ritual, familial, philosophical parts of the religion.  After a year, where I have talked to lots of other Jews I'm feeling like there are no Jewish guys out there who are nearly as serious or interested in their Judaism as he was interested and serious about my identity. I also feel like I didn't give him enough of a chance to take part in Jewish culture/ religion (I didn't take him to shul that often or holidays etc) and I'm really regretting that. I can't believe I'm still hung up on him but he is genuinely the most perfect guy out there (and I'm really picky). We were perfectly matched in terms of other life values and goals. I don't know what my question is... just looking for general advice because I'm really broken up about this and miss him so much. Shavua Tov!\n\nEdit: I just want to mention that I live in Canada! We have some cities with kinda big Jewish communities (Toronto, Montreal) but generally small population overall. Depending on the law school I get into, I will hopefully be living in one of these areas but who knows!). Also, he said he MIGHT be interested in becoming Jewish, but no guarantee. He wants to do it for himself, not for me (which obviously I want too! I think that being Jewish requires too many sacrifices (eg. sending my kids to Jewish day school even if it means prioritizing money in very different ways) for someone to do it just for love)",

Most will call to make a reservation and I can often times recognise the caller by their accent and/or surname as Jewish.\n\nI know our listing well and many times I need to verify that the caller is indeed Jewish because I know certain apartments won't be suitable for them because they have electricity doors or automatic lights, which would essentially trap the guests indoors during the Shabbat.\n\nHow do I formulate the question \"are you Jewish?\" in a polite/articulate way? Currently, I ask if I am correct at guessing they might be Jewish by their Hebrew accent and if so do they follow the Shabbat rules. I obviously don't care about the guests religion but have to ask to be sure the place they might spend their holidays in will fulfill their needs as best as possible.",

He argues that we're an ancient people, and not just a religion or ethnicity - we may be different from one another but we all belong to the same tribe.\n\nAs a Jewish people we are usually seperated from each other by the language of our host country. For example, most of us here are North American or British and cannot speak easily to the Jews who live in say France or Russia, etc. In English countries, most secular Jews and Haredi Jews don't have much interaction (sometimes ultra-orthodox only speak Yiddish).\n\nIt's a shame that casual Hebrew isn't more readily taught and practiced throughout the Jewish world everywhere. By adopting the language of our host nations in order to fit in it comes at the expense of our ancestoral language, we risk being gradually diluted away. It's the slow way of killing off Judaism - it's no coincidence that Hebrew is now being labelled a \"colonizer language\" by the Melon Mafia in order to try distance Jews from our identity.\n\nSo I propose that world wide we could start a movement to get every Jew who has interest to a basic conversational level of Hebrew. The idea is to easily communicate amongst us all, keeping the lines open and the links to the homeland alive.",

      "text": "I’m forty three years old. When I was thirty I was having a talk with my stepfather about how a lot of people’s last names in western society have something to do with their work. I got curious and looked up my last name. Druck. “Printer,” it said. And then, “Ashkenazi Jewish origin. That was the part that floored me. I was raised Mormon. Around seventeen or eighteen years old, I kinda started to gather that it was all untrue. They’re a very devout group, but any real looking into it and it’s very obvious it’s completely made up. Because it was my whole, sincere belief system though, and it was suddenly and jarringly found out to be a lie, it really pulled the rug out from underneath me. If that was made up, anything else could just as easily be made up. So I planted myself firmly agnostic for the next several years. I learned a lot about all kinds of religions, but like I said, who knows if they’re real. So this is the point that I was in that day talking with my stepfather. I called my dad and asked him, \n“Dad? Is grandpa’s side of the family Jewish?” \n“Well, yeah.” \n“Why is this the first I’m learning of it?”\n“Huh… I dunno.”\nWe grew up knowing everything about the Spanish side of the family. I don’t know if it was because of the Mormon thing or what. The strange thing is, throughout my entire life Judaism kept popping up in odd ways. The majority of my heroes or historic figures or celebrities would turn out to be Jewish. My favorite novel was based around Jewish history in Israel…just a lot of small nods in that direction. Or even growing up, I feel like Christians are either subtly hostile towards the Jewish faith, or completely oblivious and uninterested in it. Even when I was growing up in church, I had an innate reverence about it, and it bothered me that no one seemed to know anything about Judaism in a religion that’s an offshoot. You’d think that if someone was a Christian they’d HAVE to believe and view things in the Torah the way they’re supposed to. Spoiler alert, they have no idea. Haha So I was always trying to learn the Torah perspective even then, because I figured it would have to be the correct view. Granted, as a kid, I didn’t learn much about it. Fast forward to last year, and I came across, at first a video by Rabbi Benjamin Blech. Keep in mind, at this point I don’t believe in anything at all. That video changed my life. I watched it probably ten times in a few days. Then I started watching more and more different rabbi’s videos. I started reading the Torah. I read some books on Chassidus, Judaism in general, watched many, many videos of the Rebbe. It was like I was learning and hearing things I already knew inside to be true. Even though I didn’t know most of those things really yet at all. I live in the middle of Missouri, so there’s not many schuls around, but I’m searching. I have never felt like I had any real purpose to my life, but the best way to describe the feeling is like if I had a compass that was spinning wildly and as soon as I started learning…IMMEDIATELY…the needle stopped hard and fast in one direction. I went from not really having prayed in decades to praying multiple times a day overnight. Baruch Hashem. My family is coming back home.",

I was finally going to be somewhere with people who had also experienced the last 16 months of war and an entire lifetime of being a Jew.\n\nI don't think I \"romanticized\" the trip. I knew I wasn't going to get along with everyone (Jewish teenagers are still teenagers) but I thought that out of the 4000 attendees I might finally find someone to discuss all these big things that are happening and big ideas I have about the war and Israel and Jewish identity and religion. Or even just one person who would ask me \"hey! What's your name!\"\nI love learning about people particularly peoples Jewish life experience and the concept of getting to connect with people from 50 countries was something I was looking forward to. \n\nNone of that happened. I didn't have a conversation with anyone but my hosts (who well interesting were adults in their 30s and not new friends my age) no one asked for my name (one of the chaperones asked for my number so I could send her the pictures I took on my film camera after I'd developed then she literally named the contact \"CTeen Film Girl\"). \n\nI was super excited to visit the Ohel both because it combines two of my life long obsessions (graves and religious rituals) and because I hoped to find some spiritual clarity and answers to where my future in Judaism lies. I got there I felt confused by the instructions. Guilty for both not knowing what to do and doing it wrong. When we went inside people were reading from prayer books. I didn't know what they were reading even if I did I wouldn't be able to read it. I didn't even read my letter like I was supposed to I just tore it, watched it fall into the piles of letters written by better more deserving people and left.\n\nAt the end of the event I stood in Time Square surrounded by people who are supposed to be my \"Jewish brothers and sisters\" watching them be together and proud and I felt like an intruder.\n\nI'm not sure I'm able to make friends anymore. I'm not sure if I can believe in G-d or mitzvos when I'm so awful. I don't even know if I'm worthy of living",

I loved learning about Rabbi Akiva and the water penetrating stone.\n\nWomen & men sitting separate from each other so they may focus on prayer without possible sexual interference also makes sense.\n\nWhile I haven't read all of the laws of Moses, the ones I've heard so far also make practical sense (not eating certain animals, being strict about a day of rest every week, not gossiping, the entirety of the Ten Commandments.)\n\nI do have a small doubt, though. I am not a historian, but I have heard claims that the Torah has multiple authors. I have also heard claims towards the opposite. There are minds with great critical thinking power (like Ben Shapiro) who are Orthodox. I believe his denomination is called Modern Orthodoxy.\n\nI also visited a conservative synagogue once, but did not have as positive of an experience as with the Chabad. Then again, I visited on a non service day and there was auctioning happening in the building, which seemed wrong (maybe I didn't fully understand what was going on.)\n\nI would like to learn & involve myself more to see if this spiritual path is right for me. What would be logical next steps? Should I explore services with different denominations? Perhaps email my local Chabad to study under their Rabbi? Learn Hebrew?\n\nI have the Sefaria app and it seems that the Torah is a little different from the Biblical Old Testament. True?\n\nMaybe there's a book one can recommend or should I go straight into reading the written & oral Torahs?\n\nThank you.\n\nEDIT: Another thing I really like is the idea of mitzvahs: that actions, and not just begging for forgiveness, is what makes us better humans.",

During that conversation, a friend of my friend jumped in.  She identifies as Noahide.  She encouraged me to \"take off my church spectacles\" and \"start at the beginning, the beginning of the Scriptures, in Genesis, first word.\"    \n  \nI think understand what she means.  Our two religions don't just interpret the Hebrew Bible differently, but we make different textual and translation choices leading to a radically different paradigm.  Even the way we order the books makes a difference.  One of the reasons I interact with my friend (the OP of that conversation) is because I like to learn what those differences are.    \n  \nBut her suggestion leaves me with a bigger question.  If I \"take off my church spectacles,\" I don't really have a \\*reason\\* to read the Tanakh at all!  So this is what I asked her, which is also what I'd like to ask anyone here:\n\n\"I agree that's an important process. Can I ask you \\*why\\* the Tanakh is where a person should start in order to understand G-d? Why the Tanakh and not, say, the Quran or the Bhagavad Gita or the Tao Te Ching? There are obviously a lot of religions in the world, and many of them have scriptures. Why read the Hebrew Scriptures to learn about G-d rather than any of those?\"\n\nShe must have gotten busy because she didn't respond.  I'd like to ask here.  I'm a G-d-fearing gentile who really wants to know and please my Creator.  Why would the Hebrew Bible be a good place for me to start?\n\nI'll put the same question another way.  If a Jewish young man or woman is questioning their faith and asks, \"How do we know that the Torah is really the Word of G-d?  How do we know that the Prophets and the Writings were really written under divine inspiration?\" what is the Jewish answer?\n\nThanks for reading!  Looking forward to hearing from you.",

I have some extended family here who are still practising Jews, but I don't know them very well. I feel an affinity with Jewish culture, but I am somewhat ignorant about the religion itself.\n\nI would like to learn more about Judaism and relevant history etc. What is a good book to start with?\n\nMany thanks.",

I regret having sinned all my life worshipping to false gods but now I have turned my face to the God, will I be accepted by the God and by the Jewish community? I try my best to spare my time from a studious life for God and reading the Tanakh and do regular prayers, I ask for forgiveness to the Lord everyday for I have sinned for so many years, I try my best to follow the ten commandments.\nIt's not easy following Judaism here, it's a minority beyond saving, only about 4-5k, barely a few synagogues over such a vast land, and I've none in access, can I still be a believer?

I.e quick burial. Would it be best to wait until the burial is completed and when the Shiva services start? Or would it be ok to go before the burial.\n\nAlso as far as I understand flowers are probably not the best thing to give? Is there anything else apart from a card which may be appropriate or is flowers ok?\n\nEdit: thank you all for your advice and suggestions. Pm the note given it says that shiva services are from tomorrow at 8pm each night. So will head over then",

As these religions all point to that overarching deity, that monotheistic creator of all things. \n\nWhat are your takes on this? But if im honest, all these names for god Allah Jehovah and Hashem envoke slightly different images, intuitions and beliefs. \n\nWell its an interesting discussion nontheless. For example, christians and jews share the Tanakh, all three religions have similar moral teachings, prophets and traditions. We can look to similar stories between all these religions such the creation story, Adam and Eve, and Cain and Abel",

Especially the Christians (and funnily, atheists) would like an image of more loving (less \"cruel\") God (as Jesus in the New Testament), so to them this can lead to a conclusion that the G-d from Torah is actually based on a more ancient one (with the attributes of war, storms etc).\n\nDo you think that the ancient tribes simply did not have a full understanding/correct understanding of the concept of G-d? Or rather that G-d revealed Himself gradually to humankind? I've been trying not to dwell much on this but I keep thinking about it. Is there something I am maybe missing?",

      "text": "I know this is kind of a dumb question for this subreddit, but I’m scared to ask my rabbi for some reason. Censoring the word c nvert so that the sub doesn’t think I’m asking about c nversion.\n\nI started dating a Jewish boy 2 years ago, and since before I started dating him I was always curious about his religion. The first time I ever saw him was when he was talking to some other people about Judaism, and I was immediately intrigued. I ended up learning Hebrew and researching Judaism a lot because of him, and when I was reading Torah and stuff I felt this deep connection to Judaism, and after a lot of consideration I decided that I wanted to c nvert. I didn’t tell him this because I didn’t want him to think he was the reason why, and he was fine with dating a gentile—I was gonna tell him eventually, but I never did before he lost interest in me and broke up with me. \n\nThe story of Mount Sinai resonated deeply with me since I first heard it, and when I first found out early on that c nverts/future c nverts have always had Jewish souls, it made things make a lot of sense for me, and there was a period of time where I didn’t have any doubt in my mind that I had a Jewish soul. However, after the breakup, I was talking about my story regarding how I discovered Judaism, and someone (who was Jewish I should add) made a comment about how the only reason I’m c nverting to Judaism is because I dated a jew. At the time I thought that was stupid, I was sure I was over him (I think I was at the time), plus I’d dated several other people since him, but as time passed I’ve started to be scared they were right. \n\nCurrently, at least, I miss said ex. I don’t know if I ever got over them or if I was just in denial for a while, but he was the only person I dated who treated me well, and though I miss all of my exes from time to time, he’s the one I miss most. I’m wondering if I actually have a Jewish soul or if the person who said I’m only c nverting because of my ex is right—I’m wondering if subconsciously the reason I’ve been continuing to learn about Judaism and have started the c nversion process is because of him. I really hope it’s not, I love Judaism and being involved with it, but I’m worried. Although it’s rare, sometimes I find myself thinking about my ex when I’m thinking about Jewish stuff—for example, I was reading a book about Judaism recently, and the section about marriage made me think of him. \n\nAlso, when I first met my rabbi and was talking to him about Judaism, it felt like a test to see if I was worthy of c nverting. He told me it wasn’t, but it still felt that way, and he pointed out that I was more comfortable talking to him about bugs (I’m obsessed with bugs) than religion. I don’t know if that means anything. He asked me questions about how I became a prospective c nvert and stuff, and my answers didn’t feel good enough.\n\nHow do I tell if I really do have a Jewish soul or if I’m just hung up on my ex?",

So in more detail:\n \nFrom what I know, Judaism doesn't rely on Proselytization as it's an ethnoreligion, and to receive afterlife, one doesn't have to be Jewish, rather to follow the laws of Noah, which from what I know, are much less strict than the laws of Judaism. \n\nIn this case, if God is the creator of everything, and Jews are the only people who have a covenant with him, doesn't this make it more difficult for Jews to be granted an afterlife? Does this mean Jewish people are at a disadvantage? Is there much said in the Tanakh about the afterlife? (Are the accounts of the Talmud on this matter considered canonical since it was added after the age of the prophets?). And finally, is the afterlife different from: 1. What non-Jews receive? 2. Granted to those before Noah?.",

      "text": "Hi everyone, sorry for the morose topic. I just wanted to share my experience in case any other Jewish women have been experiencing loss and feeling as alone as I did. In February, my baby passed (I was pregnant and had a “missed” miscarriage, meaning my body didn’t “know”). Following, I’ve had numerous medical issues and surgeries. The grief and trauma was amplified through the long healing process. My family has continued to have babies, I felt left behind and forgotten by life. I found a Jewish therapist in the orthodox circle, and I’ve reconnected much more with faith. I’ve found renewed meaning in Av Harachamim. \n\nI’m a scientist, I have a PhD in physics, and a research background. Despite what many assume, I never found being a scientist at odds with being religious. On the contrary, being Jewish invites and encourages questioning all, much the same as being a scientist. When my loss first happened, I jumped into research mode, looking for logic or reason. As time went on, I’ve learned H*shem doesn’t always reveal his plans or reasons to us. It’s okay to be mad, confused by, or resentful of his plans in the moment. It’s okay to feel hurt and pained, but to recognize H*shem weeps with us, and draws closest to the broken hearted. \n\nAnyway, I felt very alone in my grieving. 25% of all pregnancies end in miscarriage in the first trimester. Due to the pain and stigma around the topic though, most women never talk about it. As a Jewish woman, my heart felt ripped from my chest that I lost this mitzvah and my body hasn’t bounced back yet. I come from a huge family and thought I was the only one who’d experienced this. I want you all to know, if you’re going through this, you’re not alone. Whether you find comfort in H*shem, in community, or in introspection, know you aren’t going through this alone. We can use this space to perform the mitzvah of connection, through grief, to discuss what isn’t easy but is heartbreakingly common. \n\nEdit: I want to include husbands (partners) of those who’ve experienced loss. I realize that pregnancy loss affects the fathers as well. This should be a space for anyone who has been affected to share their experience.",

      "text": "So I don't practice judaism, but I've been wondering for a while if it is possible to be an observant jew and still be an avid football fan. I ask that because of 2 comandments: Don't make idols to worship and Keep the shabbat. Latin Americans and Europeans know right how supporting a football club works. It's almost a religion and in many aspects it mimics religious idolatry, specially when it comes to the club's symbols, but as extreme this sometimes can get it lacks any actual holy conotation and many times coexists with an actual religion people practice alongside their football \"idolatry\". Also many matches are played on saturdays and for my understanding watching TV on shabbat is forbidden, so I guess there would be no ways to faithfully watch every single match of your club...? \n\nThat's the synthesis of my doubt and I wish to know from you guys if it is indeed impossible to conciliate both things or if there's a way to make it work without necessarily losing the emotional and passionate side football has, because unfortunately my only observant jewish relative doesn't know the answer.",

      "text": "Hello all! Sorry to be a bother, and hopefully you are having a pleasant day. I am not Jewish, but my father was (he didn't practice), and of late I've been curious about Jewish tradition, culture, and theology. \n\nI generally had an idea of what I thought Jews believed, but of late I've been exposed to some Jewish traditions/expressions that have challenged that view. I have a million questions, but for the sake of brevity I'll reduce them to a few main categories :)\n\n1. **The Jewish Conception of God:** It is my understanding that Judaism is a monotheistic religion, believing in a creator deity, sustainer of all things, who has made a covenant with the Jewish people. However, I have heard some Jews, especially of the Reform variety, describe God in a much more pantheistic sense, i.e. God is present in all things, as he is the very fabric of being itself, rather than something above/separate from it. I'm curious which is generally held, if there is a consensus, and where the origin of this disagreement comes from. \n2. **The ethnocultural element**: Of course, Judaism is an ethnocultural faith, but the idea of the \"Chosen People\" is something I have seen disagreement on. Some sources claim that the covenant makes the Jewish people \"different\", but by no means better than anyone else. Others, a minority I'm guessing, seem to view it as giving Jews a higher status than others. How is this status generally viewed in the faith, and why would God only want one ethnocultural group to follow him? I know that traditionally Jews aren't supposed to encourage conversion, for instance. \n3. **The Scriptures v.s. Rabbinic interpretation**: I'm a tad confused as to the disagreements over the Torah/Jewish law in general. Some Jews seem to view the law as binding and unchanging, with the Law of Moses being the same law for Jews today. Others seem view the law as binding, but also adaptable to rabbinic rulings over time. I've even some say that the ethics of Judaism is what truly matters, rather than tradition and ritual. I guess I'm uncertain as to who/what has \"authority\" in Judaism (save God, of course), and how Jews hash out strong disagreements amongst Rabbis?\n\nThank you for humoring my questions, and I deeply apologize if I have been ignorant or uneducated in these questions. I hope to learn more, and I would sincerely like to learn more about my family's past and traditions, even as most of that side of my family has passed on.\n\nHave a wonderful day :)",

I grew up with my grandfather that was a Rabbi but as I grew older and moved a lot from countries I found it really hard to establish a sense of community and closeness with the faith. I also live in PR and there's a really small community of Jews comoared to places such as NYC and such. For this reason I've been holding back from even going to a Synagogue. Being jewish has been a big part of my identity because I truly believe in the torah but I honestly feel like im not \"Jewish enough\". It's mostly due because I take more after my father and even when always having my star of David people never believe me. My mom also was very ashamed of being Jewish. She never taught us traditions, cultural norms or hebrew. I dont really balme her since here in PR people are really aggressive towards those who do not practice Christianity but I would've loved to learn basic things like Challah or so. \n\nI mostly need advice on where to start connecting with judaism again since I've been so detached from it. Im also currently searching for synagogue recommendations near my area and I've been trying to pick up hebrew. I would appreciate any podcast or videos regarding the faith.",

I grew up in non denominational Christian homeschool family, so I was a die hard Christian from a young age, however I fell out of the faith around 22 and became agnostic. \n\nSkip to fall 2024, I went back to school using my GI bill I got from the military. I was on campus one day and while walking from class a random rabbi in a heavy Israeli accent yelled at me “young man!” I turned and said “yes?” And he immediately asked me “are you maybe Jewish?”\n\nHe was set up in a tent, I walked over an talked to him and I responded “my mom told me her grandma on her mothers side was Jewish (South African Dutch Jewish)” and he responded “then YOU are a Jew, now tell me have you had your bar mitzvah yet?” I told him no and pulled out the Tefillin, I repeated a few prayers and he gave me one right then and there!\n\nEver since then I’ve attended Shabbat every Friday night at the Jewish club on campus and I love it so much. I really have found a sense of community I have never had before. Something just feels right about it. I’m still learning though.\n\nAnyway, I’m learning all this about myself and exploring it! Just wanted to share where I’m at and say hello!",

      "title": "My Grandfather Embellished His Holocaust Survival Story, so I Found Out What Really Happened.",
      "text": "My grandfather was a relatively prominent Holocaust speaker. He was indeed a child survivor, but many of the stories he told in schools and on film were made up. \n\nHe described being on a train to a concentration camp when a bomb hit the car he was in, and he was spared without a scratch. But I could never find any record of the transport. He claimed he joined the partisans at age ten, ate rodents while patrolling the Alps, and once shot a Nazi in the head. But it’s hard to imagine his rescuers letting him leave his hiding places during the war.\n\nI have empathy for the effects of childhood trauma—effects my grandfather spoke openly about in interviews. But I had the sense that he wanted to make himself the hero in a story where he was really a little boy in hiding. The embellishments were unnecessary, though. After all, no embellishment is needed to convey the horrors to Nazi Germany.\n\nI’m an investigative journalist. So when my grandfather died last year, I went on a journey to figure out what had really happened to my family during the Holocaust. I searched through thousands of pages of wartime documents, listened to hundreds of hours of testimonies from survivors who had crossed paths with my family, and traveled to Belgium, France, Switzerland, Italy, and Poland. I found out that the true hero of the story was my great-grandmother, whose account was deliberately suppressed by my grandfather. It wasn't a bomb that hit my grandfather's train. My great-grandmother took him in one arm and his sister in the other and jumped off a moving train to save their lives. There were countless other brave things she did to keep her children alive while her husband was in Auschwitz and various other camps.\n\nI wrote about all this in a long feature published in *Mountain Gazette* a few months ago. I’m now re-publishing the story as a short e-book called [*Stolen Headstones*](https://books2read.com/stolenheadstones). Since writing this story, I’ve heard from other descendants of Holocaust survivors who also want to research their family history and retrace it across Europe. I’m happy to answer any questions about my journey, my reporting process, or anything else from my book. Ask me anything. I hope this thread will lead to some interesting discussions.\n\n\\*Edited to fix link\n\n\\*Edit 2: Wow! Thanks for all the discussion. Some great questions. Just adding a quick note here because a few people have asked whether this story could be weaponized against us since antisemitism and Holocaust denial are already on the rise. Increasing antisemitism and Holocaust denial are exactly why I wrote it, and I make that very clear in the book. Facts matter. The facts of the Holocaust *really* matter. Survivor stories are important and we need to get them right. My editors and I talked about this concern, and we decided that the net good it could have for Holocaust education was greater than the potential for the story to be interpreted in bad faith. I think most people who read it will ultimately agree.",

Our elders would tell us of how wealthy and respected we once were, naming even the monarchs under which we allegedly served, which I never thought much of, thinking it was part fantasy and part exaggeration, since our family is now tiny and barely getting by.\n\nWe never talked about how and when it was all lost, but some time down the line they took a last name that roughly translates into English as \"that which hides/conceals self\". Anything before that no longer exists in official records (trust me, I checked). It was only recently that I started remembering how weird all of this were, and starting questioning around the family, when it was nonchalantly dropped onto me that we are Sephardic in origin.\n\nSuddenly it all clicked. Grandma wasn't actually making stuff up for fun, all of that was very much based on reality. Their literal surname was right there. We just went through what many Jews once did, lost it all, adopted local faith and identity, and kept on going.\n\nOurs is a very matriarchal family and I can confirm with official records that I come from the self hiding branch, though I can't say for sure if I have an unbroken Jewish mother link. I would very much like to go through the conversion just to be safe.\n\nHowever, I can't find anyone. I emailed both the local Rabbinate and the biggest synagogue in my city, briefly explaining my situation, but didn't get a reply. It's not surprising that the local Jews keep to themselves, but I have no idea what I'm supposed to do to get their attention.\n\nI don't even care about everything else we lost. I just want to reclaim the Jewish identity and community. Please help me.",

      "text": "Edit: u/nu_lets_learn answered the question [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Judaism/comments/1mksoa5/comment/n7lw0cz/), you can all stop commenting I got the information I needed, thank you!\n\nTLDR: knowing little about Christmas, I'm wondering what parts are and (more importantly, are not) considered avodah zarah or unavoidably taboo\n\nStory time, last year my fiance and I were able to find a synagogue willing to do a lesbian wedding, but not one willing to do a lesbian *and* interfaith wedding, so, with her being both secular but searching for spirituality at the time, it seemed to her like a great idea to join the tribe. About half a year into the process though it resulted instead in her reconnecting with the faith of her childhood and discovering that it was actually important to her. Idk the Rabbi did a bad job I guess /s. Despite this derailing our marriage plans I am still really happy to see how happy and fulfilled she's been having found a community and a tradition, even if it's not my own.\n\nWell, as I start shopping around for Rosh Hashanah and Sukkot decorations I am a little pained imagining both options for how we could approach her holidays. The idea that we only decorate for the holidays that matter to me just does not seem right, and at the same time I am deeply uncomfortable imagining my house decked out in the trappings of Christianity for, you know, the myriad of historical and cultural baggage that would bring. My Judaism is obviously very important to me and I want to both respect her and to respect myself and I am not sure how to stick that landing.\n\nDespite not being Jewish she still works to keep the kitchen kosher, she shabbos-proofs the house every Friday so that during the winter I'm able to head straight from work to shul, and she's lost friends over Israel just as many of us have, ect. She invests a lot of consideration into building a Jewish home and life with me because she knows how much that matters to me, she very much so is a fellow traveler, so I want to respect that effort by being as flexible as I can. I think knowing the floor (what is absolutely not permitted) will help frame that conversation and give me a place to start, but I've already asked my Rabbi 1,000 kashrus questions this week so can't bother them with another question lol, so hopefully Rav Reddit can help instead.",

My husband was raised in Reform Judaism. I am not ethnically Jewish nor do I practice Judaism. We were married by my Episcopalian rector and a reconstructionist rabbi who co-officiated. My toddler was baptized Christian and I am raising her in a Protestant denomination. I/we go to church 2-3x a month with her and I actively do Christian formation/Bible study at home with her. We celebrate Christian holidays religiously - not secularly. Before children, we participated in some of my husband’s family holidays,  Passover, Rosh Hashanah, Hanukkah, and go occasionally to break fast at Yom Kippur. I did not participate, just observed and sat at the table. Since my children are Christians with Jewish heritage, will they be accepted by their Jewish peers in the public school in our area? Will they be treated differently by them or teased? Are they ‘allowed’ to participate in the Jewish rituals at these holidays, like saying the blessing, lighting a menorah, or reading from a Haggadah at Passover with their grandparents, or is this not possible in Jewish tradition since they are being raised in the christian faith? I’m very confused what is acceptable practice for children with Jewish patrilineal lineage. TIA for your insight.",

      "title": "Getting married and building a Jewish home when you’re aromantic and asexual",
      "text": "Shavua Tov everyone,\n\nI’m posting here because I’m struggling with a personal situation that raises many questions for me, both halachically and emotionally. I’m 28 years old, fully observant, and I’ve always wanted to build a Jewish home in line with the Torah and our values. Honestly, I feel a bit ashamed to talk about something so personal with those close to me, which is why I’d rather share it “anonymously” here on Reddit.\n\nI am aromantic and asexual, also called “aro-ace”. To explain what that means:\n- I have never once in my life felt romantic attraction toward a woman (or even a man).\n- I have also never felt sexual attraction toward a woman.\n\nEven though I deeply respect marriage and family in the framework of halacha, I have never felt a natural urge or desire to get married for romantic or sexual reasons. I am fully shomer Shabbat, only eat kosher, and strictly observe the laws of family purity, including niddah and shomer negiah. I daven with a minyan three times a day, every single day. I also study Torah regularly, at least three times a week.\n\nI realized during my teenage years that I was aromantic and asexual. Despite my sincere efforts over the years to develop attraction toward women—through dating, reading, and lots of self-reflection—nothing has ever changed. Apart from that, I feel fulfilled: I’m in good health, I have a stable and meaningful job that I really enjoy, I bought my apartment, I love my neighborhood, I have close friends, I travel regularly, and I feel that I’ve achieved a real sense of stability and purpose.\n\nI want to emphasize that I’ve done my best to participate in the normal shidduch process expected in the Orthodox community. I’ve been on around fifteen shidduchim over the years. On paper, many of the girls matched what I was looking for: religious, serious, with good middot, etc. But each time, I would quickly lose interest in being around them, and I never felt any emotional connection or physical attraction.\n\nTwo years ago, due to family and social pressure, I went through with a shidduch all the way to engagement (betrothal). I genuinely tried to make the relationship work. We spent a lot of time together, and I put in a lot of effort to make her feel valued. But despite all that, I couldn’t feel any attraction toward her. Eventually, she herself realized that something was off—she could tell that I couldn’t connect to her in a genuine, affectionate way. In the end, we broke it off. Adding to this pressure is the fact that both of my younger brothers are already married and each has two children.\n\nNow I find myself wondering what my place is in this area of Jewish life: I know that the mitzvah of pru u’rvu, to marry and have children, is a fundamental obligation (Shulchan Aruch Even HaEzer 1:1). I also know that a husband has obligations toward his wife, including the mitzvah of onah (Even HaEzer 76), to provide emotional and physical intimacy.\n\nMy questions are:\n- Am I still obligated to get married even though I know I will not feel any romantic or sexual attraction, and that this could make married life very challenging?\n- Would it be honest toward a future wife to enter such a marriage knowing in advance that I likely won’t be able to give her the emotional and physical connection she deserves?\n- Does halacha recognize that a marriage like this might be unfair and painful for the wife?\n- Are there any poskim or halachic sources that address a situation like mine, where the mitzvah of pru u’rvu is at odds with my personal psychological and emotional reality?\n\nI truly want to remain faithful to halacha and build a genuine Jewish home while also being honest and respectful toward myself and any future kallah. I don’t want to mislead anyone or cause a woman pain by giving her false expectations.\n\nIf anyone has sources, advice, or personal experiences to share, I would be very grateful. I am looking for clarity and guidance.\n\nThank you very much for your help.",

What I mean with modern worship music is the equivalent to Christian worship music, think Hillsong church songs and the pop-y music they sing at those ‘cool’ Sunday services of the big free churches that a lot of young people go to and which are becoming more popular, also on social media. \n\nIt seems like the music is a great way to make the faith / belief more accessible for the youth and being able to identify more with it. Conscious that this style of music / services of these churches is not possible for Shabbat services but it seems that these modern worship song are also popular outside of the services. \n\nI know there is ‘Ruach’ music that is played and danced to at Simchas or summer camps but I feel like that you don’t really listen to those on a daily basis to connect with Hashem? Maybe because they’re also all in Hebrew and not everyone can understand? That’s at least my assumption, correct me if I’m wrong. \n\n2. Can we as Jews ‘utilise’ Christian worship songs to connect with Hashem? Particularly if they don’t explicitly mention J*sus or other Christian beliefs? A good example is this worship song which is about J*sus but doesn’t mention it directly and can only be inferred (mostly from context from the artists background)  https://genius.com/Alex-yurkiv-take-me-to-the-river-i-will-swim-lyric\n\nI know I can technically do whatever I want to connect with Hashem but curious for a halachic or kabalistic perspective on this. \n\nLong story short, I just wish there would be more modern Jewish worship music like the Christian alike lol (if you know some, please let me know!)",

The problem I have is he keeps asking me if I \"would like to learn about Jesus.\" Can anybody help me figure out a kind and respectful way to tell him that I'm confident in my faith and know about Jesus. \n\nIf this doesnt make sense I get it, it's a weird situation. \n\nThanks",

      "text": "I was raised by two Jewish parents and went to a conservative shul growing up, but otherwise was raised very secular. I’ve tried all my life to connect- events, retreats, kiruv. I was a BT for 10 years, but it just never took. The final few years of it I just ended up alone for most holidays which eventually led to me breaking Yom tov, which then just made me more alone. Most of my Jewish experiences have just been so negative- rejection, exclusion, abuse. I’m a bit neurodivergent, but I’m a decent person. It’s just so much easier for me to be secular and fit in in secular spaces. But I love Judaism itself and wish I could share in it (and wish I could be more observant). \n\nI wonder if this is unique to me.",

      "text": "Hey everyone, I’m reaching out here because I’m in a bit of a tough spot, and I’m hoping for some guidance from those of you with more experience. Recently, my 19-year-old daughter  is converting to Orthodox Judaism. While I’ve always considered myself Catholic, and I’ve prayed for her soul and her future, I’ve been caught a little off guard by her reaction towards discovering being from Ashkenazi descent (which comes from my side given what I have researched in the past month). She’s taken this discovery to heart and has been obsessed with this and now studying under a rabbi after being rejected a couple of times.\n\nI don’t want to stifle her curiosity or her search for meaning, but I’m also deeply committed to my faith and worried about her making a life changing decision that might not align with what I believe but I have decided to accept it as she's really commited to it and  I don't want to be her enemy. I've shared my thoughts on Catholicism, but I'm trying to approach the situation with love and understanding. I don’t want to push her away or make her feel that she’s not supported. At the same time, I want to help guide her in a way that respects both her journey and my own beliefs.\n\nDoes anyone here have advice on how to be supportive without compromising my own faith? (Maybe someone with catholic parents who converted here?) How do I have these conversations without making her feel like she's doing something wrong or making her feel alienated? I want her to know I’m here for her, no matter where this journey takes her. Just looking for some wisdom and perspective as I navigate this delicate situation.\n\nThanks in advance for any advice!",

Thoughts?\n\nFor context, I host a podcast, *Dilemmas On Screen: A Jewish Perspective*, which analyzes ambiguous moral situations in movies and TV shows from a Torah lens. I think this is an amazing topic - i.e., to what extent do we adapt to local cultures, and to what extent do we push back and maintain our Jewishness? In a way, it's really meant to focus in on what is central to being Jewish, and what is secondary.\n\nAny suggestions, both movies and specific scenes in those movies, is hugely appreciated. The more mainstream and well-known the movie, the better. Thank you!",

For all of my students, their education in math, science, and ELA stops in 8th grade so I want to expose them to a broad range of scientific topics so when they encounter them in real life, they at least partially understand the fundamentals.\n\nThe kids love science, but talk smack about evolution like it is the craziest theory ever proposed.

I am Jewish (edited because I have been taught I don’t need to clarify *insert that’s my purse clip from king of the hill*). This is something I didn’t really talk about until I was an adult. Not that I’m not proud, I just don’t live in an area that is culturally diverse in any form. But, after having kids I started incorporating Hanukkah, Passover, Yom Kippur, etc. into our lives. Not that they weren’t before, we just never really celebrated outside of small discussion. I have been heavily considering converting religiously as I was raised mostly by my Christian grandparents on my father’s side & have always felt drawn more to my Jewish faith. \n\nMy husband’s family is catholic. My husband considers himself atheist/agnostic. He is very open to integrating the culture into our home (he says as long as he gets to eat the food 😂) and is mostly supportive of me exploring my faith. \n\nOnto the glass…\n\nMy husband and I were married in a secular ceremony in our backyard during the 2020 shutdown. It was small and intimate. 2 years ago we decided to do a 5 year vow renewal and go BIG. \n\nMy mom (Jewish &m mitzvah’d & very very supportive of my choices) has brought up breaking the glass. My husband is willing to do this. So. She got the chupah cup for us as a gift for our wedding. \n\nOur friends are super supportive and are SO excited for us to do this.\n\nI just need to know if this is weird for me to do? Or how do I ask my Christian grandpa who is officiating to include this portion into our ceremony? \n\nEdit: I want to thank everyone for the love & education! My mom has connected me with her reform rabbi and has spoken with her about us breaking the glass 🥰",

I have always tried my utmost to be as tolerant (I really hate to use that word, please hear me out) of his practices and things. I try to be involved and I want to understand his beliefs and things as much as possible. My problem is that unfortunately of course some of the practices (namely the the fact that he won’t use his phone on the sabbath and holidays, and unfortunately we are quite long distance) effect me quite a lot and it’s difficult for me to not feel a little bit of resentment towards it. I have asked time after time that he said explains to me why these things are important to him, and he never explains. He always will say something like: “it just is” or “because it’s part of my faith”. I feel if he had an explanation such as because “x said this in the Torah and it’s important to me because…” then this would help me so much. I have explained this to him and it’s not come to anything. My problem is that I feel he does not think for himself at all and just blindly goes with whatever his parents have told him to do- he never questions a thing. I don’t mean I want him to be skeptical, just maybe slightly curious?? I’m finding it very frustrating that he doesn’t seem to think for himself. He’s choosing to be with a non-Jew, and his practices affect me a lot, it’s hard to not feel hurt every time he leaves me. It’s not that I can’t go a day without speaking to him, but it means he’s literally impossible for me to reach and it’s so frustrating from my end because I know he could pick up the phone whenever he so wishes, but if something goes terribly wrong I have no way of hearing about it or telling him. How do I get past this, can anyone help me feel less upset by this? It’s very hurtful for me :(. Before we were so serious it effects me less but the longer this goes on the more this all effects me…",

      "text": "I am baal teshuva and am in the early stages of learning. I have Jewish ancestry but was not raised in the faith, nor were my parents so I am pretty far removed. Observing Shabbos isn't an option for me right now due to life circumstances but I want to pay respect to the day in another way if possible. I was thinking that wearing a kippah on just that day might be a good way of doing that. Again I'm very new to learning. Any information on what to do if I can't observe shabbos right now, or information on Kipahs would be very appreciated thank you",

      "text": "My fiancé is Jewish by birth. He decided earlier this year to start actively practicing the faith. I was raised Eastern Orthodox Christian but I no longer practice any faith. I identify as agnostic at best, but lean towards atheism. However, I believed that it would be good for my fiancé to get involved with and embrace his Jewish heritage. I fully supported him going to services, meeting with the rabbi, going to the Torah study groups, and being involved with the celebrations. \n\nMy fiancé has struggles with mental health issues his entire life. The last several months have been particularly hard. About a week ago, he went to Torah study, and then visited with the rabbi and discussed some of the recent struggles. The next morning, he told me that the rabbi encouraged him to leave, create space between us, and get his own place. \n\nI have three children, we don’t have any children together because he is unable to have kids (we tried for over a year), but my fiancé has been a father figure to my kids, as their biological dad is not in the picture after losing his parental rights. The rabbi knows that we have a family. \n\nI don’t know what their conversation was, and after having him leave the day he informed me about talking to the rabbi, he has since had intense regret and wants to come home. I was very upset when I found out that he chose to act on the advice of the rabbi when he told me he was going to leave, especially because they have only met each other a handful of times. When talking yesterday, I told him maybe he should talk to the rabbi and ask him what he should do now. My fiancé informed me “The rabbi thinks I should marry a Jewish woman.”\n\nI was completely blindsided by this. I initially thought that he was told to leave because of the struggles happening at home as a direct result of his mental health. There has been a lot of arguing. When my family and friends asked me initially if it was because I’m not Jewish, I was confident in telling them that I didn’t believe that was the reason. \n\nI’m not sure what I’m asking here. I guess, is this normal? Is it typical that a rabbi would tell someone to leave their family and find a Jewish woman? I grew up Utah, and the LDS emphatically encourage their members to marry within their faith, but even the interfaith LDS relationships I have had in the past, their leaders have never told my partner they should leave and find someone of their own faith to be with. I am no stranger to being the outsider in religious communities, but never have I experienced anything like this.",

I found out I was Jewish when I visited Ukraine as a kid from the parent of a family friend who let it slip. My parents refused to talk about any of it and so I only got involved with a shul when I went to college. From then till now I have really connected to my Jewish identity and have understood that though my family never explicitly spoke about being Jewish their behaviour and culture was still that of Soviet Ukrainian Jews. However what I am lacking is any type of structured religious instruction that most people would receive as kids. I don't have the time or resources to enrol in a class so I need to find good resources (any kind, podcasts, books, websites etc) that help me understand all the different branches of our faith. I am using the Chabad website and My Jewish Learning to help me on specific topics, and I regularly watch the 'Menorah' youtube channel (in Russian), and when am able attend shul. I would love books that offer our religious text + commentary that is both spiritual and historic, or a resource that serves as a self paced class on Judaism.",

As much as religion didn't make sense to me, the idea that there's no higher power is also tough for me to accept.\n\nEvery time I think about Judaism, I have this little voice in my head telling me, \"look into it.\"\nI feel like there were moments I was near God but never quite got there, like I'm driving to a destination but I keep getting off the wrong exit.\n\nI guess my question is, where do I begin? There's a reform synagogue close by my place. Is it common for non-Jews to just show up to services and ask the rabbi? Should I call them first? This is all for me, not a girl or anything with an ulterior motive. If it's not for me, it is what it is - but if it is for me, I feel like I'd really regret never having explored Judaism.\n\nAny help would be greatly appreciated.  Kind of feel lost on this.",

I've always made it my first priority to treat her with the care, love, and respect she deserves.

I understand and appreciate how important your faith is to you and your family. I would really appreciate the chance to be able meet with you, not to argue, but to have an honest conversation, face to face. I believe it would be beneficial for me to really listen to you and gain a better understanding of your view of this situation as well as for you to see my intentions with your daughter and the sacrifices I would be willing to take in order to be with her. All I’ve ever wanted for ***** is what’s best for her and makes her happy, so I truly apologize if I did anything to strain your family’s relationship, as I never intended for that to happen. I wholeheartedly believe if I were allowed to speak with ******* again, I could continue to provide her with the support and compassion she needs now more than ever while going the awful things she’s going through. I also believe that if you were willing to hear me out and listen to what i have to say, everybody would stand to gain from it. Thank you for your time, Mr. *****. From what I’ve heard ******* clearly has a lot of respect for you and you sound like a great father to have. I really hope you'll consider meeting with me at some point in the near future.",

      "text": "Hey folks,\n\nI’m a patrilineal jew, did my reform giyur years ago but later learned that it’s not the way I want to practice judaism. Without being rude, it didn’t feel „right“ and „authentic“ to me.\n\nLater I started my orthodox giyur process - with lots of pauses.\n\nTo me theses pauses showed me that I’m on the right track. Because at the end I always come to the same conclusion where I see myself in the future and what I believe in and want to do.\n\nThe thing is, I love to read. I read a lot of academic bible scholarship/ archaeology stuff in the past. Even tho it never questioned my faith in Hashem (Chas v’shalom - I didn’t even want to write this sentence down) and the Torah as g’d given, it made me question the authenticity of the Talmud as g'd given.\n\nIn terms of believe to Hashem and the Torah it actually made my faith stronger somehow because I always came to the same conclusion in the end. That it’s truth.\n\nAbout the Talmud and certain rules I may be kinda biased due to the whole patrilineal thing etc and what scholarships tell about the „later development of the oral law“ and some „changed rulings over time“ (I know the orthodox viewpoint of that)\n\nFor me I „wanted to believe“ that the talmud was also given to Moshe at Mount Sinai orally, but truth be told I still sometimes have my struggles with it and feel very bad about it that I just can’t accept it due to things I „learnt from other books in the past“.\n\nI thought I found a workaround for me to view these academic vies as theories (I mean… in the end they are) and they stand next to our religion. So I have the choice what to believe in.\n\nI just don’t like that I read these things in the past and they sometimes „made more sense to me“ but still chose to believe in something else. It feels like I’m doing something wrong.\n\nAnd I don’t mean that it feels wrong to me to believe in the Talmud, but to have doubts about the Talmud.\n\nIn my giyur process (I’m still not finished, I wanna do it when I’m 100% sincere about) I asked myself a lot of times if I wanna life this lifestyle and like I said I always came to the conclusion „this is what I wanna do“ - but oftentimes when I learn new stuff the struggle starts and I fear that I „just can’t do it all“.\n\nAnd some time ago in my giyur process I met this woman via a chavruta… she is also patrilineal and we feel like soulmates. We are secretly together (but in a shomer way) only our family and some very close friends know about us. We wanna do the giyur together as a couple if possible and get married together afterwards.\n\nWe thought we were on the same page about our future but it looks like that she actually wants to live more of a chassidic life and says that I have a misunderstanding of what that means. I view myself more as an Dati.\n\nI told her about a lot of struggles from me and she is the sweetest person on earth and always means good but she always tried to „make me believe“ with „fear for Hashem - and this is also something that I realized reading a lot/ listening to many shiurim. Even tho I’m really interested in the mystical aspect of our tradition - in terms of questions/ topics like these I’m more the „rational guy“. I’m doing these things for love for Hashem and living his will with his laws in this life and make the world a better place with doing my part - but not out of fear that something bad will happen to my soul if I don’t. \n\nBut still this conversations with her „helped“ me in a way… she was like a big mirror I never had in a way about my believe system and I really wanna sort this out.\n\nShe showed me issues about how I practice and view things and it made me realize that I need to sort these things fully out in a different way in order to maintain my goal.\n\nShe says if I would simply learn more and be more fearful everything would solve itself. The first part I feel, the second I don’t.\n\nI can’t talk about that with my rabbi… at least I think so.\n\nI feel very embarrassed about all this.\n\nI had times where I stopped practicing and it always felt bad to me and not right. I was missing something. This is my way.\n\nBut how can I learn more and open my heart to the truth and let go of my doubts?",

From my perspective, beyond broad principles that are almost universal amongst any religion - such as the sanctity of human life - I'm genuinely unsure on what basis this is a thing and who, with knowledge of both faiths, actually embraces and defines it as a category.\n\nI don't pretend to be particularly knowledgeable but there seem to be clear contradictions to me:\n\n- Male C!rcumcision as a Mitzvah (Jewish) which is rejected in Pauline (Christian) Theogy later on\n\n- Emphasis on action (Judaism) Vs declaration of faith (Christianity)\n\n- Importance of a Minyan (Judaism) Vs the idea that numbers are not important in validating prayer (Christianity, Matthew 18:20)\n\n\nI don't pretend these are comprehensive and may miss the most key parts. But I do think the term Judeo-Christian is problematic and heavily misused... I need something to illustrate to my partner why this is the case",

      "text": "I'm going through a bit of a mid-life crisis right now, having just turned 50-something. I was raised very very reform (my Hebrew group didn't even have a Rabbi) but I got bar mitzvahed. Then I grew up and my parents and I kept holidays but that was about it. I married a non-Jewish woman, but a few years ago we had kids and decided to raise them Jewish. We now go to a reform temple where we live on Long Island and it has a sense of community and provides my kids with some Jewish education, but spiritually I feel like something is missing for me.\n\nI know that, as Jews, we rarely talk about our souls or the afterlife though many religious Jews do believe in these things. This is definitely not a topic we cover in reform temple where we're lucky to have Friday night services at all and maybe 30 people show up.\n\nNow that I look at my life and think about getting older and dying and about the stresses I feel today, I want to feel a strong connection to G-d. I want to feel that I have a soul. I know it's not something any of us talk about a lot, but I feel like I need more. I know this is something Christians focus on -- I tried going to Church a few times years ago -- but I'm Jewish and this is who I am. \n\nI don't know what I can do. Can I find a more observant place to join? Would they even accept me and my mixed family? Would going somewhere more religious make me feel that connection and spirituality that I'm lacking or would I just be judged for not being observant enough? Is it too late to become more religious at this point in my life? I feel like I need a spiritual advisor or something.",

      "text": "So I've been going through a bit of a crisis of the soul. I am looking for more ways to get closer to G-d and to be observant and it feels urgent to me. I belong to a reform temple which is not very spiritual at all, but it is a good community for my family, because my wife is not Jewish and, by non-Reform Jewish law, our children would not be considered Jewish and might not be accepted at a conservative or Orthodox temple. \n\nSo, somewhat out of the blue today, someone from my temple called and asked if I could serve on the Temple Board as a VP to help plan events and bring in new families. A few months ago, I would have said \"great! sign me up.\" Because I like helping people and I have lots of ideas. \n\nBut lately, I feel like I need something spiritual that I'm not getting from my temple. I need to feel like I have an eternal soul and I need to feel a connection to G-d. I've been watching a lot of videos from more religious folks like Rabbi Shais Taub and that is starting to attract me to see if I can do more and be more in my observance. \n\nBut OTOH, I'm not sure there's any other type of place for me and I haven't exactly found another temple yet. I just feel like life is passing me by and I need more in my Jewish journey.   \n  \nGranted, and this is a problem whether I take the board position or not, I'm not sure I'd find another community that would accept my family and be more religious at the same time. And my wife and kids are not in favor of moving to a different place or me trying to do something like keep kosher or keep sabbath. \n\nBefore you ask, no the rabbi we have is not the kind of person I could discuss this with. She's not very friendly and she's very material and literal. I don't think soul things are her kind of things. \n\nI just feel like my soul is empty, I'm depressed about it and I don't want to grow old and die this way.",

Latter-day Saints have historically been very Jew-friendly, but sometimes it almost feels like they cosplay Jewish culture and say that it's \"so spiritual.\" A very common one is holding Seders, sometimes even ones where the script is slightly altered to incorporate LDS belief.  (Example:https://www.amomstake.com/lds-passover-seder-script/?fbclid=IwY2xjawJEArRleHRuA2FlbQIxMQABHasN_Aq_7CbFScMb_lZQ0mg3T946Y8wWROF4mi8wm_tkZTm3O8ycnDWIlg_aem_5AZPHZQNqdUYU2nwESboHQ)\n\nThis has always made me slightly uncomfortable, and I've pushed for people to not do it,  because I feel like Pesach is a particularly sacred holiday to Jews,  and it feels disrespectful or sacrilegious. When people have wanted to have a Seder for a youth activity,  I've said, \"If we're doing that,  we're contacting a synagogue or temple and seeing if they'll guide us in how to do it properly.\" Usually they just drop the topic after that. \n\nBut, I've recently realized that I've never actually asked if it's offensive,  I've just assumed. And assumptions aren't good.   So, I guess I should ask.  Does this bother you?\n\nETA: It seems the generally feelings is that I was correct that this is ick.

If it’s an issue about “domestic” animals, then what about other wild poultry?\n\nI feel like there is a huge disconnect between Torah and Rabbinic Law. And I think both truly shift in the concept of ethics.\n\nFrom a spiritual perspective, I believe it’s about not being “lustful” towards your food. Food is energy for us to live. Plain and simple. But we also bond over sharing meals with others. It’s culturally and universally what humans do. So I believe not eating a cheeseburger is honestly really spiritually healthy, but it’s hard for me to understand chicken and cheese. The Hindus have chicken tikka masala, but don’t eat cows. \n\nI was not raised kosher, but I want to respect my future Jewish wife and children and would love some insight from others here. Am I the only one who thinks chicken parm could be considered kosher? Or am I wrong? If so, can you educate me?",

The bowl was $12 and I didn't really want to spend any more money on lunch when I'd already bought one, so I sucked it up and ate it even knowing it wasn't kosher for Passover.\n\nI rationalized it with \"I don't really keep kosher anyways, it's fine\", but I sort-of keep kosher in that I separate food into the categories \"kosher enough\" and \"totally not kosher\" and this meal was definitely in the latter for this week, so now I feel absolutely horrible. I felt horrible while eating it too, I think this is the first time in my life I ever knowingly eaten chametz over Passover, and I'm definitely not going to eat any for the rest of Passover, but I legit want to cry over this I feel so bad. Idrk why I'm posting this here, I think I just wanted to vent and feel too bad about it to tell my family. But it'd also be nice if someone could give me spiritual advice on this maybe, or just anything to make me feel even a little better?",

But I feel so \"lost\" in their world from a cultural aspect, and to a degree a spiritual one.\n\nI didn't know what frum meant until last year. I don't know all the Yeshivish terminology for things I just called Jewish customs or Jewish traditions. I don't know their tunes for benching or prayer. I'm not used to all the concept of negiah, even if the MO shuls near me don't care too much about it. I haven't studied even a page of the Talmud. I don't just feel like a less religious Jew, sometimes I wonder if my upbringing was even Jewish at all compared to them.\n\nI know I can change to fit in with them, or feel less awkward but I still feel like an imposter just by not knowing all these cultural/social parts of Modern Orthodox.",

      "text": "I am a trans woman who attends a Reform synagogue with an absolutely amazing community, but I personally don’t really agree with the Reform movement’s overall ideology around Torah and halacha. I was wondering, based on the tenets of how I view Judaism, where I belong on the religious spectrum (if anywhere)?\n\nMy views:\n- The Torah, both Written and Oral, was given directly to Moses at Sinai and passed on l’dor vador for millenia through conversation, debate, and readings.\n- All 613 commandments of the Torah are binding and unchanging, but the document also carries infinite wisdom and can be easily misinterpreted since it was given to our ancestors thousands of years ago, directly addressing their past problems and more indirectly addressing our contemporary problems. I also believe mesorah refers both to the literal legal rulings as well as the legal methods that spiritual giants like Hillel or Gamliel used to understand God’s kavanah in His laws.\n- Halachic rulings are meaningless unless rooted in all aspects of the Torah. It is for this reason that I somewhat diverge with mainstream contemporary Orthodoxy on issues related to LGBTQ, Zera Yisrael, and gender roles in contemporary life. Halacha is not as much of a list of laws but a puzzle of truth that rabbis must constantly consult and refer back to when addressing any issue. I also believe that passages that appear to contradict each other are brilliant opportunities to discover greater truths about God’s reality rather than flaws in the text.\n- I somewhat reject chasidut in favor of *tzadikut*, if you will. I deeply admire the chassidic exploration of mystical concepts and love of study, but I believe their methods should be utilized to spiritually revive the lost commandments in some way rather than to find ways to be extra-pious. Essentially, I believe no one can be truly chassidic today because no one can be truly tzadik without all 613 commandments.\n\nI’ve been thinking about starting a religious movement around this for a long time, but it would be hard since I’m not a rabbi and many people wouldn’t be interested. That’s why I’m hoping that my worldview aligns with *some* other existing Jewish movement? If need be, I can clarify my more specific views surrounding contemporary issues.",

      "title": "Will Hashem punish me if I decide to be with someone less religious?",
      "text": "Hi, I’m 28(F) who recently broke up with my boyfriend 30(M) because he is less religious than me. I grew up modern orthodox, went to a coed Jewish day school, shul most weekends, kept Shabbat and kashrut (ate dairy out tho) etc. Nowadays, I don’t keep Shabbat fully (I use technology, and don’t observe at all while on vacation) and still eat dairy out. He grew up more conservative and became more secular as an adult (eg his family would have kiddush Friday night but not Shabbat day, they would go to shul once in a while. They had a kosher home but ate out “kosher style.”) Once he moved out, he observed less-he goes to concerts Friday nights, doesn’t have a kosher apartment etc. We dated for six months. He expressed that he was willing to send his kids to a Jewish school, wanted Hashem and spirituality to be common discourse in our house, have a fully kosher home. He acknowledged that his lifestyle would change-no more concerts Friday nights. I broke up with him because even tho he was willing to make some sacrifices, I felt that there was still a religious gap between us and that agreeing to make lifestyle changes would be difficult and would result in resentment between us in the future. The problem is that in every other way he is everything that I want in a partner and I’ve been really depressed without him. If we had the same hashkafah, I know without a doubt he’d be the one I’d want to marry and have a family with. And some days I wonder if being more traditional and less modern orthodox is a small price to pay for the happiness of being with him. I never saw myself returning fully to the modox lifestyle and after all, it’s not like our kids wouldn’t grow up without Judaism in their lives. They would just grow up less religious than I did. But then I worry that Hashem would have it out for me my whole life if I chose to be less religious and raise my kids that way. That because I “know better” this would all seem like me going against Him, even though I know I’d do everything else to make sure my children grew up with Jewish values. I know that bottom line these are decisions I have to make on my own, but if anyone has any religious insight or has experienced something similar I would appreciate any advice. Thank you\n\n\n\nEdit: I’d like to thank everyone for their advice. In case anyone was wondering, he ended up reaching out asking for a phone call a few days ago (we’d gone three weeks without talking). I had hope that maybe he’d be interested in getting back together. Especially since he fought so hard when I first suggested we break up. Our time apart made me hope that we could make it work, but it had the opposite effect on him. He only called to tell me that he didn’t see things working between us bc of kashrut differences and other lifestyle changes (this felt hurtful and unnecessary since we’d already communicated all of this) but he said he missed me etc and asked if we could still be friends. I said no. This has all been pretty painful but at least he was honest. I’m deeply sad it didn’t work out but also a little relieved that Hashem gave me the clarity I asked Him for 🙏🏼",

      "text": "Over the years that I've been out as trans, I've admittedly struggled with reconciling my Jewishness and my transness. The rabbi at my synagogue when I came out was supportive, and he even helped me with a private renaming ceremony so I wouldn't be stuck with a male Hebrew name. He unfortunately retired for medical reasons soon after. But even while he was rabbi, I had mixed experiences at services. \n\nMy last straw came when I went to temple wearing a dress for the first time. I was a approached by a fellow congregant, one who I had considered a friend for a long time. She proceeded to tell me that I was \"defiling the sanctuary\" by being there like that. I silently went through the night's service, went home and cried, and never went back. It's been 2 years now since I last attended services. \n\nNow, I'm wishing I had spiritual support. I just had bottom surgery and am recovering at home. It will be a long while before I am back to semblance of normality. I contacted the rabbi at my old temple asking about being added to the Mi Shebeirach list while I'm healing from this extensive, life-altering surgery and I simply never heard back. It has left me feeling quite lonely and abandoned. It is even a Reform synagogue which makes it all the more surprising. \n\nI'm mostly just making this post to bring some attention to the special struggles that trans Jews may face, even in supposedly progressive spaces. That said, since I am recovering from a major surgery, I would truly appreciate it if someone could say Mi Shebeirach for me. My Hebrew name is *Miryam bat Neil v'Wendy*, though if you'd prefer to use a more \"traditional\" name, I suppose *Miryam bat Avraham v'Sarah* would work too, though I'm not a convert so it's not my actual Hebrew name. \n\nAs an aside, yes, I know my name is a bit odd; I'm halachically Jewish through my mother. She was never given a Hebrew name herself, and my father is a lapsed Catholic so obviously no Hebrew name there. My family has a very very odd history, so it's no surprise my own name carries some of that oddity with it.",

The few times I’ve been able to attend a Jewish event or service, I’ve realized how much I don’t know like basic prayers/songs, there are holidays I’ve never heard of, I felt like a bystander. \n\nI really want to build a Jewish life, but I have no idea where or how to start. Are there resources or practices that helped you if you were in a similar place? What’s a good way to begin learning when there’s no community? I think the synagogue in my town just closed down because not enough Jews went, and those left were mainly senior citizens. I didn’t go to Hebrew school as a kid because I would’ve been the only person in my age group. \n\nThanks in advance for any thoughts or guidance even if this is a generic ask.

      "text": "Hey Reddit. Thought I'd ask here because it would be a good place to get some Jewish opinions, and I'm desperately in need of some right now. I hope this is the right flair and that this sort of post is allowed. \n\nA friend of mine invited me to a pagan/wiccan ritual recently. I attended, and mostly didn't participate because, well, I'm devoted to Judaism, lol. They knew this and didn't mind. Still, I wanted to learn about my friend's spiritual beliefs and was very flattered to be invited in the first place. The thing that shocked me was that the friend brought up something about Kabbalah. When I said that something he was saying was wrong, he corrected me and said that what he was saying was the case for ceremonial magick. He's not Jewish in any way. I was sort of stunned and just let him keep talking. I asked a couple more questions later while I was there to try and convince myself I was okay with it, but I was just left with a sour taste in my mouth.\n\nWhen I got home, a mutual friend who was also there DM'd me and I expressed my gripes with the whole thing. This friend encouraged me to say something about how I feel. I asked my therapist as well and she said that I should bring it up. I decided to do it, with no malice and the hope my friend would understand.\n\nAbout a week later (a few days ago, I waited because I had a hectic week) I asked to talk about something and we messaged online. I brought up my confusion and he explained it by saying this had been part of occultism for a long time. He said it was natural to feel protective over things but being uncomfortable is part of spirituality, and he's had to be uncomfortable with people doing things he thinks are wrong spiritually as well. He clearly understood the difference between what he was doing and Jewish mysticism, but I was pretty pushy in explaining that the use of Kabbalah outside Judaism, especially in polytheistic and occult ritual contexts, is considered offensive and has a very rough history of antisemitism. He shut down and asked what I wanted him to do about it. I apologized for the way I spoke, in case I made him uncomfortable, and tried to explain myself further but he didn't respond with anything other than an \"okay\". I decided to leave it. \n\nHe responded again hours later saying that I made him feel bad for saying something about his spiritual beliefs and that it's fine I feel uncomfortable, but I shouldn't have told him, and he would have liked an open-minded conversation. I apologized again for how I spoke but said I felt unheard regarding appropriation and that I wanted to have another conversation about this at some point. He said he wasn't interested in defending his beliefs to me and he knows how I feel already. I said that was fair and left it again. We haven't talked since. This is a very paraphrased version of the convo, but that's pretty much it.\n\nThe mutual friend I initially talked to has been very supportive and has said that I wasn't wrong for bringing it up, even if I may have been accidentally rude in doing so. Another friend who doesn't know either of them said that I was nice and he was being dismissive of me, although I take this with a grain of salt as she's a bit more of an aggressive person. \n\nI deeply care for this friend, but I have no idea what to do, least of all whether or not I was the asshole. Per my therapist's instructions I'm giving him space. I'm very frustrated and very sad and unsure of the future of most of my friendships now, since they're also tied to this friend, which has made me stew on this a lot. \n\nI have to admit that this has taken a toll on me. I struggle a lot with confrontation, as well as having a clear vision when it comes to interpersonal relationships (for example, seeing if I'm actually in the wrong or if I'm overreacting and blaming myself). So a fresh perspective would be great, especially from people who understand what Kabbalah actually is - I'm sort of tired of explaining it to everyone lol. So, am I overreacting? Am I the asshole here?",

      "text": "Hi! \n\nI recently learned about the Freedom House Ambulance Service and thought it was so cool that it was co-founded and co-run by Jewish Americans, working so closely with and to service the Black community in Pittsburgh. I shared this knowledge and a documentary about Freedom House Ambulances with my 12th grade students in my Jewish American Literature and Culture class. This sparked an interesting conversation about a topic I don’t know enough about: Jews during the Civil Rights Movement. \n\nDoes anyone have any information and/or reliable sources they can share about this topic? Books, essays, articles, stories, videos, movies, etc. Anything that you think addresses this topic well and reliably!\n\nThank you!",

      "title": "Considering Going by My Middle Name to Feel Closer to Judaism – Looking for Insight",
      "text": "Hello all,\n\nI’m a 32-year-old man currently going through something of an identity crisis. For some background: I was raised Jewish by my father, who grew up modern Orthodox but married my mother, who is a non-denominational Christian. We were raised in Colorado, and my parents named me Patrick. Despite that, I was brought up in a Reform temple, had a bar mitzvah, went on Birthright, and have always identified with Judaism.\n\nThat said, I’ve never felt a real connection to the name Patrick—it never quite felt like me. I recently returned from a trip to Europe where I visited the Jewish quarters in Prague and Krakow and paid my respects at Auschwitz and Dachau. That experience stirred something deep in me. For the first time in a while, I felt a profound sense of connection and peace being so close to my heritage—particularly my father’s side.\n\nSince coming back, I’ve been seriously considering going by my middle name, Nathan, which was my great-grandfather’s name on my dad’s side. It feels much more in line with my identity and spiritual connection to Judaism.\n\nMy wife, who isn’t Jewish either, believes that my name—though it’s a traditionally Irish Catholic one—doesn’t make me any less Jewish. She encourages me to embrace both sides of my heritage. And while I respect that perspective, I can’t shake the feeling that using the name Nathan would help me feel more rooted in my Jewish identity.\n\nI’d really appreciate any insight or advice from those who may have gone through something similar, or anyone with thoughts on navigating identity and names within Jewish life.\n\nTL;DR: I’m thinking of going by my middle name, Nathan (after my Jewish great-grandfather), to feel closer to my Jewish identity. Looking for advice or similar experiences.",

However, she also explained how her friend meditates, believes in reincarnation, believes in karma, and practices other traditional Buddhist practices. I assume her friend is practicing some sort of non-theistic spiritual or humanistic Buddhism, but even then, that seems a bit contradictory. \n\nI also asked if she was agnostic or atheist, and I was told the friend is neither and does believe in God as described in the Torah. \n\nI'm curious if this is common in certain groups or communities or anything anybody has heard of before because I feel like it is inherently contradictory from a theological and philosophical viewpoint. No judgment toward anyone, just curious to learn more.",

No. In my early 20s a girl invited me to a Pentacostal/non dinomanational church and that calmed the community I went to highscool in for a bit. Eh years later Christian Nationalism is spreading. The Bible and the Ten commandments are being put up at public schools. And I learned more about the spiritual side of Judaism from my time at synagogue. Not much of the knowledge and cultural side of it. I'm wondering what are the Ten commandments to Judaism compared to the Christian Ten commandments and the multiple of Jewish commandments.",

The LA fires have been the most recent example where many in the Left and Right have given in to pessimism and skepticism, abandoning knowledge, meaning, and morality.  \n\nI lived in LA many years ago and, while I was poor and lived in a shitty area, I loved LA and didn’t begrudge those living in the palisades or other fancy areas.  I mourn for all the life that has been ruined or extinguished by these fires.  And yet many are celebrating.\n\nAs an Israeli in America, I’ve noticed this for a long time but the nihilism seems to be exploding now.  The masses are so lacking in community and tools for how to think about the world in addition to lacking a narrative of unity.  This has made vast portions of society susceptible to nihilism.  I am lucky because I have “the Jewish mind” and the visceral, spiritual connection to all other Jews that keeps me grounded.\n\nIt’s horrifying that we live in a world where so many people want to see everything burn, metaphorically and physically, and are now so open about it.\n\nIn many ways, it feels like this epoch is in diametric opposition to Jewish values.  Whereas we embrace life, growth, healing, and community, so many right now do not.  Now, more than ever, I feel we must be beacons of light, modeling Jewish values for the world to see, lest they forget what a world without nihilism is.",

That return, after real separation, reaches a place even higher than staying close all along.\n\nSo maybe Eve didn’t eat the fruit out of weakness or rebellion.\nMaybe she did it because she believed the story needed to begin.\nThat love isn’t real without otherness. That longing, struggle, and return are part of the design — not a mistake.\n\nGod is One.\nBut love requires Two.\nSo God made space.\nAnd Eve stepped into it.\n\nNot as a failure, but as a first act of spiritual adulthood. A conscious choice to make room for freedom, growth, and relationship.\n\nI didn’t come up with this — it was taught to me by a rabbi I learn with.\nIt helped me reframe the entire story — not as the loss of innocence, but the beginning of the human mission.\n\nWhat do you think: Is distance always a problem?

My mom didn’t “practice” Judaism when we were young, and briefly (though I don’t think very whole-heartedly) converted to Christianity while we were young g so there was unity in our home. As an adult, I find myself torn. When I attend reform shul as a guest of my mother, I feel spiritually at home. It’s hard to explain—it just feels so…easy. Like I’m surrounded by family. I do not feel this way at church, no matter what congregation we attend. I am trying to choose my words carefully, as I don’t want to come across as fetishizing the Jewish people, nor trivializing the deep pain and fear of anti-semitism that Jews live with, but forgive me if I am not explaining it well. I am also deeply concerned about the rise in antisemitism, and the ignorance in the United States regarding Israel.\n\nBut I don’t think I can convert. I’ve already married a gentile husband who has no ties or interest in Judaism, and we are raising our three young children Christian. The children are all old enough to have a spiritual connection, and all three of them connect to God through Jesus. And to be honest, I do too. I don’t imagine being able to sever that tie/or belief, so any attempt at conversion would probably not be fully honest or committed. But we do teach our children about our Jewish ancestors, we celebrate Hanukkah at home, as well as celebrating other Jewish traditions with my mother. I encourage both my parents to talk to my children about their faiths, and I would be happy for my children to embrace either faith tradition/community in adulthood. \n\nI would love advice on how to embrace my Jewish heritage, and to stand with the Jewish community, while being respectful and honest about my faith and complicated story.\n\nI should add that I am familiar with the Jews for Jesus movement, and while I’m sure many of those people are sincere, I find them pretty ethically dubious, and I am generally pretty uninterested in evangelical theology.",

Looking for other Jews who know how hard this is and/or how you have coped with it. Studying and learning anything is incredibly hard. Doctors or anyone with experience, please share your knowledge or advice.\n\n\n\nWhen I was 15, I was in a bad skiing accident where ripped off half of my face. Seriously, the medic that first showed up on the scene, projectile vomited and then passed out. Unfortunately that incident is what turned into a TBI or a traumatic brain injury for me. The problem with being a kid in the '90s, is that people weren't talking TBI's and most people didn't even know what they were. One of the first symptoms I started developing was avolition. Medication has helped but not enough. Avolition at first glance looks almost exactly like laziness. And for the most part most doctors will simply write it off as laziness. When in reality, your brain produces just enough dopamine for you to start a project or some days it's producing so little you can't even start the project. You constantly procrastinate and you have zero control over it. The stigmatism behind it is awful. In my late teens, I went to my family doctor because I had started suspecting that what I didn't know was avolition was something that might not be my fault. That same family doctor looked me dead in the eye and told me, \"Sometimes G_d makes lazy people, maybe you're just one of them.\" Another revelation came when I didn't have access to any caffeine. All the sudden, my avolition symptoms improved. That's when I knew it wasn't me. I've also noticed when I'm lifting very heavy free weights, my symptoms dramatically improve. If any of you are in this group have any mental health problems and it feels like you literally have to fight yourself all the time to empty the dishwasher or simple tasks and when you finally complete that small task, you feel mentally worn out because you literally had to fight yourself every step of the way, every arm movement every thought, is a constant fight. Is anyone out there, has any of these symptoms, please post below if you're comfortable. Also if you're a medical professional, and have never heard of this symptom and or know exactly what it's about, please post below as well. I would very much like to have a clarifying conversation with you that may possibly help your patients.\n\nWhat nobody really talks about is how heavy this stuff weighs on you, mentally and spiritually. Even though I know this chronic avolition symptom is not my fault, it's really hard not to feel like you're a moral failure all the time. For example, I know I need to study more and or learn Hebrew over the summer. This is a task that I have been not able to complete. If emptying the dishwasher is a struggle at times, imagine the exhausting willpower it would be to learn Hebrew and or regularly study from the Torah. It constantly feels like you're moving through mental molasses. On top of all of this, my short-term and working memory has dramatically deteriorated.\n\nIs anyone else here dealing with avolition or symptoms like this? If you're comfortable, please post below. And if you're a doctor or a medical professional, and you’ve either never heard of this or you know exactly what it is, I’d really appreciate it if you could reply. I’d love to have a conversation that might help others too.",

      "text": "Shalom. I’ve been following this subreddit for a long time, mostly in silence, and it has played a meaningful role in my journey toward the Jewish People and Torah.\n\nI’m Brazilian, and after years of internal struggle, study, and spiritual awakening, I’ve come to a decision that I now carry with full consciousness: I ***will*** convert to Judaism.\n\nThis isn’t something I chose lightly. It didn’t come from admiration or idealization. Quite the opposite actually, the more I studied, the more I saw the reality, the intensity, and sometimes the harshness of Jewish People and tradition. And that’s exactly what drew me in.\n\nI’m not here to ask if I’m Jewish, I know I’m not, halachically speaking. But I also know I’m being pulled toward it with a force I can’t suppress.\n\nI recently wrote a testimony that tries to express what’s happening inside of me, not for validation, but to share with others who may be going through something similar. The original was written in Portuguese, so the translation might not reflect 100% the same tone the original had, but anyways I think it's worth sharing:\n\n>I don’t know all the mitzvot, but I know I want to fulfill them.  \nI don’t yet know all the details of what awaits me, but I know I want to face them.  \nI don’t know exactly what my mission is, but I want to stand where I can fulfill it.\n\n>When I tried to communicate with G-d through Jesus and Christianity, I always felt fear.  \nNow I feel awe, and there is a sacred difference between the two.  \nNow I feel that G-d is holding my soul by the ribs, shaking me, stirring me, disturbing me, forcing me to seek something I don’t even want to pursue.\n\n>Because rationally, it would be easier to ignore.  \nIt would be simpler to live as a gentile, like any other person.  \nTo smoke my weed, get a better long term job, leave home, enjoy the rest of my youth.  \nAnd yes, maybe I’ll still try to enjoy a bit of that, because for now, I still can.  \nBut what is happening inside me is not rational.\n\n>No rational person would make the decision I’m making.  \nI don’t know where I’m going, but I am fully convinced that I am going.  \nI don’t know entirely what it means to be a Jew, but I know I want to be.  \nI know that no matter what bad things they say about the Jewish People, I will still want to be part of it.\n\n>I don’t know what I will have to do.  \nI don’t know everything I will end up doing.  \nBut I already know I will be willing to do it.\n\n>I didn’t get here through romanticism. I studied. I researched. I read.  \nI understood that Jews are not a “perfect” people and that’s exactly what drew me closer.  \nThey are direct. They argue. They shout. They’re intense. They’re real.  \nAnd the more I know, the more I see myself in them.\n\n>I don’t want to enter out of pity, or for symbolic acceptance.  \nI want to enter with pain, if needed, but with truth.  \nBecause I can no longer not be.\n\n>This is my testimony.  \nI don’t know who will read it.  \nI don’t know if they will believe it.  \nBut I know it’s real.  \nBecause it’s burning inside me and it won’t go out.\n\nIf you've gone through the conversion process, especially in Latin America or from outside any Jewish community, I’d be honored to hear your insights. I'm fully aware of the difficulties I will face, and years of study and deliberation led me to this. This definitely isn't an impulse, nor a identitary conversion, it's something I decided through knowledge and understanding of the Jewish culture and faith. It's not like I had to change the way I think, it's just that when I found out that Judaism and the Jewish People are, I felt like I found my home, and now I feel obligated to go through the front door the right way, through Kabbalat Ol Mitzvot.\n\nI know this is just the beginning, but it’s a beginning I’ve accepted with open eyes. I hope the day I finally go to Jerusalem to convert, I can look back at this post and remember where my mind was when I made the decision.\n\nHineni.",

I’ve read in multiple places that it is forbidden to practice divination, sorcery or witchcraft. I’m curious what the Jewish truth is around plant medicines like ayahuasca & so forth. My curiosity around this is because I used to be deeply involved in the plant medicine & ceremonial world and have had a lot of experience both incredible and traumatic. I’ve since walked away and asked G-d for forgiveness and cleaned up my life. However I am aware there are a lot of underground chassidic ayahuasca circles in the northeast and I just find it interesting. Doesn’t that violate what I pointed to above? \n\nIsn’t it witchcraft? It’s seeking spiritual enlightenment through a plant substance. \n\nI’ve experienced the dark side of this world and there are demonic forces, so I’m just curious doesn’t this go against the Torah?\n\n***edit please don’t try to teach me about what plant medicine and psychedelics are, I’m well versed in this field and that is not my question.***",

I am eternally grateful for it because it’s what led to my decision, and is also making the process a bit faster. I ultimately chose to do this for my future children (I am a woman) and my own spiritual/religious journey (deepening my study, etc.). I have been involved in my local community since long before starting this process, and have always been accepted as a Jew socially among my Reform and Conservative peers. Some know that I’m Zera, others don’t. If it comes up, I don’t conceal it, but I also don’t outwardly volunteer this information out of context because it doesn’t always feel necessary. Dating is definitely the exception.\n\nI’m in my 20s and navigating dating feels complex, especially outside the Conservative shul that’s sponsoring me. Obviously a lot of fellow congregants are aware of my “status”, but outside of shul I don’t really know how to go about discussing this with potential suitors. Outside shul, I primarily meet people through friends, parties, and Hinge. I am not ashamed of converting, in fact I’m extremely proud of it and should be. My father dropped the ball, and almost killed our bloodline in the process. I am the one choosing to pick it back up, which is why I am so proud of it. I am exclusively dating Jewish for reasons I don’t feel the need to explain….because it’s obvious. However, I don’t really know when I’m supposed to tell people this in the context of dating.\n\nI would love to hear feedback from anybody with insight on this. Especially female, patrilineal converts who converted independently while single AND Jewish men that have dated/married women with a story similar to mine. If you need further context, I’m happy to clarify. Thanks to all!",

      "text": "Some Historians claim that the Jews often lived better and safer under Islamic rule than they did under Christian rule in medieval Europe, though the full picture is nuanced and depends on the time and place.\n\nUnder Islamic Rule:\n \nIn many Muslim-ruled societies (especially during the Golden Age of Islam, e.g. in Al-Andalus/medieval Spain under Muslim rule), Jews were considered “dhimmi” protected non-Muslims. They had to pay a tax (jizya) and follow certain restrictions, but they were granted religious freedom, legal autonomy, and protection.\n\nJewish communities often thrived in science, medicine, philosophy, and trade. Some held high positions in government or as court physicians (like Hasdai ibn Shaprut or Maimonides).\n\nThere were certainly periods of discrimination, forced conversions, or violence, like under the Almohads in North Africa and Spain in the 12th century — but overall, Islamic societies were often more tolerant.\n\nIn Christian Europe:\n\nJews were often viewed with suspicion or outright hostility by the Christian majority. Anti-Jewish blood libels, forced conversions, ghettos, and massacres (like during the Crusades or Black Death) were tragically common.\n\nJews were expelled from many countries — e.g., England in 1290, France in 1306, and Spain in 1492.\n\nChristian theology often depicted Jews as spiritually blind, which fueled centuries of antisemitism.\n\nSo the summary:\n\nIslamic rule: Often relatively tolerant, especially in the early and classical periods. Jews could rise to prominence and contribute culturally and scientifically.\n\nChristian Europe: Much more volatile, with periods of extreme persecution and violence.\n\nIt’s not that life under Islamic rule was perfect, but historically, many Jewish communities fared better under Muslim rulers than under their Christian counterparts during the same eras.",

Last year I went to the shabbaton, and the Ohel was my first time at a kever and it really didn’t do anything for me (from an emotional or spiritual perspective). I wrote a very detailed and meticulously worded letter, davened to HaShem that my wish be materialized, but I DIDN’T put the letter at the gravesite because it felt weird to me and kind of like I was talking to the dead (חס וחלילה), so after reading my letter/davening to HaShem, I threw it in the trash. I’m going back this year of course and my question is, is putting the letter on the grave a questionable practice according to some or is completely mutar? Not trying to strike up a whole controversy about Chabad and the rebbe and all that stuff, I’m just curious about that practice in particular, so I know whether to not put it in again, or try putting it this time.

      "text": "I’ve been struggling with a very intense spiral rooted in something I encountered while reading mystical Jewish texts—specifically the Zohar and Tanya. These works introduce the idea that Jews and gentiles may have different “soul levels” (like nefesh vs. neshama), and ever since then, I’ve been afraid that this somehow means gentiles are metaphysically or even biologically disconnected—like inherently unable to feel joy, presence, or “like themselves” in certain situations.\n\nI want to be clear: I don’t believe I’m spiritually worthless. I know Judaism teaches all humans are made b’tzelem Elohim (in the image of God), and that righteous gentiles have a share in the world to come. But I started overthinking this:\n\nWhat if this soul “difference” shows up biologically—as overthinking, social anxiety, stuttering, never feeling whole, never knowing when or why I feel off?\n\nIt feels like fear hijacked a mystical idea and turned it into a spiritual identity crisis. Now I can’t tell:\n\t•\tAm I projecting anxiety onto metaphysics?\n\t•\tIs the Kabbalistic soul hierarchy just symbolic and not meant to describe literal embodiment or emotional experiences?\n\t•\tCan spiritual concepts “manifest” in the body—or is that a trauma response, not theology?\n\nI’ll also admit—I don’t really understand how metaphysics or Kabbalah works in general. I’m realizing I might have attached a connotation that was never meant to be there. But fear makes it really hard to think clearly, and now I feel spiritually haunted by a belief that may not even reflect what the texts were trying to say.\n\nI want to stop spiritualizing my anxiety, but I also want to understand what these mystical teachings do and don’t mean.",

      "text": "Hi fam 👋 Lately I’ve felt like I’ve built a bit of a wall between me and Hashem. I want to get closer to Him and accept that He loves me, but I’m scared to trust it.\n\nI know this is because of my trauma history: my mother was abusive and her love was highly conditional. If I displeased her, she withheld all love and care until I could somehow get back into her good graces. I came to believe that if I did something wrong, I was unworthy of love and would be abandoned.\n\nI’ve unpacked a lot of this in therapy, but now that I’m becoming more observant, I find myself with a problem. I love Hashem like a parent and He has truly never abandoned me. Logically, I know he loves me unconditionally and will never abandon me. But there’s a difference between knowing something in your brain and in your heart, and my heart is scared to trust in Him completely. I worry that if I mess up, He won’t love me anymore and will leave me.\n\nI feel like this fear is really holding me back in my observance and my relationship with Hashem. I also know that it’s an irrational fear, but I’m only human and my worries are what they are. Has anyone ever felt this way? Are there maybe some verses you could point me to that might be reassuring?\n\nTL;DR: I’m afraid to trust Hashem and it’s holding me back spiritually.",

      "text": "Today is mo-5/day-9 (Tisha - 9, B'Av - in the month of Av) in the Jewish Calendar, the most depressing day of the Jewish year. If there is any time to be sad about Jewish tragedies that day is today. If there is a time to be depressed, see a therapist as today is not about being depressed it's about connecting to something we are missing. Voluntarily venturing towards depression is never encouraged although we know depression is not a choice.\n\nSo we ask why are we fasting? Wouldn't G-d rather us to eat so we have energy to learn about the destruction of the temple (which we do learn about anyways)?\n\nFirst of all why is today such a sad day? We can just forget and move on right? It's a new generation. That stuff is over. Let's focus on the light! Let's be happy today!\n\nNo. Today, 5-9, we were banished from Spain in 1492.  Today we experienced expulsion from England in 1290. The Jews were butchered by the Romans and the temple Mount was plowed over in 133 CE. Both holy temples were destroyed today. The Jews rebelled against going into Eretz Israel back in Moshe times.\n\nOk so what does fasting do for us. We fast on Tisha Bav to transform our focus from physical desires to spiritual. Why? So that we can focus on our identity and who and where we are. What are we doing wrong? What wrong can we learn from our past mistakes that lead to our destruction?\n\nSo you see G-d didn't give us a fast for him. He gave it (through our Rabbis) for us. It's for us to learn about sadness. To learn the beauty in our darkness. As we know in this world there is darkness and light. In you, there is darkness and light. How you master these two realms of your persona is the ultimate pathway to your potential. So why does G-d care if we fast? Because it's for us. And he cares for us. For all of humanity. If we cannot master our darkness and understand the sadness of the day, we cannot master our connection to G-d. Besides the real sadness of the tragedies.\n\nThank you for all who read my article. I hope I shined some light on this puzzling question that exists no matter what spirituality you follow.",

Of course also babies, children, pregnant women, the elderly...everyone!\n\nEvery single day I think about everyone, what they must have gone through, the suffering, the pain, the anguish, the begging 😢..\nI cannot help but think about them, cry and feel upset about it all still. I keep having thoughts & feelings of \"are they okay? 😢 how are they doing on the other side?\" But mainly just...are they okay?\n\nIt's hard to put into words but after seeing stuff like the body of this young lady that VERY clearly was horribly r****, mutilated, tortured and seeing her lay in a position that leaves NO doubt to what happened to her, seeing her hand trying to sheild herself in defence & pain and all the agony she must have endured. Seeing the faces of the bodies of ppl that...words cannot possibly come close to explain properly but their faces are full of absolute agony, pain, suffering. Words pale in trying to describe their agony eched painfully on their faces. Exactly how first responders tried to explain. I feel scarred and so sad for all of these victims 💔..\n\nI REALLY do not want to come across as if I don't think they're in Gan Eden, hopefully close to God 😢🙏 hopefully held and being taken care of tenderly by God. At least not suffering in pain physically anymore.\n\nI just cannot stop thinking of all that happened here, it's hard to put into words the choas that ensued here unless you were here. (I know there are so many wonderful ppl, Jewish abroad in diaspora and non-Jewish around the world that have been nothing but supportive to what happened here) so I'm speaking more so about how words cannot explain the choas that was here.\n\nMake NO mistake - what happened here was an absolute Shoah!!! Nothing less. \n\nAs I said, I cannot stop thinking about everyone 💔 I'm not considered religious by other religious Jews, I see myself as more spiritual so I lack the knowledge to answer this question myself that I asked. I don't have it in me to search for the answers myself so I would like to ask OTHERS here that are much more religious, knowledable than me on this topic since this is a religious question.\n\nI keep thinking how can I help these souls that suffered so much? 💔 that they were torn away from their families with such suffering, such pain, such agony; using horrible, horrible, horrible crimes against humanity committed against them? Just because they were Jewish!! \n\nI keep trying to think maybe, is there a special prayer that can be said for them? All I can think of is trying to do a hitbodedut prayer..\nIs there something more that can be done maybe? 🙏\n\nIf it helps I'm Jewish and a woman, maybe there's a mitzvah that can be done as a woman for them? For all these souls? 😢🙏 maybe a mitvah that can be done since I'm Jewish? \n\nI just hope with all my heart that they're okay 💔🙏 that they're hopefully in Gan Eden being held in the most tender way and are hopefully experiencing the highest Love that can be had, the best bliss for them. That God is with them; being held in Love and rachamim. That hopefully every single moment is full to the brim with happiness & bliss, that it can somehow make up for every single second they have suffered here and what happened to them. That hopefully they can somehow find peace and solace 🙏...\n\nThank you everyone for taking the time to read!!\n\nP.S - I can read Hebrew so if ppl want to share their thoughts in English and or Hebrew that's okay too..",

      "text": "I left spirituality (read - my Jewish spirituality) as a teenager because it felt to me rigid and rote. In my twenties, I found my way back into spiritual practice through modalities like yoga, meditation, and ecstatic dance. Yet, when I wanted to find Jewish spaces that could offer the type of embodied practice I was looking for...it felt lacking. I couldn't find it in LA...or Chicago...or New York.\n\nSo I decided to start a community called The Sabbath Dance. We started two years ago in Brooklyn to reinvent Kabbalat Shabbat as a high energy ecstatic dance practice. Okay, but would anyone come? This was what I was wondering when we put tickets on sale for the first one. And something surprising happened. The first one SOLD OUT! 70 Jews who wanted to dance (plus a waitlist) showed up. And we haven't stopped since.\n\nSince that start, I've had the opportunity to bring The Sabbath Dance to Chicago and Nashville, and we keep meeting every month in Brooklyn with hundreds and hundreds showing up. (We're actually meeting tomorrow [https://www.viewcy.com/promote/the\\_sabbath\\_dance\\_\\_j\\_1](https://www.viewcy.com/promote/the_sabbath_dance__j_1) ). We've brought in teachings from Rebbe Nachman, Kaballah, Chasidut, and beyond with an eye toward 'where do we feel these teachings in our bodies? How can we dance with them? Scream with them? Sweat with them?'\n\nWhat I've found is that everywhere I go there is a desire for this sort of aliveness in Jewish practice and spiritual practice in general. In the last year alone I've had the opportunity to DJ Ecstatic Dances in the USA, Vietnam, India, Nepal, Thailand, and more. And everywhere - I see this desire for people to put their phones away - devices dominated by words - and move into the feeling body. \n\nDoes this resonate with you? Whats been your experience with dance and movement in Jewish space as an explicitly spiritual means of exploring Jewish ideas?",

I guess I’m at a stage where my friends and social life is high up on the things that matter to me. \n\nI like to go clubbing with my friends, but lately we’ve all been busy. The ONE WEEKEND that we’re all able to hang out and go to a club is the weekend of Oct 11/12. Which is Yom Kippur weekend. \n\nObviously I said no to Friday night, because I will not go clubbing on Yom Kippur. I’m not religious, but it’s the only holiday I take seriously. I’m spiritual and superstitious, and I want God to put me in the book of life. \n\nBut I did say yes to Saturday night, right after Yom Kippur ends. Now I’m really concerned that I won’t have enough energy to go out because of the fast. It’s gotten to the point where I’m thinking of allowing myself to drink water on Yom Kippur because I want to stay hydrated during the day, so that I could drink and dance with my friends at night. My logic is that drinking on YK is less major than eating on YK. I’d just take a few sips of water every hour and hope God looks away. \n\nPart of me knows this might be wrong, and I know that I’m thinking of doing this for all the wrong reasons. But the temptation is SO STRONG, I really might not be able to overcome it. \n\nEven worse, I live with my orthodox parents. They know I’m not religious, and they tolerate it. But they expect me to take Yom Kippur seriously, they put a lot of importance on the holiday, and they are fully under the impression that I fast every year. \n\nAnd I have fasted in the past, except that last year I purposely took my ADD meds to be less hungry; then I took headache medicine to stop a headache caused by not eating. Seems like I’ll be sinking further down this year, doing it all behind my parent’s back, which I will feel extremely guilty about. \n\nI also feel very resentful about when YK is. Why can’t it at least start on Saturday night instead of Friday night? Then I would be able to have a night out at the club without YK affecting anything. Instead, I feel cheated out of a weekend!",

      "text": "This is somewhat of a rant on a throwaway account. I've always hated the spiritual stress of the yomim tovim (RH, but mainly YK). I grew up in a Chabad environment, so I know the whole shpeal about how it's not about being judged, fire and brimstone, etc etc etc... but I still hate it. I don't want to go to shul at all on YK. My wife conversely loves YK and always has.\n\nOver the past year I've struggled increasingly with feeling connected to G-d, and in turn this has effected my ability to fulfill the day-to-day Jewish routines.\n\nDavening has become a chore I'd rather not do, Tefillen has become something I've more often than not within the past few weeks done with just Shema and Amida while skipping on the rest of Shacharis. Today, I didn't even do that. I made excuses about not being able to with other family responsibilities that was happening, but if I'm being honest that's a lie I was telling myself as I rushed out the door. If I really wanted to, I could have done it in 5 min or less... but what's the point if I feel like I'm just faking it? There was a time when I made a point to plan ahead and get it done even earlier to account for the time needed for davening, essentially putting my religious obligations first and foremost and I thought I was strong in this conviction.\n\nFor close to a year and a half I was going to Torah classes every morning as apart of my routine before work, but always had a difficulty internalizing the lessons on any level I could feel or take with me.\n\nI have kids, young kids and I've been trying to keep up with it all for their sake. Reminding them and helping them with the blessings, doing their sing-along davening with them, talking about the parsha etc... but it feels hypocritical, I feel like a hypocrite but I don't want them to feel as crappy as I do about Judaism. I want them to have a feeling of love and connection to Judaism and G-d.\n\nI wear a kippah and tzitzit every day, and have never thought about not wearing one. I would probably feel weird if I didn't, but I feel like a hypocrite to wear one when I know I'm not living up to a frum lifestyle under the surface--with the lack of davening, now tefillen, learning, internalizing etc.\n\nI don't want to feel this way, and aside from therapy that I've been in for four years I've tried the sincere davening to G-d. I've cried, wept, promised, begged for help, then clarity, then peace, then finally just some relief from the things and feelings I've been struggling with... I'm burned out.\n\nI don't know what I'm looking for with this post. I guess answers, but also just validation.",

      "text": "There are moments in life that bend time,  \nWhere past and present meet at the edge of a single breath,  \nTo make space for miracles,  \nAnd two weeks from now will mark one of those moments.   \nTwo weeks from now,  \nMy mother will walk back into a Sephardic synagogue,  \nFor the first time in over fifty years.  \nShe will walk back into her own forgotten life,  \nNot just as daughter,  \nNot just as keeper,  \nBut as a guest, a ghost,  \nCrossing the threshold.  \nOf a world she thought had burned to ash.  \n\nThis time, she will enter my own Sephardic synagogue.  \nNot just on any Shabbat, either,  \nBut the EXACT hundredth anniversary.  \nOf her own Synagogue's birth and inauguration,  \nThe crown jewel of Jewish life,  \nThat once thrived in Lebanon,  \nThe very Synagogue she belonged to,  \nWhere her bones learned how to be Sephardic.  \nAugust 2nd, 1925.  \nAugust 2nd, 2025.  \nThese dates loop like sacred thread,  \nAnd this story feels like a flickering flame,  \nSmoldering like an ember,  \nWaiting to be reignited,  \nLong after it was threatened with extinction.  \nThese dates feel like sacred coordinates,  \nLike G-ds very fingerprints at work.  \n\nAfter she fled Lebanon in the 1960's,  \nAfter the flames,  \nAfter the violence,  \nAfter her synagogue stood in ruins,  \nShe let it all go.  \nAnd who could blame her?  \nThe night sky of Lebanon had cracked with fire.  \nShe and her family stood in a hollow airport,  \nBattered bags pressed tightly to their chests,  \nThe world unraveling beneath their feet,  \nBecause suddenly,  \nTo be Jewish was to be hunted,  \nAnd to be forced to vanish into silence or death.  \n\nShe crossed oceans,  \nAnd built a different life.  \nNot in French, Hebrew, or Arabic,  \nBut in English.  \nNot with blessings on the lips,  \nBut with silence.  \nShe raised me in the secular world.  \nNo mezuzot.  \nNo Kiddush.  \nNo zemirot on Shabbat.  \nJust faint echoes.  \nThe melodies of Fairuz, Umm Kulthum, and Farid al-Atrash.   \nThe Hamod my Teta cooked.  \nThe soft glow of secretive Chanukah candles.  \nThe sporadic, annual Chabad Shabbat dinners.  \nMy Bat Mitzvah amidst the palm trees of the tropics.  \nSomehow, the echoes found me, though.  \n\nI fled, too.  \nFrom a different kind of war.  \nFrom a home that had turned dangerous,  \nWith nothing but one small bag.  \nAnd the clothes on my back,  \nJust the way she did.  \nThe day I fled,  \nI could almost *feel* her presence,  \nHalf a world away,  \nYet right there in the terminal with me,  \nThe whoosh and jolt of the aerotrain beneath my feet,  \nConstantly peering over my shoulder,  \nIn fear danger might still be lurking right behind me.  \nBoarding pass nervously fluttering in my hands,  \nNot knowing if or when I would ever return to the life I knew.  \nFeeling the upward tilt of the airplane,  \nAnd finally exhaling as I peered out of my window,  \nAs the ground beneath me grew smaller and more distant,  \nThe question flashed across my mind like a crack of thunder:  \nWas this what it was like for my mother,  \nWhen she fled Lebanon,  \nNot knowing what life held in store for her?  \n\nI too started again,  \nFrom nothing,  \nBut somehow,  \nI found my way back to everything.  \nI walked back into our heritage,  \nOur people.  \nBack to the roots she buried.  \nBack to the name she was born with,  \nWhich I've reclaimed as my own,  \nNot just legally,  \nBut spiritually,  \nThat I now wear as a banner and blessing.  \nI've found my way back to our Sephardic life,  \nThe first family member in over fifty years,  \nTo find my way back to a life of observance.  \nTo Torah.  \nTo Kashrut.  \nTo G-d.  \nTo tradition.  \nTo the melodies she forgot she knew.  \nTo the soul we both still carry,  \nEven after all the forgetting.  \n\nAnd now, she will be coming back too.  \nShe will sit beside me on Shabbat,  \nWith prayers rising all around her,  \nLike incense rustling from swaying cedars.  \nI wonder what it will feel like for her,  \nTo hear the Chazzan sing,  \nJust as her father did as the Chazzan of her synagogue.   \nShe may not remember the words,  \nBut I wonder if her bones will remember the ache.  \nShe will smell ḥamod again,  \nAnd remember her own Teta's kitchen.  \nTo hear a rabbi chant in a cadence,  \nThat matches her father’s memory.  \nI wonder if she will remember the Brachot.  \nIf she'll remember when to sit and stand,  \nWithout even knowing why.  \nI wonder if her eyes will water when no one’s looking,  \nThe same way mine do.  \nI wonder if it will feel like mourning,  \nOr perhaps like resurrection.  \n\nI’ve prepared a table.  \nI’ve planned a Kiddush.  \nNot because she asked,  \nBut because something holy demanded it.  \nSomething that remembers our family,  \nEven when they tried to forget it.  \nThey left that life in rubble,  \nBut I've rebuilt life from those ruins.  \nMy mother birthed me once,  \nAnd now I get to bring her back to life,  \nIn a different way.  \nThis isn’t just a visit.  \nIt’s a return.  \nA sacred reckoning.  \nA soft thunderclap in the soul.  \nWe don’t need to say everything.  \nWe never do.  \nBut I want her to know,  \nThis is not coincidence.  \nThis is kavanah.  \nThis is the hand of G-d,  \nAnd when she steps into the synagogue,  \nShe will not be alone.  \nI hope she feels them.  \nBaba.  \nTeta.  \nThe vivid blue of her own Synagogue.  \nOur ancestors.  \nThe ghosts of Beirut, Aley, and Bhamdoun.  \nAll of them.  \nAnd me,  \nHer daughter who came home,  \nSo she could, too.  \nI stand not just as her daughter,  \nBut as her witness,  \nAs her continuation,  \nHer return.  \n\nLike a cedar that still sways,  \nAs I  continue my journey of Teshuva,  \nThis visit too will represent the root that reaches back,  \nThe new branch growing towards the light,  \nCarrying forward her rhythm into today.  \nSoon, we will sit not just in a sanctuary,  \nBut in a miracle.  \nToday, as we enter Shabbat,  \nI feel the chilling poignancy of the miracle soon to unfold.  \n**Shabbat Shalom.**",

      "title": "What draws people with no relation to Judaism to Judaism?",
      "text": "I come from a family of hardcore Protestant fundamentalists, the southern variety. Lots of preachers and even when not preachers, generally pretty devout. There are some exceptions scattered about, but not a whole lot. \n\nI'm the main exception, being that I am the most outspoken atheist of the lot, and the other two family atheists that come to mind are my nephew and uncle. My nephew doesn't really care about the subject so it doesn't come up very often. He sort of lives very separately from the family where I try to stay a lot more connected despite our vast differences. My uncle is a wealthy lawyer and because of the clientelle he serves (mostly fundamentalists), he tends to keep it pretty quiet, unless around family. \n\nThere is one interesting conclusion that the three of us all reached independently of each other, however: if we were to convert to any religion, it would be Judaism. \n\nI know my own reasons but if I had to hazard a guess, the other two would agree with at least one of mine, that being the intellectual traditions of Judaism. \n\nWe could obviously leave it at that and say \"well, yes, Judaism has an interesting intellectual history and tradition that draws people who are into that kind of thing\" but I'm not sure that's *enough*. \n\nWhat I mean is, there is also a long history of terrible antisemitism. Even if it's not overt, as it isn't in my family, it's often there to some extent. Whatever draw Judaism has possessed has been historically rebuffed by that undercurrent. The Christians in my family may be Zionists, but it's a sheer technicality. Their eschatology requires Israel to be \"complete\" (whatever you take that to mean) in order for the apocalyptic events of Revelation to unfold. They don't care about Jews at all. \n\nThere's probably a wider conversation to be had here about what Judaism means to Gentiles with no particular relation or exposure to it. \n\nYes, we live in a time of incredibly intense antisemitism once more, but it also seems like something had changed under the surface. Like, somehow it has become the case that people with no connections to Judaism have become more \"aware\" of it. This seems like a distinct change from moments of heightened antisemitism in the past. There are still the usual antisemitic canards scattered about the culture, but there's some draw *towards* Judaism underneath it all. \n\nAnybody else well-read on Nietzsche might wonder if the connection is about the nihilism of our time versus the grand story of humanity that Judaism offers. He was of the perspective that the Jewish people were profound creators of their own destiny as a people. The return of Israel to the world has certainly added currency to that thought. \n\nWhether a person really believes in the spiritual bits of Judaism or not, it would be hard to deny that the religion has been a profound uniting force for the Jewish people, and it has changed the course of history repeatedly. It's probably hard to not have some kind of admiration for that, if you're a certain type of person. \n\nThe internet might open the world up to currents of antisemitism that people naively assumed had been consigned to the dustbin of history, but I suspect it has done exactly the opposite as well, and drawn a lot of people towards Judaism. \n\nAll of that said, I wouldn't expect to be a convert anytime soon, but I am completely fascinatined by this thing that it seems like it being overlooked. Only a few other people seem to have noticed it, including Rabbi Tovia Singer. (Whatever one thinks of him – I certainly have plenty of criticisms, but he has noticed the same thing I have.)\n\nWhat do you think? Have any of you noticed what I'm talking about?",

I couldn't be happier.\n\nI believe one thing that I should be transparent about in my journey is that I am a diagnosed schizophrenic.\n\nAs a bit of background information, I grew up non-denominational christian and, in my household, I was told that demons were at play and my schizophrenia, although diagnosed and medicated, was not real. This is many christian's approach to severe mental illness, in my *personal* experience.\n\nIf my schizophrenia did not make spirituality slightly more difficult, I would probably only bring it up if I was actively episodic and needed some help– but I feel it necessary to mention my diagnosis to the synagogue's Rabbi as my schizophrenia may play tricks on me during my journey.\n\nHowever, I am nervous that this will change people's perception of me and I will be seen as strange. I will say that I am medicated and genuinely happy, and I work hard to not appear strange to others so people seldom suspect there is even anything wrong– to which I am glad.\n\nIn your experience, how has the Jewish community– particularly and most relevant to me, the Reform Jewish community– treated people with schizophrenia? Is this something I should even talk about? Or should I just be genuine and pray for the best? Thank you all!",

      "text": "Erev tov everyone,\n\n  \nI've been getting closer to completing my conversion, and I've been tackling some deeper parts of Jewish writing and theology. I've been poking around Chabad's website, and have found a lot of really interesting (and conflicting) ideas about angels, mainly the following:\n\n1. In [this](https://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/420549/jewish/Pestered-By-Angels.htm) article by Yaakov Paley, he describes the importance of talking to angels:\n\n\"Not being privy to such Divine radiance, the angels will ask questions of the Jewish people, who have been \"over there,\" and who are familiar with the details involved. \"You are a son of Israel, tell me...\" The loftiest spiritual beings have not and are not destined to \"sit before the Holy One as a student sits before his teacher\"--the privilege to be bestowed upon the Children of Israel ([Midrash](https://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/2398444/jewish/Midrash.htm) Rabbah)--they will therefore approach those who are \"in the know\" for updates.\n\nA lesser angel may timidly approach you to comprehend how it was created by a father reciting the Friday night *Kiddush* on a cup of sparkling wine, and another radiant seraph may beg for an insight into its formation from an act of charity. And don't be bowled over when a giant of a trembling angel approaches you with expectant awe, and inquires, \"You were over 'there' today; what's the latest? What is He doing now...?\"\"\n\nI realize he's one guy on a website, but he claims that these ideas come from Rashi (without a citation).\n\n  \n2. In [this](https://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/692875/jewish/What-Are-Angels.htm#footnoteRef10a692875) article by Baruch Davidson (listed as a Chabad rabbi), there's a mention of some angels having the job of taking prayers to heaven, with the Zohar being cited. My Hebrew isn't good enough to translate the specific passage, but it might help clear up this quote:\n\n  \n\"Some angels are created for one specific task, and upon the task's completion cease to exist. According to the Zohar one of the angels' tasks is to transport our words of prayer and Torah-study before G‑d's throne.\"\n\n  \nI mainly bring it up because there's some very heavy language being used here. There's big imagery and ideas that sound like praying *to* angels or at least visualizing them in an unusual way. I also realize that Chabad doesn't speak for every Haredi or Hasidic group, but I would be curious if this kind of language is common elsewhere. \n\nI've been doing tons of digging through sources, but I can't find any good answers. At what point does mysticism contradict core elements of prayer and how we think about God? I've seen people here say that the very idea of an intelligent angel is something foreign to Judaism, so where can we draw a comfortable line?",

      "title": "Guilt turning me away from judaism",
      "text": "I know the title sounds strange, but I don't know how else to phrase it. My situation is quite complicated, but I will try to give some context. Sorry in advance because this is a long one. \n\nGrowing up we weren't particularly religious, a little, but I can best discribe it as a very, very relaxed version of reform. But, when I was 14, my mom (very suddenly) decided we were all going to baal teshuva and tried to raise us orthodox (she liked to say ultra-orthodox) from then on. It was very difficult for me because it was literally going from one day living the way \"everyone else did\" to the next having so many rules \"no TV, no music, throw away all your pants, cover your head, no going out on Friday's or Saturday's, no eating anything you like/ used to eat, don't talk to male classmates (this was particularly difficult cause growing up I was always a bit of a Tomboy so most of my friends were boys)\" etc. The whole nine yards. It was hard, but I complied because I wanted to be good. \n\nBut sadly, things escalated to a life less based on Judaism and more based on my mom's untreated mental illness. For example, making me step into an ice cold shower at 3am because I was \"not pure\" and needed to be \"cleansed\". This messed up my idea of Judaism/religion in general. So, due to abuse and other situations, I moved out at 17. Growing up before the \"switch\" was also very difficult because of my mom's illness, I had once been placed in another home by \"CPS\" (I don't live in the U. S.), but now religion had become her weapon, so to speak. Therefore, when I moved out I became secular all together, unable to handle even thinking about religion at the time. Never an atheist, but I just tried to never think about religion. A few years later I was feeling empty, so I decided to explore judaism again. Tehillim here and there, gratitude, hitbodedut, short morning prayers. But I always struggled with the guilt of living the way I lived. Don't get me wrong, I wasn't doing anything crazy. But you know every time I ate a pizza with cheese and meat on it or stayed up studying for a college exam on a friday night, I had a lot of anxiety afterwards. \n\nI also struggled a lot with the guilt of feeling that I wasn't doing enough. I've posted before (not sure if here but for sure in Facebook groups and other Jewish forums) asking for advice because the lack of motivation doesn't let me be consistent with my practice. People always reply nicely, saying things like \"do what you can\", but I still feel bad. For a lack of a better way to explain it, I practice judaism a few months then go back to secular for a few other. And I've lived in that cycle for the past 8 years. \n\nI'm now entering my thirties, and have a partner and a two year old. The extent of my partner's jewish practice is limited to \"I believe in HaShem and trust he's got my back\" and fasting on Yom Kippur, but that's it. He doesn't really do anything else except hitbodedut 3 or 4 times a year. We have celebrated the High Holiday's for the past three years, but it's been mostly because I wanted to. I'm okay with this, but he can't really advise me on how I feel. I want my child to grow up knowing HaShem loves him and takes care of him, but I don't want to inflict trauma on him like my mom did to me. For the past six months I haven't been religious at all. I had been doing some small things here and there but just stopped all together because I got depressed. If I didn't do things \"perfectly\" I felt terrible, and if I did something like eat a pizza or watch a movie I'd start feeling very guilty, and the anxiety everything was causing me just became too unbearable again. So now the only religious thing I still do is touch my mezuzah when I leave and enter my home. But that's it. I think about my child and feel sad because I don't want to raise him atheist... And now we're in that time of the year, that month we should use to reflect before judgment day. And I feel so sad,so guilty and very scared. Because I don't want HaShem to be mad at me. But I think about Rosh Hashanah, for example, and get so much anxiety. Because I don't know what I'll do that day. I was checking and I have an exam (second major) that night and I'm already feeling guilty about taking it. I can't ask for an exemption because it has to be a letter from an official Rabbi from my country for it to count but I don't live near any synagogues. \n\nWhich brings me to address some things I know people might comment or want to know. Firstly, I know I need therapy. I've been going in and out of it for most of my adult life, depending on if I can afford it. These past six months that I've been depressed I was seeing a therapist but I stopped going recently because of some issues with her approach to things (interrupted me when I was speaking, said I didn't need to talk to her about the things I wanted to, etc). As soon as I can afford finding another professional, I'll do it. But still, regarding my spiritual/religious experience, mental health professionals always tell me to look for a \"leader in my community\" to ask them, because they can't advise me on it. Which brings me to my second point, I am not part of any Jewish communities except for here on reddit and on Facebook. I watch a lot of videos from breslev and use the app insta Rabbi sometimes to ask questions but, you know, it's not really personalized. I buy many books and other things from a \"jewish shop\" (sorry, don't know the word in English) that's almost two hours away from my home but they are orthodox so, I don't really know the owners. It's also complicated because if I read something difficult I get demotivated as well. For example, I read that it's prohibited for women to use birth control unless a Rabbi says it's okay. That made me spiral because my pregnancy was high risk and I'm still having some health issues two years later, so I use birth control because (to me) it's too risky to get pregnant again right now. And yeah, I know life is not supposed to be about doing whatever you want. But it's difficult to reconcile things in my mind. Anyways, my mom always asks me to come to her Rabbi's synagogue, but again, they are orthodox. So yeah, sorry for trauma dumping all of this I guess, but that's why I'm turning to you guys for advice, you're all I have 😅.\n\nAnyways, I just wish I could pray without feeling sad or scared while doing it. I wish I could read tehillim consistently without feeling like the worst human being on the planet for skipping a day. I wish I could just feel like I deserve to be alive and that I deserve good things that happen to me :( I'm at a loss on what to do. For the upcoming holidays and in general. If any of you have any advice or solidarity I'd really appreciate it. If not, then thank you for reading me.",

      "title": "Reflecting on my first Shavuos experience!",
      "text": "So, my long Jewish journey was recently marked by my first exposure to Shavuos, which was also my first time studying Torah in a minyan, and my second time I've gone into my local Chabad house. The rabbi there seems to be a great man. I'm joining through a conservative shul, and my rabbi is also a great guy who is teaching me a lot in my class. So, my experience at Chabad was great, as it was in my first Pesach. We studied Torah, and did Yizkor prayers. My experience with studying Torah was interesting. I've been hesitant to study Torah, because I'm a pretty secular guy, and as evinced by previous posts, the secular people in my life have not been supportive of me embracing the heritage of my father's side.\n\nI tried, while studying Torah and saying Yizkor prayers, to imagine all the other Jews who've read the passages, and who said those prayers. We did the kaddish for those we've lost, a bunch of prayers for the hostages and the family of those members of Chabad who've died, and I said Mi Sheberach for my Jewish mentor, who is a lovely old woman fighting cancer. She's my friend, a teacher, and a surrogate Jewish mother to me. Then we ate a bunch of ice cream and cheese based foods. Meatless lasagna, pasta with cheese and tomato sauce, pizza rolls for the kids. Had a great chat with the former director of my shul who left it to support the Chabad house. He helped them reopen after covid, and he made sure to get one of those nice memorial board things, with the lights on them? Don't know what they're called, but my shul has one. He bought one for the Chabad house. Damn nice man.\n\nHonestly, the rabbi and his son were saying the prayers so fast, I think there was a little bit of niggunim happening. They brought out the scrolls from the ark, twice that night. They go by, and people were kissing their fingertips and touching the covers of the scrolls. So I did as they did. There was a woman there who asked the rabbi, why segregate the genders during the prayers? \"Us men are easily distracted by beautiful women,\" he says. I think she knew why, and she was just being coy, wanted to flirt with the rabbi a bit. It was news to me that the rabbi is training his son, Mendel, to be a chazzan. He led much of the prayers that night. Don't think he had been bar mitzvahed yet. He was maybe 11 or so, to my untrained eye? Seems devoted to help his dad, did the prayers fantastically. Tried to go faster than the rabbi, I think. All in all, good time.\n\nYou know, I'm dipping my toe in the spiritual end of Judaism. Thought it would feel foreign and weird to me. Not too shabby, actually. I'm very comfortable with silently speaking prayers and shuckling. Wish I knew the melodies for the prayers, though. Obviously prayed and shuckled without a tallis, because I'm not an official member of the tribe yet, but I will be one day. Now, I'm not a drinker. A lot of alcoholism in the family, so I don't drink. Most alcoholic drinks taste bad to me, but I've decided I could like that Fabrengen wine. That sweet red. I'm really not one for drinking, but so far that's been the only drinkable booze for me.\n\nThere were a good 40 or so adults, and maybe a dozen kids there. Great turnout. One of the middle aged women, I think her name was Dorothy, she was herding these little kids running around the Chabad house. She says to me, \"get in there and have some cheesecake before it's gone! The kids will eat the sweets up fast!\" It was really nice. They actually ran out of siddurim. A few people needed to share. Obviously, Chabad uses the Gudnik chumash. I'm just learning about the differences in siddurim and chumash. I've learned about the Rebbe, and honestly he's a really cool guy. I want to go visit the Ohel in New York City. I would like to talk to the Chabad Rabbi about the Rebbe at some point, but I also don't want to put out the idea that I would become Chasidim. I don't want to lead him on, you know?\n\nThere were a couple dozen Very Old Jews there for Yizkor and Shavuos. Most everyone was able bodied, but I really wanted to help a few of them get around. There was one woman, looked to be in her 80s, she had four slightly younger people with her, the poor girl had a leg in a cast. One old man came up to me, pulled me close, he saw my Magen David. I wear it pretty proudly nowadays. I don't tend to associate it with the modern Netanyahu government, I view it as a 3 millennia old symbol of a people. \"Where did you buy that, was it here? I want one! So good to see the young people proud of their heritage!\" I poured him some grape juice, he couldn't have wine. He sort of leaned on me a bit to walk around, \"oh, I hope you don't mind, I'm an old man, it's hard to get around anymore!\" Normally I'm uncomfortable with strangers touching me, but that was fine. He didn't bother me at all.\n\nI saw old Jews reading Torah, young children as little as two, sitting under the tallis, laughing and shouting as the rabbi threw them candy for sitting through the prayers. I looked at little Mendel, soon to have his bar mitzvah, learning how to be a chazzan from his dad. He was proud to lead prayers. An man in his 50s or 60s who was signing to and guiding an older deaf man in his 80s. I saw generations of one big family. And then something my mentor had been saying suddenly hit me. \"Mishpacha.\" Family. She's always telling me, \"you need Yiddishkeit.\" I'm interested in the history, the culture, how it feels to be Jewish. What I felt in that moment was being a part of this huge thing, so much bigger than me. 3000 years of survival. Love. I have never felt more Jewish than in that moment. I felt connected.\n\nAm Yisrael Chai.",

I’m not a frum looking guys, except I’ve started wearing tzitzit and keeping my head covered, usually with a hat, but a kippah at home, and synagogue obvs. We are going on a trip to Montreal and Vermont this week. I don’t necessarily want to tuck in my tzitzit, as I’ve only started to wear them out and I’ve been gaining a lot spiritually from them. However, I’m not opposed to tucking them in, as my life and safety of my family is important. \n\nI know it all doom and gloom about pro-pali protests in Canadian cities and schools getting shot up, but how unsafe safe is it?\n\nI’m coming from a somewhat rural, western, area so not many Jews. But also not a whole lot of knowledge as to what Jews look like.\n\nIs it safe?",

      "title": "Giving Permission to Each Other",
      "text": "In the Shacharis (morning) prayer, the ArtScroll translation notes that the six-winged angels ask one another for permission before saying “Holy, Holy, Holy” to Hashem. At first, this seems difficult. Why would they need to ask permission?\n\nTo approach this question, we can look at a metaphor from engineering:\n\nIn distributed computing, a self-stabilizing system is one that can recover from any arbitrary or faulty starting state using only local information. These systems don’t rely on central control; instead, each node adjusts based on feedback from its immediate neighbors. A classic example is Dijkstra’s self-stabilizing ring: a network arranged in a circle where each node checks and corrects itself by looking only at those beside it. Over time, the system as a whole returns to a correct and stable state—without any single part taking over.\n\nNow consider this principle in a spiritual context.\n\nParashas Naso offers an example of self-stabilization within the Torah’s legal framework. In Numbers 5:10, the Torah discusses gifts designated for the Kohanim. Without guidance, the Kohanim might have assumed they could take these gifts by force, since the Torah entitles them to receive them. But Rashi notes that the Torah says, “a man’s holy things shall be his”—teaching that the tovas hana’ah, the right to give the gift and enjoy the giving, remains with the giver. This detail preserves the giver’s spiritual agency and prevents what might otherwise be a sanctioned form of theft.\n\nIn engineering terms, this is a feedback mechanism. The Torah anticipates an unintended consequence of its own law and corrects it from within, by layering the legal structure with moral consideration outside the text Moses received at Sinai. It doesn’t rely on a prophet or a judge to step in; the system repairs itself by means of its own oral tradition. \n\nA second example appears earlier, in Numbers 4:22. Hashem tells Moshe to count the descendants of Gershon “as well.” Although Gershon was the eldest son of Levi, his family was not listed first—because the Kehathites, who carried the Ark, were. The Bechor Shor explains that the inclusion of “as well” was the Torah’s way of correcting any appearance of disrespect toward Gershon. The parsha even begins with the word “Naso”—“elevate”—to emphasize Gershon’s value.\n\nRav Moshe Feinstein writes that although Gershon’s tasks were less sacred than those of Kehath, they were equally necessary. Here again, we see the Torah embedding feedback into its oral supplement to protect against harmful perceptions and to preserve dignity across roles.\n\nReturning to the angels: what appears to be a delay or inefficiency—asking permission to praise Hashem—is actually a sign of stability. Each angel checks with its neighbor. Like the nodes in a ring network, they do not rush forward on their own initiative, This is not a lack of agency, but a design of interdependence, where harmony matters at least as much as truth.\n\nJust as the Torah creates systems that regulate themselves through mutual awareness—of dignity, of risk, of unintended consequences—so too the angels model a cosmic version of distributed spiritual order. Their need to seek permission from one another reflects the highest unity, not fragmentation. The praise that results is not one angel’s outburst but a chorus: self-checking, balanced, and holy.\n\nMay our own service reflect this balance, and may our learning bring us closer to a world aligned in harmony and praise, with the coming of Moshiach speedily in our days.",

He also said that the differences that Spinoza had with the Sephardi Jews of Amsterdam that led to his herem were more to do with personal conflict than spiritual conflict.\n\nWe didn't have much time to get into detail on the subject, so I wanted to ask about it here. I haven't had the time to do detailed research and reading on the subject myself; what opinions do Jewish thinkers and theologians generally have on Spinoza, his philosophy and his life? What about the concept of pantheism (or the related panentheism) in general? Do people have any source recommendations for me to learn more about pantheism in Judaism, about Spinoza's life and relationship with the Jewish community, etc.?",

I learn what I could, the three branches, the history, the main thinkers, the myths about Siddhartha Gautama. Then I learned a little about this religion from a sociological perspective in my country. I spent hours in a public library doing the gruntwork, from very little and general books to more specialized readings.\n\nProblem is: I never met a single buddhist in my country, they're a really small minority. And I feel like books can only lead me this far, without talking to actual buddhists. My book knowledge feels like a bone without flesh and nerves.\n\nSo I have three questions: one about rituals, one about faith and one about myths.\n\nAs buddhists, what are the rituals you practice socially to manifest your faith?\n\nIs this faith something you feel the need to manifest? Is there a ritual where you claim \"yes, I'm a buddhist and this is my act of devotion\" kind of moment? And is this moment something individual and intimate, or do you prefer something more social?\n\nWhat are the most important stories which help you build your spirituality? What life anecdote about the Buddha or other sages are the most significant to you?\n\n\n\nI must ad, and considering the number of trolls, this is important: this is not sealioning to talk about my own atheism with the replies. I'm not here to judge, debate or criticize your answers, that's not my point and I will have probably nothing to say but 'thank you'.",

So far my learnings center around a podcast - The Secular Buddhist - as well as a book, “What the Buddha Taught” by Walpola Rahula. \n\nPerhaps it’s my own upbringing coming to bias my understanding of what I’m learning - but the Buddha’s teachings feel extremely human-centric and - at its core - free of religion. \n\nYet the couple times I come to this sub I am surprised by the language of afterlife and deities and other religious aspects. \n\nI am by no means asking “am I wrong, or are you wrong”. The answers here won’t move me from the path I am walking - but I don’t want to operate out of ignorance of what others believe. \n\nI hope this is enough information to begin a dialogue, but if an aspect of what I have said thus far leaves questions for you, please ask. \n\nEdit : thank you everyone for taking the time to provide insight and perspective!",

With Judaism, Christianity, and Islam all under the purview of \"Abrahamic religions,\" denoting they all come from Abraham and otherwise accept the same general ideas and mythos (e.g., all three believe there is one deity they all worship, they share many of the the same stories in Genesis and Exodus), I wonder if it would be better to conceptualize Buddhism similarly as \"Buddhist religions.\" \n\nHas anyone in an academic setting tried this before? And what are the thoughts of other fellow Buddhists?\n\nEdit: I mentioned \"Abrahamic religions\" because within Judaism, Christianity, and Islam there is more conformity within those three religions than between them, but they all share common themes, beliefs, traditions, etc. They have different source texts, and different cannons even within their religions, but have overlap. Similarly, in Buddhism we don't all have the same cannon, accept different teachers, and even have different conceptualizationd of the path we walk, but we share some overlapping beliefs.",

He says this about other sects and other religions, \"Thus, one should know all the tenets of the religions of Buddhism and non-Buddhism-for example, other religions, Bönpos, the Chan Buddhists, the Nyingma, the Kagyus, the Sakya, the Geluks, and so forth—to be the emanations of the buddhas and bodhisattvas.\" Now in Buddhism I haven’t found this acceptance of other religions quite on this level, saying that other religions are the manifestation of the enlightened Buddhas. Are there any other masters of any Buddhist sect with this view? I am a religious pluralist myself, my time in western philosophy I’ve viewed that in religious differences of mysticism especially between religions like Sufi Islam, Hinduism and Buddhism there are language barriers that prevent people from seeing the strong similarities in these systems. I do feel like in terms of a lot of mystical philosophy especially in certain sects of Hinduism the conception of God is largely the same as Buddhist concepts of ultimate reality, but that maybe a controversial view on this subreddit but it has been a researched topic in academia for awhile now. But I’m curious to see if anything like this is present with other masters in Buddhism whether in Mahayana or Theravada. Or maybe any scriptures to support this view? Thank you",

Those beliefs vary from historically compatible, like indigenous folk religion, to antithetical, like Christianity or materialistic atheism. \n\nHistorically, Buddhism mixed with different cultures and faiths depending on skillful means and the capabilities of the people practicing there. Millions of lay Buddhists in the world venerate gods or spirits while also worshipping the Buddha.\n\nIs there a point at which another belief system cannot be mixed with Buddhism? And what red flags or indicators should one watch for to make sure that added belief does not dilute their Buddhist practice?",

      "text": "I was wondering if anyone has read Orthodoxy And The Religion Of The Future? Or if anyone here is an ex-Christian who has a good understanding of philosophy and theology? Basically, from what I understand Rose thinks eastern religions are without foundation and are based on logically fallacies (as opposed to Christianity) and are being pushed on the world to create a global religion that rejects Christ. He also thinks they appeal to pride in humans. Do you think this is true? I only ask because I have a Christian family member who thinks I'm being influenced by demons because I'm into eastern thought and he recommended me this book. \n\nHis quote:\n\n>  \nZen has, in fact, no theological foundation, relying entirely on \"experience\" and thus falling into the \"pragmatic fallacy\" that has already been noted earlier in this book, in the chapter on Hinduism: \"If it works, it must be true and good.\" Zen, without any theology, is no more able than Hinduism to distinguish between good and evil spiritual experiences; it can only state what seems to be good because it brings \"peace\" and \"harmony,'' as judged by the natural powers of the mind and not by any revelation — everything else it rejects as more or less illusory. Zen appeals to the subtle pride — so widespread today — of those who think they can save themselves, and thus have no need of any Saviour outside themselves.",

      "text": "I’m not the wisest by any means, but after some thinking about why an eternal hell might exist, I’d define religion not by a god, but as ‘something which provides an answer for the predominant suffering in the world.\n\nI looked down on christians before, because I thought many of them were fools who put themselves in terrible situations in life, and now need a delusional christ to counteract their stupidity. Now I see that they’re smarter than me. They understand more of the sorrow in this world than I do, and see that the suffering in this life does not nearly compare to the joy. Therefore, the only explanation that life should be allowed to continue to exist, is to believe in Jesus. Then, just by living, you demonstrate your faith in him. Now I get why there’s no “evil” in eastern religions. There is just ignorance which  some possess.\n\nThroughout my life, I commit small sins, such as stealing or lying, but I’m ignorant to the negative which spreads from this; which is much like the butterfly effect. When you put into perspective how one bad day from yourself, can transfer to another person, and through them, even more, you realize that life is really, mostly suffering. Even though I’ve had happy moments, it was interrupted by so many… small and annoying setbacks. I don’t think the happy times are entirely a lack of pain—but it definitely accounts for a lot of the “joy”.\n\nNow, I feel that a lack of spirituality comes from a stupid ignorance surrounding suffering. Maybe I’m over-exaggerating how bad life is, but I still find that last statement to be true. One thing enlightenment maybe requires comes from understanding all the sorrow that’s possible to experience maybe? Until there’s nothing left to feel, and until all ignorance is erased.\n\nI meditate, but barely read as much buddhists texts as I should. Please educate me on this matter and show me how much I have no idea what I’m talking about haha. 🙏",

      "text": "Note: I'm defining \"major world religion\" as \"over 100 million followers.\" There are other definitions of major you could use, but I think this one is defensible, in terms of follower impact.\n\nAs for why I claim Buddhism does well here: one of the precepts is \"Do not traffic in human beings.\" This pretty clearly - probably more clearly than anything else - applies to slavery. And while it isn't an outright ban, if a good Buddhist can't buy and sell slaves -  if there's something there that's un-Buddhist - then I think it's a short, natural step to say that a committed Buddhist shouldn't own slaves either. Why would it be bad to buy and sell slaves, but okay to own them, especially since to own a slave, you must buy one? And from there, you're pretty close to building a case that there shouldn't be any slaves, period.   \n  \nIn terms of the other major world religions: they seem to tiptoe around the topic and not make any disavowing statements quite as strongly as Buddhism does, where to hold the precepts you must not be a slave-trader. In Christianity for example there is the famous saying from Galatians 3:28: \"There is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither slave nor free, there is no male and female, for you are all one in Christ Jesus.\" And yet, in those times, male and female were clearly useful, even essential, categories. So it ends up being a statement that perhaps you should treat those people as equals in some metaphysical sense, but not in social, practical ones: meaning those divisions, like \"slave\" and \"free\", can persist.\n\nAnd I do think that this has had more of an impact than people might think: besides the obvious historical ones, even in how seriously people take the religion today.\n\nI used to be Catholic, a religion with an estimated 1.3 billion followers. I don't think this had an impact in the sense that many people leave because of the religion's position on slavery (which is: against, today). But I think that historically it caused an orientation towards being neutral to okay with slavery, and the consequences of that, in history, were very damaging over time. There are MANY lukewarm to disbelieving ex-Catholics today, who keep the religion at arms' length because of its relation to history. And the comfortableness with slavery, or slave-like conditions, is a major contributing factor. In the USA for example, I think that the sense in which a slave-owner could also be an upstanding Christian hurt the religion that was here over time, in terms of discrediting it in the eyes of future generations. These things matter, not only to hardcore believers, but also to regular people.\n\nI thought this was useful food for thought, and something to ponder when considering ethical behavior.",

      "text": "Christianity is often thought of as the child of Judaism, and for good reason. The Bible is told as a narrative from the perspective of the Jewish tradition. For Christians, Christ is viewed as the fulfillment of the prophecy foretold in the Old Testament.\n\nBut let's step back for a moment and examine this...when one looks at Christianity as a \"continuation\" of a story, it actually seems much more like an \"answer\" to (or progression) from the Buddhist story, not Judaism.\n\nWhether or not you believe Christ traveled to India or learned from wandering Buddhist monks, one thing is certain: There are 18 years of Christ's life we have no account for. From 12 to 29, nobody knows where Jesus was, what he was doing or how he developed spiritually. This is very unusual, given that Jesus was already a \"known\" figure at age 12 when he debated with Jewish elders in the Temple.\n\nI think it's safe to say that something important likely happened during these years, but we don't know what.\n\nBut regardless of whether Jesus learned about Buddhism during these years, let's just look at the narratives of each religion:\n\n**Buddhist narrative:** Consciousness is eternal, there is a direct pathway to Enlightenment and Enlightenment is the ultimate state of one's true consciousness. Buddha himself never claimed to be a direct representation of this consciousness, but rather showed his followers the way to achieve it. In that sense, he might be considered a prophet or teacher rather than a direct manifestation of higher consciousness.\n\n**Christian Narrative:** Christ is the physical human embodiment of the higher consciousness (God), the son of God. In the context of this post, Buddha was the prophet of pure consciousness, Christ was the direct manifestation of it.\n\nIn some ways, Buddhism, Christianity and Judaism are all saying the same thing: One higher consciousness exists. Where they diverge is in the interpretation of what this consciousness is. Judaism (Old Testament) portrays this consciousness as a man, and one who is very wrathful and judgmental. Buddhism portrays this consciousness not as a deity, but a state of being that is somewhat indifferent to us. Even so, this state of being is something that can be achieved rather than worshipped.\n\nThe teachings of Christ, I would argue, are much more aligned with the teachings of Buddhism rather than Judaism in the Old Testament. This reflects a reconceptualization of \"God\" that is radically different from Judaism.\n\nI realize this is a radical notion, but it really does seem to fit. Open to a lively debate if this piques your interest!",

Ive been trying to leave religion but now I definitely can't bring myself to it, im terrified because of her. \n\nHonestly I've been wanting to get into Buddhism but can't bring myself to leave Christianity now, I'm scared. I want to leave, I don't want to be here anymore, im grateful for everything my parents do, but she's made me scared. Soon, I'm going to drivers Ed and eventually I'll have a job and can drive places, should I go to a Buddha temple when I can drive alone?\n\nI don't THINK this is considered religious trauma but I don't know what to do right now. Im homeschooled, no IRL friends, no sports or anything in walking distance. What do I do? I'm shaken up.",

      "title": "I imagined a world where Buddhism, rather than Christianity, became the dominant religion of Europe in the latest episode of my podcast The Books of Thoth.",
      "text": "Hello Everyone.  So, I recently released a new episode of my audio drama anthology The Books of Thoth.  It is a collection of stories imagining the past, the future, and worlds that could have been. I figured that I might be of interest to people around here.  My podcast is completely free to listen to.  It is non-commercial, and I make no money off of it. \n\nImagine a world where Buddhism, rather than Christianity, became the dominant religion of Europe.  A world where Buddhist temples in Scandinavia and Frankland also host images of gods such as Thor, Odin, and even Loki. We shall hear a folktale about a monk called Ketil, and how he helped spread Buddhism to Northern Europe. But more than that, he also drew the attention of the gods of Asgard themselves.\n\nA big thank you to Scott R. McKinley, Patrick Heinzen, Faye Holliday, Juan Cruz III, and Tim Stephenson for helping bring my alternate history folktale to life.  \n\nI’ve always been fascinated by the cultural aspects of alternate history.  That is, what new cultures, or changes to existing cultures, arise as a result of changing history.  I’ve always had a deep love of mythology.  So, I suppose it was only natural that I’d find a way to combine my two great loves.  \n\nI’ve always found the idea of Buddhism spreading to Europe to be particularly intriguing.  We have found Buddhist artifacts in Scandinavia, due to the various trade routes that the Norse were part of.  There was also the so-called Buddha Bucket, but that one has been debunked.  No, it wasn’t made by Buddhist Vikings.  It was actually a depiction of a Celtic deity.  \n\nStill, I’ve always wondered what it would have been like if those artifacts had meant something.  It might seem odd that a warrior culture like the Norse would embrace Buddhism, but then, couldn’t you say the same of them embracing Christianity?  And it isn’t like Buddhist haven’t gotten into their own share of wars over the years. \n\nIf Buddhism were to spread to Europe, I can see it being split along cultural lines. Perhaps there would be different schools for Northern and Southern Europe. Buddhism has always been flexible about incorporating local deities and spirits, so we could easily see the old pagan religions sticking around. Though, they would be subject to quite a bit of domestication, for lack of a better word. These are no the same Aesir of the Eddas. They’ve been tamed by hundreds of years of cultural syncretism.\n\nI focused primarily on the folktale itself, but I gave hints as to what the wider world is like.  For example, Istanbul is still called Constantinople.  This hints that the Byzantine Empire, if not necessarily still around, never fell to Turkish invasion.  Hagia Sofia means Holy Wisdom in Greek.  So, it might not be the exact building from our world, but I figured it would be a potentially good name for a Byzantine temple.  \n\nThere’s mention of stone slab monasteries in Cusco.  So, the Inca Empire managed to resist European colonialism.  Though, they’re a Buddhist nation as well.  So, perhaps a form of soft colonialism did still happen to the Inca.  We also get mention of the nation of a Tlaxcala, so history went differently for Mesoamerica.  The Aztecs got defeated, but solely by their fellow Mesoamericans, rather than that plus conquistadors. \n\nPortugal is still called Lusitania, as it was in Roman times.  Christianity was a major influence on Islam.  So, no or weaker Christianity means Islam never happens.  And no Islam means no Caliphates to conquer the Iberian Peninsula.  So, Roman influence survives, especially with Byzantium still around.  Maybe they managed to hold onto the Iberian Peninsula.  Isis and Mithras are popular gods in Lusitania, as they were in Ancient Rome. \n\nThen there’s Frankland.  A name sometimes used for Charlemagne’s empire, if not Western Europe in general, by the Norse.  Perhaps the empire of Charlemagne managed to stick together.  Also, Frankland worships the Norse gods, or at least their Germanic counterparts.  So, Germanic/Norse influence is a bit wider spread.  \n\nIt’s also mentioned that the Yoruba are Buddhist.  If Europe became Buddhist, I can easily see them spreading it to other countries, perhaps even using it as a justification for colonialism as they did in our timeline.  \n\nI’m also very pleased with how my cast of gods turned out.  Thor, Odin, and Sif played things more or less straight.  But then you have Loki acting like a zany cartoon character, and he knows it.  And of course, big props to Scott R. McKinley for being a fantastic narrator. \n\nThe Books of Thoth is hosted on RedCircle:\nhttps://redcircle.com/shows/the-books-of-thoth/ep/827886b4-5e87-42b8-8d8f-725cb3cb59b7\n\nYou can also find it on all major podcast \nplatforms:\n\nSpotify: https://open.spotify.com/show/3hQ94fOX5V03CXg8ZLgMZ9\n\nApple Podcasts: https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/the-books-of-thoth/id1716132833\n\nRadioPublic: https://radiopublic.com/the-books-of-thoth-6pQno2\n\niHeart: https://www.iheart.com/podcast/269-the-books-of-thoth-127954491/\n\nPodcast Addict: https://podcastaddict.com/podcast/the-books-of-thoth/4730175\n\nPocket Casts: https://play.pocketcasts.com/podcasts/21e93100-6322-013c-9f20-0acc26574db2\n\nPodbean: https://www.podbean.com/podcast-detail/cqaub-2da068/The-Books-of-Thoth-Podcast\n\nAudible: https://www.audible.com/podcast/The-Books-of-Thoth/B0CN3CLRMY",

I see that there is a difference between the concept of ontologies within religion, with some strands and people claiming that Buddhist realms or beings are mental archetypes, I also saw that other strands tend to affirm a real ontology for beings that look like \"gods\" or beings that have a different ontology than us, for example , And I also saw about the concept of emptiness that even these beings, like the devas or bodhisattvas, are empty in essence. Can someone explain this to me? Maybe this question is naive or maybe there is just a lack of deeper understanding, but in my opinion it seems that there is a distinction in Buddhist cosmology.",

      "text": "From his book *The Noble Eightfold Path: The Way To End Suffering*:\n\n>Once we come to recognize the need for a spiritual path we discover that spiritual teachings are by no means homogeneous and mutually compatible. When we browse through the shelves of humanity's spiritual heritage, both ancient and contemporary, we do not find a single tidy volume but a veritable bazaar of spiritual systems and disciplines each offering themselves to us as the highest, the fastest, the most powerful, or the most profound solution to our quest for the Ultimate. Confronted with this melange, we fall into confusion trying to size them up — to decide which is truly liberative, a real solution to our needs, and which is a sidetrack beset with hidden flaws.\n>\n>One approach to resolving this problem that is popular today is the eclectic one: to pick and choose from the various traditions whatever seems amenable to our needs, welding together different practices and techniques into a synthetic whole that is personally satisfying. Thus one may combine Buddhist mindfulness meditation with sessions of Hindu mantra recitation, Christian prayer with Sufi dancing, Jewish Kabbala with Tibetan visualization exercises. Eclecticism, however, though sometimes helpful in making a transition from a predominantly worldly and materialistic way of life to one that takes on a spiritual hue, eventually wears thin. While it makes a comfortable halfway house, it is not comfortable as a final vehicle.\n>\n>There are two interrelated flaws in eclecticism that account for its ultimate inadequacy. One is that eclecticism compromises the very traditions it draws upon. The great spiritual traditions themselves do not propose their disciplines as independent techniques that may be excised from their setting and freely recombined to enhance the felt quality of our lives. They present them, rather, as parts of an integral whole, of a coherent vision regarding the fundamental nature of reality and the final goal of the spiritual quest. A spiritual tradition is not a shallow stream in which one can wet one's feet and then beat a quick retreat to the shore. It is a mighty, tumultuous river which would rush through the entire landscape of one's life, and if one truly wishes to travel on it, one must be courageous enough to launch one's boat and head out for the depths.\n>\n>The second defect in eclecticism follows from the first. As spiritual practices are built upon visions regarding the nature of reality and the final good, these visions are not mutually compatible. When we honestly examine the teachings of these traditions, we will find that major differences in perspective reveal themselves to our sight, differences which cannot be easily dismissed as alternative ways of saying the same thing. Rather, they point to very different experiences constituting the supreme goal and the path that must be trodden to reach that goal.\n>\n>Hence, because of the differences in perspectives and practices that the different spiritual traditions propose, once we decide that we have outgrown eclecticism and feel that we are ready to make a serious commitment to one particular path, we find ourselves confronted with the challenge of choosing a path that will lead us to true enlightenment and liberation. One cue to resolving this dilemma is to clarify to ourselves our fundamental aim, to determine what we seek in a genuinely liberative path. If we reflect carefully, it will become clear that the prime requirement is a way to the end of suffering. All problems ultimately can be reduced to the problem of suffering; thus what we need is a way that will end this problem finally and completely. Both these qualifying words are important. The path has to lead to a complete end of suffering, to an end of suffering in all its forms, and to a final end of suffering, to bring suffering to an irreversible stop.",

She said, exactly \"I'd beat his ass\". \nIm thinking I stay quiet about me questioning religion, I can't learn much about Buddhism though since I can't focus and retain any of the information I get, I lack motivation to learn about it and I can't get anything Buddhist related due to the fact my parents would know. I've leaned away from Christianity completely, I don't despise the other people In it, but I'm starting to hate how my parents have forced me into it, I don't hate them but I hate how the act on the topic of religion. \n\nI don't know what I'm asking for advice but honestly anything y'all would think would help with the family issues and religion issues.

They forced me to go to youth group when I said on multiple occasions I just didn't enjoy going, I couldn't say I didn't really enjoy learning about God, Jesus and the bible, Christianity never seemed to be right. Some of the things in the Bible seemed far-fetched (not to sound rude, so sorry). I'm tired of hearing about the Bible , God and Jesus, I made a joke saying \"I am a god among men\", as an absolute joke, I said it in a weird tone and it was because I got first place on MARIO KART. My sister looked me dead in the eye, serious tone and said \"There's only ONE god\". \n\nNow I'm questioning religion (In secret). The main one I've looked at was Buddhism, I noticed my beliefs were a bit similar to it already, reincarnation, good and bad karma, and I'm questioning if I believe in a god or \"Higher power\". It's hard not to believe in God, Jesus and the holy Spirit when it was all I ever heard, I don't really want to believe in that since it doesn't seem right. I can't confront my parents since they'll probably think Its the internet putting ideas in my head, and I have a feeling they wouldnt take it well.\n\n\nI don't really know what to do in this situation, I lack the motivation to try and learn more about Buddhism or really do anything, I even struggle with motivation to get out of my bed in the morning spending 1-3 hours in bed. \n\nIf there's ANY advice or ANYTHING anyone would think that would be useful or helpful in this situation PLEASE let me know, I'll try to respond as quick as possible and I apologize if I respond late. I've thought about getting a Buddha statue but I didn't want to since my parents probably wouldn't like it and I'm unsure if it's disrespectful to the religion.\n\n\nIM SO SORRY I RANTED:(",

Turns out I don't know any practicing Buddhists and while I can find info online it's much more authentic and relatable if i can get info from an actual practicing individual. \n\nI've got 10 questions I'm asking people about the how their religion plays out in their lives. \n\nHope it's ok if I put the questions here and anyone who feels like it can answer\n\n1. Are there particular holidays you celebrate and if so what's your favorite and why? \n\n2. Are there guidelines or rituals for foods to eat and how to prepare them that you follow? \n\n3. Are there particular clothing that you wear that is influenced by your practice? If not you do others? \n\n4. Are there symbols you wear or keep with you to remove you off your faith? \n\n5. How do you learn about your faith and do any of the principles guide how you live your day to day life? Examples would be great. \n\n6.

I understand that Buddhists believe that we are the consequences of our actions, and those actions attract karma (good or bad) that binds us to samsara. Yet, what does that karma bind to? If we do not have a self (Atman), like Hinduism says, what is bound in samsara? And as a result of that, what attains nirvana?",

But have we not already entered an age of spiritual freedom and maturity less hindered by conformism and ignorance? Sure on the surface the world's messier state might look like a bad thing, but if there is no way out but through, doesn't that still imply progress? \n\nI hope only that in the spirit of interbeing, spiritual entities everywhere can find a way to take off their shackles, because the 21th century does not need anymore differentiation, but rather universally applicable logic that defies the regional identity based structures that came before.",

We should look for truth in other religions different than our own because truth is truth. I agree with this notion, which deconstructs any loyalty to systems of dogma/religion(this binds one to much error and dishonesty). Are there any Buddhist works that specialize in talking about the subject of extracting truth from many different sources(even when the organized religions are known to compete with each other)?",

I, myself, is a buddhist.\nI never ask her to change her religion because I always think that every religion is basically good (how naive of me).\n\nShe started to say things like cannot get married besides in the church, cannot have different religion as a spouse, and our kids must be catholic.\n\nI feel like she doesn't consider me as a human being.\nI feel like I'm only a sperm donor to her.\n\nBecause I loved her and I cared about her.\nI tried to wake her up from her fanatic thinking.\nThe problem is she didn't and still doesn't think that she is actually fanatic.\nShe only think that fanatic is someone who hurt other for their believe.\n\nIn 1 debates with her, she even willing to protect her religion more than her own parents.\n\nI even try to learn her religion, but as I dig deeper to her religion, I only find the dirtiness on her religion.\nLike in the bible, it's explicitly taught you how you can make your slave become yours in lifetime. And many more.\nSo I told her I cannot convert to her religion.\n\nIn the end, we go our separates way. More precisely, she left me for a catholic man.\nI mean, why choose me in the first place when she knew I was a buddhist and she was this fanatic.. It really broke my heart.\nIs it wrong to choose humanity more than religion?...\n\nI then married a buddhist and have children. Don't get me wrong, I love my wife and children.\n\nBut it still bug me to this days..\n\nAm I right to say that she is fanatic ?\n\nHow to teach my children to protect them from fanatic religions teaching ?\nWhile make them confident to face the world so I don't limit their growth?\n\nBecause I'm a indonesian born chinese buddhist, so basically I'm the minority of the minority here..\nAnd a religious country in indonesia doesn't understand my thought of process.\n\nCan I say that her way of thinking is dangerous in the long run for us human being?\n\nPlease help me.\n\nBest regards.",

      "text": "I love Buddhism for a lot of reasons, and I’m relatively new to the teachings, but I can’t wrap my head around the fact that reincarnation is a part of it. A lot of people say that Buddhism is not even a religion but a way of life, and to some extend it can be rather spiritual but most things from what I’ve seen make perfect sense in the world we live in. However, reincarnation is not a part of that in my beliefs and even with an open mind, that will probably not change, just like I know I won’t ever be able to believe in a god.\n\nBesides reincarnation being something I don’t believe in, the whole concept as far as I understand it doesn’t make sense to me.\n\nWe spent lifetimes trying to reach enlightenment, go through all this suffering to at some point reach nirvana. And then what? We suddenly just stop reincarnating because we get it all now? In that case it feels like a challenge. What am I missing here?\n\nDon’t get me wrong I love so many things about Buddhism and I will continue to practice it in my own way, I think it’s so so important for everyone to practice at least a bit of Buddhism in their lives because the pillars it rests on are all just good and healthy for you as an individual and society as a whole. It’s just that some ideas I find hard to wrap my head around. Yet I’m trying to understand why :)\n\nEDIT: I think I’m starting to get it some more now. There is no self, and hence there is no “me” that can be reborn. It’s rather the actions that carry on into the world which ultimately make it either easier or harder for the next conscious being to reach enlightenment. At some point insane amounts of good karma could accumulate in certain beings causing them to live a life where they can ultimately reach cessation of all suffering.\n\nHowever, everyone’s opinion on this seems to differ in this thread so far. Some saying I might have lived a millions lives and others saying only my actions live on because there is no self so ultimately no self can be reborn. And many more opinions. It’s fascinating stuff that’s for sure.\n\nEDIT 2: I wanna thank everyone for giving me their views and beliefs on this topic. As someone who's primary language isn't English and has ADHD, I've been reading every reply multiple times to try and understand for the past HOURS. Besides the fact that everyone seems to have a different approach towards this idea or explaining it, it's also just a lot in general. As some of you might understand, I am super overwhelmed right now and didn't quite think this post would get so much attention and responses. For now tho, I'm just gonna let it all sink in a bit and go back to being for a while, while in the meantime practicing the eightfold path and trying to become more present instead of being stuck in the past or future. I find myself wanting to learn about it all but if there is one thing that I take away from all this is that no amount of learning can make me understand, and that I really have to experience it. Have a great day :)",

We come from an african-brazilian religion called Cabinda, but I've always kept the dharma in my mind while engaging with it. Now my parents are organizing a proper baptism for me in our religion, called an Obligation, where the (I'm not really sure how to describe it) influence of an Orixá - a god - is established in your life. I understand these practices won't bring me any closer to nirvana, but I'm afraid even engaging with them will outright prevent me from reaching any sort of progress in my spiritual journey. I'm not sure what to do: is it possible to honor the traditions of my family knowing full well it won't lead to enlightenment, or do I have to renounce these practices to be able to follow buddhism? Thank you for your answers.",

My dad literally lives in his dads coworkers room he’s not in a position to help at all financially and he owes 2k to my mom each month and she is addicted to adderall i’ve lost an entire side of the family because of her actions as I am no longer connected with her side of the family. \n\nAnyways a bit of a venting or almost justifying my actions i guess in a way.

      "text": "It is deeply concerning to witness how a self-proclaimed \"monk\"—who is neither legally ordained nor recognized by any Buddhist authority in Vietnam—has a tool (quân cờ) in the hands of certain overseas political groups, particularly individuals aligned with the former South Vietnam (Việt Nam Cộng Hòa) diaspora in the United States. \n\nAs a result, Thich Minh Tue image is shared in this platform without clarity of who this man truly is.\n\nLet’s be clear: this individual has never undergone proper ordination. He has no preceptor (upajjhāya), has not received the Upasampadā (higher ordination), and has not followed any Vinaya training required of a true monk. Even he himself has publicly denied being a monk. Yet he wears the robes, shaves his head, and walks the streets receiving offerings from sincere but misinformed Buddhists—people who often don’t know what makes someone a true monk.\n\nIn Buddhism, robes and appearances do not make a monk. Ordination must be granted by a qualified Sangha, through proper rituals and discipline. As the Buddha taught:\n\n“It is not by the shaven head that one is a true contemplative... He who is free from evil and shameful deeds, he is the true contemplative.”\n— Dhammapada 264–265\nWearing monastic robes while not living by the precepts, not having proper ordination, and yet allowing others to believe one is a monk—is not only misleading, but a serious spiritual offense warned against by the Buddha himself.\n\nWhat is more troubling is how his image has been co-opted into a political symbol. Rather than serving the Dhamma or practicing selflessness, he is being used to fuel anti-government sentiment, particularly by groups who long for the days of the former regime. These groups are not necessarily defending Buddhism—they are defending an image that fits their narrative.\n\n\nEdit 1:\n\nusing “pro-claimed” is not a correct word, however, this person still passively using the benefits of being seen as a skillful “monk” by the public. Why does this matter?? I stand against misinformation about this person identity and watching he taking advantages from looking as a monk while CRITICISING others monks who obtained proper training.\n\nIf he is a fake doctor, lawyer or any other professionals that requires specific distinct dresscode, he will be held accountable by the law now. Beside being used for political reasons to divide Vietnam Buddhism and government, - his fake identity and influence will lead people from the meaningful Buddhism trainings and wisdom. So that's why I make this post. I want to clarify about this person, spreading the truth because I saw other posts about him, and they're not right.\n\nAs a Buddhist, I follow Buddhism rules and Buddha words, and I don't like people to take advantages of Buddhism in any forms - passive or not. \n\n\n\nEdit 2:\n\nI want to clarify again the reason I posted this. I'm not posting this for any other reason than to share my concern about Minh Tue’s growing influence and how it’s affecting the public’s perception of Buddhist monks and Buddhism as a whole (as I see the praises on his journey reached this sub) Since he isn’t a real monk but is widely admired while wearing the image of one, it misleads people and encourages a new kind of culture that risks eroding the core teachings and traditions of Buddhism. There’s a reason why the Buddha made it clear that someone pretending to be a monk can never truly be ordained.",

      "text": "Some elements of the dhamma may have striken my faith in an irremediable way, and I'm not happy about it, as I truly appreciate this religion.\n\nThe biggest factors I think are present in DN26, this whole thing about a monarch who specifically needs those 7 treasures (and morality of course...) to be a wheel turning monarch, and when he is considered worthy to be one, a giant magical wheel appears on the sky and them helps him submit all the four continents/islands (planets? Sometimes Jambudīpa is said to be our earth, other times to be just India...) just by appearing all powerful (while carring the monarch) on the sky of these other kingdoms, and them, after the conquest, the wheel just stands there droping goods to help the king sustain it's government and services to the public... all of this just seens very strange to me, but it's not only that, the enormous lifespan variation, which is heavily implied to have happened on this earth (this world system and eon) not just seens, to me at least, strange and unbelievable, but straight up impossible to have happened, further the predictions to lifespans as lower as 10 in the future as morality decays, with a sexual maturation around the age of 5 are too very bold claims... all this lifespan cycle has brought alot of doubt to me.\n\nDN27 and it's claims on the origins of this world cycle too have brought doubts to me, even thought it's lessons are interesting and you can do some incredible comparations with what we know and can prove about the start and development of life and society on our planet, still , it has in general brought some odd takes which go against proved knowledge , like how sexual organs developed on beings (who are conscious as us) who are implied to be the ancestors of humanity.\n\nHonestly I haven't read any sutta on the 32 marks of a great man yet, but to me they do not only seen to be really odd, but superficial, I mean, why having these psychical characteristics contribute to the development into becoming a Buddha? Or even the wheel turning monarch? Aren't both achieved by deeds of mind, body and speech?\n\nThere are some other minor things in other suttas (that I've read) which sounded odd like these previous cited things, but they are connected to them anyway, like the implication of humanity being way older than it is (in this eon and world system) or the map of the world system.\n\nThat's it, sorry if I sounded agressive or disrespectful, i didn't mean to, and english is not my first language too so it may not be as well articulated as I wished. This situation of disbelief and atheism are not new things to me, as many of you westerners, I've abandoned christianity a long time ago as well, but this time it hits different, because as ironic as it sounds, I am way more attached to buddhism than I was to christianity when I was a christian child, it hurts a lot now, it's like being left in the darkness, without any source of light that was previously there guiding me to the triumph, being deprived of a greater reason, a motive, the path, is sad. If I leave this faith for real, it won't be like leaving a burden behind, I would be just taking good with me, maybe with a part of me left behind too lol. \n\nThank you for reading my vent.",

To gain my mother’s approval, I had to follow a very strict path; otherwise, I was labeled as “the one who brings bad luck.”\n\nOver time, I discovered another form of Buddhism that brought me peace and freedom, but this upset my family. For example, I was reprimanded for kneeling in front of a monk as an act of support, which wasn’t allowed according to the group’s strict rules.\n\nMy mother pushed me to participate more and more in Sōka Gakkai activities, and when I wanted to leave, she accused me of being possessed by a demon. At meetings, I never really got to speak; I felt like just a number, a pawn in a hierarchical organization where some members were put on a pedestal—almost like spiritual “stars.”\n\nThis rigid hierarchy and spiritual competition deeply hurt me. I eventually left Sōka Gakkai with much sadness because this faith also helped me through difficult times. Today, I am searching for my own path, away from pressure and false appearances.\n\nI share my story here in the hope of helping others going through similar experiences and maybe find some people who can help me in my spiritual journey.",

      "text": "Buddhism emphasizes logical analysis of reality as a mean to developing wisdom, but in the end, absolute reality can only be acessed through direct experience and faith, not by logic. That is why we have meditation.\n\nAnd faith is not blind faith. Is a trust, a conviction, on the Buddha, Dharma and Sangha, and it arises from wisdom.\n\nWe have Four Noble Truths:\n\n1) Life is suffering.\n\n2) The cause of suffering is craving.\n\n3) The cessation of suffering comes with the cessation of craving.\n\n4) The method to end suffering is the Noble Eightfold Path.\n\nThe fourth Noble truth cannot be confirmed by logical reasoning. You can only truly know it works when you have fully experienced Nirvana. So faith/conviction is an important part of the path. \n\nI think some people take too much time concerning themselves with questions that have no answers (at least, not answers the conditioned mind of samsaric beings could fully grasp) like \"what exactly happens after Nirvana?\", \"Why is samsara happening?\", and so on. This comes partially from the Western emphasis on scientificism, materialism, and rationality. People always need something to hold on to, as if mere logical reason could cause enlightenment by itself.\n\nWe don't always need to have a solid ground to step in. We do not need to have all the answers of the universe. Sometimes you just have to do it and experience for yourself.\n\nFaith is one of Five Spiritual Faculties required for the developing of meditation. And if you become attached too much to the technique, to a solid basis, you will not advance further in meditation.\n\nThere is the story of a poor fisherman who went to the local temple to meditate. The masters there were all occupied arguing about some esoteric, complex detail of the doctrine, and they just told the fisherman to sit and watch his breath, just to get rid of him and continue the debate.\n\nThen, at that moment of meditation, the fisherman acquired all the meditative accomplishments that the masters in all their years of study hadn't acquired. Because he had the minimum of faith. He was not concerned if he was following the \"rules\" or with questions like \"what exactly is Nirvana?\". He just did it.",

I was busy and felt like I did not have the time and energy to commit to it anymore, so I felt it was wrong for me to say I was a Buddhist still, and 2. the lack of proof of reincarnation\n\nI grew up in a Christian household, but even from a very young age, I recognized that there was no proof and I found religion to be a sham. I have been an atheist since I was 5-6. When I was older, I found Buddhism and came to call it my own. However, as I have always had a proof/logic-driven brain, I often found myself questioning reincarnation. It is very hard for me to believe in something that does not have proof. That is why I have always been an atheist and why I have only tried religions that do not feature gods.\n\nHow can I overcome this? I saw something today that really made me want to reconnect with Buddhism. I would love to continue my journey.",

      "text": "# This is what it's like to Have Faith in Amida Buddha\n\n1. Having Faith in Amida Buddha is to *know* *the Fact* that when we have sincerely entrusted ourselves to Amida, and have said his name even once in entrustment, we will be earnestly saved. Once we know that Amida saves us just as we are, there is no going back.\n2. It is a fact that the sun rises in the morning, and what comes up must come down, so it is a fact that Sukhavati is our abode at the end of our life. Shakyamuni can't lie to us about Amida. He taught us the *Fact* of Amida and the *Fact* of Amida's Primal Vow.\n3. Having faith in Amida Buddha *is not* the same as having faith in Jesus Christ, the Son of God. We Shin Buddhists cannot pray to further our faith through the Nembutsu/Nianfo. It is Amida Buddha who gave us our faith as a gift. Christians and Muslims pray daily to safeguard themselves from temptation and sin. It is their personal decision to believe in God. As a Shin Buddhist, I am unable not to entrust myself to Amida because His light shines upon me at every moment. I am unable to not be saved. I know both intuitively and intellectually that it is a *Fact* that I and others who truly entrust themselves to Amida will be saved.\n4. By deeply listening to Amida's call, personally reflecting on your life, and saying Namu Amida Butsu even once as a thank you to Amida for saving you just as you are, you've done your part. Now it's Amida's turn to take the wheel and sail away to Sukhavati. There is nothing else we can do on our part. That is it.\n5. Even if a person has doubts about Amida's salvation or existence, they will still be saved by Amida, but it will take longer to actualize Buddhahood within Sukhavati (The Borderlands). They will never fall back into Samsara again. Their fate is sealed; their fate is Buddhahood.",

      "text": "Hello, my friends, I hope you are all happy and well.\n\nI recently learned something about The Buddha, from which I assume to be a reliable source, that has left me in a bit of a spiritual crisis.\n\nA short preface: While I started adopting Buddhist practices into my daily life several years ago, it was only this year that I began to lean more into Buddhism itself, the history, the 4 Noble Truths, the 8-Fold Path, and The Buddha himself.\n\nSo, the other day I was watching a documentary about Prince Siddhartha's journey to enlightenment. The documentary claimed (almost as a throwaway comment) that while The Buddha appointed his disciples as monks to spread his wisdom and teachings, he only allowed women to become \"nuns\" after 5 years of pestering from his aunt. And even then, they were treated as the lowest of his devotees because he felt that women belonged with families and were too emotional to spread his teachings and wisdom effectively.\n\nThis doesn't offend me as a woman. My practice allows me to separate myself from these kind of negative emotions. I know and accept the abhorrent treatment of women throughout history, particularly by organized religions.\n\nMy crisis stems from the thought that...*after* attaining enlightenment, our Supreme Buddha continued to have reservations and negative preconceptions about women. Shouldn't he have recognized female inferiority as one of the many illusions in this life? Aren't all living beings equally worthy? He famously embraced all people from all walks of life, eschewed caste beliefs, etc.\n\nIt's just such contradictory behavior, if true. While I continue to believe, trust, and practice his teachings, I can't help but feel a very deep disappointment in my heart. I have opinions about organized religion in general, which is one of the reasons I find solace in Buddhism. But now I struggle with the idea of \"yet another\" religious leader who was not who people believe he was.\n\nTLDR: How could an enlightened Buddha still view women as lower and less worthy than men?\n\nEDIT: I just want to add that I have struggled to find refuge in the third Jewel of Buddhism, The Sangha. It is difficult to find this community where I live (Dallas, TX), so I hope I can finally call this group my Sangha. Love to you all.",

      "text": "My neighbour is an old Evangelical Christian guy. I only went there often because I like to hang out with his daughter who is several years older than me. She is very nice and cool sister. She married a while ago and the old man has successful made his son in-law converted (or at least to raise the kids Christian) even though his family is a vegan Buddhist. He seems very proud of it and expect everyone do the same when married a Christian. \nThe only problem is, every time I went there, he keeps talking about religion and try to convert me as well. Things got to my limit when my husband is a man from Christian dominant background - who is not religious and I don’t convert like the neighbour expected. We learned that my gods / deities system is very accepting and they won’t send his family members or ancestors to hell because they are not Buddhist. It is just base on each other own life karma so if they were a good person they don’t have to worry about my gods. So we have agreed to keep my religion as it is and I don’t have to give up.\n\nBut the old neighbour seems to be pissed about this even though we are not his children or family. When I visit his house he keeps telling me I have to convert and he plays bibles reading, gospel music on the movie nonstop. He keeps talking about his God and say my gods are false and offensive stuff and I have to put up a smile to be nice with him. Every time I took my brother there to say hi and he try to do that to my brother as well. I would be understanding if he just mentioned it once to test the water and stop if I don’t show interest after tell them I have my own religion, but the repetition is too much like he has nothing else to talk about. Also, my parents when they visit like to hang out with them as well since there is not much Vietnamese in our area and they are being respectful, i don’t want my parent’s friendships impacted because I speak up.\n\nHowever, I really respect his daughter as a person and want to keep the relationship nice, but also I don’t want to keep being forced into religious conversations and topics every time I go there. The daughter relationship with his dad is also not so great that she used to cry to me about how the dad was being a bit controlling and she has a responsibility financially taken care of her new family, with siblings and parents. I am Asian and in my culture you have to respect the elders (aka not able to talk back or argue with them even though they are wrong) so I don’t want him to get offended if I ask him to stop talking about his religion as I never try to convert them or play mantras to my in-law family. But that being I have to make a choice to possible cut off from that neighbour and that will hurt his daughter feelings. And also I don’t want my kids growing up around the neighbour try to change their faith despite my in-law are happy with them being no-religion. \n\nIf you guys were me, how would you deal with this? Would you confront him one that you are uncomfortable and all to see if he stops and hang out with his daughter like normal, or would you just cut them out to avoid problems?",

But hopelessness that this is what is brings confidence because U can trust U will be ok (equanimity).\n\nNow how can I make sense of faith with this hopelessness in mind. Sometimes both things are use interchangeably but I don't think they point to the same thing. \n\nAs I practice being in the present without storylines and being hopeless that reality could have been different if I did things this other way - It is not and that's ok. A new energy comes up, that wants to believe this is the path for me and I don't wanna call it hope, but maybe faith. Faith in the path of the warrior. \n\nWhat are your thoughts on this?

      "text": "I have believed in many parts of Buddhism for many years but I feel like I've reached a point where it can't work for me.\n\nBuddha taught to test everything. Well, many things I tested against my own experience and they proved correct. Buddhism is full of wisdom which rings true for me. However some other things I've tested and time and time again they are proven to not be backed up by my experience or science. These are some pretty fundamental things, like reincarnation and karma. \n\nSo all that is left is faith. Faith in the buddha, dharma and sangha can only get me so far. Eventually the damn breaks, the walls crack and the whole thing comes tumbling down, despite the wisdom in some other parts.\n\nHow did you overcome this? Did you overcome this? Is it best I leave Buddhism in the past for me and simply move on? What would you do in my position?",

      "text": "Newcomer/truth seeker here,\n\nAfter a recent (past few years) deconstruction of faith, I have discovered this path which so far has proven to be true for me (as I sift through different teachings, etc. and keep what I find to be wholesome, tossing what I find to be harmful). Still very, very new to this religion (if I may use that word in the popular sense).\n\nAs someone whose only real (multiple decades of zealous devotion and practice) frame of reference for “spirituality”—and all things pertaining to life, death, and their true meanings—is Christianity (and the last several years, specifically reformed/Calvinistic doctrine), it seems to be that the concept (if you will) of Samsara is faith-based and not something that can be proven. How is this reconciled in Buddhism in that all other teachings/insights can be tested and proven as true with intellect?\n\nIn basic terms, how can one truly believe in Samsara, or reincarnation (or even karma for that matter) when it can’t be ultimately proven? Is this no different than believing in a deity or an afterlife yet having no substantial evidence for their existence, needing faith alone to trust their validity? Where can I find proof of Samsara or karma? Or is my understanding of these concepts too informed by my Western faith-based predisposition?\n\nThe same questions arise when I read/hear of the idea of prayer (which I’ve always viewed as a faith-based petition to a deity and different from mere meditation) or venerating historically significant Bodhisattvas (is this not a form of deity worship)? \n\nI am not altogether opposing these concepts, but I would appreciate other ways of looking at / understanding these ideas. Any recommendations for further study is appreciated. I am currently most drawn to and most studied in the Mahayana school of thought (particularly Chan/Zen) but welcome any insight from any school. Thanks for you patience in my desire to grasp these ideas and further understand this path.",

      "text": "I wanted to follow up on my previous post about exploring Buddhism and religious practice. I really appreciated the support and insight from this community—it helped me feel less alone.\n\nSomething I didn’t mention before, which I think might be important to share, is that I have a phobia called automatonophobia. It’s the fear of things that represent humans but aren’t—like wax figures, animatronics, mannequins, some statues, or even certain religious icons or masks. I know it sounds niche, but it’s very real and can be incredibly triggering and overwhelming.\n\nThis phobia has made it really difficult to feel safe or grounded in certain religious environments. For example, I’ve found some traditional churches or temples unsettling due to specific imagery or figures. It can feel overstimulating and even distressing, which makes it harder for me to participate in rituals or practices that involve symbolic statues or representations.\n\nI suppose I’m wondering if anyone else here has navigated spiritual or religious practice while managing a sensory issue or phobia like this? I still deeply want to be part of a community and explore spirituality in a way that supports personal growth, compassion, and mindfulness—but I worry about how this fear might limit me, especially in more traditional spaces.\n\nI’m still figuring it all out as I go, but any experiences, recommendations, or even validation would mean a lot.\n\nThank you for reading.",

      "text": "I’m not even sure what I’m looking for exactly. Just if anyone has any advice or pieces of wisdom to offer me in this time to keep me going that would be great. Sorry if this post is just long, but I guess it helps me to get it off my chest. \n\nIt has been almost 6 months now ever since I found out my ex cheated and lied to me since the beginning of our relationship. I felt something of me broke that day. Just that one lie destroyed me because of how big the repercussions were and I was blindsided. I was dragged and my reputation was slandered by the third party, and after that I found out that my friends went behind my back and supported her. I am not the kind of person to tell people to not interact with someone just because I have problems with them, and never did; but the things they did was a betrayal of trust because they lied to me about it. \n\nI have no idea why all of this is happening for me. Maybe we can say it’s my past karma, probably so, but I have trouble gathering the strength to keep going. I have been through childhood abuse by mother, abuse by teachers and a lot of stuff people my age never went through. But this was the last nail in the coffin. I almost got admitted to the hospital because I was so close to suicide. The only reason why I never did it was because I believe in hell. \n\nI never did anything bad in this life. I donate, I pray, I try to do things to help people if I can. \n\nBut this issue keeps haunting me and I’m not sure whether I can keep going. This incident has brought me closer to Buddhism because I have never chanted so much before this. I **want** to believe that the bodhisattvas are watching over me, but it’s so so hard. I’m not Buddha or enlightened monk so acceptance doesn’t come easily for me. \n\nWhat do I do now? I’m already seeing a psychiatrist and am on meds, going to be seeing a therapist soon. But I don’t see it getting better. Does this all have a meaning? Am I clearing my bad karma by going through this? I have no idea.",

I haven't been particularly believing for most of my life, but I find comfort in Allah at times. \n\nI came across Buddhist teachings (the four noble truths and the eightfold path) and books about the matter (Dhamma Within Reach is fab) and they've really really resonated with me. I've started to meditate and read and have listened to talks by Ajahn Brahm and Thich Nhat Hanh and I've loved it all, and I'm yearning to learn and apply more to my life. \n\nHowever recently, I've found myself feeling a bit lost again. Lost in the sense of I think I might be looking for the comfort that Allah is watching over me, as I've been used to my whole life. Buddhism doesn't believe in a Creator or \"observational\" God as far as I understand, not in the sense that Muslims view Allah anyway. So I guess I'm looking for any guidance on how to continue my spiritual journey. \n\nI have been spiritually lost for a lot of my life and Buddhist teachings have resonated with a lot of my core beliefs. \n\nThank you in advance friends",

I made this realization that we often assume that the miracles come to us because we believe in them, as if we assumed a passive stance.\n\nNow the concept of trust flips the focus from the outside to the inside. This is what I was thinking when I mentioned exams in my article. Hard work is hard work, there isn't any religion in this regard. It's all about you doing it. If some external force could possible intervene to favor you, it could very well favor somebody else. Why would the sun shine for you alone? I don't know if this is a biased view and I don't know if this is a misdirection of faith on the masses. But isn't it common to see hope and miracles associated to just believing in almost the same way as luck and a lottery? When I think about trusting oneself, this seems for me much more relatable to a proactive stance. Because to set things in motion you can't just wait and do nothing but to rely on faith.",

The thinking seems to be, “if they dehumanize me, I am right to dehumanize them.” It is also pragmatic: dehumanizing those who are causing widespread harm seems to enable people to fight back against them without being hindered by guilt. I understand this line of thinking, but as someone who believes in Buddha, I have a lot of trouble getting behind it. But I also believe that someone can hold compassion while also channeling anger into fighting for what is right.\n\n\nI am worried I am doing something wrong as a leftist. To be transparent, I lack education on the nuances and iterations of leftist theories and history. I have disabilities that hinder my ability to learn these things. I have tried to educate myself but have trouble remembering and organizing the information.\n\nI just wonder if my aversion to much of the leftist sentiment I am seeing online is indicative of some error in my thinking. I truly see dehumanization of others as a grave error in judgment. I cannot understand how dehumanization of others cannot be an illness, and I do not want to participate in it.\n\nAre there any Buddhists here who have had similar thoughts or observations? Is there any advice you could offer that may help me with these tensions? Thank you for your time.",

This caused issues in the comments, of course, saying about how that isn't his teachings, but it's always bothered me. What is right and what is wrong? Obviously to be healthy. But what about mental health?\n\nTo edit: I only use the Xanax when I really need it in bad moments, or to help sleep. I'm not using it constantly. Maybe just a few times a week.",

His teachings have touched the deepest parts of me. However having been reading about Ajhan brahm I have discovered that nuns cannot be ordained. Somehow I never knew about the plight of buddhist nuns untill very recently. not just in Theravada but also Tibetan buddhism and I'm sure many other traditions. Having found out about the unwillingness to ordain nuns I am deeply troubled. I feel that this profoundly undermines my faith that buddha dhamma is purely compassionate. How can it exclude half the population? I am sure that many Ajhans an Lahmas feel the same as me and can't express this view due to the intransigence of the buddhist authorities and not wanting to jeopardise the merit they create in this world but I'm profoundly hurt by this and it has introduced an element of dought that I just can't get out of my head. I'm not trying to make a political point here I am just very upset by this.\n\nBy the way I'm a man for what it's worth.\n\nPlease help me resolve these feelings if you can.",

This isn't my first foray. I've been to my local sangha, meditated with a few different groups, and read some books (well, I've tried; I often get stuck, for the reasons mentioned below).\n\nA lot of the core tenets of Buddhism as a practice resonate with me. But I keep hitting a roadblock with the belief system. The book I'm reading now, Buddhism for Beginners by Thubten Chodron, talks about Buddhist deities the same way Christians talk about God - as omniscient, pure, free from defilements and endless in their compassion; that they would end our suffering if they could, but only we can choose to follow the path.\n\nThis is exactly the kind of talk that put me off Christianity. I just don't buy it. I simply do not believe there is any being in existence who is somehow all knowing and all powerful, yet does not possess the knowledge and power to right the wrongs of this world. It doesn't make sense to me, and furthermore, isn't particularly useful as a way to inspire people to be better. When I think of a deity who has all this knowledge and power but can't or won't use it to end our suffering, all I feel is bitterness.\n\nWhile there are many versions of Christianity, there are no Christians I know of who do not believe in God or acknowledge the existence of Jesus. They may believe in different depictions of these entities, but they typically believe Jesus was a real person and God is a real deity. It's not symbolic, and believing in these figures is required to participate in the faith.\n\nIs Buddhism the same way? Are these deities acknowledged as being made up by humans looking for something to aspire to and I'm just taking it all too literally? Am I misunderstanding something? I know I can apply Buddhist principles to my every day life either way, but I still want to know the answer to this question. Thank you for your time.",

My response to these claims is to remain agnostic until I have sufficient empirical evidence, not anecdotal claims. Is there sufficient evidence for rebirth or the heavenly or hellish realms to warrant belief? If it requires accepting what the Buddha said on *faith*, I don’t accept it.\n\nI do, however, accept the scientifically verified physical and mental health benefits of meditation and mindfulness practice. I’ve seen claims on this subreddit that Secular/Scientific Buddhism is “racist” and I don’t see how. How is looking at the Buddhist teachings in their historical context and either accepting them, suspending judgement, or rejecting them due to lack of scientific evidence “racist”?",

      "text": "Unpopular opinion? Maybe. But I’m going to say it anyway:\n\nWestern Buddhism will never mature until it stops relying on a secondhand transmission of Asian cultural forms and begins articulating its own voice. I’m not talking about reinventing the Dharma from scratch. I’m talking about recognizing that every great Buddhist movement in history — from Indian Mahayana to Chinese Chan to Japanese Pure Land to Tibetan Vajrayana — evolved by translating core principles into local language, symbols, ethics, and imagination. Why should the West be any different?\n\nInstead, what we have now is a kind of Buddhist museum tourism: people dressing in Asian robes, chanting in foreign languages, and pretending to understand metaphysical systems that weren’t designed for them. We’ve got Zen centers that are more Japanese than Japan. Tibetan groups frozen in time like cultural relics. Western teachers who parrot lineages they never fully internalized.\n\nMeanwhile, the West has its own existential crises, moral questions, philosophical depth, and artistic imagination. Where is the Dharma that speaks directly to addiction, alienation, consumerism, ecological collapse, racial trauma, and spiritual hunger in our own idiom? Where is the Buddhism that uses our myths, our psychology, our music, our moral struggles?\n\nIt’s time to stop acting like guests in someone else’s temple. It’s time to stop outsourcing our spiritual imagination. The West deserves a Buddhism that is both faithful to the core insight of liberation — and unashamedly, creatively its own.",

      "text": "This is a genuine dilemma I have right now. Please by all means correct me if I got this wrong, but this is my general, simplified understanding of Dharmakaya so far:\n\nIt basically means the true, ultimate nature of all things—like the pure, perfect truth that underlies everything. Think of it as the \"truth body\" of a Buddha, representing the essence of enlightenment that is beyond any form or appearance. It’s the most basic, real existence behind all that we see and experience.\n\nI don't know if it's due to prior experiences with other faiths, but this just screams to me the equivalent of what most would call \"God\". An eternal, all encompassing creator of all that surrounds us and makes us tick.\n\nIf anyone could please clarify this help me better understand from a Buddhist perspective, it would be much appreciated.\n\n🙏",

      "text": "Edit: I want to thank everybody for your kind and thoughtful responses. I'm relieved to know I am not alone. Someday my family will know my beliefs, and from there I will be able to live authentically. I'll share my journey as it goes on. Until then, I am grateful for this community. You all have played a big role in my spiritual journey :)\n\nI'm making this post wondering if there are any other Christians-turned-Buddhists out there who share my feelings. I became a Buddhist on 2 May of last year, and today is Easter. There are many reasons I have not told my family my beliefs yet, but I hope that I will be able to someday when I am completely independent from them. My mother in particular is pretty set in her white Christian nationalist ways and is xenophobic. The way she talks about other faiths and groups of people makes me want to stifle myself.\n\nAll this being said, having to celebrate Easter is very hard. This is my eleventh Easter as a nonbeliever and my first as a Buddhist. I know I am doing wrong by hiding myself. Is there anyone else here who is currently in the same boat or was at some point? How do you get through it?",

I want to make my believes clear as to see if I’m even welcome in this place. The academic tag is appropriate because I feel this is a discussion as to why my believes may not be accepted here.\n\nI believe in the Buddha as an enlightened MAN. A profit and a guide to show us one of the many paths he educated on. I read and follow the Dhammapada, as these are the words and saying of the Buddha directly. I study and meditate on Kōans as the great teachers have instructed their students through the centuries. I do not believe in organized religion of ANY sect, as I believe human corruption, struggles for power, and willingness to abuse that power (much like I experienced with the censoring of my highly upvoted commentary) often lead those of faith astray under the banner of what one “ought” to do. I want to remind everyone that organized Buddhism came about much later than the Buddhas own life span. It is therefore not something I believe is pure and honest to the way our great teacher saw the world. \n\nEvery comment I make, and every insight I have is based on the word of our teacher. I do apologize for not belonging to a popular “school or sect” of Buddhism but does that invalidate my beliefs and my own study of the Dharma? \n\nWhat are some thoughts on this brothers and sisters?

      "title": "Mahayana is an own standing tradition that is present since the creation of buddhism",
      "text": "(Mainly this post was commented by tibetian buddhists, a tradition I do not have many stocks of and they seem to ignore what quotes the Buddha did or just do not care about them.)\n\n[Mahayana Buddhism](https://www.originalbuddhas.com/de/blog/mahayana-buddhismus):\n\n>The origins of Mahayana Buddhism are still quite mysterious, but there are several theories about its origins. It is claimed that Mahayana emerged as an independent school from a pre-existing school, Theravada. However, some historical records show that Mahayana was developed long before that.\n\n>\"Traces of Mahayana teachings appear in the oldest Buddhist scriptures. \\[...\\]\"\n\nThe Vimalakirti Sutra contains the first approaches to the relativity of precepts, sitting meditation, and rituals, which were later further developed in Zen.\n\nSchisms within the Sangha emerged early on. The Mahasanghika school, which also resulted in a disagreement among early Buddhists, can be considered a forerunner of Mahayana. A school that emerged around 137 years after Buddha's death.\n\nIt becomes clear that Mahayana Buddhism sees itself as the Buddha's original teaching and views the Hinayana with derogation. You can evaluate that for yourself as you wish, but that is the Mahayana's position at its founding.\n\nIn Kasyapa's Sutra, the Buddha also says:\n\n“Just as, Kasyapa, the world together with its gods might polish a cheap glass-crystal, that glass-crystal will never become a beryl gem. In the same way, Kasyapa, even if a sravaka be endowed with all the precepts, instructions, ascetic qualities of purification, and states of concentration, he will never sit himself on the seat of awakening and awaken to unsurpassed, complete, and perfect awakening.”\n\nTherefore, the Pali Tripitaka can at most have a relative value in Mahayana. The Four Noble Truths are also relativized in the Shurangama Sutra. However, I believe the Second Noble Truth is correct there. Buddha nature, emptiness, nirvana = samsara, bodhisattva, etc., are all not mentioned in the Hinayana and are the core teachings of the Mahayana. The Buddha of the Mahayana is simply completely different from the one presented in the Hinayana. The understanding of the concepts, even among some of the same sources, is NOT the same. I don't want to start an argument; I just want people to accept that these are two different traditions that are not comparable. Ultimately, of course, there are those who see similarities, but I think the Mahayana has distanced itself more than clearly and expressed itself clearly, seeing itself as a Buddhist tradition that has existed from the very beginning.\n\nMahayana emerged from a split within the Sangha. Theravada teachers reject the Mahayana sutras, as well as the Mahayana sutras say that Hinayana followers lack the marrow.\n\nWhen one quotes the Buddha in the Lotus Sutra:\n\n\"I will now teach the highest truth for your sake: There are no śrāvakas who attain nirvana. What you practice is the bodhisattva path; And if you practice step by step, You will all become buddhas.\"\n\n, then it is clear that Mahayana sees itself as an independent tradition that was already valid at the time of the Buddha.\n\n*Since some confusion arised (mainly from the tibetian community for some reason), I want to give other examples for Mahayana standing as it's own tradition.\n\n\nShurangama Sutra:\n\n\"For instance though a lute can make sweet melody, it is useless in the absence of skilful fingers;101 it is the same with you and all living beings for although the True Mind of precious Bodhi is complete within every man, when I press my finger on it, the Ocean Symbol102 radiates but as soon as your mind moves, all troubles (klesa) arise. **This is due to your remissness in your search for Supreme Bodhi, in your delight in the Hearer's Vehicle and your contentment with the little progress which you regard as complete**.\"\n\nVimalakirti Sutra:\n\n\"In the same way, when we **voice-hearers** hear this doctrine of the emancipation Beyond Comprehension, we are all incapable of understanding it. If wise persons hear it, there will be none who do not set their minds on attaining anuttara-samyak-sambodhi. But what of us, who are forever cut off at the root, **who with regard to these Great Vehicle teachings have already become like rotten seed**?2  \nWhen **voice-hearers hear this doctrine of the emancipation Beyond Comprehension, they will surely all cry out in anguish in voices loud enough to shake the whole thousand-millionfold world**. But bodhisattvas should all accept this teaching with great joy and thanksgiving. For if there are bodhisattvas who put faith in this doctrine of the emancipation Beyond Comprehension, then none of the host of devils can do anything to them!\" When Mahakashyapa spoke these words, thirty-two thousand offspring of the gods set their minds on the attainment of anuttara-samyak-sambodhi.\"\n\nI personally will not take Buddha's words lighlty in that matter. Although others seem to look around them quite easily. I have not yet figured why though. It makes no sense to me.\n\n“O Śāriputra! At first that affluent man attracted his children with three kinds of carts, then later gave them only the safest and best large [ox]cart, adorned with jewels. Moreover, that affluent man was never accused of telling a lie. The Tathāgata is exactly like this. He tells no lies. “In the beginning the Tathāgata teaches the three vehicles in order to lead sentient beings. And later he saves them through only the Mahayana. Why is this? Because the Tathāgata possesses the treasure house of the Dharma, which contains immeasurable wisdom, power, and fearlessness. And although he is able to give the teaching of the Mahayana to all sentient beings, not all of them can accept it.\" \n\"To whom they joyfully press their palms together, Touch their heads, and preserve Only the Mahayana sutras with pleasure, Who never preserve even a single verse Of any other sutra. Teach it to those who seek this sutra As intently as they seek for the relics of the Buddha, Who after obtaining it will accept it Respectfully, with bowed heads; And will not seek any other sutra And will never think about heretical scriptures.\" -Lotus Sutra",

      "text": "To preface, I'm an individual interested in Buddhism. I've studied Buddhism in school as well as some other \"faiths\".\n\nMy question comes down to the sentiment of there being predecessors to Gautama Buddha. If Gautama's presence proved anything, it's that Gautama's appearance DID coincide with a world with 0% information on Buddhism and it's Dharma.\n\nIf the next Buddha, Maitreya, won't come until an age of decline; why do we even discuss or pontificate on it?\n\nIn my understanding, Maitreya wouldn't incarnate this realm until Gautama's presence is lost and the world needs reintroduction to the Dharma and Buddhism...\n\nBut if that's the case why even discuss it? It seems paradoxical in a sense. Maitreya wouldn't appear until the world doesn't know of Gautama OR Maitreya.\n\nSo the introduction of the next Buddha before their time, *seems* to be more distractory than useful.\n\nThe only reason I could imagine the utility in knowing Maitreya now is that the essence of his predecessor may be lost to the world before the actual symbol is. That is to say, the world will perceive the Buddha/Buddhism differently than it was intended/conceived as, while it physically has a presence in this realm.\n\nThe utility of Maitreya would regard calibration of Buddhism. Maitreya would serve more as a \"prophet\", in the sense of updating/correcting the structure AS it is currently understood.\n\nWith impermanence and emptiness, how can we believe the structure of Buddhism is 100% the same as when Gautama introduced us to it?\n\nNon-buddhas have historically relayed scripture to modern Buddhists, so doesn't the game of telephone between \"non-enlightened masters\" cause degradation/erosion?\n\nThis post is on the sentiment of Buddhist Dogma. Which dogma is prioritized, Change or the Buddha?\n\nWe need not know of Maitreya now if the information would be lost by the time of Maitreya's actual appearance, right?\n\nWould the importance in knowing of Maitreya be that perhaps Maitreya's presence will appear while \"Gautama's\" Buddhism is still in circulation?",

      "text": "Clinging onto your legacy in a bid for immortality is a classic example of forgoing enlightenment in lieu of attachments. Gwyn would rather throw himself into a bonfire, damning him a painful, endless rebirth cycle, than allow his rule to die off. the never-ending cycle of the First Flame going out, only for someone to toss themselves in, then it going out again … it clearly sucks.\n\nA ‘soul’ in Asian languages (like Japanese and Chinese) doesn’t always indicate the self. It can instead be translated to 'sapience’. The mindless Hollows of the *Dark Souls* universe gained sapience, not a 'soul’. Hence why a player sucks up 37 'souls’ when you kill some rando zombie - no, that one mook wasn’t holding onto 37 individual souls, you gained a certain amount of 'sapience’ energy that translated arbitrarily into a video-game-logic number.\n\nFog is a common trope in Buddhist-inspired fiction to indicate a lack of sentient clarity. Fellow Japanese games like *Silent Hill, Persona, Ghost Of Tsushima*, and Fromsoftware’s previous *Demon’s Souls* make use of it. We also have clear asura analogies with Aldia (someone who almost achieved nirvana but the process was flawed) who is depicted with multiple faces, limbs, and constantly on fire. We got the primordial serpents, whose 'wacky’ facial design probably took a lot of inspiration from [Mara](https://preview.redd.it/sukuna-as-mara-the-personification-of-evil-in-buddhism-v0-4x858nphj0sb1.png?width=862&format=png&auto=webp&s=23d4f3033f9212babf95400eee62681673cb0fa8), a demon who tried to tempt Buddha away from enlightenment. There’s a trilogy-wide, ongoing struggle between making peace with death, decay, and Dark as part of nature.\n\nBut most tellingly, we have a lack of *christian* tropes, which is a big giveaway. There’s little to no emphasis on things like redemption, or forgiveness, or faith, or any of the 'seven deadly sins’ being Bad Things, stuff like that. Christian homogeneity has resulted in a lot of brainrot. It really seems like people aren't aware that in countries like China, Japan, Taiwan, Indonesia, Vietnam, etc - the entire christian percentage is in the single digits. More than half the world definitely don't take it as seriously as the west does. I, a Taiwanese immigrant, grew up seeing it with as detached a passion as for Greek classical aesthetics. \n\nIt’s one thing to have a story where a Japanese samurai redeems his bloodied past through kind actions, with the movie closing on a shot of him walking upwards and disappearing into the sunlit sky. It’s another to have a European plate armor knight aim to end a world long past its welcome and reject the system of endless respawning. One is most certainly built on christian morals, the other isn't, and it's not defined by the costuming.\n\nFromsoft fans can recite to you every in-game item and their descriptions, every single npc enemy and where they come from. But very few seem to have picked up on *Dark Souls’* Buddhist influence. it’s a shame, 'cause we really need more non-christian-based media in our pop culture, and I wish more people realized that their favorite game exists on a level far separated from what they’re likely used to.",

It really has helped me a lot. But losing someone this close to me has never occurred and I really don’t want to spiral/end up on a bad path mentally especially with my siblings and mother in the same boat.\n\nI don’t really know why I’m posting this to be honest. I think I’m just scared of events to come as well as the whole grieving process etc. I just wanna stay strong enough for my family. Maybe if someone else here has gone through something similar or anyone in general who would like to share some advice I’d more than appreciate it. \n\nThank you if you are reading this, peace to all 🤍",

      "text": "I just claimed to be a Buddhist in front of a couple people and now I am wondering if I had any such right to make that claim. \n\nPersonally, I do not always practice dharma. It is something that comes and goes for me, as I have disabilities and am neurodivergent and this produces a lot of barriers for me in terms of mental bandwidth, discipline, accessing resources, and even understanding and remembering teachings. However, I have experienced a lot of positive aspects of Buddhist practice, and I have “touched” the truth of the Buddha’s teachings (I am not sure how else to put it; but I mean that during meditation practice and developing things like compassion, I have seen how what the Buddha teaches about things like interdependence and attachment makes sense). I also have faith in rebirth, even though I cannot verify it. \n\nBuddhism has been a deeply healing and transformative thing for me, but now I feel like I’m “not Buddhist” because I am often not adherent to the principles and I have a lot of gaps in knowledge due to cognitive issues. I know it goes against practice to even cling to identity in this way, but here I am, doing it anyways. \n\nPart of me just wants someone to validate that it’s okay for me to feel deeply connected to Buddhism in this way, even while I still have much to learn and even while I am not always “doing Buddhism.” But honestly… I don’t know what I want. I think a big part of it is that this is a deeply personal part of my inner life and I do not usually openly share it with people. So now I am feeling exposed and insecure. Where I live there are hardly any Buddhists. I do not feel I have a community here.",

      "text": "Hello r/Buddhism ,\n\nI used to be a Christian, due to a mystical experience I had in my teen years. To keep it short, after reading Psalm 37, verses 1-4, I realized that God could satisfy my yearning for sin in even a rock, so long as I gave myself fully to delight in him *himself*. I then experienced what felt like the visitation of a holy ghost, telling me (not audibly but like through soundless words) \"you're saved and spared from hell\", and then left. Afterwards, I felt deep bliss and peace, and developed what have been called the fruits of the spirits (e.g., kindness, peace, wisdom, etc).\n\nFast forward to the present, I've been atheist for nearly a decade, and studying Buddhism seriously for the past couple weeks, and yet this experience still haunts me - having always kept me from being fully atheist - and always encouraging me to return to \"the faith\". \n\nAtheists tell me it was a hallucination, Christians are divided on it (when I them), with some seeing it as my salvation story and others seeing it as not to be trusted.\n\n**In short, this mystical experience has not only kept me from becoming a full atheist, but is also keeping me from becoming Buddhist, and so I would like your thoughts on this.**\n\nHow do all of you, as Buddhists view this experience? Do you think it's good, truthful, a hallucination, etc? I'm curious as no one has ever been able to give me peace on this matter. While I have all shorts of questions, this matter is one of those I've been yearning to get to the bottom too.",

It was an impromptu trip, I wasn't going to go with them but they said why not at the last minute. \n\nOne of the women there was receiving Gojukai and recommended I do too. I didn't realize it meant I would be joining the temple. I'll admit I was kind of drunk and just signed my name. I figured it would just be them placing some stuff on my head and saying some words, not that I was \"committing to the faith\".\n\nI feel badly about it now because while I believe in some Buddhist concepts I am nowhere near devoted enough to be an actual Buddhist, but I'm not sure what to do. Would it be disrespectful to request that my name is removed from their files? I'll probably still visit that temple with my friends and I wouldn't want it to be awkward.\n\nI'm honestly just ashamed I did this! I am not an organized religion kind of guy, I would never have done this if I was more aware of what I was signing up for.",

Migraines have been the worst, even if they improved recently. In the morning when I wake up I have chest pain close around the heart and the ribs. I also have chronic knee pain, I was injured and had surgery (for which I had to wait a lot because I had a doctor that I can't but consider evil for how he behaved towards me, my mother and my condition); this made it hard for me to find a job and get leave the house.\n\nI have also severe ADHD, and a few years ago I started having chronic fatigue. I have also been introverted all my life, meeting people and even getting out of the house was literally traumatic for me for most of my life. I have never been in a relationship, yet I have always suffered heartbreaks. I also always had a bad relationship with my relatives.\n\nI remember as a child I cried more than was normal for newborns.

      "text": "**Long story short,** my family and relatives are fairly religious people. Every year after Lunar New Year/National Holiday/, they invite a lama to conduct a traditional religious ritual or blessing ceremony. However, there’s something I’ve consistently observed that I find quite unusual — even unsettling.\n\nWhile reading sacred texts and performing the ritual, the lama casually drinks one or two cans of beer. That alone feels off to me. I can’t help but question how someone who has devoted their life to religion — who is supposed to embody its teachings and moral discipline — could feel at ease drinking alcohol in the middle of a sacred act. It just doesn’t sit right. What’s more, my parents don’t seem to find it strange at all. In fact, they offer him the beer themselves. According to them, it’s something he enjoys, and they believe that by keeping him happy, he’ll perform the ceremony more thoroughly, more sincerely. They say it’s a way to encourage him not to rush or cut corners. But I disagree. I don't like the attitude he brings with him — a kind of entitlement, as if being invited gives him the license to behave however he wants, even in ways that seem contradictory to the spiritual responsibility he holds. To me, it feels less like devotion and more like indulgence disguised as tradition.\n\nI’m left wondering: Is this behavior really acceptable in a spiritual context, or are we just condoning it under the name of faith and ritual?",

      "text": "Hello all, I only recently became a Buddhist after five years of being an atheist materialist. While I have in recent months left most of what I used to believe as an atheist materialist behind there is one that has stuck with me because I find the evidence and arguments for it, as put forth by people such as Sam Harris and Alex O’Connor, to be nearly indisputable, to the point where if I can’t believe it I’m not sure what I can believe. That idea is Determinism. \n\nBefore I explain it more, I would like to clarify a few things. \n\nFirst, I do know that the concept of Free Will in Buddhism is different from how it is in the Abrahamic Faiths. I have done some reading on that, including on this subreddit; however, I have felt that they are all addressing a definition of Determinism that I do not hold to. \n\nSecond, to be clear, when I say I am a Determinist, I don’t mean that everything was predetermined, by which I mean I don’t think we could predict the future as long as we knew all the given variables. I believe, and as far as I am aware, both Harris and O’Connor believe this as well, that there is some small degree of randomness in the universe that prevents things from being truly predetermined. Instead, how I define determinism is that all actions, physical, mental, or spiritual, are the effects of some cause.\n\nWith those things clarified, here is my question: Is Determinism, as I have defined it here, compatible with Buddhism? I feel like it's basically just Dependent Origination, but I have seen a lot of people saying that Determinism and Dependent Origination are very different things here on Reddit, so I am not sure. \n\nThanks for reading",

I want to learn about all of your religous beliefs.\n\n\n1. Is nirvana similar to the concept of moksha in Hinduism, or is it diffrent? Some people tell me that in nitvana they become kne with god others say the body exists in a higher field of existence where it  ceases to exist. I want a mainstream answer. I understand Buddhism has many sects and Interpratations but I'm confused.\n\n2.In Buddhism who is the god? Is it like trh abhajmic faiths with a supreme god with laws or like a manifestation of the universe like in Hinduism?\n\n3.How come other deities are seen as gods or devas on Buddhism? If they are two gods one will have to have more power then another. If they are equal then they will allways out will each other making neither of them supreme. Example: If god a wants to make a ball red and god b wants to make a ball blue how will they. Other get their will if they are both equally as powerfull.\n\n4.What is buddhisms concept on doing duty? Is preforming action over in action a strongly emphasised concept?\n\n5.What is the meaning behind stupas in Buddhist monestaries? (Find them cool)\n\n6. Buddhism seems to be about accepting how nothing is permanent? Is the soul also not permanent?\n\nThanks.",

      "text": "So few days ago i was invited at a friends house for dinner. They were very devoted pure land practioners. After dinner we started having chit chats and one point we started having convresations about buddhism as i was new in it. They were very excited and was kind of like preaching to me about Amitabha buddha and his pure land like in a Christianity or Islam way, which really strikes me. And i kinda noticed that in many pure land people. Now after researching about many things im a bit confused and i just dont get it so correct me if im wrong with all due respect and im not here to attack anyone just im not quite understanding it. So my question to pure land people or anyone in general that if they say \"Just chant Amitabha’s name and you’ll be reborn!\" then *Did the Buddha ever teach that reciting a name erases karma? If so, why did he teach the Eightfold Path?* *If Amitabha saves everyone, why are we still here?* Now some may say i lack \"faith\". But the *Kalama Sutra says to test teachings, not blindly believe. Does chanting alone lead to wisdom? Then doesnt it become like theistic religions type? Now some may also say Pure Land is for the Dharma-Ending Age (Mappo)! But the Buddha never said ‘the Dharma will end, so replace it with chanting.’ He said ‘be your own lamp. So again with all respect explain a bit someone im eager to learn and grow in wisdom.*",

      "text": "Hi, everyone! So, a little background about me: I was raised a catholic and eventually got out of it because I just didn't have faith, some of the deeper aspects of it just didn't make any sense with me. I've been in a deep search for spiritual truth for years, and a lot of meditation eventually started giving me some new insights - and after some research, I found that these insights are in line with the Buddha's teachings (for example, impermanence and interconnection). However, as I research more about it, other questions arose.\n\nI know buddhism is not about answering deep metaphysical questions, but I think the ones I'm about to ask are well within range of being answered by someone experienced (but I may be wrong about this haha, if a question I pose is not meaningful or based on misunderstandings, please point it out). **I would like to beforehand thank you very much for reading and taking the time to help me**. So, here it goes:\n_______________________________________________\n1 - Buddhists say that Samsara exists because of attachment and ignorance. Why weren't we born without these defects? Why are we being forced to experience this game of trying to free ourselves from the cycle? I realize this might be one of those unanswerable questions, but it doesn't hurt to ask\n\n2 - If there is no separate self, then how can some beings be the rebirth of a specific person, if that person is only a collection of impermanent processes? For example, some buddhists take the Dalai Lama to be a reincarnation in a long succession of lamas. But since there's not an individual self, that means that those lamas weren't actually there to begin with - so how does it make sense to talk about them coming back?\n\n3 - Do Buddhists believe that all beings are ultimately one, sharing the same mind? Or each being is actually an individual, but permeated by the same nature, or manifestations of the same nature? Or nothing like this?\n\n4 - What is Buddhism’s view on free will? If the answer is \"there is no free will\", then why must we face the consequences of our actions (karma), if we are just playing a script?\n\n5 - If there is no \"I\" performing actions, why does karma exist? What are the mechanisms that somehow connects karma to its consequences?\n\n6 - If everyone in the universe dies, and the universe itself cannot support rebirth anywhere, is that equal to Nirvana being achieved? After all, no rebirth = no suffering.\n\n7 - If \"I\" don’t move on after death, does that mean I will cease to exist and no longer suffer? If the answer is yes, then why bother trying to achieve enlightenment, if I just have to wait until I die to no longer suffer? And wouldn't that apply to everyone? In others words, why not just wait for everyone to die?\n\n8 - If there are multiple universes, what is the mechanism that connects my karma to another universe? How could my actions in this physical universe lead to rebirth in a completely different universe? My actions, whatever they are, involve me interacting with my universe. If I cannot interact with different universes and cause effects there, I don't see how the consequences of my actions could branch into worlds that are not physically connected with ours.\n\n9 - If I hypothetically killed someone, what exactly is the karmic cause and effect? The effect was that a life was lost—why would that result in future suffering for me, specially in another universe?\n\n10 - Nirvana is beyond existence and non-existence, but only attainable after getting rid of the self. If \"I\" attain enlightenment, who gets to experience it? If the answer is no one, then why should I bother trying to achieve it?\n\n11 - This is a big one for me. As far as I know, Buddha only taught about suffering, its causes and the way to get rid of them. He said on some occasions that prayers and relying on gods are not useful, that the way to liberation is to train the mind and live according to the Dharma. However, in Vajrayana buddhism, they do a lot of prayers to a lot of deities, specially Tara. Where did Tara even come from? For buddhists, is she an actual being that existed in some universe, or is she just merely a symbol? And regardless of what she is, how could she help us in any way? How does Tara practice does not go against what the Buddha taught?",

      "text": "I have noticed that there are some people in the world who seem to only interact with the world through power relations. They glorify those they see as powerful or rich or whatever, and they find (fleeting) joy in making others feel bad or seeing others humiliated or hurt. \n\nI see it as though they are wholly identified with the feelings that come from seeing oneself \"better than\" or \"worse than\" others. \n\nThis is approximately 2 year old reasoning, or it would be in a healthy world. \n\nHowever, their entire personality and even morality seems emotionally tied to the feeling that it's \"better\" to be powerful, and being \"weak\" or vulnerable is inherently bad.\n\nDoes anyone know of any Buddhist teachings or philosophies for dealing with such people?\n\nIt generally seems to cause personal harm to be around them. But to some degree, if one is going to live in the world of humans, they are near unavoidable. \n\nSpecifically wondering is there a way to confront them in ways so that they might be able to see what they are doing--or at least hold them accountable/discourage the behavior through healthy boundaries in any Buddhist teachings? \n\nOr if one were to say, not to confront them or to just ignore them, what are the teachings behind that, or can you refer me to a philosophical source? \n\nI think my main worry is that if I don't have boundaries with such people I may be enabling the behavior. And some of these people can be very dangerous and cause more harm in a short amount of time than can be undone in a much longer period of time. So I worry that if the good people don't stand up to them, the human species and many around us could just get ravaged due to the immaturity and cruelty of a small few people. Similarly in local communities, one highly pathological personality can wreak havoc in any community or organization of people. \n\nI'm especially looking for Buddhist texts or philosophy on exactly how these dynamics work in people.\n\nFor me it's very difficult to tell how much these people are conscious of--who is simply avoiding things that make them feel uncomfortable, versus who is actively attempting to manipulate others around them to get ahead. It would seem such knowledge would b e necessary for knowing how to best interact with them, but the fact that both interactions appear to be in bad faith to begin with complicates this for me.",

      "text": "I’ve been struggling with faith for a long time. I dabbled in Christianity for a while, but deep down, I feel drawn to Buddhism. The ”problem” is that my family are newly converted Christians, and they’ve been encouraging me to open my heart to Jesus. They pray for me every day and are very devoted.\n\nDuring my time exploring Christianity, I asked God (the Christian God) to give me a sign that He’s real. Specifically, I asked Him to take the form of a bird and show Himself to me. A few days later, a dove landed on my balcony and stayed there for a while. Last night, I even dreamed about a dove.\n\nAll of this has left me feeling confused. I’m wondering if I’ve made the wrong choice by leaning toward Buddhism. Have any of you experienced something similar? And as Buddhists, what can you tell me about this kind of experience? Did the Buddha ever say anything about phenomena like this?\n\nEDIT: My connection to Christianity is mostly cultural. I know quite a lot about it and I do not like it for a plethora of reasons. I think I must make it clear that I am not a Christian, nor have I ever been. I think these questions that occur in me are closely related to my family’s new conceptions. I have only started to actually explore and learn about Buddhism - going to temple, meditating, and done a lot of reading, and it speaks to me. I admit, my mind is always racing and gets easily occupied. In my mind, it’s a hell of a coincidence. However, you all have calmed my mind a bit by contributing with question I must ask myself.\n\nI really appreciate your reply and thank your for taking the time.\n\nThank you so much!",

      "title": "Chinese Buddhism in America is slowly fading away",
      "text": "In recent years, I’ve observed that Chinese Buddhism across the Americas is slowly receding. As impermanence is well to do, the state of Chinese Buddhism is retreating quietly, and in some places, disappearing altogether in the form of temples closing up shop or in some cases being abandoned entirely. I don’t believe this is due to a weakening of devotion or doctrinal clarity, there are still pockets of that being found in smaller places. I think all of it stems from how cultural outreach and generational continuity have grown increasingly insular and tribalistic. For example, one temple will cater specifically to mainlander Chinese, others to Taiwanese people, a few from the diasporic communities and refugees. I have yet to see any sprout up from my generation, and I am willing to bet that that I will probably never see it in my lifetime.\n\nFor context, I live in Southern California, where temples often cater to specific ethnic or regional groups. One pattern is consistent: many temple members are in their 70s or older, with some well into their 90s. Young people are met with a lot of suspicion, and when there are a couple of upstarts who want to learn more, they’re met with terse response and often indifference. Many of them simply just go toward Tibetan and Japanese Buddhism.\n\nBefore you say anything—yes, I’m aware of Hsi Lai Temple. Here in California, it’s basically a central hub where you’ll run into people from nearly every nearby temple. But not everyone goes there regularly. The same goes for the City of Ten Thousand Buddhas up north. That said, not all Chinese Buddhists resonate with those traditions. One leans heavily toward creating a humanistic Pure Land on earth, often at the cost of the austere, renunciant model of monasticism we were taught to revere. The other represents a highly conservative and disciplined community, deeply committed to the monastic path, but perhaps less accessible or adaptable to modern, multicultural life. Either way, you encounter the same problem: there’s no room for westerners.\n\nIt is 2025, and gone are the days when erudite Buddhist scholars would sit among eager laypeople to expound the Dharma. Today, most Dharma talks I encounter have been reduced to general life advice, sometimes drifting into unsolicited medical tips they heard online or mental health commentary. Others still rely solely on ritual and funeral work, the classic go-to for whenever a sangha member needs to make a living to afford to live here.\n\nThere were efforts to reach out to Westerners, but almost all have fallen short. The monastics who once led those initiatives have since returned to China or Taiwan, some disillusioned, many vowing never to come back. A few new organizations have emerged, but they often draw from the same shrinking pool of devotees, and many of them are not those that you could count on to give generously. \n\nThe momentum for broader outreach just isn’t there, and one might say that you can find it in the younger Asian American populace. You aren’t seeing them come in droves, however. Asian-American millennials and zoomers have  grown more atheist or agnostic by nature. Most Asian Americans have grown wise to generational trauma and trying to steer clear of their culture that they perceived to be either misogynistic or lacking in context. \n\nDon’t believe me yet? Go on, try it for yourself. Ask your Asian friend of Chinese descent right now to describe what faith they belong to. There is a high chance they use their parent’s default answer of \"Buddhist\" because they don’t know how what their belief is.\n\nA side note: a few brave Westerners will manifest a vow to fully ordain in the Chinese tradition, and without notice disrobe in favor of Buddhist academics before veering completely into just studying theology. This honestly doesn’t surprise me very much. The language barrier is much higher in Chinese tradition than it is in Japanese, where there actually is a genuine desire to fill the communication gap. \n\nLately I find myself reflecting on that documentary about Master Sheng Yen and the founding of Dharma Drum Mountain in Taiwan, particularly his early years in America. Though his time here was brief, it profoundly shaped his approach to teaching and connection. And yet, the fact that he left so soon speaks volumes. Perhaps the seeds for planting the bodhi simply weren’t ready to take root in this soil.\n\nAs of 2025, I’ve now come to believe that, at least for Chinese Buddhism, America will never be fertile ground for deep cultivation, and despite any earnest effort to do more outreach and education, won’t be for quite some time.",

      "title": "My Confession",
      "text": "It is quite a miracle that I became a Buddhist.\n\nAs such I call this post *my confession*.\n\nI encountered Buddhism during my graduate studies in physics. We still had our free university then, a uni within a uni, where the community taught classes on things they had a passion for. A beautiful idea. Why let the classrooms sit empty? Put them to use!\n\nOne of the regular instructors was a Nyingma lama who taught classes on basic Buddhism, vajrayana Buddhism, Tibetan ritual practice, Buddhist history, and Tibetan language. \n\nI was not a good candidate for Buddhist practice.\n\n1. I am what is called a \"black\" or \"poison\" Buddhist. That basically means I came to spirituality backwards. I came to a spiritual crisis after people close to me were subject to violence, and sought the source and end of such darkness. This is a great spiritual obstacle. The way to approach dharma is through faith and devotion, not pain and horror. \n\n2. My last spiritual port of call was a fundamentalist Christian cult. I don't say that pejoratively. The group has been described as such by journalists. This lead me to great distrust of religion, and religious heirarchies. Particularly of religious teachers.\n\n3. I was a committed scientific materialist. After the cult experience I had rejected the possibility of any and all metaphysical truths beyond what could be observed scientifically. I had reduced myself and those around me to molecules, and the greatest truth I could find for myself was an ethics based on science, and a happiness based on science. All methods of just surfing the molecules that I was made of.\n\nSo I found myself taking lama's classes and finding them very interesting. He was quite a charismatic teacher, and his story was very interesting. Living in his teacher's barn as a retreat. He was an interesting and very appealing man, but I was very critical of what he taught. It seemed like Tibetan cultural nonsense and metaphysical fantasy. A cool one, but just that.\n\nThen having gone through all of the courses I was invited out to the gonpa, the Tibetan meditation center, out in the mountains. I was invited to partake in a ganachakra or Guru Rinpoche in the temple. \n\nBOOM\n\nSomething happened. A deep resonance. Something sparked and woke up in all of my senses. \n\nThe smell of the incense. I had been fond of incense, and always got it on head shops. The Indian stuff-- but this, what was it? It seemed so familiar. \n\nAll the sounds. The big drum, lama and his wife playing the cymbals, people ringing bells and damarus. It too seemed so familiar.\n\nThe shrine. The water bowls, lamps. Skullcups. Statues of Buddha, Tara, and Guru Rinpoche. And the tangkhas. Their brocade, the paintings. In particular this one of Guru Rinpoche and his 25 disciples. This Guru Rinpoche person! \n\nEven the texts. Pechas in Tibetan. The texts for us with Tibetan, transliteration, phonetics, translations of words, the English translation of sentences. The sounds. The words. Everything from the courses, all those concepts and ideas, right there. \n\nI wanted more, and lama was willing to provide it. From my side, I just needed all of my questions adequately answered. I had questions about the scientific basis for the practices, of the metaphysical claims, that enlightenment was possible. Lama would provide the traditional explanations from the textual and oral traditions. But I demanded scientific proofs. Ones based on the study of matter.\n\nAnd I wanted evidence that Tibetan Buddhsim was free of structural violence of any sort. That Buddhist societies fit my picture of utopian societies. And lama would share the reality of religious wars, sectarianism, slavery, capital punishment, and assassination of religious figures. I was outraged and depressed. OK. The utopia of Buddhist communities in the West. And lama shared the reality of teachers exploiting students for money and sex, the reality of wholly fake teachers. I demanded a spiritual tradition without human flaws. \n\nI kept orbiting around practice with endless questions. And one day lama had enough. He knew something that I didn't, which was my endless questioning was just pushing me away from practice, and if I was pushing myself away, it was already having some transformational power.\n\nHe announced that we would only answer questions related to study and practice, and that he would take me under his wing and teach me. I took the offer as I knew I could walk away at any time.\n\nHe said I should get some books and learn them. One was Tantric Practice in Nyingma by Khetsun Zangpo. Another was Gampopa's Jewel Ornament. There were some lo jong texts, and Shantideva's Bodhicharyavatara. There weren't many books on translation back then, but I could get these.\n\nI would study and meditate on these books, and come up with questions. I would also come back with my habitual questions. Materializing or psychologizing (in a Western sense) different concepts like karma or rebirth and basically demanding an scientific journal article explaining fully. Which or course didn't exist. And which lama didn't entertain.\n\nLama also gave me homework. Actual practices to engage in. Shamatha. Lo jong mind training. The four thoughts that turn the mind to enlightenment. And he wanted me to come back with something. Something beyond that was nice, that was fun. He wanted me to really engage the practices. Have some success with calm abiding. Have some deep effect from lo jong and the four thoughts. To be able to weep thinking of the suffering of others. To have a sense of gratitude for my life, a sense of possibility in this opportunity.\n\nThat was hard, as it steered me into many of my questions. The metaphysical Buddhist worldview is at the heart of these meditations. Karma, rebirth, the six embodiments. But I found myself asking different questions. Instead of having questions answered before I would entertain Buddhist practice, I would tell lama, \"I'm not sure on this instruction of all beings having been my mother because I'm a bit unsure about rebirth\"-- and he would give me a pivot. A different angle. He would do this with all of my doubts. This is how you can work with it in the context of practice.\n\nIn time I became an agnostic about much of Buddhist metaphysics. Largely because I came to understand Buddha's teachings as upaya or skillful means. I also came to have a different relationship with my \"beliefs\". They really weren't that important or that fundamental. \n\nI was studying physics at the same time and had a similar insight there. My \"beliefs\" about the physical world really weren't that important or earth shattering either. Much of what we worked with admittedly worked only in a narrow band of circumstances. Fundamental problems were intractable mathematically or impossible computationally because of their size or complexity.\n\nFrom lama I came to realize that I was at an advantage. I had come to appreciate pramana or valid cognition. In both science, the social-political world around me, as well as dharma. I needed to find and see the truth in all of these things, but my beliefs weren't the end-all. They were just one tool. \n\nThat was hard to accept. And for a time I just went around my lama and tried to get all of my questions answered. I dug into books like the Tao of Physics, the Dancing Wu Li Masters, and other science and pseudoscience that rubbed against eastern though. Dam Das, Tim Leary (his Tibetan Book of the Dead rendition!),  Shulgin and my own experiments with hallucinogens. A deep dive into shamanism, Christian mysticism, and indigenous beliefs. I was set on answering all my questions.\n\nAnd I thought I did. So I came to lama with a full report. He was drinking tea and accepted my company and calmly and intently listened. And when I was done, with great dramatism, he slapped his hands on his knees and exclaimed: \"Aren't you clever!\". And laughed with the same loving and mischievous spark in his eye I had come to rely on. And take refuge in.\n\nIt was clear. I had just fed my own neuroticism, my own ego. Any \"profound\" experiences were fleeting. Any wisdom just lines connecting dots in my on confusion. Spiritual masturbation. \n\nIt was a lot of work, working with lama.\n\nIn time he agreed to offer me refuge and my first empowerment, the empowerment of Guru Rinpoche from the cycle lama held and taught, at least in part. But I had one last piece of homework. To really study about the lineage masters from Shakyamuni Buddha to Guru Rinpoche and beyond to generate great faith. And so I was give the lung for the seven line prayer and the Om Vajra Guru mantra. I would throw myself to Guru Rinpoche. Right into his lap. \n\nI share this because I see a lot of people hoping to answer all of their questions before adopting a Buddhist practice. They hope to find the perfect form of Buddhism that fits their needs and interests like a sleeve. The one they agree with most. And when all of these pieces are in order, when everything is lined up, they can pass \"GO\" and begin their path to enlightenment. \n\nAnd I share these because there are people who doubt they are smart enough, good enough, clever enough, or blessed enough to begin practice. Or they come from complicated backgrounds. They have trauma or are neurodivergent. They struggle with addiction or compulsions. Or perhaps they have done bad things. Even very bad things. \n\nAnd people who have a yearning for enlightenment, for liberation, ease-- but they have already indicted, judged, and condemned the dharma they are so drawn to. \n\nJust be bare honest with yourself and your guides on this path. And try. The path and it's fruit is closer than you think.\n\nWith the hook of faith, liberation is in our hands. \n\n*a Guru Rinpoche day offering*",

      "text": "So a quick background on me, I've practiced Buddhism as well as practices from other mystical traditions for about the past 10 years of my life. I've always been quite adept at meditation, finding myself capable of reaching higher Jhana states within 10-15 minutes of meditating, even with inconsistent practice. Meditation just has always come naturally for me, though my habit has been rather inconsistent throughout the years.\n\nBut this past year has been unusually troublesome. My meditation habit has nearly entirely slipped away. I lack the drive to progress along the Jhanas now. Nihilism has essentially taken me hostage. It feels frivolous to focus on enlightenment, when I look around me and see where society is heading. Fascism is on the rise and it seems like humanity is doomed to relentlessly repeat the same mistakes, century after century. \n\nThe advent of AI has further fueled my nihilism. With the way things are going, most people in the west seem destined to be replaced by AI in the coming decade, with no serious discussion among our politicians on how people are going to feed their families. The Oligarchs have all but cemented their power, openly pushing society towards a cyberpunk style dystopia. We become increasingly reliant on AI, I fear that future generations will fail to learn reason and logic as these tasks are outsourced to AI.\n\nIt seems the future is destined to bring poverty and suffering, there doesn't seem to be much of a way out. Yes, nothing is permanent.. But with technology allowing our tyrants to personalize propaganda towards each individual, I fear that a great dark age is upon us. Everything that we see as good and rational is at risk, there's serious potential that this dark age can be one that lasts centuries.. Everything gets increasingly dystopian... I'm honestly unsure how to cope with it. \n\nEnlightenment ends up seeming frivolous, we're being propelled into this dystopian nightmare whether we accept it or not. I find myself gravitating more and more towards mindless distraction. My motivation to meditate has been eroded along with my faith in humanity. \n\nI'm honestly not sure what to do at this point :/",

      "text": "Hey guys, I came across this sutta again and it got me thinking ([accesstoinsight link](https://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/sn/sn25/sn25.003.than.html#:~:text=Intellect%2Dconsciousness%20is%20inconstant%2C%20changeable,%2Dof%2Dthe%2Dmill.)).\n\n> At Savatthi. \"Monks, eye-consciousness is inconstant, changeable, alterable. Ear-consciousness... Nose-consciousness... Tongue-consciousness... Body-consciousness... Intellect-consciousness is inconstant, changeable, alterable.\n\n>\"One who has conviction & belief that these phenomena are this way is called a faith-follower: one who has entered the orderliness of rightness, entered the plane of people of integrity, transcended the plane of the run-of-the-mill. He is incapable of doing any deed by which he might be reborn in hell, in the animal womb, or in the realm of hungry shades. He is incapable of passing away until he has realized the fruit of stream-entry.\n\n>\"One who, after pondering with a modicum of discernment, has accepted that these phenomena are this way is called a Dhamma-follower: one who has entered the orderliness of rightness, entered the plane of people of integrity, transcended the plane of the run-of-the-mill. He is incapable of doing any deed by which he might be reborn in hell, in the animal womb, or in the realm of hungry shades. He is incapable of passing away until he has realized the fruit of stream-entry.\n\n>\"One who knows and sees that these phenomena are this way is called a stream-enterer, steadfast, never again destined for states of woe, headed for self-awakening.\"\n\nNow from a personal perspective, obviously I have faith in the Buddha because he says things that noone else says in a wiser way. That supposes I'm a faith-follower, I believe?\n\nI also thought about this stuff, and I understand that naturally everything related to conditioned phenomena is going to fade away. Our eyes are not going to last forever, they're only going to last 90 - 120 years at most. Consequently our eye-sense also fades once the structure supporting the sense fails. So this must make me a Dhamma-follower?\n\nFinally, I know and see that these phenomena are this way because I have the feeling in myself that they are temporary, that the fading of the senses is inevitable. This must make me a stream-enterer?\n\nI guess I don't believe that I am because it's too easy, and a lot of Dhamma practice is very difficult. It seems intuitive that almost every human on earth, when asked, would agree that eventually the senses will fade, does that mean everyone on earth is already incapable of being born in hell? Does that make everyone a Dhamma-follower? No, I don't think so, so there must be something that I don't understand in this sutta.\n\nOn another personal note, Dhamma practice is very difficult, so this extreme accomplishment seems to contradict my life experience of Dharma practice.\n\nAnd finally, maybe the Buddha is specifically speaking about the awareness of the sense-consciousnesses? To me, the sense-consciousnesses never made <sense> because of the divide of eastern vs western approach to consciousness. I'm only aware of my main consciousness and the senses within its' domain.\n\nAny thoughts on this?",

Ever since I was 12, I have been studying buddhism deeply, i read the Pali Canon, and I try my best to follow Mahayana, although recently I havent been following it thst much. while still  being Catholic.  I just want to say, my story does not represent the entirety of catholic faith and values.  When I walked into confession, the priest was very rude and he was rushing me to speak. I was like screw it and i walked away and went to another priest.  I asked the second priest if it was a sin to practice buddhism. he told me that it was the gateway to the devil. Now this is when i got angry, because I knew he didn't know not one thing about buddhism. He asked me shat drew me to it and obvious I couldn't say everything, so I just said finding peace. Then he had the bright idea to tell me about a book a CATHOLIC priest wrote about how buddhism is bad. like what? Mind you, I was very twitchy and short because I was pissed, but I couldn't go off on this guy. We got into a bit of a debate, and the whole confession was about this issue. In the end, I think that priests need to research other religions before talking.",

      "text": "This is something I’ve always struggled to grasp. From a physicalist perspective, it seems most intuitive to me that consciousness, thought, mental formations, etc. are processes generated by the brain that would therefore cease with brain death, so it’s been hard to synthesize that with the idea that this all would continue after death in another body.\n\nMy limited research into the arguments for rebirth seem to uncover only unsatisfactory answers that boil down to:\n\n1.\t⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠The Buddha in his enlightened state literally witnessed rebirth— but this just rubs me the wrong way because it’s akin to commanding one to accept so and so belief just because Jesus/the Quran/etc. said so;\n2.\t⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠There is anecdotal evidence for recalling past lives— but the evidence is generally contentious, and it seems irrelevant, as most people aren’t able to recall their past lives anyway;\n3.\t⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠Energy etc. doesn’t get destroyed, so the five aggregates would naturally continue on after death— but if the mind really arose organically from the brain, then it wouldn’t be unreasonable to assume that no more brain = no more mind, just as a flame would simply burn out once the candle sustaining it burnt out and would not cause another flame to spontaneously appear on some unlit candle.\n\nOn my own, the closest I’ve gotten to proving rebirth in a way that makes sense to me are:\n\n1.\t⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠Consciousness or sentience itself is a state of being, so, from the perspective of consciousness itself, our local consciousnesses are always going in and out as sentient beings are created and destroyed— but, from a strictly physicalist perspective, it’s hard to see how one specific local consciousness would therefore directly pass on to another specific local consciousness;\n2.\t⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠The illusory concept of a self is simply a specific configuration of the aggregates, so a combination of the aggregates in another being would pass the flame along, so to speak— but this would also mean that my hypothetical perfect clone/twin would share my sentience and “self” altogether like a hive mind, while also not explaining why such a process would have to wait for my death to pass on to another sentient being, as it would also imply that there could be tons of “selves” coexisting with a particular continuation of a particular configuration of the aggregates.\n\nProbably one of the biggest mental hurdles for me is also in understanding the actual physical mechanism by which the flame is passed on from the dead body of one being into the womb of another— how would this be physically possible?",

      "title": "Today I left Amidaji",
      "text": "# Today I left Amidaji\n\nAs the title suggests, I have been completely ex-communicated by Adrian Cirlea (I will never think he is a real priest anymore so I *will not* refer to him as Rev. or Josho in this post) and cannot contact him at all forever. He makes me feel bad even though I never fully joined his \"Sangha\".\n\nBTW this is what Adrian looks like:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/c4w3c21mcl5f1.png?width=202&format=png&auto=webp&s=4cb8aa275fe34b3e7bcb9841ad0dd9f8df83efcc\n\nI think the biggest reason I joined Amidaji was because I was just getting into Shin a few months ago but was confused by the number of diverse opinions regarding who Amida is, what is Sukhavati and its nature, and what is Shinjin. Jodo Shinshu can be a very confusing sect from the outside. I used to be a Muslim convert, and then I became devout to the point of fundamentalism. I am extremely well-versed in Islam and know practically the whole religion like the back of my hand. I *know* my past Islamic practices and beliefs have and may forever skew the way I view religions and their diverse practices, so I have been for the past year and a half trying my hardest to distance myself from Islam and what it has done to me. Islam made me and still rarely makes me view Buddhism like it's a Black-and-White religion, where I'm right and you're wrong. Over the past two month, this sentiment has been changing. Islam made me a worse person and has affected how I used to be a Buddhist, which is a reason why Adrian appealed to me.\n\nAfter doing some research on Adrian, I wrote him some emails and he responded. At first he was very nice to me and helped me out, but over time he became more dismissive of my questions and told me that I shouldn't be asking some questions. For example, I asked him about the difference between the Transformed and Fulfilled Land, and he told me:\n\n>\"...There is no reason to insist more on this, just focus on matters of faith\".^(1)\n\nLater on, Adrian told me that I needed to believe in:\n\n>\"...our conservative attitude towards marriage (only between man and woman), against abortion, etc...\".^(2)\n\nAdrian was basically dictating what I needed to believe in to join this temple or I'd be excommunicated from contacting Him. He wants us to follow a set of precepts that he basically created our we're not considered real Shin Buddhists. This includes the prohibition of meat and same-sex relationships.\n\nAnother point of contention I have related to our emails is how much he scolds us if we do not read his books, even if we do not have the time to. His damn commentary on the Infinite Life Sutra is 500 pages long! I'm a college student, how do you expect me to read this while I have other literary classes at the same time. Adrian told me:\n\n>\"...Again, do NOT read the Larger Sutra without the Commentary as you will never understand it. Any sutra has many layers of interpretation/reading, and the worst mistake one can do is to read it without proper guidance \\[*his* guidance\\].\".^(3)\n\n>Earlier, he told me: \"If you want to study with me and Amidaji you must read what I asked you to read (and I asked you to read my commentary on the larger sutra). Otherwise I will not be able to communicate with you anymore.\".^(4)\n\nBesides emails, I have also attended his zoom meetings: this includes both his sangha meetings and  1-1 discussions. During his Sangha meetings, nobody really had many questions, it was just Adrian rambling on about the same things. He has done a lot of work in his \"sect\" because of his Priest background, but this work has made him very arrogrant and pompous. His meetings can basically be summarized as this: 1. 45% dismissing other sects under the guise of \"Amida Dharma Talks\" 2. 45% praising Adrian as if he's a saint (quite the contrary) 3. 10% ramblings on the same topics\n\nTrust me on this assessment because if you watch Amidaji's videos this will basically cover all of them. Amidaji's meetings are just an echo chamber where we *must* agree with Adrian or risk ex-communication.   While he is good in how he preaches the Amida Dharma, that's the best thing about him. Adrian is a very dismissive and bigoted manchild who can't believe other people have different opinions.\n\nPraising Adrian in this cult is not an understatement. He parades himself in this online sangha as if *only he* understands Shinran and Rennyo. The two main people Adrian thinks understands Shin Buddhsim well enough are Paul Roberts and Eikan Kobai Sensei. It's almost like a trinity. As i have said earlier, he forces us to read his books where only he can give the best answer. Not only this, but if you join his meetings, get ready to praise his ability to \"know\" the correct interpretation of Shin Buddhism and to \"create\" a new \"sect\".\n\nAnd let's point out the elephant in the room: His political and sexual beliefs. Oh my God, how the F do you expect me to defend these Twitter posts Adrian has made in the past. Many articles and posts have been made showcasing what he has done so I won't post them here. He's a racist and homophobic person who distorts the Sutras to fit into *his* image of what Buddhism should be (I'll explain more about this later in this post). If he considers himself a Shin Buddhist with Shinjin, why does he believe that LGBTQIA+ people cannot receive Shinjin? Why does Adrian call Black people monkeys? I have *NEVER EVER* supported this side of him.\n\n\\--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWhen I told Adrian that following only his interpretation is too rigid (because it seems against the spirit of Buddhism and cult-like) he told me:\n\n>\"...When a teacher who has studied more than 20 years gives you his most important thing in his life - his time, energy and learning, you accept it in gratitude and do what you are told in your position of student, not complain or argue...\".^(5)\n\nWTF does \"not complain or argue\" imply? I realized firsthand that Adrian Cirlea is a cult leader.\n\nIf you look into my post or comment history, you'll see that I am a staunch critique of Nichiren's school. Why do I mention Nichiren in this post? I hate Nichiren, because he is so zealous and bigoted that there is no way *IMO* that he is or will be proven to ever be correct, and I fear that he had a horrible rebirth. I find many similarities now of Nichiren to Adrian. Adrian Cirlea thinks his Sh\\*t doesn't stink, so he touts how only he and the Amidaji Trinity (Him, Paul Roberts, and Eikan Kobai Sensei) know what Shin Buddhism is really about. If you don't follow him, you don't have Shinjin. Adrian also denounces other priests or monks that don't follow his cult doctrine. If you reserach how Adrian behaves, he is very much like Nichiren. From now on, I consider him the Nichiren of Jodo Shinshu.\n\nFrom my heart, I sincerely apologize to this Subreddit and the entire Shin sangha globally. Even when I was joining this sangha, his political and sexual views icked me. These are not defendable actions at all and I do not condone these. I was gonna ask him why he posted these things, but I was a little scared tbh. I wish I never knew who Adrian was and associated myself with Amidaji.\n\nI hope that people read this post and understand from an insider how F'd up this cult and its leader is. Learn from my mistake, as I have to relearn some things from Jodo Shinshu. I still have received Shinjin from Amida, but I feel empty now, like I wasted my time. I hope the moderators of this subreddit or others could make this post pinned as a warning for people who may stumble onto Amidaji and Adrian Cirlea.\n\n1.

      "text": "Ive recently become very interested in Buddhism, especially mindfulness techniques. I haven't tried to truly meditate, but I want to learn. I may go to a local center soon. I am reading Thicc Naht Hanh and listening to his talks. \n\nI still consider myself a Christian, though very disillusioned with it due to the bad fruit of family suffering as well as the larger political landscape in the US. I've believed for a long time that the True heart of Christianity is supposed to entail compassion and understanding of Truth. If Christ has truly saved us and through His love transformed us, how can we possibly be fine with the injustice we see? And not only that, believe that the authorities perpetrating those injustices are sanctioned by God? Even personally my evangelical upbringing has made pursuit of truth, openness and understanding all an uphill battle. \n\nAnd now I find myself approaching Buddhism with serious interest for the first time. Maybe as an augment to my Christian faith, maybe as a thing to pursue in and of itself. Thicc Naht Hanh sees no conflict between both traditions. Many will say otherwise, especially those of evangelical persuasion, that embracing Buddhism at all is serving false Gods or \"all roads lead to god\" deception. From an early age (im now in my mid 30s) I was immersed in a lot of fringe conspiratorial end times spiritual warfare veins of conservative Christian discourse. As an adolescent I was tormented with prospect of having to be a martyr killed by the anti christ. Id image all the possible ways I might be tortured and whether I would endure to the end and not renounce Christ. I was taught to pray and verbally rebuke bad thoughts and the demons that seed them. It was a sort of dark mindfulness now that I think about it. I still remember for whatever reason some preacher giving a radio sermon and claiming that if you dabble in Buddhist practices, that you'll be opening yourself up to demonic possession, because, he claimed, when you empty your mind you're making it the perfect place for a demon to enter into, because theres nothing else there. I now regard this idea and way of thinking with contempt. But I won't lie, it left and subtle but powerful psychological conditioning. When I consider letting go and trying meditating, that thought, that possibility of evil entering me lurks in the back of my mind. Even growing up and into adulthood Ive periodically had dreams where I was in some future situation, and in every situation I felt that I was different. Compromised. Straying from God. Ive often felt like the dreams were prophetic. Now I dont know. I think they were subconscious reflections of my inner path. Ive never been able to truly integrate into evangelical life. Young Earth creationism was one of the first things I let go of in favor of an informed scientific view of the origins of life. In college I dated a non Christian to the chagrin of my church leadership that was grooming me for leadership. That ended because my relationship compromised me. \n\nAnd now, Buddhist practice is helping me in ways nothing has. I feel happy to be alive. I feel like helping people at my job is a blessing and opportunity to brighten their day, not an annoyance or mundane interruption. Sometimes I get brief flashes of the sort of happiness I felt as a child. So I dont know. Im still a Christian and have faith in Christ and some version of a True form of the faith. But I want to explore and experience wisdom and joy wherever it can be found. And there is a lot of baggage that dogs me. \n\nEdit: I initially failed to clearly define my question. For anyone who was formerly Christian, what was your process of becoming Buddhist given your former background? For anyone still Christian who has successfully integrated Buddhist practice and ideas alongside Christianity, how do you navigate walking with each? How have you found freedom from dogmatic programming?\n\nA whole hearted thank you to everyone that has responded thus far. Your insights are very helpful.",

Keeping my post here unedited because I think good for other people to see my experience and be aware of the warnings signs. Thank you to everyone who has also shared great advice.\n\nIn my city I started going to a buddhist temple. I follow a lot of buddhist values so naturally I wanted to learn from actual buddhists instead of just learning from books. \n\nI've been attending the free sessions and plan on donating what I can afford to for their service.\n\nI attended a new meeting session which was more of a talk and had a monk exploring a buddhist book and it's teaching. Met some great people, talked in groups too on subjects we were learning. All seemed very good. I was learning a lot.\n\nHowever right at the very end they announce that these sessions will now cost a large fee for my wage to attend. And that I'd needed to sign a form saying I was going to commit to a 9 months of sessions that I had to commit to reading the book they were teaching on, that I'd have to attend every session, attend at least one meditation a week and sit in a written exam.\n\nDue to my job I have a different rota every week. I'm unable to commit to anything really whilst trying to be what I'd consider a student of knowledge. I tell them this and I basically get told to just sign up (which includes paying) and to tell them if I can't attend the sessions.\n\nHate to say it but red flags just instantly go up for me. It went from a nice environment of learning to feeling like I was being sold something, as if I was just another customer and I definitely felt an attitude change towards me when I said I may not be able to attend. I feel like I suddenly realised I was being sold Buddhism rather than them wanting to willingly teach.\n\nThis doesn't feel in line with the buddhist teachings of compassion. They weren't trying to encourage me to still come to learn, or to attend the free meditation. It was either I pay or I'm out. I can still attend the free meditation for everyone, but these study sessions were now cut off from me.\n\nWhy not allow me to just pay for the sessions I can come too due to my job? Why not have the doors of knowledge open for everyone to come and learn despite their situation. What of the homeless man with no money? They seemed to only want me for the sessions and said they couldn't be flexible about it. Unless of course I pay the fee then just let them know if I can't attend if I have work. But I'm not allowed to just attend if I had time and I just want to experience and learn what I can when I can. No I HAVE to be committed. Honestly it started feeling like a cult.\n\nBuddhism was formed from multiple different beliefs and ideas. The orginal Buddha was taught by different gurus and surpassed them in their teachings. I feel like some groups of  buddhist has forgotten this and it's became way too religious and stuck in blind faith. I think it's became way too dependent on it's own teachings. It felt very westernised in the way some religions work. \n\nIt's totally changed a lot of my perspective. I'll always still study Buddhism, I think the original Buddha's teachings are fantastic. I just see a disconnect in the modern world. I think there's a reason why The Buddha found enlightenment in the wild, by the woods and lake and not in a temple.",

      "text": "Recently i saw a post on why buddhism is not working for me and looking at the comment section , i found \\[most of the\\] people just encouraging to meditate more , remain with the feeling. While all that's good , as someone who goes by early buddhist text , i want to highlight some key things.\n\ndirectly MEDITATING is not what buddha described in his gradual training  \nneither remaining present and all that modern interpretations is something that buddha talked a lot about.\n\nLet me in brief highlight the GRADUAL TRAINING one must take to discover dhamma  \nThe source is mahjimma nikaya 107 , feel free to explore it yourself if you find anything useful words i quote below from the sutta\n\n*‘Master Gotama, in this stilt longhouse we can see sequential progress down to the last step of the staircase. Among the brahmins we can see sequential progress in learning the chants. Among archers we can see sequential progress in archery. Among us accountants, who earn a living by accounting, we can see sequential progress in calculation. For when we get an apprentice we first make them count: ‘One one, two twos, three threes, four fours, five fives, six sixes, seven sevens, eight eights, nine nines, ten tens.’ We even make them count up to a hundred. Is it possible to similarly describe a sequential training, sequential progress, and sequential practice in this teaching and discipline?’*  \n  \n*‘It is possible, brahmin. Suppose a deft horse trainer were to obtain a fine thoroughbred. First of all, he’d make it get used to wearing the bit. In the same way, when the Realized One gets a man for training, he first guides him like this: ‘Come, bhikkhu, live fulfilling virtue and the training rules. Live restrained by the code of conduct, endowed with proper behavior and a suitable environment. Seeing danger in the slightest fault, train in the training rules…’*  \n  \n*When the bhikkhu is virtuous, the Realized One guides him further: ‘Come, bhikkhu, guard your sense doors…’*  \n  \n*When the bhikkhu has his sense doors guarded, the Realized One guides him further: ‘Come, bhikkhu, be moderate in eating…’*  \n  \n*When the bhikkhu eats in moderation, the Realized One guides him further: ‘Come, bhikkhu, be committed to vigilance…’*  \n  \n*When the bhikkhu is committed to vigilance, the Realized One guides him further: ‘Come, bhikkhu, be possessed of recollection-and-awareness…’*  \n  \n*When the bhikkhu is possessed of recollection-and-awareness, the Realized One guides him further: ‘Come, bhikkhu, frequent a secluded lodging—a wilderness, the root of a tree, a hill, a ravine, a mountain cave, a charnel ground, a forest, the open air, a heap of straw…’*  \n  \n*He gives up these five hindrances, defilements of the mind that weaken understanding. Then, quite disjoined from sensuality, disjoined from unwholesome phenomena, with thinking and with pondering, with joy and comfort born of separation, he abides having entered upon the first jhāna… second jhāna… third jhāna… fourth jhāna…*  \n  \n***That’s how I instruct the bhikkhus who are trainees (sekhas) —who haven’t achieved their goal, but live aspiring to the supreme safety from the yoke.’”***\n\n  \nBe very mindful on what you are investing your time on and strive to understand your practice. PLEASE DON'T MECHANICALLY FOLLOW A METHOD, EXPECT RESULTS AND GET FRUSTATION IN EXCHANGE OF YOUR TIME AND FAITH\n\nMay all practice well",

Snake oil salesman selling programs to achieve astal projection and past life regression. Ect. \n\nAnd obviously there can be some very profound spiritual experiences that can come from meditation. For example the monk who self burned. My father was a monk and when I heard about that story as a child I asked him about it. He told me the monk would have been in such a deep meditative state that it was similar to a coma or deep sleep. So it can be applied and seen in real practice. \n\nSo I ultimately know my goal shouldn't be to have a spiritual experience from meditation. It should be to cultivate mindfulness, detach from thought. \nBut what about spiritual experiences? Can I expect to have one at some point in my journey or should I throw that idea out the window and continue to practice regardless?",

      "text": "Kia ora koutou, kia ora koutou - Hello everyone, be well.\n\nI am a very new learning Buddhist from Aotearoa New Zealand.  At this point on my path, I might tentatively consider myself a Secular Buddhist.  I have been interested in Buddhism for many years, but only since January have I been getting more intentional about my practice and study.  Already I am seeing positive effects in my life - I feel calmer, more mindful, and what little I've learned of the teachings of the Buddha are helping me combat long-lasting depression.  I meditate 2-3 times a day (what I think would be considered Anapana meditation?), practice stretching I learned from martial arts, and try to practice mindfulness, right words and actions, right insight and wisdom, and mettā for all beings.\n\nThe other day I met with a trusted, life-long friend, who I believe usually gives good wisdom, and we discussed our spiritual paths.  He draws from many religions to inform his beliefs, and our discussion touched on Taoism, Hinduism, Christianity, and other beliefs.  He made some interesting claims that did not sit right with me, though, and I would be very interested to hear other perspectives on these claims.\n\nI'll try to present these ideas to the best of my memory.\n\n- He claims that ascetic monks who are reaching for enlightenment are, in a way, committing what he calls \"spiritual suicide\". He claims that their near-complete 'disconnection from the world' leads them to be, in a way, spiritually empty or useless to those around them, unable to relate to anyone. I pushed back against this idea with the notion that, as I understand how things worked in the past, the layry would support the clergy, and in return the clergy would teach the layry what wisdom they can.\n\n- He claimed that 'extreme ascetics would starve themselves to death if they could, if doing so wouldn't generate negative karma'. I'm not sure what to make of this one.\n\n- He claims that Buddhism creates a hierarchy, where those ascetic monks that are closer to enlightenment are considered 'better than' everyone else. I pushed back with the notion that, in a way, we are all on this same path, a sort of 'universal oneness', and that as I understand it, all beings can eventually reach enlightenment.\n\n- He claimed that Siddhartha Gautama Buddha 'nearly starved himself' as part of his practice. I pushed back with the notion that Buddhism is, as I understand it, supposed to be a sort of Middle Way, neither hedonism nor extreme asceticism.\n\nI do not know exactly what to make of these claims, but I find I cannot agree that reaching enlightenment is \"spiritual suicide\". Surely, there must be some misconceptions in this view.\n\nThank you for your time and attention.\n\nAroha nui, much love 💗🙏",

Looking back on all the cringe things I’ve done in my life. I won’t hit you with details but I honestly think I’ve hit some BIG cringe. MORE than average. Anyways, I feel so ashamed it’s like I can’t even IMAGINE ever spiritually progressing, even over lifetimes, into something worthy of bodhisattvahood.\n\nSo just wondering:\nAre there any known stories of past lives of spiritual masters where they reveal that maybe they also had a cringe incarnation or two? Some story that shows it’s ok, it gets better, and you can still take refuge in the path and grow?",

I keep encountering comments like this on this sub, \"your practice must be weak\" or \"have you even studied Buddhism?\" and I just want to offer this as an area to be aware of within ourselves as we walk the path.

In fact, I have always leant more toward there being an “ultimate reality” though I don’t understand what that would look like and it may not be worth speculating on as it may be unanswerable.\n\nAnd yet, when I want to try transcendental meditation or other practices because it includes notions of “ultimate reality” I avoid them because the conventional wisdom seems to be there isn’t one and in buddhas eyes is kinda seen as a “cope” from my understanding. I also generally avoid meditation and yoga practices that aren’t used in my sangha  (zen).\n\nAs a Buddhist, how do you relate to notions of ultimate reality and dealing with spiritual practices outside of what was recommended by Buddha?",

He recognized that there was a limit to the lessons he could learn through pain.\n\nAny wisdom, book recommendations, or teachings that might help would be deeply appreciated.\n\nI'm especially interested in perspectives from those who have navigated abusive relationships, or teachers who have guided students through abusive relationships.\n\nThank you all deeply 🙏\n\n--\n\nThe international legal complexities of leaving make this even more challenging, but I'm trying to separate the spiritual question from the practical one.",

      "text": "One thing I noticed when I was just starting to study Buddhism and oriental religions in general, was the emphasis they give to mind, rather than the physical world. How the universe is seen as \"degrees\" of mental states, or planes, rather than an apparent physical, concrete universe.\n\nI mean, it's obvious why. Everything we perceive as external is actually a mental projection. If you look at any \"thing\", mind is there first, like a background. That's what we can see directly in our own experience.\n\nAnd it's kinda hinted even in Western spiritual practice. When people pray with a lot of faith and love, some of them have visions of deities or light. It's a total shift on reality when we change our mind state. No matter what's our religious background.\n\nI am saying this because I think that the idea of \"matter over mind\" or \"matter as substantial\" in Western spirituality kinda of blocks people from understanding the nature of reality in a better way.\n\nWe can see that when people get into Buddhism and find difficult to understand how the universe works without a specific God, or how we are reborn without a \"soul\".\n\nThis kind of mentality binds us to matter, in such a way that there must always be some kind of eternal \"thing\" or \"substance\" behind phenomena (even if it's a subtle substance/thing, like a soul or an individual God).\n\nI mean, people tend to find hard to understand something completely immaterial and without substance (like mind in Buddhism). They tend to think that there must be a \"thing\" behind \"things\", no matter what.\n\nThis is also dangerous to spiritual development, because you can easily turn into a skeptic or a materialist when you are told since you were born that spiritual reality is some kind of \"subtle matter\" inherently existing somewhere in the cosmos.\n\nDo you agree with that? What are your thoughts?",

What makes my set of parents special enough for my first-person awareness to take form? What's to stop it from manifesting again if it came from nothingness?). While I don't know if I can agree exactly on what Buddhism says about things like how life after death works or how reincarnation works, I find that a lot of what it says to be insightful (a lot of what it teaches also is shared with spiritual accounts like NDEs). \n\nBuddhism and other groups like Hinduism share advice on how to get through life like how to deal with inner turmoil.

      "title": "Marital/Spiritual Union with Avalokiteśvara",
      "text": "Good morning all, Namo Amida Butsu. \n\nI have what may be a controversial question regarding the idea of spiritual union in Buddhism that may be better suited for the Pure Land subreddit, but I am looking for examples across Mahayana/Vajrayana in general. In essence, placing all our love, affection, our entire being on the Ultimate in a sense that may be described as a marital union.\n\nIn Christianity for example,there are multiple Saints that were said to be wedded to Jesus due to their devotion to Him, and thus would be united to Him for all eternity in all ways including romantic, such as St. Catherine of Siena, St. Teresa of Avila, and St. Bernardo de Hoyos, who all received miraculous rings and experienced escatic visions of their marriage day go Him. It is not a sexual marriage or union but rather a full syncronicity with the Divine found in celibacy and rooting all desires in selflessness, essentially forgetting the self in Other Power. \n\nThe same may be said of Hinduism, where multiple Vaishnavist Saints were said to be married to Krishna in the same way as the Christian Saints above, such as St. Mirabai and St. Andal who were both celibate female yoginis that pledged themselves solely to marriage with Krishna and wrote many beautiful love poems about Him. \n\nIn Buddhism however, there is of course the idea that nothing has true form or self, with some branches of Buddhism stating even the Buddhas are not \"real\" in any sense and simply Emptiness reflecting itself back. There is Tantric Buddhism within Vajrayana that focuses on sexual union as the highest level of wisdom, but it is meant to be done passionlessly and is more about the sexual act itself rather than the nun taking the place of the female Buddha or the monk taking the place of the male Buddha. It's all symbolic rather than an actual representation of union between the practitioner and the cosmic Buddha. \n\nThe closest example I have found is, in Jodo Shinshu Buddhism, the founder St. Shinran while meditating in front of a statue of Avalokiteśvara/Kwannon for three days had an escatic vision in which Avalokiteśvara appeared to him and told him if he required a spouse, He would become his spouse, which later led to St. Shinran meeting his wife whom he viewed as an incarnation of Avalokiteśvara and would lead to marriage being permissible for priests in Jodo Shinshu as opposed to other branches. His wife would later write in a letter that she had a vision wherein she saw Shinran as an incarnation of Avalokiteśvara, bringing the mirror full circle; Avalokiteśvara married Himself to bring about the Jodo Shinshu sect and lead to a new wave of evangelism in Buddhism. Even then, it's not quite the same as what the Christian and Bhakti Saints experienced, wherein they were married to the Ultimate without any fleshly mediator. \n\nThis is a shot in the dark, but given St. Shinran experienced this vision and no one at the time seemed to question it, I wondered if it had any precedence in Buddhist history, or if any other Buddhist Saints had an experience like St. Catherine or St. Mirabai in pledging themselves fully to the Buddhas with full intimacy? Thank you in advance for any answers that can be provided. My wording is a bit clunky here given we are talking about a highly esoteric subject matter, so I apologize if I come off as oversimplifying matters regarding Buddha-Nature or union with the Divine. It just seems to me there must be other examples besides what St. Shinran experienced.",

      "text": "This story concerns Ãcariya Mun’s longtime spiritual partner.\n\nÃcariya Mun said that in previous lives he and his spiritual partner had both made a solemn vow to work together toward the attainment of Buddhahood. During the years prior to his final attainment, she occasionally came to visit him while he was in samãdhi. On those occasions, he gave her a brief Dhamma talk, then sent her away. She always appeared to him as a disembodied consciousness. Unlike beings from most realms of existence, she had no discernible form. When he inquired about her formless state, she replied that she was so worried about him she had not yet decided to take up existence in any specific realm. She feared that he would forget their relationship – their mutual resolve to attain Buddhahood in the future. So out of concern, and a sense of disappointment, she felt compelled to come and check on him from time to time. Ãcariya Mun told her then that he had already given up that vow, resolving instead to practice for Nibbãna in this lifetime. He had no wish to be born again, which was equivalent to carrying all the misery he had suffered in past lives indefinitely into the future.\n\nAlthough she had never revealed her feelings, she remained worried about their relationship, and her longing for him never waned. So once in a long while she paid him a visit. But on this occasion, it was Ãcariya Mun who thought of her, being concerned about her plight, since they had gone through so many hardships together in previous lives. Contemplating this affair after his attainment, it occurred to him that he would like to meet her so they could reach a new understanding. He wanted to explain matters to her, and thus remove any lingering doubts or anxieties regarding their former partnership. Late that very night and soon after this thought occurred to him, his spiritual partner arrived in her familiar formless state.\n\nTo be continued 🙏",

      "text": "Next year, I'd like to travel out of the country in search of a spiritual vacation. My main goal is to visit a temple. I've done a bit of digging, and currently I'm landing on Wat Suan Dok in Thailand. One of the appeals of this particular place is the advertisement of being able to sit down with a monk. This is definitely something I'd love to do, if possible.\n\nI'm trying to get some insight on this temple from people who have been there personally. I'm also trying to figure out if there might be another location that's better suited for something like this. I'm going to be traveling solo. I don't need a ton of attractions or fancy things, I'd like to visit a smaller place that isn't packed with people or a touristy destination temple, but i would like some things around the area I'd be staying to do. \n\nMy main goal is 5 to 7 days of peace. Away from the static in my brain of the day to day grind. I'd love to meditate on a mountain, or a place with a beautiful view. I'd love to sit down and have a conversation with a monk. Learn from the source and grow as a Buddhist (i don't have a teacher, so I'm very limited to reading and videos/podcasts like Ajahn Brahm). I'd love to purchase things that are made by the monks to display on my altar. Mainly, I'm trying to pull information from people who have actually traveled to a temple that fits the criteria. This probably won't be able to happen for a long time after this trip, so I want to make it count and make it memorable. Without the travel costs, I'm working with around $3-5k, 3 being what I'd prefer (spend as little as possible because I don't need a bunch of stuff, just the experience and peace).\n\nThank you for taking the time to read this :)",

I don’t fully understand why to be honest, but I've decided to just go with it and see where it leads. \n\nI've never even given spirituality much of a thought before but I'm 35 now, and suddenly I feel what I can only describe as \"spiritually directionless\". I know that probably sounds strange, especially since I’ve never been religious/spiritual before. \n\nMy parents didn’t practice any kind of religion, although I was Christened as a baby (mostly due to tradition, I think). My grandparents were religious, so I did hear Bible stories growing up, but religion was never pushed on me or a major part of my life. \n\n  \nI’m totally lost. Since I’ve never been part of any religion before, I don’t even know what “getting started” looks like. If you have any beginner-friendly advice, book recommendations, or online resources that might help someone like me ease into Buddhist thought and practice, I’d really appreciate it. \n\nI live in a country with a very small Buddhist population, and I struggle with severe social anxiety, so finding a local community isn’t really an option for me right now. This is something deeply personal that I’d like to begin practicing quietly and on my own.",

      "title": "Spiritual Transcendence and Atheism",
      "text": "I have a lengthy post here that basically describes spiritual transcendence as an antidote to a purely atheistic and materialist world view. There is a reference to a Buddhist book and a research paper titled \"Neurobiology of Spirituality\".\n\n\n\nWhat I am asking, for anyone interested, to please read and respond with your thoughts. Here it is.\n\n\n\nTo be disillusioned or disenchanted is to be disappointed or lose belief in something. A purely secular view of this world is useful for scientific inquiry, but not adequate for society as a whole. I personally have experienced disillusionment of this atheist world view through an episode I will not elaborate on here.\n\n\n\nFor the curious and left unfulfilled of this material world, they will eventually conclude, by thorough investigation, that the entirely atheistic worldview is not adequate for both explaining the existence of human consciousness and morality, as well as not being being compatible with most societies around the world. An atheistic worldview does not provide an adequate moral framework. Even the word 'atheist' to some, particularly the devout religious, has connotations like 'unlawful', 'sinful', or 'dark'.\n\n\n\nReligion provides support for those who lack understanding of the world and need a world view. These belief systems can also provide those who experience great suffering a coping mechanism.\n\n\n\nSelf preservation and self protection are essential to every human being, as well as safeguarding those around us altruistically. For coping with both death and uncertainty, many place their faith in God.\n\n\n\n“For self-protection man has created God, on whom he depends for his own protection, safety and security, just as a child depends on its parent. For self-preservation man has conceived the idea of an immortal Soul or Atman, which will live eternally.”\n\n\n\nThe quote above comes from a Sri Lankan Buddhist monk and scholar who introduced and expanded Buddhism into America and other western countries. Rahula downplays the importance of supernatural elements such as karma and rebirth, but does not reject them entirely. According to Rahula, God, as mentioned in the quote above, was created by man.\n\n\n\nAside from being pedantic and dissecting the nature of God, spirit and spirituality is something real and studied in many scientific papers, specifically spiritual transcendence. The quote below is from the following paper.\n\n\n\n[https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3190564/](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3190564/)\n\n\n\n\"Spirituality involves as its central tenet a connection to something greater than oneself\"\n\n\n\nIf this is true, would it not mean that those who have less 'spirit' or are less 'spiritual' have less connection to whatever it is that is greater than themselves?\n\n\n\nThe brain regions associated with self-referential thinking are known collectively as the default mode network, which have less activity with experienced meditators. There are other great benefits of meditation like less amygdala activity, meaning you are less emotionally reactive, but the defining aspect of spiritual transcendence is a loss, dissolution, or transformation of one's sense of self or ego.\n\n\n\nCould this very dissolution or transcendence, described in every culture around the world, throughout time, of every major religion, be exactly what every tradition describes? And could this phenomenon be the solution to those who are not satisfied with a purely material and atheistic world view?",

      "text": "Hello, I'm looking for more spiritual friends in Portland Oregon that we can help support each other on the path. I consider myself Tendai and attend a Tendai online Sangha, but since there's no Tendai temple in Portland, I attend Zen when I want personal interaction since they share sort of the same theoretical basis. Interested in people with similar leanings, perhaps who have attented a good variety of temples around here and have a solid picture of what they want. Doesn't necessarily have to be the same thing that I want. But people who can encourage each other to meditate, encourage each other in the precepts, encourage each other in retreats, etc, definitely interested in making new friends that would be a good influence.",

      "text": "I recently discovered spirituality 1.5 years ago and it completely changed my life.\nIt started with the NHI news in the states then went down a couple of rabbit holes. I attended an open session at a buddhist centre near me then I signed up right away for calm abiding meditation course then Lam rim (still In this course). I've had some interesting experiences along the way as well that shattered my atheist world view.\n\nHowever in the meantime as my curiosity couldn't be quenched and I found Buddhism very confusing as it's not really telling the truth but let's you find it I guess ?, I have been reading a lot of western spirituality material (Bob Monroe, Tom Campbell, law of one, Dolores cannon, Seth Material etc) I found it easier to understand. I do see similarities but I also am incredibly confused. There are some things that are similar some are not.\nSometimes people argue thing whether things are true or not, or if the channeled material got \"corrupted\" etc. I've heard it from some that I have to pick one system and stick to it. Does it include reading about aspects of the path and the \"truth\" as well? \n\nBtw I still attend my local centre the things I'm learning feel right, make sense and peaceful and almost feel at home there.\n\nI've tried asking my local centre but they were not familiar with these things. The one thing they told me is not to practice another thing at the same time as the works of the energy centres etc is in a different way.\n\nIf you could help but shining some light on the matter perhaps if you have gone through this as well I'd be very very thankful 🙏",

      "title": "Tibetan Spiritual Symbols: A Gentle Reunion with the Self",
      "text": "*— reflections from a quiet observer*\n\nI’ve been quietly browsing this forum for quite some time, and today, I can no longer hold back the stirring in my heart. I’d like to share with you some stories and insights I’ve gathered over the past year—silent yet soul-shaking moments inspired by Tibetan culture.\n\nMy initial fascination came from the mysterious and powerful symbols often seen in Tibetan traditions — flowing mantras, smooth prayer beads, small amulets worn close to the skin. These symbols seemed to draw me in like magnets. I didn’t grow up within this cultural soil, yet at some unexpected moment, I found myself struck by the reverence, rhythm, and depth of intention behind them. A long-forgotten part of me began to gently awaken.\n\nAmong all these symbols, the six-syllable mantra “Om Mani Padme Hum” captivated me the most. It felt like a secret messenger—appearing in sacred texts, engraved on rings, strung through prayer beads, and even printed on fabrics worn by people who didn’t speak a word of Tibetan. At first, I tried to decode its meaning:  \n**Om**, the sacred sound of the universe, a resonance of body, speech, and mind.  \n**Mani**, the jewel of compassion and wisdom.  \n**Padme**, the lotus that blossoms unstained from the mud, a symbol of purity.  \n**Hum**, the echo of spiritual completion.\n\nBut over time, I realized that interpretation wasn’t everything. What moved me more was how this mantra lives in daily life. In Tibetan regions, it is not just a scriptural chant—it’s the inscription on mani stones, the whisper in spinning prayer wheels, the wind-song on fluttering prayer flags. When I absentmindedly run my fingers across a ring bearing this mantra, the cold metal is no longer just material—it becomes a gentle reminder to return to inner calm amidst chaos.\n\nThen there’s the legend of **Siguniang Mountain**—Four Sisters Mountain—a breathtaking story where sacred mountain worship and feminine divinity are interwoven. The tale tells of four sisters who fought fiercely to protect their homeland from demons, ultimately transforming into four majestic snow-capped peaks. The tallest among them, Yaomei Peak, is revered as the “Queen of Sichuan Mountains,” representing the youngest and bravest sister. This mountain, embodying protection, sacrifice, and feminine strength, reshaped my understanding of the divine feminine. No longer confined to softness or motherhood, it radiates defiance and responsibility—echoing the image of Tara, the female bodhisattva who vows to liberate all beings. Every time I recall this story, it plants a seed of resilience within me, reminding me to face life’s trials head-on.\n\nPerhaps true spirituality doesn’t always require grand rituals or profound doctrines. The prayer beads we choose to carry, the amulets we hold, the sacred mountains we revere—they are all channels through which we speak to ourselves. In the rush of modern life, these spiritual symbols become anchors that hold us steady against fragmentation. Through quiet repetition and silent gazes, they bring us into presence and peace. They are mirrors, too—reflecting our longings, our strength, and the forgotten parts of our inner landscape.\n\nMore and more, I’ve come to believe that this path is not necessarily about belonging to a particular faith. It’s simply a way of being. Just as some people journal to understand their emotions, or turn to music for healing, I turn to these Tibetan spiritual symbols. They are the language through which I reconnect with myself.\n\nAnd this journey is far from over. I don’t know what other insights or surprises await me, but I look forward to them—and I’d love to share and learn with others who’ve felt something similar. 🌿",

But do not become attached to them, thinking \"this is the end\". This was a mistake made by many great, wise masters during the Buddha's time, and he proved all of them wrong.\n\nKeep going. Keep training. And most importantly, search for a teacher than can guide you correctly and help reaching even higher attainments.\n\nMay all of you reach enlightenment.🙏🪷",

      "text": "With the recent assassination of the UnitedHealthcare ceo, people are celebrating about it. Evej though I don't have an opinion on thr guy as I wasn't paying attention to all the controversies surrounding him, I can understand why people were frustrated and desperate for being denied coverage. However, I can't help but wonder if it's harmful in the spiritual/karmic sense to take delight in another's misfortune, let alone death.\n\nWhile I'm certain spiritual groups like Buddhists aren't above using unpleasant means out of desperation (like self-defense), I think that the ideal is that you wouldn't take pleasure in it. At most, you're only resolute in doing what's necessary and nothing more. Violence isn't something to take joy in no matter what. Doing so would be antithetical to spiritual practices.\n\nWhat's your take on people rejoicing over another's misfortune, be they evil or not? Would those happy about the ceo's death accumulate negative karma?",

      "text": "Western Buddhism has been heavily influenced by the New Age movement. In online forums (including here at reddit) it is common to encounter nominal \"Buddhists\" proclaiming New Age beliefs that are alien or even antithetical to Buddhism. Adherents of such ideas rarely seem to be aware of those ideas’ origins, however; nor of their problematic nature from a Buddhist point of view. Probably, part of the reason for this is that is isn't all that difficult to find ideas in the Buddhist tradition that are superficially similar to New Age beliefs. A New Ager might cherry-pick such Buddhist ideas, take them out of their context and understand them through a New Age lens, and then mistakenly believe to be proclaiming something Buddhist.\n\nThe close links between Western Buddhism and New Age spiritualism (including its predecessors such a Theosophy and New Thought) really need a book-length study by some historian with sufficient knowledge and understanding of both traditions, as well as of relevant aspects of 20th century cultural history. While such a book would surely be fascinating, researching and writing it seems a daunting project, and certainly not the kind of project I could pull off, lacking much of the necessary expertise and skill. This blog post is the best I can do right now:\n\n[https://www.lajosbrons.net/blog/western-buddhism-and-the-new-age/](https://www.lajosbrons.net/blog/western-buddhism-and-the-new-age/)\n\n(Of course, suggestions for improvement are welcome.)",

Its methods/dharmas (according to Tiantai school) are six:\n\n1) Count\n\n2) Follow\n\n3) Cease (samatha)\n\n4) Contemplate (vipassana)\n\n5) Return\n\n6) Purify\n\nAll are just as the samatha-vipassana [teachings] of Tiantai [school]. Those whose preparations are inadequate mustn’t not know [this].\n\n[For it is] said in Guishan’s Admonitions: \"[That those who] are unconcerned with the [Buddhist] doctrines, do not have the [necessary] causes to accord realisation to the profound way.\"\n\n[Just as] the Precious/Jewel Treasury sastra [states]: \"Pitifully the priceless precious/jewel [lies] hidden inside the pit of [five] skandhas/aggregates.\" \n\n**So when then will there be attainment to the spiritual light’s solitary shine shedding off [both the six] sense-roots and sense-dusts?**\n\n.\n\n---\n\n.\n\n######Essential Dharma of Mind Transmission 3viii\n\n.\n\n>所言同是一精明分為六和合。一精明者。一心也。六和合者。六根也。此六根各與塵合。眼與色合。耳與聲合。鼻與香合。舌與味合。身與觸合。意與法合。中間生六識為十八界。若了十八界無所有。束六和合為一精明。一精明者。即心也。學道人皆知此。但不能免作一精明六和合解。遂被法縛不契本心。\n\n.\n\n**What's said to be the one essential luminance is discriminated into six resonating units**^1 .

These are the eighteen realms^7 .\n\nIf the eighteen realms are completely understood to be devoid of existence, the six resonating units are held as one essential luminance. This one essential luminance is the one-mind. \n\nStudents-of-the-way all know this. Yet they can't stop making interpretation of this one essential luminance as six resonating units. And so, fettered by the dharma, [they] don't accord with the original mind.\n\n.\n\n1. The one essential luminance and six resonating units are terms mentioned in the Surangama Sutra.\n\n2. The six sense roots are eye, ear, nose, tongue, body and manas (mental-faculty).\n\n3. The six sense dusts are sight, sound, smell, taste, touch and dharma (mental-object).\n\n4. Manas is the mental faculty.\n\n5. Dharma here refers to mental object.\n\n6. Vijnana which means 'divided or dualistic knowing/knowledge' is usually translated as consciousness. Thus the six vijnanas are eye-consciousness, ear-consciousness, nose-consciousness, tongue-consciousness, body-consciousness and mental-consciousness.\n\n7.

Anyway, my feelings of spirituality are there is truly nothing to achieve on a permanent level within human form. Yes through practice we strengthen heathy mindsets and inner peace, but is this not a coping mechanism to make dormant our complex mind and its self awareness. Ultimately the most we can do is remain in a complete hypnosis conscious state 24/7 for the rest of our lives, we can’t truly achieve anything. Yes there is enlightenment, however that infers you have completed and transcended humanity and in my eyes completely left your human form and returned to the Universe, Now, divine, nothingness, consciousness etc, of which we already are when in the absence of our human mind’s self awareness. Ultimately death is the only true enlightenment?\n\nI see life as a game now, I have my internal self of which is my core, and now I understand unless I completely severe my humanity from me then I will always be incomplete (even if it’s 0.000000000001% incompleteness), and in a way this understanding has freed me and removed my fear of death. \n\nThe whole point is that there is no meaning, but doesn’t spiritualism and enlightenment mean a process and give purpose to live with, so in essence gives ‘meaning’ to one, if so doesn’t this just replace our lack of purpose in life with another facade of ‘meaning’. All it does is provide sanity to the human mind by giving justification to our existence? (Just how we seek from the external)\n\nThe only way I see completeness and inner peace is either 100% constant hypnosis, besides that aren’t we all just experiencing incompleteness on different levels and ultimately just working towards decreasing that amount of incompleteness to inverse infinity?\n\nMaybe I am understanding spiritualism and enlightenment wrong, or maybe there are other perspectives I haven’t explored… please enlighten me. \n\nOr does nothing truly matter in this life and it is actually a coping mechanism.",

      "text": "Hello friends,\n\nI grew up in Canada, but my mother immigrated from a country with a lot of religious tension and violence, because of this she was very anti-religious during my childhood. There was no talk of church or spiritualty that wasn't deeply disapproved of or even mocked by her.\n\nAfter leaving home I struggled with meaning and finding my roots in the world as we were not a close family and we moved too often for me to have longstanding relationships with other people. I moved to Asia for work and discovered meditation and a deep sense of peace in Eastern believes like Buddhism, Hinduism, and Jainism that had been missing from my life. Though I can't help but still feel the seeds of doubt in me from my mother saying that anything spiritual is a 'cult', 'woo-woo', or worse adjectives she's mentioned that still run through my mind.  \n  \nIs there a way to overcome this doubt and truly embrace spirituality with 100% belief? If so, how could I practice this?  \n  \nTLDR: Craving spirituality but grew up in a deeply anti-religious household and struggling to remove the doubt from my mind, as Buddhism as been a saving grace in my life.",

      "text": "Hello everyone, I'm writing this post and plan to post it in multiple different forums to ask for potential guidance and insight. I'm a very logical person, and haven't been spiritual in years, however recently I've been having dreams that are very out the ordinary for me. \n\n\n\nTypically, my dreams are random, vague and inconsistent. I never see the same people in more than one, most of them end abrubtly and are honestly just nonsensical. However, for the last 7 or 8 months now, I've had very vivid dreams of being visited by a young girl, who appears very consistent from dream to dream, as do the settings she visits in, with the exception being her age. Sometimes she's older, sometimes she's younger, but every dream makes it apparent it's the same girl. She has the same brown eyes, brown hair with a tinge of red that smells like apples, light brown skin and the exact same smile and laugh. When I dream of her, it feels so real, I can remember every detail, I can practically still feel the touch of her skin and the smell of her hair vividly, and her name, Aurora. She tells me I'm her daughter, and looks so much like the woman I've been dating for the last year. The only thing is, we don't have a child together, though we do very much intend to. \n\n\n\nThe dreams range from my girlfriend and I taking the girl to the park so she can play while we enjoy a picnic, sometimes on the park benches, sometimes underneath a tree, to my girlfriend doing our girl's hair and painting her nails. Sometimes we're watching the football game together, other times my girlfriend is taking her shopping and I'm not allowed to go because \"No daddy, this is girl time, you stay here.\" I've had so many of these dreams now, with the most recent one being last night.\n\n\n\nSometimes I feel crazy because a part of me really believes I'm being visited by our future child, but even if spiritual beings are real, how could I be visited by one who hasn't even been born yet? Am I insane for thinking she may really be my little girl? \n\n\n\nI'm sorry if it seems silly, but I'm hoping to gain some insight from spiritual people and leaders of various belief systems, in hopes of making sense of everything, and hopefully getting some answers.",

Besides that, I don’t feel like my life is too occupied in most fundamental aspects of my adult life. As most people who seek religion, I’m somebody who’s not living up to a life purpose where I could become a part time, full time guru or monk.

      "text": "An old thing i had posted here in 2022, and deleted out of shame, now reposted for the sake of archiving. \n\nSo i made a lot of sense out of it since then, and i've been happily practicing <3\n\n***\n\n1- CW mention of suicide attempt, and honestly a lot of r/offmychest material\n\n2- Throaway account so that i can say all the ridiculous things i need to say and feel only moderate amounts of shame about it.\n\n3- Also i'm fluent but not an actual native of english, if there's wonky syntax or spelling it's because i don't know how to speak.\n\n4- now that i finished typing my wall of text (sorry about that) i realize that i wrote it with fluff and florish like it was fiction and now it sounds insincere and maybe fake.\n\nI won't change it. I believe fiction is the only way for us small and finite humans to get a grasp of an infinite and senseless world, and i believe humor and florish is a way for me to put a safety distance between me and memories i'm still very sensible about.\n\nFor the sake of me getting the answers i need i told the relevant events and thought process that happened to me in the order they happened to me, but i have no way to prove that i'm not faking it for attention.\n\nIf you can't believe me but still want to say something, please indulge me and treat this like a wacky creepypasta that you wouldn't buy into but would still suspend your disbelief for.\n\n5- i talk a lot about myself as if i were an immensly interresting person and i get that it all sounds very foolish and self-centered, i don't know what i'll get out of this but i do except to be called out for that, i believe it would be healthy for my ego and my personal path so don't hesitate to be harsh.\n\nAnyway, what's in the title.\n\nI consider this the single most important event in my life (up to this day), the moment that defined who i'd be as a person, and even though this memory never left me a single second i talked about it to almost nobody because it's both quite intimate and quite impossible to explain without sounding super weird.\n\nThat is, until a few months ago when i told that silly story in an half-drunk haze to another half-drunk guy that had just came back from his retreat in a monastery in Thailand, and he told me to check out what buddhism had to say on that.\n\nFor the first time i had a chance to understand what had happen that day, my most precious memory, what had helped me through all my life but that i never managed to make quite sense of.\nWhich is why i'm here today.\n\nFor the context, when i was 13 was also the year i had my first and only suicide attempt. I had suffered suicidal ideation since i was 9-10. School was horrible, i was already crippled with undiagnosed mental illness, unresolved queerness, and the kind of cruelty that the school system reserves for the weird kids of those ilks.\n\nLife was hard, had kinda always been, but at 13 i was diagnosed a sudden and severe chronic illness that'd lead to a lifelong disability.\n\nSo yeah, school was shit, my brain was trash, and i was seeing my body quickly decrepit without any hope of betterment in any area. What is left in your life when you're 13 and alone and in pain and boiling hormones make you edgy? You catch my drift.\n\nWhat stopped me was the cold realization that killing yourself when you're a weak kid with no gun or high bridges around requires way more preparation and equipment than i had, and that what would happen if i missed my shot would be far, far worse.\n\nSo i cleaned my mess, tidied up the knive i had no idea how to use and the belt i had no idea where to tie, and told not a soul about it.\n\nI was 13 and entirely made of sadness the way teenagers can be, but that welcomed failure gave me a sudden reality check.\n\nPragmatically, i wouldn't die of suicide, that was not realistically going to happen.\n\nBut my problems were still here.\n\nI was munching on those thoughts for a week or a month, i can't remember, but then sweet and soft early summer weather came so i got to unearth myself from my depression den and take a nap in my mom's garden's hamok, under the trees.\n\nAnd i don't know, maybe it was the fresh air, the warm sun, the small and cozy garden, the fact that i had had enough time to let all those thoughts macerate, but here's what happened in my head, i remember the feeling with clarity but the thoughts are blurry:\n\nSo, i couldn't die, i was trapped here, and this meant that my only solution was to willingly choose to live. For a boy whose life had been full with the idea of his own death, that was a big shift of perspective.\n\nI thought of what living implied, on a metaphysical level. Having influence on others, letting other influence you, the fact that pain would never stop, and if fighting something that would never stop even had sense.\n\n(Here's were the blurry recollection and dumb-sounding stuff begins, stay with me.)\n\nThe tree above me was living too, as was the grass under me, i was a part of that.\n\nI thought about the fact that every single strand of grass is its own organism, its own entire living being, but whose essence was not separated from the rest of the lawn in any meaningful way. Like, the lawn exists both as a lawn and as a gathering of a hundred thousands individual strands of grass.\n\n(i was not putting it out with those words when i was 13 obviously, i guess i just held onto that thought into my better-read late 20s)\n\nThat thought brought me to thinking about the living network of grass, trees, bugs and birds and me, the cycle of us dying, rotting, breathing and shitting, feeding each other, unable to be separated in any meaningful way, each of us a tiny extension of the whole.\n\nAnd i don't know how to describe this in a satisfactory way, and especially not in my mother tongue, but i felt like in that moment i had gone off the ground, out of my body and out of my self, and i had dipped a toe in \"the great flow\".\n\nI felt perfectly safe, perfectly serene, perfectly welcomed, perfectly fitting in the right place as the tiniest spec of dust in the immensity of the everchanging universe.\n\nI felt like we were nothing but the sum of what we exchanged between each others, from the amoeba to the forests to the megalopolis, like a camera dezooming from the microscope to the Milky Way, all of us embarked in this great flow, struggling and growing, all our emotions and actions from happiness to pain to grief to terrifying violence to absolute joy a sacred witness of us being here, with no other meaning that being here really, a wonderful event happening, and i loved us all so much.\n\nI found us beautiful, moving, and perfect. Not \"perfect\" as in \"only good and none bad\", but \"perfect\" as in complete, circular.\n\nAt that moment nothing existed and nothing was true past that love, which was the most conforting and joyful feeling i ever felt.\n\nThen at some point i came back to Earth, in that mind, in that body, in that hamok under that tree, and i guess i went on with my life.\n\nI remember beggining to form (without the words to express i correctly) the idea that reality was nothing but the network of stories we construct as we go, which doesn't help when you need to believe that schoolwork or social conventions are important (and they are, just not for the reasons i was taught), and that i had needed some time to adjust.\n\nIt sure didn't help at all with my problems with authority, or even with my philosophy classes in high school (which was a bummer).\n\nBasically what it took to bring me back to Earth was understanding that yes, behind the curtain was that perfect flow of all things and that all i saw around me was nothing but fictions, meaningless chitchat, but that actually i loved chitchat, and i loved even more the beings doing it.\n\nI also remember thinking that i had brought back from that \"trip\" a crumb of that perfect joy i had felt that day, that i had tucked it in between my ventricules, and thinking that the happiness i now felt at any moment was not an emotion anymore but a state of being.\n\nIt left me so much stronger than i was before. I've never stopped being suicidal actually, i still have a brain susceptible to chemical imbalance and emotions override me and my \"permanent state of metaphysical happiness\" quite often.\n\nSince then i've walked dangerously close to that pit more than once, my life have gotten immensly better overall but i still make little field trips to bad places from time to time, but the fact that i am still here today to write these lines is proof of my resilience and i impute it in large parts to what came upon me that day.\n\nBut it left me quite mystical in a way that was very difficult to express to others, i was and still am in social circles that are very much not into spirituality of any kind, and in a way it made me lonely in a whole new way. Because of this, i've slipped quite deep down some culty slopes, i've gotten into a pair of abusive, traumatizing relationships that used my unadressed sensibility to spirituality as an entry point or a way to strenghten a psychological hold, the last one i gotten out of very recently.\n\nThat last experience made me understand that actually i wanted to talk about it, and i wanted answers, or at least an outsider point of view. An uninterested one, of course.\n\nSo yeah, these past 4 months i've been trying to join an in-person sangha, read theory and practice, but in my current circumstances i've only been able to stick with reading theory. So far what i understood is that no words in this world can possibly express how much Nothing i know, which is always a valuable lesson to get, and also reasuring because it means you're in the right place to learn.\n\nAmong the few things that i read and understood, a lot align and put words on things i've felt and thought before, so that's encouraging.\n\nMy question is: did some of you experienced the same thing, or something similar? If yes, what happened? And maybe most importantly: what do i do now?\n\nTL;DR: When i was 13 i had a spiritual revelation, in the light of buddhist teachings what happened and how far up my own ass am I ?",

I see they originate from India, and from religions such as yours (Buddhism) and Hinduism, so I came to this reddit community online as it seemed the quickest and most reliable way to get an answer. I see so many spiritual people being disrespectful to certain closed practices, like burning white sage, and I want to make sure that wouldn't be the case if I were to practice chakras. I feel sad to see that some people will take closed off practices and steal them from communites, then water it down and.. Eugh. Even if I can't, and the Buddhist community is uncomfortable with spiritual people practing it even if done correctly, I'd still like to know about them too, because they seem really interesting.

      "text": "‘Venerable, you must hear! The Blessed One has in many ways condemned speaking falsely. He has commended giving up speaking falsely, has revered, praised and extolled it. Since, venerable, from this day forward, you must not, even with the intention of making someone laugh, speak a conscious lie, how much more must you not purposely speak about the higher human characteristics. Venerable, the knowing and seeing Blessed One, the Tathāgata, the Arhat, the completely and perfectly Awakened One has said: “That monk who, without knowing, without ascertaining, when even the higher human characteristics do not exist and are not found, nor the noble, nor the achievement of the distinction, nor knowledge, nor vision, nor the state of ease, still says ‘This I know. This I see’, and then later when he wants purification of the offence that has arisen from the false assertion says – whether he is asked or not – ‘Venerables, in saying I know what I do not know, in saying I see what I do not see, I spoke an empty lie’, since that monk – unless it was said from pride – is defeated he is one denied the right of living with a community.”\n\n‘Such a monk asserts in regard to himself: “What do I know? I know suffering. I know its arising, its stopping and the path. What do I see? I see the gods. I see the divine snakes and forest divinities and heavenly birds and celestial musicians and centaurs and demonic serpents and hungry ghosts and flesh eaters and evil spirits and female demons and demons inhabiting corpses and flesh eaters of the thick obscurity.\n\n‘“The gods also see me. The divine snakes and forest divinities… \\[as before\\]… also see me.\n\n‘“I hear the words of the gods. I hear the words of the divine snakes and forest divinities…\n\n‘“The gods also hear my words. The divine snakes and forest divinities… also hear my words.\n\n‘“I go to have sight of the gods. I go to have sight of the divine snakes and forest divinities…\n\n‘“The gods come to have sight of me. The divine snakes and forest divinities… come to have sight of me.\n\n‘“I converse with the gods, chat, exchange pleasantries and continually stay with them. I converse with the divine snakes and forest divinities… chat, exchange pleasantries and continually stay with them.\n\n‘“The gods converse with me, chat… the divine snakes and forest divinities converse with me, chat, exchange pleasantries, and continually stay with me.”\n\n‘Although he is not one who has achieved this, he says “I have obtained the perception of impermanence, in impermanence the perception of suffering, in suffering the perception of no-self, in food the perception of the disagreeable, in all the world the perception of disgust, the perception of danger, the perception of abandonment, the perception of dispassion, the perceptions of stopping, death, impurity, of a blackened corpse, a putrefied corpse, a swollen corpse, a worm-eaten corpse, a gnawed corpse, a bloody corpse, a scattered corpse, a heap of bones and the perception of discerning emptiness.”\n\n‘Although he is not one who has achieved this, he says “I have obtained the first meditation and the second and the third and the fourth, friendliness, compassion, sympathetic joy, equanimity, the sphere of endless space, of endless awareness, of nothing what-so-ever, and of neither perception nor non-perception, the fruit of one who has entered the stream, of one who will return only once, of one who will not return, and of the state of an arhat, the range of supernormal powers, the divine ear, the ability to read thoughts, know past lives, the places of death and rebirth, and the exhaustion of the afflictions. I am an arhat, one who meditates in the eight forms of release, and who is freed from both physical and mental constraints.”\n\n‘If a monk has done such a thing, immediately upon doing so he is not a monk, not an ascetic, not a son of the Buddha, and has perished from the state of a monk. For him the character of an ascetic is destroyed, perished, disrupted, fallen, defeated, and for him the character of an ascetic cannot be restored – like a palmyra tree with its top lopped off is incapable of becoming green again, incapable of again sprouting growth or gaining fullness. You, from this day forward must make effort to carefully guard your thought by remembering and attending to what is not to be practised, and not to be done, and to the abstention from what is not to be practised.\n\n‘Are you not going to practise such a thing?’\n\nThe newly ordained must say: ‘I am not going to practise it.’ That is the declaration of the things that lead to falling.\n\nTranslated by Gregory Schopen from H.

      "text": "Here are 15 points that show the roots of Abrahamic religions (Judaism, Christianity, Islam) are in Hinduism. Even a few of them are more than enough to prove this point. Yet these 15 points are selected from a big number:\n\n1)The absolute truth is that one thing is preceded by another which will go infinitely into the past which will never reach nothingness as something does not emerge from nothingness—thus universe made of matter (transformation of “energy that can neither be created nor destroyed”) is “eternal” (Bhagavat Gita 13:19, 20; Ecclesiastes 1:4)\n\n2) Soul is eternal, takes another body when the present one is no longer useful due to accident/age. (Bhagavat Gita 2:22; Wisdom of Solomon 8:20; Job 1:21, KJV; Luke 12:5; 1 John 2:17; Mathew 11:7-15)\n\n3) Just like a human being passes through growth, adulthood and old age, each block of history \\[called *Yuga* or “Age”\\] passes through phases of declining quality (Bhagavat Gita 14:18) or from “unleavened” \\[pure\\] phase to “leavened” (impure) phase (Mathew 13:24-30, 33)\n\n4) When decadent phase reaches its peak of decay, God restores the purity bringing New Age (Bhagavat Gita 4:7, 8; Mathew 12:32; 19:28; Revelation 11:18; 21:1-5; Daniel 2:32, 33, 34, 44)\n\n5) Recreated New Age will become Old Age in due course of time, and cycle of New Age and Old Age will repeat (Bhagavat Gita 4:7, 8; Ecclesiastes 1:9, 10, ESV, Septuagint) like a “seed” (Mathew 13:31, 32) which is symbol of cycle of GROWTH and DECAY. Hence God is called \"Seed-giving Father\" and \"King of Ages\" (Bhagavat Gita 14:4; 1 Timothy 1:17, ESV)\n\n6) Each New Age is inherited by the *satvic* or the spiritual who were so in the previous Age and will continue to be so till the end of each Age. The rajasic and tamasic or the unspiritual return to the second half of each Age (Bhagavat Gita 14:18; Mathew 19:28-30) with the same *sanskar* or tendency/traits they “treasure” or cherish in their “hearts.” (Bhagavat Gita 8:6; Luke 6:43-45)\n\n7) First half of each Age is like heaven on earth quality-wise as whole inhabitants are only the spiritual, but second half of each Age is mixed of both the spiritual and the unspiritual—hence is like hell on earth quality-wise. First half is like day—hence inhabitants are called “people with divine property” or “children of light” (Bhagavat Gita 16:1-3; Mathew 5:14; 1 Thessalonians 5:5) and second half is like night or “darkness”—hence inhabitants are called “*asuric*” people “with demonic property” (Bhagavat Gita 16:4, 21, 22; John 6:70; Mathew 8:11, 12).\n\n8) The spiritual take lessons from the unspiritual on what to avoid in life to remain spiritual, and watching ill-effects of choices of the unspiritual makes the spiritual even more resolved to be spiritual. Thus the unspiritual is like blessing (not a problem) for the spiritual. (Bhagavat Gita 3:25, 26; Proverbs 21:18; Luke 19:11-27; Mathew 22:1-14)\n\n9) Action and consequences are inseparable (Bhagavat Gita 2:47; Galatians 6:7)--hence wise choice attracts beneficial results and unwise choice attracts unpleasant results.\n\n10) Destiny is created by thoughts over which humans have control. If person uses this control, his mind is his “friend” or else it is his foe” (*Bhagavat Gita* 6:5). The same thought is seen in Jeremiah 17:10 (*Septuagint*) which says humans are endowed “reins” that can be used over thoughts and bodily tendencies.\n\n11) Non-violence is one’s duty (Genesis 1:29, 30; 13:9; Deuteronomy 22:10; Isaiah 22:13–14; 66:3–4; Mathew 19:18; Revelation 22:15) which is called “your ultimate duty” in the East. (Bhagavat Gita 12:4, 13, 20)\n\n12) God is described to be the beginning and end of everything as all cycles are happening under His oversight. This concept is symbolized by taking first letter (Alpha) and last letter (Omega) of Greek Alphabets (Revelation 1:8), which is same in the sound *AUM* which represents Supreme Soul God and indirectly individual souls as A is symbolic of first sound in alphabets which is produced by wide opening of mouth, M is symbolic of last sound, happening by closing the mouth, and the middle sound U is symbolic of narrowing of mouth, thus *AUM* symbolizes that which comes and goes after remaining for a while. (Bhagavat Gita 10:25)\n\n13) God and His Name is defined to be “The Being” (Exodus 3:13, *Septuagint*), and modern translations render it as “I AM THAT I AM” which many transliterates as Jehovah, from the verb “*haya,*” thus one who “causes” the Old Age to “become” New Age (Ecclesiastes 1:9, 10). This is the most famous concept of *Bhagavat Gita* 4:7–8. Abraham called God by the name “THE ETERNAL.” (Genesis 21:33) In India, the word for EXISTENCE is *Asti,* “Now being, existent, present, from Asa, “to be” \\[hence the word for Epic is *itihāsa* = *iti ha āsa* “thus it has been” which means something that had happened, was in existence, is presented in story-format\\]. Thus both highlight the connotation of BEING ETERNALLY EXISTENT, being “connected with the verb *haya*, to be, with the meaning ‘he is,’ implying existence without limitation.(New International Encyclopedia/Jehovah)\n\n14) God is ETERNAL (Sanatan) His Laws too are ETERNAL. (Malachi 3:6) His ETERNAL Law (*dharma*) is defined as “being delightfully engaged in the welfare of all living beings.” (*Bhagavat Gita* 12:4, 20) Righteousness is described as giving as God gives more to a flower than to a king (Mathew 6:28-33) You should not give even a little bit of uneasiness even to an animal, (Deuteronomy 22:10)—even if it belongs to one’s enemy (Exodus 23:4, 5) Killing an animal even for sacrificial purpose is equal to killing a human being—and such an act inevitably invites befitting consequence. (Isaiah 66:3–4) Stealing done even out of hunger should be compensated by “seven times” (Proverbs 6:30–31; Mark 4:24; Luke 19:11–27)\n\n15) God is called “Father and Mother” (Deuteronomy 32:18; *Bhagavat Gita* 9:17)  \n21) Woman is described as synonym of “fame, fortune, fine speech, memory, intelligence, steadfastness and patience.” (Bhagavat Gita 10:34)# Wisdom is personified as woman in Proverbs 3:13-18; 4:5–9, 7:4–5 and 9:1–6 and wife’s role in the family is said to be of management and counselor to husband and children (Proverbs 31:10-31)\n\n**#Footnote**\\------------------------------------------------------\n\nBhagavat Gita is the summary of all earlier Scriptures, hence it would only reinforce what they said about women. For example, Vedas had said: “The entire world of noble people bows to the glory of the glorious woman so that she enlightens us with knowledge and foresight. **She is the leader of society** and provides knowledge to everyone. She is symbol of prosperity and daughter of brilliance. May we respect her so that she **destroys the tendencies of evil** and hatred from the society.” (*Rig Veda* 1.48.8)\n\nAnother such concept found in the Bible is found in such earlier writings of which Bhagavat Gita is the summary. For example, Knowledge, Love, Power-Justice are shown to be the Core qualities of God which are symbolised by four creatures seen around the throne of God—Eagle, human, bull, lion. (Revelation 4:7) This concept is found in earlier writings, they are *Satyam, Shivam, Sundaram* which are knowledge/Truth, love/Benevolence, Beauty \\[result of doing anything with power and doing justice to all aspects and elements\\]. “Siva indeed is the expression of Ananda, Bliss for whom a devotional outpouring has been made in the Svetasvatara Upanishad in His aspect as Ananda (*satyam, sivam, sundaram*) (for details, google cesgoa .org)\n\nThose who \"ruin\" or pollute this earth will be punished (Revelation 11:18), and its principle is found in earlier writings: Treat “a Tree as equal to Ten Sons.” (*Matsya Purana* 154.505 to 154.512)\n\nTree is symbol of taking wastes from nature and giving too valuable things to us in return \\[which is the essence of all Scriptures--\"Take minimum, Give maximum,\" symbolized by 1000s hands of goddesses\\]. No wonder ancient Indians had temple surrounded by trees/forest. And word for forest is *kavu* in some Indian languages, in Malayalam kavu means “Sacred grove”—thus *kovil* became the word for temple in Tamil, language of neighboring State. This was borrowed by the ancient Jews whose word for temple is also הקהל haq-qāhāl \\[phonetics: *kaw-hawl*\\] (Hebrew Lexical Dictionary). This is because first temple in Israel was built by King Solomon who had trade links with ancient India and many building materials came also from India (*History of the Jews in India*, wikipedia) thus was deeply influenced by India’s Theology (See, Wisdom of Solomon 8:20) India is mentioned in the Jewish Scriptures (Esther 1:1 and 8:9)\n\nEven more vital words such as אֵם (em) is *amma* (mother) and Ἀββᾶ (Abba) is *appa* (father) in Tamil. (Google: Tamil words in Hebrew for more). It could be even deeper than anyone could even imagine: Abram (later changed into Abraham) is the forefather of Jews. Abram and Brahma have phonetic resemblance, and also have same meaning--Father of multitudes. So is the case with their wives--Sara (means noble woman) and Saraswati (Sara = essence + vati = female). Jews, Muslims and Christians say they are descendants of Abraham.\n\n**EDIT**  \nAll documentary evidences from eminent people like First Century Jewish Historian Josephus, Philosopher Aristotle etc, archaeological evidences, Research Papers ... are all given as replies to various comments hereunder, to keep the OP short.",

      "text": "As a vegetarian, I'm often confronted with the argument that 'those who eat meat are not Hindu.' However, after exploring various Hindu scriptures, I realized that this claim oversimplifies the complexity of Hinduism. Different texts and traditions offer varying perspectives on animal sacrifice and meat consumption.\n\nFor instance, the Bhagavad Gita and Guru Granth Sahib condemn animal sacrifices, while other texts like the Brahmasutra and Manusmriti seem to permit them under certain circumstances. This diversity of opinions highlights that Hinduism is not limited to a single book or interpretation.\n\nIt's essential to consider the cultural and regional contexts that shape Hindu practices. Rather than relying on a single text, we should engage with the rich diversity of Hindu scriptures and traditions.\n\nPersonally, I've been a vegetarian since childhood due to family habits. However, I believe it's crucial to challenge blanket statements like 'meat-eaters aren't Hindus.' I'd love to hear your thoughts on this matter. You can explore the references I mentioned online for further insight.",

      "title": "The Dilution of Sanatana Dharam and Buddhism has made our religion a joke for our own Hindu people",
      "text": "I refuse to consider Gautam Buddha as 9th Avatar of Lord Vishnu and even many Buddhist refuse to accept Gautam Buddha being an Avatar of Vishnu or having any relation to Hinduism.\n\nThe Buddha mentioned in our Religious Texts and Gautam Buddha are apparently different because not only are their stories not matching with each other but there are many other problematic things\n\nSo I will first start with Saugatha Buddha(as per Bhagvad Puran) -> Born in Bodh Gaya , Bihar about 5000 Years Ago and name of their Mother will be Anjana\n\nNow let's look at Gautam Buddha -> \nBorn in Lumbini Province of Nepal about 2500 Years Ago and name of their Mother was Maya \n\nEven we go on to see Gautam Buddha did not believed in Veds Granths and concept of God itself which will make one wonder how is it Avatar of Vishnu then? \n\nWe are aware about stories of all 8 Avatars of Vishnu and Ramayana Mahabharata in great detail but then it makes me wonder about did we lost track of Saugata Buddha and what was their story?? Though in Purans a few more things are mentioned about Saugata Buddha (9th Avatar of Vishnu) -> The objective of this Avatar of Vishnu was to protect knowledge of Vedas from Asurs because they were trying to manipulate Vedas however the condition this time for Vishnu was to make it happen without any violence so he misguided Asurs and led them away from Vedas this way they are able to protect Vedic Knowledge.\n\nBut if we see the Timeline of events\nRamayana -> Treta Yuga 7000 to 8000 Years\nMahabharata -> Dwapar Yuga 5000 Years Ago\n\nBuddha and Kalki are supposed to be Avatars in Kaliyuga so the avatar of Buddha happening immediately after Mahabharata end also seems a bit odd maybe 3000-4000 years ago would be still understandable enough \n\nAnd when I think about it if the objective of Buddha was to mislead Asuras from Vedic Knowledge without using any Violence basically he had to brainwash them so it is possible that the teachings of Gautama Buddha which we know were actually to mislead Demonds but in that case why are many normal people like us following it?\n\nEven in our Textbooks what we are studying are not Hinduism Teachings but Buddhist Teachings like Non-Violence , Unity in Diversity and being Vegetarian is right thing to do.\n\nWe are not at all taught about Dharma/Kartavaya in our Education which has led to our Nation turning submissive in past many centuries.\n\nIf we look in our History everyone in childhood itself was educated about Dharma there was no Hindu King (atleast before Buddhism as Religion emerged) who would be talking about non-violence everyone did Shastra Puja and I respect many brahmin priests who are vegetarian as well as anyone else having such personal beliefs but vegetarianism must not be imposed upon others 90% people in Deccan Plateau are Non-Vegetarians.\n\nIn many parts of South India as well as West Bengal goat or chicken is offered as sacrifice to their God or Goddess(in most cases it is a Roop of either Shiva or Parvati) and Swami Vivekanand were also Non-Vegetarian.\n\nOne must fight for what is righteous and must protect their religion and knowledge as well this is something Hindus are getting detached from we are made to believe that all religions Hinduism , Islam , Christianity etc. are meant to promote Humanity this all kind of dilution and mixing has reduced Hinduism to a Joke in 21st Century and the ones who are Hindu they are also walking on the path of Atheism and you cannot blame them. Only Hindus have got this worm inside them of considering gods of all faith as equal.\n\nWhile Buddhism might seem a progressive religion and it has also expanded well in Asia but it is clearly lacking elements and when the founder of the belief itself has doubts on God the people who are following such belief are bound to go and do the same.\n\nConclusion: While there are doubts upon Gautam Buddha being 9th Avatar of Vishnu or not and if he is not then what was story of actual Buddha who was mentioned in our Texts?(Might be Greatest Mystery of Millenium in that Case) We can agree on one thing that the last Avatar of Vishnu had tried to manipulate Asurs from following or believing in Vedas Purans Granths so you can distance yourself from those things if you are also a demonic person but if you are not then what is preventing you from applying sanatan principles in real life? People who believe in Dharma and fight for it along with doing Karma are the ones who will see themselves through Kali Yuga\n\nThere is no need for us to follow anything else that has been tried to feed into our Minds.",

      "text": "Lately, I have witnessed an increase in Science vs Religion posts. Certain subreddits have been created just to speak negatively about religion, grouping every religion under the same umbrella. I believe this shows utmost disregard for the thousands-of-years-old philosophies of Hinduism and other religions. I have hardly seen any sane believer unnecessarily fighting with these people.\n\nWhy can't empirical science and religion (or spirituality) coexist? Science is not the final answer to everything yet—it's ever-evolving. What we know as an \"accepted theory\" today might get proven wrong a few decades later. For example, take the atomic theory: there were many models proposed by various scientists over a long period. Each time a new model was proposed, the earlier one was discarded. This is the nature of science—it evolves with time.\n\nLately, there have been certain developments in quantum physics, and many of those concepts can actually be found in Hindu philosophies. I'm not saying science is useless—far from it. It's of utmost importance in today's world. Let's be real: I wouldn't be writing this post if not for science. But the scope of science is still too limited for it to dismiss everything else.\n\nI believe people who outright reject other points of view actually lack scientific temperament. True science asks for an open mind, not a closed one.\n\nThanks for reading. Please let me know what you think.",

      "text": "Hello. I'm writing a fictional series about genetic age regression; that is people who are made young again by way of DNA/cellular reparation therapy. One character I'm considering adding is a Sadhu character who believes deeply in Brahmanism, and is hopeful this process will aid him in the quest to find Brahman (essentially getting to live two lives in the space of one). As an American writer, not a Hindu, I'm curious if there are any opinions on whether such a man would not partake in this science, on spiritual/cultural grounds?",

But ,it upsets me so much so say this that Ive only felt distant. \n\nPlease help me out.\n\nMy family is not religious but I believe religion is a personal matter. Family has a role but at the end ,it depends on the individual. And I want to get closer to God ,learn more about Him. \n\nI am an ST but I didn't know I was a dalit until class 10 or something. I first heard about the caste system in my social book in school and I remember feeling bad for the dalits(i turned out to be one lol)\n\nThe caste system is what keeps bothering me. I know many are against it but I feel insignificant and dirty because I belong to the lower caste. I dont want to feel this way nor do i want people to not like me just because I belong to some other ( idk what's the term).\n\nI am lucky that the people around me has always been kind. I have heard of the hate against us but personally I have never faced it. But I cant help but think about this too often than not. \n\nIm sorry if my post is all over the place. I cant put my thoughts well into words. \n\nI have scrolled through this sub many times but I have only got more confused. I dont understand understand the terms that you use nor have I ever heard about them .\n\nGod,I am a mess rn. \n\n\"Spiritually lost\" I have heard this term many times but i had never felt it until now. My Christians and muslims seem to know so much about their religion and then theres me. \n\nI dont know why im posting this. I only want to vent(?) about my frustrations regarding my inability to feel closer to God.\n\nIdk where to begin or who to ask about this. Please help me if you can. \n\nThank you.",

Not only do I find that intreaging, but the absolute beauty behind the faith and each individual deity. I especially love how when you think you've learnt everything about Hinduism, there's still so much more to learn across multiple lifetimes. Another thing I'll say that's really appealing when it comes to the Sanātana Dharma, is the idea of punishment after death. Instead of an eternal punishment and damnation like Abrahamic traditions, you get given chances to reach Moksha across many reincarnated lifetimes, as well as being either punished with negative karma for your own negative choices in life, or blessed with positive karma.",

Tbh I never had proper friends and or any sort of relationship. But it was all fine, I used to believe so much in lord krishna. But it all changed once I came back from amarnath yatra.\n\nAfter I came back, my studies were going great, after I came back on 28th July 2023, I got severe ear infections and tinnitus, I wasn't able to study, I wasn't even able to sleep properly because of the constant tinnitus. My father thinks I am a fool and I was acting. He said me that I have gone crazy and refused to give me money or even go to the doctor. My mother took me to the doctor. \n\nThen on 14th November 2023, my friends made me take weed, I told them I don't like this stuff, they said me I am not masculine enough and stuff, so I just took one puff and I was extremely high. \n\nThey thought of me as a weirdo after that, cos I was speaking lame stuff and made a clown of myself when I was high. Because of this day, my tinnitus got worse. Even after this my neighborhood friends betrayed me badly, shamed my family of being poor, I being weak wasn't able to fight them with strength. \n\nI loved krishna from a very young age, I thought I was being tested, but no, I wasn't I am 22, and not a single good thing jas happened to me since I was 17. I still believe Hinduism is a beautiful religion, but do not believe in any of the gods. They never helped me.\n\nI have stopped going to temples, doing pooja, and even thinking of giving my holy books like gita to someone else. I wanted to just throw all of it or burn it, but i still hold a lot of respect of my religion. I need proofs and reasons to believe in krishna again.",

      "text": "There are few examples of this. \n\n# Siva Ganesha Lila\n\nWhy did Siva cut off the head of His own son? How could the master of the three worlds not recognize his own son?\n\nThe answer to this is found in Siva Purana. Lord Brahma explains to Devarshi Narada\n\n*Due to the difference of Kalpas, the story of the birth of Gaṇeśa is told in different ways. According to one account he is born of Maheswara. His head looked at by Śani was cut off and an elephant’s head was put on him.*\n\n*Now we narrate the story of the birth of Gaṇeśa in Śvetakalpa when his head was cut off by the merciful Śiva.*\n\n***No suspicion need be entertained, O sage. Śiva is certainly the cause of enjoyment and protection. He is the lord of all. Śiva is possessed as well as devoid of attributes.***\n\n***It is by His divine sport that the entire universe is created, sustained and annihilated. O excellent sage, listen to what is relevant to the context, with attention.***\n\n# Rama crying for Mata Sita\n\n  \nAfter Sita Apaharan takes place, Sri Rama cries to Lakshmana saying that this must be due to His bad Karma. This cannot be taken literally because Sri Rama is described as the Supreme Person in 100 crore scriptures (sata-koti-pravistaram) and the Supreme Person does not accrue Karma as explained in the scriptures. \n\nThis Leela is explained better by a story in Ramcharitmanas. Mata Sati is shocked to see Sri Rama, whom as Tulsidasji describes is \"Master, Servant, and Friend\" to Her husband Lord Siva,  crying for His wife the way an ordinary person would. Lord Siva tells Her not to doubt Sri Ramachandra. But She wants to find out the mystery and so She takes the form of Mata Sita and approaches Him while He cries. \n\nWhen Sri Rama sees Her, He immediately smiles and offers obeisances, asking Her why the Mother came without Her husband Lord Siva. She realizes that Sri Rama cannot be an ordinary person if He can see through the illusion of Jagat-Mata, and sees that He is Swayam Bhagavan. \n\n# Krishna crying for the illusion of Salva beheading His father Vasudeva\n\n  \nThere is an episode where Salva battles Krishna and conjures an illusion of dragging Vasudeva out and beheading him. Krishna immediately goes into grief mid-battle and wails out. \n\nOne might wonder how the Supreme Lord can be tricked by an illusion of an ordinary person in the first place. Moreover, how can Krishna exhibit grief like that when He is God?\n\nBhagavatam explains\n\n*\\[Śālva said:\\] Here is Your dear father, who begot You and for whose sake You are living in this world. I shall now kill him before Your very eyes. Save him if You can, weakling!*\n\n*After he had mocked the Lord in this way, the magician Śālva appeared to cut off Vasudeva's head with his sword. Taking the head with him, he entered the Saubha vehicle, which was hovering in the sky.*\n\n*By nature Lord Kṛṣṇa is full in knowledge, and He possesses unlimited powers of perception. Yet for a moment, out of great affection for His loved ones, He remained absorbed in the mood of an ordinary human being. He soon recalled, however, that this was all a demoniac illusion engineered by Maya Dānava and employed by Śālva.*\n\nSo we see that Sri Krishna plays the part of a human being who awakens to the realization that it was an illusion. How did He do this when He already knows it? This is Lila! He even perfectly plays the part of ignorance despite being all-knowledgeable. \n\nIt is a difficult concept to understand, no doubt. No conditioned soul can understand Lila of Bhagavan and we need to dedicate lifetimes even to get a glimpse of it. But to summarize, the stories are the play of the Gods, they are not actually lost in illusion.  \n\nJai Sita Rama",

These I think most of them are doing by self interest.\n\nAnd who marry into hindu family follow their customs and children born also continue.\n\nBut in general Is there really something as converting to Hinduism ? Are there any rituals or some organisations who are converting people into hinduism ?\n\nEven though hindus we have thousands of variations in following rituals, varying rituals and philosophies so how is this done.",

We both follow our faith, and have strong beliefs. \n\nOvertime, we've had quite a few conversations about our religions. Before there had been tension but now there's more acceptance that we both have our own separate beliefs and that in the future we will have to come to some sort of agreement. \n\nI believe in Krishna, I believe in him. I don't subscribe to a specific sect of hinduism, I'm just seeking knowledge and trying to be a decent person. I just want to be able to be so concrete set in my belief. I want more than just surface knowledge.\n\n Also his parents, especially his mother, I believe thinks I may convert in the future. We have had conversations before and she subtly tries to tell me I'm not really allowed to believe in something different when I'm at her house. So I can definitely see that being a big complication on the future. \n\nAre there any texts you suggest I read that compares Christianity and Hinduism, the history, philosophies, etc. \n\n\nNote: please don't tell me to break up with him. He really is a good person at heart, and I can see myself marrying him in the future. \n\n\nThank you!",

So i like the philosophy and learning from hindu videos or gurus mystics, isha sadhguru some like him. Anyways. So what is the caste system about?  Is it gods system? Or the elites trying to control?

While I am from America, I have been looking some things up on Google about Hinduism, and it seems to have a lot of truth to it. \n\nBy truth, I mean, the way it speaks about astral projection, reincarnation, and mediums. (Correct me if I'm wrong, I'm pretty ignorant on the religion)\n\nThere's so many stories out there, of children and adults recalling past lives, and I know two people personally, who have astral projected.\n\nBut it seems as though, when someone has an NDE, if there's any religious figures, it's always the Christian deities, and hardly ever do you hear about Hindu NDES.\n\nNow don't get me wrong, Jesus doesn't scare me, but Christianity does, especially with the threat of eternal Hell. That's why I get uneasy sometimes, when the majority of visions and NDES contain things from Christianity, even when one didn't really subscribe to that religion in the first place. Some have seen the Christian hell as well.\n\nSo, has anyone on here had an NDE, or maybe a personal experience with a Hindu deity?",

      "text": "It’s nice to see that many famous spiritual teachers follow some practices from Sanatan Dharma. But it really hurts when they avoid saying words like \"Hindu,\" \"Hinduism,\" or \"Sanatan.\" Recently, I watched a popular guru say he didn’t even know what the Hanuman Chalisa was. He said he had \"heard of it\" but never read it. That shocked me. The Ramayana is one of our most important scriptures, and the Hanuman Chalisa is a basic prayer for millions of Hindus. How can someone be a guru and not know something so important?\n\nIt feels like some of these gurus are using parts of Hinduism like Yoga, Meditation, and Mudras to make a name for themselves. They take what’s popular but ignore the deep spiritual roots. Even worse, they put their own pictures and statues everywhere, but don’t talk about Bhagwan (God) at all. That’s not real spirituality that’s just self-promotion.\n\nA real guru should respect and acknowledge where their knowledge comes from. Sanatan Dharma isn’t just about peace or fitness it’s a complete way of life, full of devotion, wisdom, and connection to God. If a teacher hides that truth, how can they really guide anyone?\n\nTrue wisdom doesn’t need to distance itself from its roots. If Yoga and Vedanta are valuable, it’s because Hinduism preserved them for thousands of years. A guru who denies this is like a river denying its own source.",

I’m an nri so it might just be cuz Indians/hindus around me are westernized but to elaborate I feel like Hindus just follow because their parents do. I went back to India a bit ago and noticed people pray and stuff but they don’t listen to texts such as the Bhagavad Gita or listen to some of the lessons this great religion teaches. I feel like it’s like this for a lot of religions. However what I notice about ours is that nobody really knows our religion outside of Hindus who read Gita, pray, and other scriptures. Everyone I’ve met,even in India know Christians worship Jesus and some of the basic rules of Christianity, Islam, Buddhism etc. however 90 percent of ppl in the west think Hinduism at 300,000,000 gods and every time I have to explain there’s only 1. Basically to summarize, I feel like most Hindus are only “Hindu” cuz of tradition and don’t know about our religion, I see some people around me making fun of those white girls who are Hindu, but I feel we shouldn’t make fun of them. Some of them are more Hindu than Hindu Indians and nepalis. I put this as a question cuz I wanna see ur thoughts.",

I was fed up and said \" What kind of God needs fear over his devotees to control them, isn't it unfair according you\" He stopped, then said \" Even if someone is good will you let me enter your home if you don't know them ? , same way Jesus won't let you enter his home \" and then I stopped as well ! Later when he started again \" hindus can worship Jesus as well right?\" I said yes krishna said : No matter whom you worship ultimately it comes to me \n\nI want to ask you guys what should be my answer to the part \" heaven is Jesus home and he doesn't let's your enter if you don't follow him same way me don't let strangers enter in our house\"\n\nThanks all\nHare Krishna",

      "text": "When Bhagwan Ram was exiled to the forest, the people of Ayodhya, overcome with love and devotion, followed him. Moved by their loyalty, Ram turned to them and gently asked all the men and the women to return home, reminding them of their duties and responsibilities. The men and women obeyed his command and reluctantly left. However, among those who had come to bid him farewell, one group remained behind - a group that did not identify as male or female - the hijras i.e. transgenders.\n\nSeeing their unwavering devotion, Lord Ram did not ask them to leave. Instead, he acknowledged their faithfulness and, upon his victorious return to Ayodhya years later, blessed them with a unique place in society. This act was more than just a reward for their loyalty - it was an affirmation of their existence, dignity, and spiritual significance in Hindu culture.\n\nThis story from the Ramayana is not just an episode from mythology; it is a reflection of Hinduism’s deeply ingrained ethos of acceptance. At a time when many civilizations shunned those who did not fit into rigid societal norms, Hinduism recognized and respected them. Even today, kinnars have a revered place in Hindu traditions, often called upon to bless weddings and childbirth.\n\nToday, as the world grapples with increasing intolerance and division, Hinduism continues to remain a guiding light, showing that true greatness lies in acceptance, love, and harmony. \n\nHinduism offers an important, timeless lesson: humanity is about inclusion, not exclusion. \n\n*Note: Having read the Valmiki Ramayana, I am fully aware that this is not mentioned in that version. It is likely from a later version. I am sharing this since I think the moral lesson is great.*\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/aykq0ugkp2fe1.jpg?width=780&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=084ef308a6d38e709af4dff6a3dad1880ada6b36",

      "text": "To preface I was working on a fantasy novel based on Hinduism and I wanted to explore the idea of morality and the idea of Dharma itself.\n\nIn my novel, I was working on the character of an aged King who rules a brutalist society. His people have their own set of religious laws and their own sense of justice. They believe in war, conquering, mutilation, pillaging, rational cannibalism and slavery. In their holy books, whatever we consider adharmic, they consider to be virtues.\n\nI was thinking of Lord Rama's dilemma in Uttara Kanda, in which society disagrees with Rama and forces him to send Sita away. Rama justifies this by saying he honoured his Rajya Dharma over his personal dharma. Basically choosing the collective over the individual.\n\nSo in my character's place, he is stuck, he cannot strike down barbaric acts as that would lead to civil war and he will be defeated 10:1 in ratio. These people in this society value their barbaric traditions and old laws above everything else. No matter who tries to \"teach them the proper path\" they wholeheartedly reject it. \n\nWhat should he do? How would Lord Rama handle this situation if he were in my character's place?\n\nAnd how would you compare Hindu Dharma to another religion?",

Then universal conciousness dissociates into individual conciousness.\nWhat we take as matter is actually mental.\n\nIdealist science ( scientists - Nikola Tesla)\nThat there is a collective conciousness and our brains tune into different frequencies of this conciousness to produced illusion of different individuals.\n\nAs per idealist perspective, the fundamental substance is taken as conciousness and matter is a emergent out of conciousness.\n\nI think idealism should become more main stream. \nWe had given realist science a free rein. \n\nFor more information on scientific idealism check out bernado kastrup videos on YouTube he explains it better. \n\nOur advaita philosophy is also idealistic.",

      "text": "I am 17 now, and was born to a really religious hindu family. But I was always the kid that questioned everything in my mind. And over the years, this has led me to be an atheist or maybe agnostic.\n\nHowever, I am open to changing my mind and learning more.\n\n\nHere are few questions/arguments that I have against religion/god.\n\n1. If an eternal, all powerful, all kind god exists, why would he want us insignificant humans to pray and praise him? Why would he care about that in the first place.\n\n\n2. Why doesn't God just fixes everything bad about the world. Stuff like wars, global warming etc. how can it be justified?\n\nIf the answer to the above question is to protect our freewill, then doesn't God , in many cases, doesnt help us even when our free will is gone? If for example a girl is getting raped/assaulted by a gang, then at that point there's nothing she can do. Her free will is gone. Why doesn't God kill those those rapists and prevent these crimes?\n\n\n3. If God loves everyone, then whose conflicting desires does he fulfill? Humans always have desires that are conflicting, and in many cases, against each other's desires.\n\n\n4. If an eternal, all powerful God exists, why would he use the most inefficient mode of communication - books, to communicate with humans. What about the millions of people who cant read? Why doesnt he simply give more direct, easier mode of communication/teaching?\n\n\n5. Why does each and every religion have varying set of rules? Even what 'God' is in every religion is different. It feels like religion is not this God created way, but a way made my humans for their own needs.\n\n\n6. Doesnt karma just create an infinite loop of bad deeds? If i do a bad deed, and somebody does something bad to me as a result of me doing bad, then doesnt the other person do a bad karma, and then would get punished, and the cycle will repeat?\n\n\n\nI do not mean to speak badly of Hinduism. I am posting here, seeking to learn more, to question my beliefs.\nThank you.",

But things around me in Bangladesh are little messy right now. So it's a necessity to know about my Religion from the core. A lot of people around me are converting to Islam which I don't like. I have a lot of Muslim friends. And I can say confidently that, in their mind they want me to convert. So, if we see practically, for my lack of knowledge it'll be easy to brain wash me for them as I don't know much about my Religion.\nThat's why I want to know everything about my Religion. But a lot of Religious books are there. For my lack of time, I won't be able to study all of them I guess. But I'll still try.\n So, please guide me in this journey of knowing my origin, my religion, which strengthens my beliefs.\nAnd , if you have any story to tell which strengthens my beliefs, please tell me.\nJay Sri Krishna",

So, I came across paganism, and how people are worshiping their old gods(nature and elements) in Europe, I went down the rabbit holes of proto Indo-European culture, pagan mythology, how they were oppressed by Abrahamic relegions, but then I came across the Vedic deities who were very similar to different pagan gods( Indra = Zeus= wotan=thor). The main reasons people go back to paganism is the organized religion's oppression but also nature worship, and for me it just made more sense to worship the nature and elements that enables me to live, rather than Pouring milk over a rock or worshiping a guy who killed a bad guy for his wife,or his super monkey friend (but he is very cool tho)\nOr krishna(don't even wanna talk about him)\nAll These gods and epics just seem over-the-top and exaggerated fairy tales used to control the masses like the bible and quean(to me),these modern gods and story seem to oppress the Vedic mythology,just like how Christians destroyed pagan mythology,so I choose to worship the Vedic gods only and rejected hinduism\nApart from reading the rigveda what else can I do to worship the vedic gods only?",

I study World Religions and am currently working on my Internal Assessment (IA), or term paper which looks at different interpretations of the objectivity and function of karma. For my IA, I am collecting a small sample of followers from all backgrounds to ask a short set of questions to, to gain a better understanding of interpretations of karma.\n\nIf you are interested in brief correspondence through either direct message or (preferably) Zoom, please reply to this post with some brief background about your standing within and history with your religion. From there, we can get in touch to schedule a short interview within the coming weeks. \n\n  \nThank you for reading and I hope you consider helping me feed my curiosity and write a great paper!",

From thousands of scriptures , to now being able to enhance visualization, mindfulness and personalized solution and base on each stage of one's path\n\n1.Nearly all scriptures, their commentaries from various sages/schools of thoughts ,explanations and many other references are freely available\n\n2.Lots of perspectives,schools of thoughts and philosophy can be easily explored, summarized and evaluated effieciently.\n\n3.In-depth and step by step meditation and other techniques from various cultures,traditions and personal discoveries\n\n**Now these are the breathtaking ones that are recently possible in easiest way:**\n\n1.Ability to create one's own school of thoughts:\n\nUtilizing AI in order to input our fundamental thoughts, and creation of its application,expansion as well as revision on every aspect of life using various scriptures from upanishads,puranas or other texts as base. Just like many texts originated taking aspects of vedas as base, we can create many aspects using scriptures as base. For example, i explored about river and philosophy and meditation of river to explain each part of life and universe.Creation of sanskrit mantras, knowledge about aspect of reality and practical worship/meditation can be generated using references from thousands of other sages's knowledge\n\n2.Ability to create images and videos of ishvara for bhakti:\n\nTo be able to input any quality,attribute and create a diety residing on cosmos or river or hill or any way one wishes is revolutionizing as it assists in personalizing the meditation and visualization. If you wish to worship krishna as friend, a father or even a teacher, you can make it . If you want to worship durga mata as a child , you can create image and worship. If you want to create an image of shiva on cosmic background , dancing with destruction, you can create it as well and worship that form. \n\n3.Ability to create own songs:\n\nCurrently, we can even create songs to invoke awareness or devotion , that is beautiful and can exactly replicate one's current stage . I tried creating isha upanishad song  and another sanskrit song, and i can feel bliss and progress in bhakti more deeply than if i simply contemplated lines, since bhajans and kirtan can be created for one's favourite diety and scriputure. Any way , many many methods and paths are now available.\n\nIn short, \"Adhikari Bheda\", and \"ishvara\" ) can be explored, and fundamentalized in a logical, and personalized  way easier than before due to these technologies.",

      "text": "Interfaith relationship - Hindu and Muslim\n\nI’m Hindu (24, F) and my boyfriend of 4 years is 26. I am pretty religious and my boyfriend although he comes from a very strict and religious Muslim family, he considers himself atheist/agnostic. Since he was a teen he’s never associated with being Muslim and pretty much has left the religion. He respects me and my beliefs and is open to the idea that there is a God but religion is not right. His family know and are super against our relationship but he has fought constantly against them. I only told my Mum (who I’m super close to) a few days ago as I feared her reaction. She was surprisingly calm but told me I 100% have to end this relationship before it goes on longer. Her main concern is that at some point regardless of what he says, he will become religious and life will change once we get married and kids come around. I have always wanted my kids to be raised Hindu, and he has accepted this. However, I’m worried that although he may be ok with this now, in the future the compatibility will fade. I fear culture and religion will play more of a role and I will sacrifice a lot. I also fear going against our families will only breed resentment as life goes on. I don’t know what to do - he’s an amazing guy who I have a great life with, but I don’t want to set myself up for divorce or conflict in the future. Would love some advice please.",

      "text": "Ok so I am a 14 year old Hindu girl. Today some of my Muslim friends asked me to tell them Ramayana in detail because they had a chapter and a test on it. Soo I start telling them little information and realized that I basically knew nothing. All I knew was Ram Ji saved Sita Ji from Ravana and a little about how they built Ram Setu. There are many other kids on our school that don't know anything about it. So a genuine question.... Why aren't we learning about them in school instead of Mughals and all because isn't that our history. Isn't it time to start teaching these things at school because if you ask a Muslim kid anything about their religion they know EVERYTHING and they are also being taught in schools. So what about us? \n\n\n\nEDIT:: \nOkay so clearly bohot logo ne mere post ka point miss kar diya aur kuch toh itne defensive ho gaye jaise maine unki poori history delete karne ka notice bhej diya ho. Pehle toh relax kar lo, main bas ek honest observation share kar rahi thi.\n\nMera kehna simple tha — kyun nahi humein schools mein Ramayan, Mahabharat aur apni dharohar ke baare mein detail mein padhaya jaata, just like how other communities manage to stay connected to their roots? Main kisi ki history ko hate nahi kar rahi, bas apni ko miss kar rahi hoon. Ye point samajhna mushkil kyun ho gaya?\n\nAb kuch log keh rahe hain ki ye ghar pe seekhna chahiye. Sure, par school ka bhi role hota hai holistic education dene mein. Jab Harappan Civilization, Mughal Empire, aur French Revolution school curriculum mein ho sakte hain, toh kya apne thousands of years old civilizational knowledge ko ignore karna justified hai? Sanatan Dharma koi sirf \"religion\" nahi, it's a cultural, philosophical and historical system. Aur agar secularism ka matlab sirf Hindu dharohar ko ignore karna hai, toh fir wo biased secularism hai, not true equality.\n\nAur bhaiya, jin logon ne bola ki \"ye sab ghar pe seekhna chahiye\", toh batao na kitne Hindu households actually apne bachchon ko systematically Ramayan-Mahabharat padhate hain? Sabko pata hai ki modern parents ke paas time hi nahi hota, aur naye generation ka interest phones mein hota hai. Toh school hi ek platform hai jahan structured knowledge diya jaa sakta hai. Ye responsibility sirf parents pe daalna unrealistic hai.\n\nPhir kuch log bol rahe the ki “Muslim kids bhi sab nahi jaante”. Arre bhai, point unka knowledge ka nahi tha, point tha ki unko institutional support milta hai — madrasas, weekend Islamic classes, etc. Humein bhi wahi system chahiye — Chinmaya Mission jaise centers mass level pe accessible aur affordable nahi hai. Schools ek platform hai jahan har baccha aa sakta hai.\n\nAur Mughal history ki baat — haan bhai, padhna chahiye. Aur main toh ye bhi bolti hoon ki unke ache aur bure dono aspects padhne chahiye. But ye kehna ki Ramayan-Mahabharat \"unfair\" ho jaayenge dusre religions ke liye toh matlab hum apni hi mitti se jude hone ke liye permission maangein kya? Kab tak hum apne hi itihas ko \"controversial\" bol ke ignore karenge? Germany apna dark past padhata hai lekin apna Beethoven aur Goethe bhi nahi bhoolta. Hum sirf invasions padhte hain, civilization nahi.\n\nAur jo bol rahe the ki “You have access to Reddit but don’t know Ramayan, that’s your fault” — bro, Reddit pe hone ka matlab yeh nahi ki mere andar saare Ved download ho gaye honge. I’m 14, not a time-traveling rishi. 😂 Jitna galti meri hai, utna hi system ka bhi hai jo mujhe ye sab school mein systematically nahi padhata.\n\nKuch logon ne bola ki ye sab regional variations ke wajah se confuse karega. Arre bhai, toh kya hum Mahabharat aur Ramayan ke core teachings bhi ignore karein? Har subject mein versions hote hain — physics mein bhi theories evolve hoti rehti hain, iska matlab ye nahi hum usse padhna chhod dein.\n\nAur haan — jo keh rahe hain ki \"aajkal ke bacche khud seekh sakte hain\", bhai sahi hai, hum khud seekh lenge. Lekin agar system support kare toh zyada accha hoga na? Khud karne ka matlab ye nahi ki system ka kaam maaf kar dein.\n\nSo again, main sirf ye keh rahi thi ki Ramayan-Mahabharat jaisi cheezein humare curriculum mein honi chahiye, not as forced religion, but as cultural heritage. Unka essence, unki stories, unki teachings. Ek time tha jab ye sab oral tradition mein pass hoti thi, ab uska replacement sirf “watch a YouTube video” reh gaya hai. Kya ye sahi hai?\n\nLast thing — I’m not anti-any religion, not anti-Muslim, not anti-history. Main bas apne liye wahi chah rahi thi jo dusre communities ke bachcho ke paas already hai — exposure, knowledge and pride in their own roots. Bas itna hi.\n\nAap sabko lagta hai main immature hoon? Shayad hoon. Par ek cheez pakki hai — I care enough to ask these questions. Aur agar hum jaise bacche ye questions nahi poochhenge, toh fir kaun poochega?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdit (because apparently my existence has offended half of Reddit):\n\nI asked one genuine question — why aren’t we taught about our own scriptures like the Ramayana or Mahabharata in school — and somehow that was enough for a whole crowd of grown-ups to come at me like I committed a crime. I’m 14. I wasn’t attacking anyone’s religion. I wasn’t demanding anyone’s history be erased. I simply expressed disappointment that our curriculum barely touches our own ancient epics, while some of my friends (yes, I have Muslim friends and we respect each other’s beliefs) had opportunities to learn basics of their faith through Urdu lessons.\n\nAnd instead of understanding the context or discussing it like sane people, some of y’all really decided it’s your personal mission to educate me on how “it’s my fault,” how I should “google it,” or how I’m apparently “too lazy” to read the Ramayana — and even throwing bizarre takes about “fear-based religions,” “garbage vs gold,” and random World War comparisons. Seriously?\n\nWhy are you all so triggered by a teenager asking why her own history and culture aren’t taught enough in school?\n\nAlso, the irony of adults arguing with a 14-year-old girl online instead of actually encouraging her curiosity is just… sad. Instead of mocking me, gatekeeping, or throwing condescending one-liners, maybe think about why someone my age is even raising these concerns. Because we’re growing up with questions, and if the answer is always just “go Google it” — then what’s even the point of an education system?\n\nYou’re free to disagree — but don’t forget that respectful disagreement is different from being dismissive, patronizing, or weirdly aggressive toward a kid.\n\nSo yeah — I'm asking again, why are so many of you burning over one question? If my post really doesn’t deserve this much heat, maybe step back and ask yourself why you’re reacting like this.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEDIT::\nAt this point, it’s honestly hilarious how a simple, genuine question from a 14-year-old girl triggered an army of grown adults who can’t tolerate even the idea of someone wanting to learn about her own culture.\n\nLet me be very clear now:\nI am no longer replying to anyone under this post. Not because I don't have the capacity — but because I’ve realized you’re not here to exchange thoughts, you're here to win arguments. And that’s where I lose interest. 💤\n\nY’all are so desperate to be “right” that you’re debating a schoolgirl as if I’m the spokesperson for Sanatan Dharma. You twist facts, throw elitist English around, and shout “mythology ≠ history” like it’s the only line you’ve memorized from your overpriced coaching institute. Congratulations.\n\nYou ask for \"evidence\" for dharmic texts but never hold the same standards for half the things taught in modern history classes. Why? Because your problem isn’t with facts — it’s with the idea of Sanatan Dharma being taken seriously. That says more about you than it does about our scriptures.\n\nYou act as if I'm forcing religion down anyone’s throat when all I did was ask: Why are our own scriptures — Ramayana, Mahabharata, Gita — not included in the curriculum, even as literature? Not worship. Not preaching. Just basic cultural education. But no — even that is too much for your fragile echo chambers.\n\nYou mock kids for chanting Hanuman Chalisa, yet have no issue when kids are fed distorted history filled with glorified invaders. Hypocrisy is your real subject — maybe add that to the syllabus?\n\nAnd to all the “be grateful” crowd — thanks, but I’ll pass on your unsolicited advice. I’m grateful for my roots, my culture, and my curiosity. Not for being told to “stfu and study” by strangers online who clearly peaked in Reddit comment wars.\n\nThis is my final comment on this post. You're free to keep replying to the air now. 🙃\nTouch grass. Or better, touch a library that doesn’t only print NCERT textbooks.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEDIT:: So I deleted Reddit for a bit. Not because I was ashamed. Not because I felt defeated.\nI just needed a break from watching grown adults lose their collective sanity over a 14-year-old girl asking a genuine question.\n\nLet me update you.\n\nI’m the class president at my school. Every month, our school invites student suggestions for improvements. So instead of endlessly crying on Reddit threads like some of you do, I had a real conversation with my Principal.\n\nYes. I took this “immature, emotional, poorly-informed” idea straight to the top.\n\nI explained how it’s unfair that we never get to learn about our own civilizational epics in school — not religious indoctrination, but cultural studies, just like how other kids get structured support for their identities.\n\n\nGuess what?\n\nInstead of mocking me, the Principal listened.\n\nHe told me our school — a private institution that isn't Hindu, Muslim, or anything else (because let’s get real: schools don’t have a religion 😭) — would take it up seriously. He said, “Let me talk to the board.”\n\nAnd yesterday?\nThe school owner walked in.\nWith a Rishi.\n(No, not some cartoon-looking baba with a fake beard. A real scholar — probably someone with more knowledge in his pinky finger than your entire paragraph about “myth ≠ history.”)\n\nHe announced that starting next week, every Friday and Saturday, there will be optional sessions on Sanatan Dharma’s cultural, philosophical, and scriptural teachings.\nOptional.\n\nYou know what that means?\n\nFreedom of choice.\nExactly what the same crowd yelling “secularism!!” was pretending to defend.\n\nAnd apparently, something similar is already available to Muslim students, so this is not “exclusionary” or “Hindu nationalism” — it’s equal access. Fairness.\nExactly what I asked for in the beginning.\n\n\nTo every keyboard warrior who told me I should \"Google it\" instead of asking my school to teach it —\nDid Google ever teach you calculus, Shakespeare or Mughal history?\nNo? Then why tf are you okay with our heritage being reduced to a DIY YouTube playlist?\n\nTo the “it’ll be too confusing, regional versions exist” gang —\nBro, science has evolving theories, history has conflicting perspectives, and literature has 700 interpretations.\nBut you don’t cancel those subjects, do you?\nYou only cry confusion when the Ramayan enters the chat.\n\nTo those shouting “mythology ≠ history” —\nCool, then let’s also stop calling Akbar “Great,” remove hero-worshipping chapters on invaders, and teach every figure in history with the same standards of scrutiny.\nDon’t just bring logic when it’s time to gatekeep your own roots.\n\nTo those who said “this should be taught at home” —\nYeah, well, most parents today barely have time to teach their kids how to change a lightbulb, let alone recite verses from the Gita.\n\nAnd to the ones who said, “You’re just trying to push religion in school” —\nI literally proposed an optional cultural studies class, not a compulsory aarti session.\nIf that’s what makes you uncomfortable, maybe you’re not scared of “communalism.”\nMaybe you’re just allergic to anything Sanatan being taken seriously.\n\nYou clowned a kid for not knowing the Ramayan.\nThen clowned her again for wanting to learn it.\nAnd when she actually made change happen, you probably still think you’re right.\n\nMeanwhile, I got a whole curriculum change started.\nAnd all you got was 40 upvotes and a superiority complex.\n\nSo here's your takeaway, dear Reddit experts:\n\nWhile you're busy fighting about why things can’t happen,\nI’m out here proving that they can.\n\nI'm here to say:\n\n👉 I asked a question.\n👉 I got mocked.\n👉 I acted.\n👉 I got results.\n\nAnd no matter how hard you try to twist it — you lost this round.\n\nTouch shastra. Touch school reform. Touch reality.\n\nOr just touch grass again. 🌱 Your choice.\n\n— A 14-year-old who's doing more for dharmic education than most of your PhDs. 🙃",

      "text": "I should mention that I am not asking this in bad faith, I am agnostic atheist but I don't claim that science debunks religion or whatever, it doesn't, it can't, and it doesn't have to.\n\nBut there are particular instances where science and modern studies go against religion. What do you do then?\n\nLike evolution, the age of the universe, etc.. these clash with what dharmic texts say. Especially evolution, if humans turn into animals to serve their bad karma punishment, then why were there animals and suffering millions of years before humans existed? I suppose at best you could say that these carry over from the previous universe? but does that then mean that our karma and everything remains the same even after every-single-thing ends at the of the universe? Somehow minor things like bad deeds are so great that they survive the death of the universe?\n\nThere is just very little evidence in several cases, like the two epics. I read some books on Mahabharata and Ramayana, and I must admit, they ar every persuasive, I must admit that some sort of war(s) might have happened but there is no evidence of the divine parts. Which makes sense though, carts and armour and all that stuff can survive a war in remnants but divine parts like Krishna showing his divine form to Arjuna isn't preserved in the sand, archeology can't do much with this. But then that calls for a reasonable belief that the divine parts are more likely to have not happened, unless we first take religion to be correct 100% and then look at evidence, but that's just the texas shooter fallacy.\n\nSo how do the more open minded and scientific-minded of you reconcile faith with it? By the way I am not talking to people who take everything to be a metaphor and only look out for spirituality and lessons, you're all good, but I am talking about the complete- or near-fundamentalists.\n\nThanks!",

My mind often feels like a battlefield. I've tried so hard to stay afloat, to find meaning and strength in life, but the **constant pressure, trauma, and absence of peace** have taken a heavy toll on me.\n\nIn the past, **I used to feel connected to God** — especially during festivals like **Ganesh Chaturthi and Navratri**. I would pray with sincerity, hoping for divine support. But now, I feel **empty**. I try to sit in front of my altar, chant, or meditate — but I don’t feel anything. **No presence, no peace, no answers.**\n\nThis spiritual emptiness has led me to explore other faiths, including Christianity and the **idea of love in Christ**, just to find some comfort or divine connection. Yet deep down, I **still want to believe in the God I grew up with**. I want to believe in God — but my practical mind keeps questioning: *If God exists, why all this unending suffering? Why no sign of love, guidance, or relief after all these years?*\n\nBecause this loss of faith is not out of arrogance or rebellion — it’s out of exhaustion and pain. I still **want to believe**, but I feel shattered and disconnected.\nI'm almost su icidal now.\n\nIf anyone has gone through something similar — **how did you reconnect with your faith**?\nHow do you **feel God again**, when your heart is numb and your mind is tired?\n\nI would be grateful for any perspective, guidance, or just someone who understands.\n\nThank you 🙏🏼\n– A seeker who’s trying not to give up",

      "text": "Hello, I am very new to all of this, and to be honest I am very confused. So, I am very sorry if I word things wrong or if I am offensive in any way. Like I said, I am just so new to this. \n\nI will start by saying I was vaguely raised Christian/Jehovah's Witness. However, I never really believed in the Christian God. But another interest of mine has been mythology for a long time and ive always been interested in different cultures. There is a video game that I like that has a lot of religious figures in it, and I always like to research the different figures they put into it. \n\nA few months ago, a few Hindu missionaries (?) came to my college to hand out copies of the Bhagavad Gita. Many people at my school disrespected them and threw them away and dropped them on the ground. For some reason, I felt very inclined to pick up these books and take them to a safe place. \n\nWhen I learned what the Bhagavad Gita was, a part of me became very nervous to read it for some reason. \n\nNow, recently in this game I played, they have Krishna as a character and I felt uncomfortable about it. They depicted him in a way that didn't feel right at all, and the more I learned about the real Krishna, the more I was drawn to him. I learned about Laddu Gopal, and I also learned about Saraswati, and I have felt really connected to all of this. When I watch people on tiktok show their different Pujas(?), my body has a reaction like I am seeing something very sacred that I need to respect \n\nMy fear is, though, even though I feel really connected to all of this, that I somehow am just thinking this is all really cool and not that it resonates with me. Again, I don't mean to be disrespectful and please correct me if I am, but because my introduction to all of this really was not a good one, I'm worried that I might be in the wrong mindset for this.",

When I got what I wanted I did not care about missing out times with friends, not having fun, sleepless nights, slapping myself to study for hours or more. But I did all of this last year also but did not achieved what i wanted. I had the same faith in God then I don't know why he did not gave me what I wanted like he always does because of my hardwork. \n\nBecause of this now I don't feel like studying and want to enjoy my life. I feel like I am losing my past self who wanted every achievement and success. I think I am becoming someone who has accepted failure as her life. But I don't want to be like this.\n\nNow I don't get the motivation to do hardwork because I am like \"Jaise last year hardwork Kiya tha par Kuchh result nahi mila Vaise abhi bhi karungi aur nahi mila too kya karungi, isse achha maze hi Kar lu. Which keeps him a vicious cycling loop of guilt.\n\nBTW I have been the topper ever since class 5th upto second pre board of class 10th but in board exam I could not be the topper. This was the dream which I had for past one Years and spent my whole year chasing it. I did not go to any school fest, gave up on co curricular activities, gave up on smartphone, social media and my friends but still could not get it.\n\nI am presently preparing for a competitive exam and i want a good collage. Please help me what is wrong which me and how can I fix it.\n\nNOTE :- Vo \"make your parents feel proud\" Vala concept mat bataiyega, my father is really abusive (you can check my earlier posts of different sub) so ye to motivation factor nahi hai. Aur ye sochti hu ki pad ke hi is hellish jagah se nikal sakti hu to lagta hai pad ke to boards top karne ka bhi sochha tha nahi hua na. \n\nMORE IMPORTANT NOTE 🥲 MAI KRISHNA JI SE BAHUT PYAR KARTI THI (HU 🥺) PAR MAI TO AB APNA KARM NAHI KAR RAHI HU TO VO SHAYAD MUJHSE GUSSA HONGE AUR PATA NAHI KYO LAST YEAR UNHONE MERE SATH ITNA BURA KYO KIYA.

      "text": "It does seem that all humans are born with a natural inclination to believe in the spiritual or the supernatural. \n\nNow the very existence of this inclination does not prove that there is in fact some spiritual reality out there that we are missing. We may have developed this disposition to simply deal better with the world around us, the same way we have developed the idea that free will exists (even though all theoretical and experiential evidence suggests otherwise). We may just be stardust that took on the perversion of life floating without purpose, and for all we know, completely alone in the Universe. But then again, we may not be. \n\nThis \"then again, we may not be\" is a surprisingly new trend of thought though. For the longest time, all humans agreed that WE AREN'T. We aren't alone and we aren't without some cosmic purpose. The received wisdom for centuries has been that there is some great truth we have to uncover (well, some religions believe that they have already). It is fascinating our the underdeveloped, unenlightened brains of our ancestors chose to construct lies, huge intricate lies with thousands of years worth of lore, thousands of scriptures and stories passed down for thousands of years either written or unwritten, accompanied by detailed and complex rules and rituals, music, art, culture...its interesting that the silly, silly humans embarked FIRST on this grand multimillennial enterprise that was apparently entirely counterintuitive, for which humans had to push themselves to their very limits and reach heights of greatness that we would now regard impossible for their time. Humans first surrendered themselves to this global conspiracy, sacrificed their material lives and worldly pleasures for it, bled for it, died for it, killed for it...and have only now seem to accept the simple truth that this was all fiction. \n\nSo even if it all is fiction, it seems to be foundational to human existence. We cannot do without it. And I am not referring to God as that is conceptualized differently in different religions. What I mean is the Ultimate Truth. That provides us comfort of purpose (or lack thereof), which we hold very near and dear to ourselves. Our beliefs about which are sacrosanct. Everybody, including atheists and the agnostics have convictions about this Ultimate Truth which are for the most part, unshakable. A rationalist's insistence on empirical evidence and an astrology enthusiast's faith in the tellings of cards and omens and stars are the same thing.   Both are trying to make sense of the world around them. Does one come closer to their goal than the other? Depends on who you are asking. The astrology enthusiast definitely sees merit in their own ideas and actions. Any the judgment of any external observer will be obscured by their own biases. So it is not that everybody SHOULD DO whatever they want, whatever brings them peace and purpose. It is that everybody DOES. And everybody believes that they are more righteous than the other.",

My nani was a Krishan bhakt so my bedtime stories were always about lord Krishna. Because of this and my interest in Hindu mythology, my view on gods and goddesses was always more from a curious stand point. I've read quite a lot but still can't help but feel agnostic. I've struggled with my mental health quite a lot and I've tried almost everything from medicine to therapy and I'm grateful for the extent it's helped to but I've exhausted my resources. Faith seems to be the only answer, atleast that's what people tell me. I'm in a place in life where I feel stuck. And if I try to pray it feels wrong, as if when everything was going well, if I wasn't a believer then, then why would any god accept me right now when my life is in shambles and I need help? How do I get over my shame and doubt?",

Why am I here? It is only through an enlightened Guru that one can reach a state of God-realization. That’s why there are a lot of spiritual masters in the world.",

      "text": "Hello guys, so my family has been going through crisis since past 2.5 years. I then thought these things will pass without thinking much about them. I felt these are business related issues and my father would be able to handle them and I should focus on my studies and getting a job and securing the future. I did that, I felt main mera karam karunga and not think negatively about things. From past year I started going to temples in the city I was living in for my studies to ask Gods to help my father make right decisions and ensure that people he was hoping to get funds from, give him the funds. I did this for entire 2024. I was working hard for my studies and I got through and got into a great company as well. My mother kept her composure and tried to ensure that our household remained calm. She prayed everyday, my father prayed everyday and  I prayed everyday for something good to happen. My father has been a giver all his life, helped people from all walks of life and was greatly respected but his actions and things happening with him  in the past year has made me question a lot things. I believed in Karma and that good things happen to those who do good. He helped everyone but is now almost bankrupt. I  did not ask anything for my self and only for my father for the entire 2024 has not gotten what he wanted. This makes me feel that if there was a God then what is he doing. I cannot trust my faith now. I feel sad and disappointed. Now this is a feeling I am feeling for the first time in my life and I feel negatively about it. \nWhat can you guys suggest? I feel like going to a temple and asking the Pandit there about these feelings as well.",

This post is for them.\n\nA family member of mine has died unfairly, why did God not do anything to save him? Im going through financial problems, im praying to God for money everyday, hes still not answering my prayers. What do i do to make him hear my prayers?\n\nHow much selfishness is hidden in these words. You know that everyday thousands of people are going through unimaginable pain, they have lost so much. But still, only when that hardship strikes *you*, you feel bad and start to lose faith in God.\n\nPraying to God, will not achieve anything on its own. Praying to God for selfish desires, even to think that those prayers will be heard is foolish. Is God some bank, where you go, deposit a request or loan and get money? Does God owe anything to you? Why, in any scenario, should he be indebted to you and give you as you please. The real thing which God wants you to do, is get up, and do your work yourself. Take control. But, do not turn egoistic doing so. It is not 'Leave everything to God and trust him to take control'. Nor is it 'Take control over my own decisions and act completely as you please.' It is 'Take control, and trust God to guide you on the right decision'. Pray to God for the strength to take matters into your own hands.",

      "text": "Long story short I’m someone who keeps their actions clean and I consider myself a kind person and for me dharma means to pray from your heart and have faith in our gods that if your actions are clean by not hurting anyone and treating everyone as you would want to be treated god will help you and show you the way forward. But in the recent years I’ve been facing blow after blow; and for many years I’ve kept my full hearted faith that if I continue praying with faith god will take away the pain one day. But after a most recent event I’ve started questioning if god does really care. Especially after I’ve seen some really vile people who use others and betray them be absolutely fine in life and nothing ever happens to them. In fact these are the kind of people that carry these lessons forward and teach others in their family that it’s okay to betray people. I’ve started questioning how god enables these kind of lessons in the first place? Isn’t he supposed to be wise and just? \n\nI started getting into astrology to find some answers and to me it looks like what you do in this life doesn’t really matter. Your heard work/faith/kindness/keeping your head down and actions clean doesn’t matter because if you have bad things in your chart your life will be broken no matter how much hard work you’ve done and you will deal with bad stuff even if you are a good person in this life and similarly if your chart is good you will get good things in life even if you’re a horrible person who uses other people for gain.\n\nI’ve basically lost interest in even trying to fix my life now because I feel like it will be taken away anyway so what’s the point? Has anyone else faced this?",

If not, I fully respect if you do not wish to share that information. I've included the questions below, so if you want to simply reply to this post that is fine, but if you prefer to DM that is okay too.\n\nThe questions:\n\n1. Have you practiced Sanatana Dharma your whole life? Or did you convert (or even revert back)? If you have not practiced your whole life, when did you start actively practicing? If you're a revert, tell me what called you back to Sanatana Dharma?\n2. How would you best describe the cardinal values and the principle end (or end goal) of Sanatana Dharma?\n3. How would you best describe your own theological beliefs? Is there a particular tradition within Sanatana Dharma with which you have the most affinity? If relevant, do you have a particular deva or devi to whom you are devoted?\n4. What religious practice or practices, feast days or festivals, or teachings within Sanatana Dharma touches you in a way that says \"This is what it means for me \\[to be a Hindu\\]\"?\n5. How has your faith transformed over time? How have you evolved with your faith?\n6. How does your community live out its principles through everyday life and in efforts to make a positive difference in the broader community and/or the world?\n7. When it comes to community outreach, including with other faith communities (such as Catholics, for instance), what approach does your community take to make dialogue and build bridges? How about dialogue within the different traditions within Sanatana Dharma?\n8. How does your community respond and work with those who don't necessarily have a background in Sanatana Dharma, but are interested in living in the traditions of Sanatana Dharma?\n9. What are some of the most pressing concerns and challenges for your community, in the geographical region you live?\n\nEdit: I forgot to include one additional question, which I've added below.\n\n   10. What is something about Sanatana Dharma that you wished that others outside of your faith tradition knew about \\[Sanatana Dharma\\]?",

I want to believe, but I live by the principle that a man who doesn’t question isn’t truly scientific. My life hasn’t been easy—financial and health crises have clouded my judgment and belief in a higher power. \n\nPerhaps I’m too shallow to embrace faith fully, or maybe I seek proof that everything will turn out alright.

He was in a car accident and was determined to be having brain swelling and eventually based within 10 hours after the accident in the hospital. I previously was a strong believer in God more specifically I looked to lord murugan during my happiness and struggles in life. I prayed/fasted to Him in the hospital hoping that my brother would recover. My mom is the strongest faith holder in my family. She would be the one fasting for Pillaiyar, murugan, Durga, and Shivan. My mom PRAYS every morning, afternoon, night..pretty much all the time for the safety and good health of her children. And then this happens. We are a small close knit family, we didn't have an easy life not exactly.. we had our struggles but even if we fell down we would pull through. But we always relied on God to see us through the tough times, as if God was testing our faith in him idk. This time I completely trusted God would see us through this too, just like every other time. I made promises to him in prayers in the hospital hoping my brother would pull through alive even if it was with broken limbs or whatever (he didn't break any bones or even have a single scratch on him). But my brother passed anyway. I feel like God turned his back on us and left us on deaf ears. I feel like he has forsaken us. I'm having a hard time praying to God or trusting him especially Pillaiyar who was sitting around my brother's neck as a pendant, and Murugan who was sitting in my brothers' car on the dash. What kind of a God would let us go through such pain? what kind of God would do this to my mother? I feel so abandoned because I've always turned to God, but i don't think anyone is listening.",

      "text": "THINK about it: A Hindu practitioner dies and gets reincarnated in a Buddhist house. Now their new reality would be thinking Hinduism might be wrong.\n\nSame if some Buddhist dies and gets reincarnated into a Hindu or Jain house. Now they might think that Buddhism is a wrong/misguided path.\n\nJains don't eat meat but Buddhists do—does it mean that whatever sacrifices they made in last birth are now meaningless?\n\nTo what degree calling them meaningless is justified?\n\nEven if we say that somehow they might get some inspiration to change the faith they were born into and convert to some other faith, do we have a for-sure answer that the faith they choose to convert is the correct one?\n\nWhat justification do we have, and what basis do we have to judge other faiths as right or wrong?\n\nIf the answer is nothing, then what is stopping us from following the customs, practices, and rituals of other faiths as well?\n\nWhat is stopping a Jain from eating meat or a Buddhist from praying to Hindu gods?\n\nAnd why limit it to Indian faiths only why not include religions like Druze or Pythagoreanism, and Platonism?\n\nWhy not behave like their followers do?\n\nIf you say that we follow and respect their gods as well but don't behave like others do then it's just cherry-picking!!\n\nNO cherry-picking can unveil the truth to us !!",

Granted, I know from my faith to not put any gods before my God, but 2 things I need explained:\n\n  \n1. If the Holy Spirit and Brahmin are the same being, and therefore a part of God, then there shouldn't be and issue, correct??\n\n2. Everything I know about God has been limited to the Abrahamic faiths and where they came from. Yes, I have doubts about reincarnation, but God made everyone and would, therefore, give everyone a chance to go to heaven. Since God made people outside the area where the Abrahamic faiths were developed, there has to be something I'm missing here.\n\n  \nSide note, when it comes to portraying the Hindu gods, what are some do's and don'ts, because if my question's answer is \"yes\", then I want to make sure I understand fully what I should(n't) do when portraying them as to not offend God.",

All Indian. All looking at me like I'm a lost white boy looking for the naan on a buffet. No one has ever been rude. It's just clear that I'm very out of place in these places. \n\nWhat I most desire is the ability to go and sit in a consecrated space. To be with my beloved Mahadev. And to learn more about Him and the religion from whence He comes. \n\nI want to actively worship. To offer to help with abishekam. Or at least not look like a tourist whilst standing there watching the Priest do it. \n\nI've been told that unlike the Christian faith I grew up in, Hindu Priests don't generally \"teach, counsel, or guide\" those who come into the Temple. \n\nSo... Who does? And how do I find and connect with that person? \n\nThanks for your thoughts. 🙏🏼",

      "text": "I’m sorry I don’t know if this is the right place to post this… Hinduism is so beautiful and introspective and it means so much to me. But what pains me is seeing Hinduism reduced to a political weapon. Hindu nationalism strips away the humility, the questions, the beauty replacing it with exclusion and aggression. When Hindu identity is reduced to this I feel very disconnected to the faith because it goes against everything I value. I value love , empathy and compassion. What brought about these feelings was … I came across a documentary about the Rohingya and seeing some very unkind comments from Hindu nationalists makes me feel heartbroken especially because the Rohingya have been through so much and are so vulnerable. Hindu nationalists are pushing me away from my faith. We can talk about reformation and coexistence and pluralism… we don’t need to make unkind comments and lose our humanity.",

      "text": "Lately, I’ve been feeling something incredibly deep for Krishna.\n\nI’m Brazilian, raised in another faith, but there’s something about him that moves me in a way I can’t explain: the androgynous beauty, the sound of the flute, the teachings in the Bhagavad Gita about surrender and devotion. It feels like my spirit remembers him from another time.\n\nI’ve made drawings of him, written a few poems, and once offered my own meal to him before eating. Sometimes, certain symbolic moments or feelings come to me, like small signs or impressions that feel meaningful. Other times, I softly chant the Hare Krishna mantra before sleeping or when I’m anxious, and it calms me as if he truly hears.\n\nI’m also thinking about visiting the Hare Krishna center in São Paulo to feel closer and learn more.\n\nI do worry a bit about being disrespectful since I’m not from the culture and can’t follow every rule perfectly. But this feeling is sincere and peaceful, and I’d love to keep it alive.\n\nHas anyone here felt something like this? How can I keep this devotion real and respectful?\n\nThank you so much for reading.",

Maybe it's just because I'm from abroad or whatever but compared to bangladeshi hindus here they don't seem as religious as us. I was talking about my days at \"gita part\", its basically every Monday we would have a gita reading of a text and everyone would have a assigned text be asked to go home and annotate it and read it out. My indian friend asked me what that was and that she never heard of it and ngl me and my friend were shocked. We did this for 3-4 years and have always been told that indian hindus were doing it more vigorously. Most bangladeshi hindus here have a puja for pretty much everything on the hindu calender, not just durga puja or holi. And alot of us do ekadosi or do \"niramish\" days (where we only eat fruits and veg). There was a point in time I was vegetarian for 2 weeks because someone died. But my friends didn't even know what ekadosi is. I guess being from India where the majority of people are hindu anyways you don't keep your faith as close as a minority would. But idk if this is the case for most",

Yes, \"convert\" people into the fold of Vedic Dharma.\n\nMost people, especially younger generations feel proselytization/conversion is an extremely evil practice only done by the Abrahamic systems, hence they feel Hindus should not do it and even proudly say that Hinduism does not proselytize as an organisational/institutional tenet/practice.\n\nThis makes no sense though. How do you think Vedic Dharma in its many forms existed all over \"Akhanda\" Bharat, parts of Japan, south-east asia, saudi arabia, central-asia? And how do you think a Buddhist dominated India got \"re-converted\" into the Vedic fold?\n\nProselytization was done heavily by the Rishis and our ancestors, hence Vedic Dharma existed in the large Indian-subcontinent.\n\nIf we do not do Ghar-wapsi and do not preach outside India, then the existing Dharmic population will keep going down because the other religions treat conversion as their holy duty with specifically allotted funds, human resources, influencer eco-system spanning media, movies, academia, government institutions.\n\nIf the whole world could benefit from the knowledge and practice of Dharma, don't you want everyone to benefit from it? We are in the golden age where one can influence large masses of people just through  social-media.\n\nFor Christians, I do not think we have to preach them to leave Jesus Christ. Vivekananda preached heavily in the USA to christian audiences but always maintained that Jesus was an enlightened being, but the religion of \"Christianity\" organised by the Churches did not embody the vision of Jesus. Similarly for Islam, there are many enlightened Sufi saints with whom we can syncretise.\n\nIf we really care and believe that Sanatana Dharma is a force for good in the world then not spreading it and waiting for other religions with their radical Churches and radical sects to engulf Hindus into their fold, is a disastrous idea.",

Brahma, Vishnu and Shiva are manifestations of this, and everyone and everything which exists is a manifestation of this too. \n\nIt is absolute, formless, impersonal (beyond any concept of good or bad, since even evil is its manifestation) and devoid of qualities and any kind of definition.\n\nI had worshipped Vishnu, Shiva and a lot of deities, but nothing much seemed to happen. However, after I discovered Brahman, I researched more into it. As it turns out, worship of Brahman doesn't please it or anything - it is attained by self realisation, since we are That (Tat Tvam Asi). \n\nCombining this with the \"Wu Wei\" concept of the Chinese faith Taoism revealed a lot, since it helps align our actions with the flow of the universe, and everything is so amazing now, every second is filled with wonder and bliss 😭 All is Brahman, and everything now is cute and adorable to me, full of wonder. I can't see Brahman as a CEO kinda authoritative figure- it's just consciousness trying to experience itself, which is adorable 😭. \n\nI just wanted to share this here, hoping it inspires anyone who feels lost. You're all amazinggg, I hope you all realise your self as well. \n\nPeace ✌️❤️",

      "text": "I have been following SD for decades but only recently felt called to wear bindi and vibhuti. Honestly it makes me feel like myself and connects me with my faith. But I do feel nervous about upsetting other Hindus. I know that this is a very accepting tradition so I try to put my nerves aside and smile and greet other Hindus when I pass but I just get stared at and some look angry at me when they see my bindi. \n\nAnyway, apart from that I have been called to work with a deity outside of Hinduism - Hathor who comes from the Ancient Egyptian system. But now I feel that if I wear symbols of Hathor alongside the bindi etc it will be even more upsetting to other Hindus.\n\nI am not sure how to navigate this. My belief and faith tells me that it does not matter on a spiritual level as they are all forms of the one, but socially and culturally I want to respect other cultures and not step outside of my lane.\n\nWould love some feedback navigating this. Do any Hindus here actually pray to other deities too?\n\nThank you all for reading!",

I've been posting on here for a few months now. Love how most of the members answer kindly, also absolutely love how helpful the mods here are.\n\nSo, from what I've been answered, there is only spiritual experiences of God. I don't take that as evidence but sure, why would God need to present evidence tailored for me. That's fine.\n\nBut what about his deeds? Is there any evidence of Krishna lifting Govardhan? Is there any evidence of Ram (allegedly) living for eleven thousand years? Is there any evidence of Mahabharat happening as described in the epic (100 brothers vs 5 brothers, legendary weapons, etc...)?\n\nNow, I am not asking just for evidence that mildly points towards the stories being true because you can twist anything to fit the narrative, that's done with all of the religions.\n\nSo is there any 'extraordinary' evidence for the 'extraordinary' claims made in our scriptures?\n\nI've learnt a lot on this sub, which has actually made me pretty agnostic (from previously being absolutely atheistic), so I feel that asking a specific question like this might help a lot.\n\nThanks!",

      "text": "PLEASE READ THIS AND DON'T BE OFFENDED AND IF YOU'D LIKE TO ARGUE , ARGUE WITH UTMOST FACTS ONLY,\nSo in Bhagwat Geeta chapter 4 , verse 13 states(Translation •1)“According to the three modes of material nature and the work ascribed to them, the four divisions of human society were created by Me. And, although I am the creator of this system, you should know that I am yet the non-doer, being unchangeable”\n\n•(Translation 2)\nThe fourfold-caste has been created by Me according to the differentiation of GUNA an d KARMA; though I am the author thereof know Me as non-doer and immutable.\nOne thing About This is Casteism Is Based upon a person deeds(guna) and not based upon by birth rather it is a occupation based thing\n\nFor the welfare of humanity the supreme creator Brahma, gave birth to the Brahmins from his mouth, the Kshatriyas from his shoulders, the Vaishyas from his thighs and Shudras from his feet. (Manu’s code I-31,\nGod said the duty of a Shudra is to serve the upper varnas faithfully with devotion and without grumbling. (Manu 1-91) Manu is not satisfied with this. He wants this servile status of the Shudras to be expressed in the names and surnames of persons belonging to that community. Manu says:\nNow From The above understanding this deems caste as a hierarchy which isn't mentioned in the bhagwat geeta or any other textbook written by ved vyasa or Valmiki , \n\nShudra is unfit of receive education. The upper varnas should not impart education or give advice to a Shudra.It is not necessary that the Shudra should know the laws and codes and hence need not be taught. Violators will go to as amrita hell. (Manu IV-78 to 81)\n\nThis is also blatant discrimination which is not followed in Bhagwat Geeta and instead the bhagwat geeta follows principles of The Bhagavad Gita emphasizes equality in a spiritual sense, particularly regarding the perception of all living beings. Specifically, BG 5.18 states, \"A wise man sees all beings equally, seeing the same divine spark in everyone.\" \n\nAnd another thing is that Manu's not Mentioned in any puranas or bhagwat geeta or ramayana (Edit: I was confused about this part sorry I've understood he is mentioned)\n\nThe Manusmriti also Follows Child Marriage ,One shall give his daughter in the proper form, even though she may not have attained (the age), to a bridegroom who is of exceptionally distinguished appearance, and her equal, This Makes no sense as none of the books neither promote or have any mentions of following such I'll law\nSo MY THEORY IS MANUSMRITI IS A MAN MADE BOOK WHICH ISN'T PART OF THE SANATAN DHARMA BELIEF , please let me know your opinions\nDO YOU THINK IT IS OR NOT PART OF SANATAN DHARMA? \n\n\n•Edit:After a Huge Debate and Arguments with knowledgeable fellows of this community I've came to my conclusion that I may acknowledge Manusmrit's but I also do agree I may not wish to follow it , I may borrow some principles but I may deem some principles as situational based and human written not the words of the supreme , Manusmriti is a part of Hinduism but is very situational dependent.",

      "text": "I’ve been an atheist my whole life, until recently. Even now, I wouldn’t say I “believe” in God in a conventional sense, but I also don’t deny the presence of a higher cosmic order. To me, the concepts of creation, destruction, and everything in between were likely simplified into human forms by the learned sages of Satya and Treta Yuga so that ordinary people could better grasp them.\n\nBut this post isn’t about that.\n\nWhat truly baffles me is how much we have lost. Hinduism is vast, more than just a religion, it’s a way of understanding existence itself. Yet, according to our own scriptures, with each passing Yuga, 1/4th of the original knowledge disappears. By the time Kali Yuga ends, everything will be lost. And we are only 5,000 years into it, with 400,000 more to go. Look around, no one even knows what Moksha truly means anymore. The deep philosophies of Sanatan Dharma are either misunderstood, oversimplified, or weaponized for political agendas.\n\nThere is no real guidance left—most rely on traditions, politics, or online content instead of truly studying texts. Sanatan Dharma was meant to deepen our understanding of the self and cosmos, yet it’s now reduced to superficial beliefs. We were meant to live in harmony with nature, but we exploit it instead.\n\nSpirituality has turned into a business, with gurus selling enlightenment while ignoring true transformation. People cherry-pick scriptures to fit their agendas, distorting their meaning. Dharma was never about blind faith, yet that’s how it’s seen today. True seekers, who once dedicated lifetimes to wisdom, have been replaced by those chasing fame and power.\n\nKrishna warned about all of this. It’s happening right in front of us.\n\nI personally use our scriptures as psychological and philosophical guides rather than religious texts. But how do you all cope with knowing that true spirituality, true understanding, is almost non-existent in today's world?",

But I'm genuinely willing to understand/learn if someone explains it to me.\n\nEdit: Why is everyone so hellbent on saying it's not always scientific !! i mentioned spiritual reasoning would be helpful too",

Not a troll post, but i genuinely cannot wrap my head around the reason for spirituality in hinduism revolving so much around this thing.

Not the too ritualistic and superstitious path, but the path of spirituality. Many times my prayers have really been answered tbh. I believe in icchashakti, that if you want something with full wish, you get it.\n\nBut nowadays, my beliefs are shattering. I have been seeing many social media content, that make me go against the belief in spirituality - though a part of me still believes it. I take sanatan as a spiritual path, not a superstitious path. I feel the rituals are created for our mind to visualise and connect with the divine, if we cannot do so without them.\n\nI also believe that atheist-believer thing is western. Western religions view their god as all loving, all good, omnipotent single entity. And atheists debunk them by saying that \"If god is all good, why did he make evil\". But in eastern philosophy and sanatan, god is a spiritual force present in all of the universe. He as all qualities.\n\nSo, I want to know how can I be spiritual again. And have mental peace by connecting with god. I believe in science too, and do not deny the scientific concepts, as I believe the order and harmony of the universe is created by God..",

Clarify doubts as per scriptural references and personal understandings.\n4. Any scriptural understanding is allowed only if it is approved by bhagavad gita. Any scriptural understanding if it is against bhagavad gita teachings it is not encouraged for dealing. (Ex: Understanding Vedas is approved by Bagavad gita but not tamasic activities like animal sacrifices and other activities).\n5. Only to develop our sattvik nature gradually as per bhagavad gita only and reduce our rajasic and tamasic qualities.\n6. To create a online satsang group to protect ourselves from sinful materialistic bondages which eat our life times and sunk into lazyness, pleasures, ignorances, distractions and antivedic lifestyle.\n7. Even if you are beginner no problem. If you have are interested to get uplifted through bhagavad gita teachings and its followers you can join.\n8. To reduce our misconceptions and misundertandings in bhagavad gita because of our tamasic and rajasic impurities in our minds.\n9. Day by day to improve ourself in devotion and understanding of lord with the help of karma yoga, gnana yoga, bhakthi yoga, dhyana yoga different paths mentioned in bagavad gita which suits based on individual person.\n10. For each individual based on his knowledge and capacity an individual timetable is prepared.

To keep engaged everyone into love for the lord through all ways as per bhagavad gita, without deviation.\n12. Experts are greatly welcomed, even a single word of them can push our lives from hell. Even a single spiritual experience of them can destroy our lazynesses and misundertandings. (Ex :Thats how Narada saved valmiki just with small conversation) \nThe power of small conversation of an expert is weapon of destruction of all tamasic and rajasic impurities. They are deeply respected and welcomed.\n12. Always open to gain knowledge and suggestions from gurus.\n\n\nNo negativity is allowed. No blaming anyone is allowed. If one find something wrong show scriptural reference only. No personal blaming. No arrogance is allowed.",

It feels like 2 different sides of me are fighting.

      "text": "Hello and namaste everyone! As the title says I think western spirituality and new age has led me to Hinduism. \n\nI've recently seen a video explaining that we are not the thoughts, nor are we the body, and instead we are perception, awareness, and are ALL consciousness arising from a source like water droplets from an ocean.\n\nThis literally sounds like the concept of Brahman and Atman that I've studied. Another thing I noticed was this whole \"Christ consciousness\" and \"raise your vibration\" \"open your chakras\" and all of these terms. It sounds like they took a lot of stuff from Hinduism/buddhism and combined it with a desire to go away from Hinduism and instead have their own ways of getting there. \n\n\nAs I've went further down I saw that a lot of ppl end up crazy because of these concepts, and that's exactly why Hindus recommend initiation.\n\nAnyways I know I'm kind of jumping topic to topic so I'll cut to the question, how can I apply these concepts into a daily practice? I do not really feel connected when praying to a god with form, but when I just give aspects and personality without any physical form, it helps me focus my mind on the divine. Are there any mantras/deities that are like this which I can use in my practice?? I am more of a seeker than a believer so it's a bit difficult for me to settle but I really want to learn",

      "title": "Need help: My girlfriend’s spiritual journey has taken over our relationship",
      "text": "Hey, I am a 25-year-old guy from Delhi.\n\nI have a girlfriend whom I’ve been dating for the past four years, and I’ve known her for ten years. She has been madly in love with me for most of her life, and I love her deeply too. About two years ago, she started reading the Bhagwat Gita, and one thing led to another, and she got really deep into preaching Lord Krishna.\n\nCurrently, she wears a kanthi, chants the Lord’s name for around 30 minutes daily, and attends Bhagwat Gita classes that last about an hour. I had a business that she initially helped me scale from scratch. She used to handle social media and customer support in my small business during her travel time. However, she suddenly stopped doing that as she began doing jappa instead, leaving me helpless. This business was generating around 3-4 lakhs per month, and for her, it was at least 20k per month. Now, the revenue from that business is zero because I never had the time to restructure after the fall.\n\nThere was a day when I hit the lowest point in my life when I realized my friend was doing the same business as me. I was devastated and called her, telling her that I was halfway through and needed her to meet me that day. She denied it, saying she had classes and couldn’t compromise on them. (Note: I am usually very emotionally stable; I don’t think I’ve ever felt this low in my life. She was a very supportive girl, so this was a complete shock to me.)\n\nShe started visiting Vrindavan, and the frequency of her visits increased significantly. In the past seven days alone, she visited Vrindavan four times. Her parents do not try to stop her or say anything about it, nor do her friends, as they feel that it will bring them a curse from God. This leaves me as the only one trying to show her that another reality exists.\n\nHer ambitions seem to be pretty much dead. Don’t get me wrong, she is working somewhere and is one of the most hardworking people I know, but I believe her ambitions are fading as she revolves her life around her practice.\n\nRecently, she told me that she has discovered Maharaj Indresh Upadhyay Ji and that he is her guide. She wants to take diksha from him. I’ve realized that my girlfriend is starting to detach from reality—not just reality, but from me as well. (Please note that this is a girl who has literally obsessed over me for most of her life.)\n\nAs soon as I realized that I no longer hold the same position in her life, I pulled back and created some distance. This snapped her out of it, and she came back to reality, apologizing to me and trying to mend things with me.\n\nNow, I feel very helpless. She is someone I’ve invested the last four years in, and I really want to marry her. I have a few questions:\n\n1. She wants us to find a middle ground where I visit Vrindavan once every three months and listen to podcasts of Maharaj Ji. Honestly, I’m open to it, but do you think there is a middle ground?\n\n2. Should I talk to her mother about this? (Her mother knows we are dating but doesn’t like me one bit.)\n\n3. Do you think it’s worth burning myself out trying to save my girlfriend? If there’s a 0% chance of saving her, then there’s no point in putting in so much time and effort. (Please note that I employ around 60+ people, and their livelihood depends on how hard I work, which I’m definitely not able to do because of all this.)\n\n4. She says this is her personality, this is who she is, and that she finds happiness in this. She says she doesn’t want to leave me, but I don’t know what to do.\n\n5. I did a lot of research on Maharaj Indresh Upadhyay, and he seems legit, not like other babas, except for the fact that his best friend is Bageshwar Dham Baba. If you can help me get some information on Bageshwar Dham Baba or Indresh Upadhyay Maharaj, maybe I can try to talk to her mother, and we can collectively try to help her.\n\n6. Can you please tell me about diksha/deeksha? Please note that this diksha is not the usual diksha; it’s something different.\n\n7. If I leave her now, she says she would prefer living in Vrindavan. I tried leaving her, but she cried and convinced me otherwise.\n\nI really need help and any information you can provide. I feel very helpless, like I’m fighting a battle I can’t win, and I’m literally alone in this battle. Please help me out here.",

      "text": "I’ve always been drawn towards the Goddess or a Divine Mother, especially the past two years and since I’ve turned 40. Hindu art has been a fixture in my home but I didn’t know why I was fixated on it, it just felt like it should be there. I have been having lucid dreams/astral projecting/out of body experiences naturally since I was a child, but recently these beings have made an appearance. They are huge… like several stories tall, and look like Hindu deities, although I didn’t know enough about anything to identify them. That’s when I started studying everything I could get my hands on. Recently I had a very intense OOBE where I traveled to a beautiful colorful realm and a huge blue woman with four legs came up to me on a beach. I felt like she was two deities, I don’t know why. Like Kali and Lakshmi blended together. She gave me some wisdom, saying The Christ has come to this world in many forms, some which I would recognize, some I wouldn’t, and that he was coming back again. I asked her a question about my personal journey and she started freaking out, then ripped her head off and threw it down the beach!! I didn’t know much about Ma Kali at the time, so this really worried me that I had offended her. Now i see it as her guiding me to release my ego. After that, I encountered another giant being, this one was green and made up of plants and earth. It was shifting between male and female the whole time. I bowed down and it smiled and wrapped it’s arms around me. It felt very welcoming and glad to see me. I (stupidly) asked it what my purpose was also, and it just looked at me like I was saying something silly and didn’t answer. That was most of what I remember. I really want to explore these experiences with someone who’s knowledgeable, but I don’t know any other Hindus than myself. I feel like my past life or lives have been in Hindu families, and I have been dreaming of them and miss the community that I don’t have in this lifetime. I live in the Bible Belt and i have no idea where to turn. There is an Indian American community center/temple near me but I’m extremely shy and they haven’t answered any of my emails. I don’t want to just pop in and make a fool of myself. Any advice on my experiences or what I should do would be greatly appreciated 💜🙏",

I think that she is strong-willed and intelligent. She verbally \"crushed\" me, she reacted violently verbally.  I've been feeling the fear that she has a special connection or resonance with Maa Durga and Maa Kali. The strange thing, I don't know if it's envy (an emotion I must accept in every field, but overcome), is that, being called \"Sara\" and having this personality, she is more worthy of a connection with these deities. All this comes from some research I've done:\nHer name is Sara. It means \"Princess\", \"Lady\", in hebraic. The point is also that there is another coincidence, which I fear is like this. There is a French Rom cult where a \"Sara-La-Kali\" is worshipped, Sara the Black, which refers to the Hindu deity Kali, goddess of time and destruction. I see it a bit like that. Also Sārā is another name for Durga. The reference is also to this from how I see it. I feel weak and insignificant compared to her. All these coincidences cannot be just coincidences, given the nature, name and connection with Kali and Durga.",

      "text": "HEADS UP. I DID use chatgpt for this. But the story is real, I just don't have the time to paraphrase it and make my writing reflect what happened.\n\nGuys, I’m in deep trouble, and I don’t know what to do. For some context, I’m 16, I’m Indian, and my parents don’t exactly trust me. I’ve always been kind of average in school, so when my dad’s friend told him about this *spiritual camp* that opens your third eye so you can basically *see without seeing*, he jumped at the idea. Apparently, it helps you focus better, and you can even read books with your eyes closed. My dad got so convinced that he signed me up—and my little cousin too.\n\nI did my research, and I quickly realized it’s all a scam. People literally cheat by peeking through the gaps in their blindfolds because they’re too scared to admit they can’t do it. But it was already paid for—15k each. I thought maybe the yoga would be worth it, so I went along with it. Plus opening ur 3rd eye, I heard, is no where related to actual sight.\n\nThe very first class, we were given a blessing from the guru to *open our third eye*. It was this whole dramatic ritual, like we were being initiated into some secret world. But after that, it was four hours of straight yoga. No breaks. And then, we were supposed to *focus* and see these colored balls with our *third eye*. All the other kids were nailing it, and I was just there, staring at nothing. I got so fed up with being forced to go that I did what everyone else was doing—I peeked through the gap in the blindfold.\n\nNow my whole family thinks I’ve unlocked some magical power, and they couldn’t be prouder. I can’t even describe how guilty I feel. They believed it so easily. But my cousin...he’s in 3rd grade, and he couldn’t do it. He gave up, and now he’s been crying non-stop because he thinks there’s something wrong with him. It’s honestly heartbreaking. I want to tell him the truth so bad, but he’s so convinced that it’s real. And if I tell him, he’ll definitely spill everything to my family, and then they’ll know I cheated.\n\nBut it’s more than that. My parents are just...like that. If they find out I faked it, they won’t trust me again. They’ll believe in this ritual over me. I know it sounds messed up, but that’s just how it is. I feel like a coward. I don’t want to be. I want to stand up and say something, but I can’t. Even if I did, I know they wouldn’t believe me. My dad trusts his friends more than he trusts me. I’m just...stuck.",

      "text": "Namaste\n\nI live in a shared flat where we have a common puja room. One of my flatmates keeps photos of Sri Sri Ravishankar there, and regularly chants “Om Namah Shivaya.” While I respect that we may follow different gurus or spiritual paths, I’ve been struggling with certain aspects of how she uses the shared space.\n\nShe uses my diya (lamp) for her rituals, but I noticed the ghee she uses smells unpleasant—almost like it has animal fat—and it lingered on the diya. I felt so uncomfortable that I ended up buying a new one for myself. Despite my quiet discomfort, she continues to use shared spiritual items without asking, and is generally inconsiderate when it comes to shared household matters too.\n\nWhat hurts more is that, although she reads the Bhagavad Gita, she treats me quite rudely and lacks basic courtesy. This mismatch between her professed spirituality and daily behavior leaves me confused and even angry.\n\nHow do I process this as a practicing Hindu? How should I deal with the emotional and spiritual dissonance when someone seems spiritually devoted but acts in a way that feels unkind or disrespectful? It is causing me a lot of distress.\n\nAny perspectives or wisdom from scripture would be appreciated.",

      "text": "Let me share a personal experience. I’m currently in Italy, where I recently connected with a group of Hare Krishna devotees and discovered a temple. While I appreciate their warmth and sincerity, I've also encountered some troubling aspects of their approach.\n\nBeing Italians, their understanding of Hindu philosophy is primarily filtered through a limited set of saintly interpretations—many of which, unfortunately, diminish or outright devalue Shiva and Maa Sati, viewing them as lesser beings. Personally, I have no issue with others holding different beliefs. Who am I to judge or rob someone of their peace?\n\nHowever, the problem begins when they pressure me subtly or directly to chant or endorse “Jai Prabhupada.” I find it difficult because, to me, respect must be earned. As of now, Prabhupada has not earned my \"Jai.\"\n\nWhat concerns me more deeply is their lack of exposure to the vast landscape of Indian philosophical thought. When I bring up saints like Kabir or Namdev, their response is dismissive. Regardless of how profound these saints' teachings are, they are rejected because they don’t align with the narrow framework this group associates with Hinduism.\n\nLately, I’ve also been studying the Bhagavad Gita through the lens of five or six different commentaries. This has drawn criticism, as they insist there is only one \"true\" translation. I tried explaining that I see the Gita as a living text something to be questioned, explored, and understood from multiple perspectives. I even mentioned that I approach Krishna’s teachings with a healthy skepticism not because I find them flawed (in fact, I haven't yet), but because true learning involves inquiry, not blind acceptance. For that, I was labeled an atheist.\n\nIt saddens me because the Hinduism I know and seek to understand embraces diversity of thought. It honors non-believers, reveres all deities and manifestations of the divine, and fosters an environment of open spiritual inquiry. But this spirit of inclusiveness is missing here. And to be fair, I’ve seen this kind of dogmatism not just among them but in other sects too, like BAPS, where scripture often seems molded to fit a pre-decided ideology.\n\nI find myself questioning: Am I wrong to feel this way? After all, I don’t know Sanskrit, I haven’t realized God, and I’m not claiming to hold the ultimate truth. I’m simply a seeker of the truth.\n\nSo, I ask: How do others navigate this? How do you hold on to your spiritual curiosity and openness in spaces that demand conformity?",

So, she also ranted about my younger sibling's extra spending issues. we both are dependent on her and my dad. \n\nthis is just the initial condition that lead to my negative thoughts. I had the idea 'once I start working and making my own money, I will find a sugar daddy who supports a lavish lifestyle for me'. Dont get me wrong, I know these affairs are wrong and against my principles and teachings i grew up with, but I just had these ideas from idk where. Then, she said without knowing my thoughts, about how many youngsters are making money online from coaching ppl and more. that kinda silenced me a bit, bcs its like she unknowingly said one can make money without selling themselves. \n\nBut I still lay and continued my thoughts on like being a sugar baby and like making money by offering company to rich men. then, you know what actually made me share this here? I saw a video on my fyp on tiktok, about kali purush and the places he thrives including with ppl who engage in illicit relations.  My stomach dropped and I cant even say a word. my mind went black. All the sadhana ive done my whole life, my morals and my body that housed my worship, I was willing to throw all that away for money? I teared up so fast knowing how stupid I sound now. \n\nThis is a rant about myself. Anyone who also struggle to keep their head above these material stuff, I know how you feel too. I would never judge anyone for these issues, God helped me out now, he maybe not the next time. thank you for listening",

I’ve noticed my relatives and friends recently starting to practice meditation and wearing a sphatik mala to enhance peace and clarity. Personally, I am also interested to know the significance behind different types of rudraksh beads.\n\nFrom what I have picked up, the 5 mukhi rudraksh seems to be common and is known to enhance calmness and focus while meditating, which makes it easier to meditate. It is said to embody Lord Shiva and is one of the most common beads. On the contrary, the 7 mukhi rudraksh is said to be helpful in overcoming obstacles and gaining wealth. It is often recommended for energic balance too.\n\nI look forward to hearing from all of you and your experiences wearing sphatik mala or different types of rudraksh. Have you noticed meditative or lifestyle changes after wearing them? Any advice for newcomers? It will be interesting to learn from each other and support one another by sharing knowledge for our spiritual growth!",

I’ve noticed my relatives and friends recently starting to practice meditation and wearing a sphatik mala to enhance peace and clarity. Personally, I am also interested to know the significance behind different types of rudraksh beads.\n\nFrom what I have picked up, the 5 mukhi rudraksh seems to be common and is known to enhance calmness and focus while meditating, which makes it easier to meditate. It is said to embody Lord Shiva and is one of the most common beads. On the contrary, the 7 mukhi rudraksh is said to be helpful in overcoming obstacles and gaining wealth. It is often recommended for energic balance too.\n\nI look forward to hearing from all of you and your experiences wearing sphatik mala or different types of rudraksh. Have you noticed meditative or lifestyle changes after wearing them? Any advice for newcomers? It will be interesting to learn from each other and support one another by sharing knowledge for our spiritual growth!",

      "text": "Hi everyone, I’m a 20-year-old Bengali Hindu male. I’ve been a Krishna Bhakt for as long as I can remember. I wear a kanthi mala, chant the Hare Krishna maha mantra (two rounds daily), worship Him every day, and try to take His name as much as I can throughout the day. I also eat vegetarian food on all puja days celebrated in my home, though I generally do consume non-veg otherwise.\n\nA few months back, I felt a strong spiritual pull and decided to eat vegetarian twice a week and also observe Ekadashi. Initially, it felt very natural—it brought a beautiful sense of closeness with Krishna, and I felt really aligned with my bhakti.\n\nBut lately, everything just feels… off.\n\nI feel like I’m forcing myself with Ekadashi and the extra vegetarian days. It’s no longer as uplifting as it was in the beginning, and I’m starting to wonder—am I doing something wrong? Is this distance I’m feeling because I’m not following these practices “perfectly”? Does not doing all these things push me away from God? Am I somehow less of a Hindu?\n\nI really don’t want to lose my connection with Krishna. At the same time, I’m trying to understand if these practices should feel more natural and joyful, instead of burdensome.\n\nMy question is do I force myself to stick to it till I get used to it or do I follow my heart.",

I only want to concentrate on chanting stotrams, doing simple puja and going to temples.\n\nI just want to take up a Devata Upasana in the future and concentrate on it.\n\nBut it is not easy too. The grief is making me not able to focus on God. I used to go to a Durga temple weekly and pray to the Goddess ardently. Now, after my grandmother's death, I go the the temple but could not pray wholeheartedly to Durga. I just look at Her, try to chant her name mentally a few times and then leave. There are times where I cry to Her why should I experience such things in my life.\n\nDo you think that I am going in the right direction in terms of spirituality (as in not feeling interested in marriage or my hobbies but trying to focus only on spirituality)?",

I am thinking of connecting to God closer in daily life and get rid of bad habits and start spiritual journey and stay healthy. \n\nCould anyone suggest any mala like spatik, or rudraksha mala so that I can start my spiritual journey by connecting to God closely. \n\n(Why I am asking for mala is I need something on me to remind myself and not to feel lonely that I am not alone, god was always with me)",

Most platforms don’t even ask for the things that matter to us — like your **Guru's name, Sampraday, or spiritual values**.\n\nSo I decided to build one, with love, as a service to our sampraday.\n\n# 🙌 Join the Journey\n\nIf you or someone in your family is looking for a Vaishnav life partner, do check it out.\n\n🔗 [Download the app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.vaishnav_sathi.vaishnav_sathi&pcampaignid=web_share) (Android only for now)\n\nYour blessings, feedback, and suggestions are always welcome 🙏",

Ultimately, it was he, my Guru, Dada J P Vaswani, who showed me the path to enlightenment, to spiritual awakening. He led me to discover the purpose of life. He inspired me not just to exist, but to find meaning and purpose every day that I live. All glory to the Guru, to help the seeker realize the truth, be awakened and liberated.",

      "text": "Alright i’m 18F and after being atheist i’ve converted into hindu, and have been practicing in normal prayers for the past 3 years. I was born in an open minded hindu family so hinduism isn’t new to me.\n\nHowever. as i research more and more, my mind is filled with so many questions that a normal believer isn’t able to answer, such as which path i should choose how should i start etc. \n\nI would wanna worship either shiva or krishna \n\nKrishna because from whatever research i did, i find him to be so amazing, i gravitate towards him and i want to be his friend. My family doesn’t really pray to krishna, but they’ve started from the last two years because i kept talking about him ahahahah. I remember a year back me and my mom had a dream about krishna on the SAME NIGHT, it was so crazy.\n\nShiva because my family worships him and i find him very powerful and gravitate towards him too. I think i gravitate towards him because of my family and all the stories. Honestly his aura is just so powerful. \n\nYeah i typed a lot i just want suggestions😭",

If you can prove that you're a decent person who can keep your beliefs to yourself and be kind to people who are different from you, then you deserve respect. I know religious people who have done it, so it's perfectly possible. Your religion is not your personality.\n\n\nI see no reason to have positive feelings about anyone I haven't met.

      "text": "One of those social media preacher kids came up to me on the street recently. The kind with a backward hat, a ring light, and a mic in your face asking if you believe in Jesus. I said no. He looked stunned. Then I asked him a few basic questions about his own religion. It fell apart instantly.\n\nHe didn’t know that Paul never met Jesus. He didn’t know that Paul’s letters were written before the Gospels. He had no idea the Gospels were written decades after Jesus died, by anonymous Greek authors who weren’t eyewitnesses. No clue that Matthew and Luke copied from Mark. No idea the resurrection stories contradict each other completely. He had never heard that the earliest Gospel, Mark, ends with no resurrection appearances at all.\n\nHe couldn’t explain why Jesus’s birth is dated to two completely different time periods in Matthew and Luke. One says it happened under Herod, who died in 4 BCE. The other says it was during the census under Quirinius in 6 CE. That’s a ten-year gap. One Gospel has Jesus’s family fleeing to Egypt. The other says they went straight back to Nazareth.\n\nAnd when I brought up the Trinity, he said it’s all over Scripture. I asked him to show me where Jesus defines it. He couldn’t. Because he didn’t know the Trinity is a post-biblical doctrine created by Church councils in the fourth century. Same with the New Testament canon. He didn’t realize it was the Catholic Church that decided which books made it into the Bible. Evangelicals claim they just follow Scripture, but they’re following a table of contents that Rome gave them.\n\nMost Christians have no idea\nthat Paul barely talks about Jesus’s life, teachings, or miracles\nthat Judas dies two different ways in Matthew and Acts\nthat the Gospels can’t agree on who found the tomb, who was there, or what they saw\nthat John rewrites everything with a totally different voice and message\nthat the last twelve verses of Mark were added later\nthat doctrines like the Trinity, the virgin birth, and parts of the resurrection story evolved over time\n\nBut they’ll still tell you you’re going to hell for not believing it.\n\nIf you’re going to preach to strangers on the sidewalk, maybe start by understanding where the magical sacred book came from. I seriously think the majority of Christians think “Mark, Matthew, Luke, and John” watched Jesus go around and then got together right after he died and wrote down everything exactly as it happened. They obviously just cherrypick feel good verses and have never actually read and compared all the wild contradictions haha. Jesus can be whatever you want him to be…. That is what the writers of the gospels and Paul did!",

One guy, from the Caribbean, told me that “here in LA public schools have secret rooms where boys have to wear dresses and make up during school hours, then they get back to their normal clothes before going home”.\r\n\r\nThen I spoke to a guy from Central America, who was trying to get a job at McDonald’s. He told me the “prices at McD’s are so expensive nowadays because of the high minimum wages in California”.\r\n\r\nHow can it be at all possible that these two guys, who have a lot to lose from the future Trump presidency, can believe in these absurd lies and shoot themselves in the foot so badly?\r\n\r\nIn my opinion, religion plays a huge part in this problem.\r\n\r\n*Faith* is believing in something without any evidence. Religions promote *faith* because their claims are so absurd, if you have a minute of doubt, you stop believing. When you are religious, you are always told not question anything.\r\n\r\nSo when people blindly believe \"an angel got a virgin pregnant, she had a baby that later on performed miracles, then he died and ressurected\", what will people *not* believe in?\r\n\r\nIf someone is gullible enough to fall for this madness, how will they not fall for “they’re eating the dogs”, or “kids get sex change operations at school”?\r\n\r\nIt's about time we stop being so respecful and tolerant towards people’s own beliefs. I do respect people who have their own imaginary friends, but I cannot respect this being allowed to be said out loud like it’s a normal thing.\r\n\r\nWhen people cannot tell the difference between truth and blatant lies, and their gullibility threatens the health of the world’s democracies, it’s time we say enough is enough.\r\n\r\nI know Dawkins and Gervais can be arrogant and out of touch. But I think we need more people like them telling it like it is: religion is stupidity, and it’s killing our planet.\r\n\r\nI love my kids (14m, 9f) more than anything in the world. They’ve both been raised as skeptics (scientific skepticism) and they view religions as outdated fairytales.\r\n\r\nI want my kids to live in a world where people can understand the difference between evidence, burden of proof, reality, fiction and lies",

      "text": "My daughter is from a previous relationship and her mother takes her to church and puts her in Religious Ed (youth group) on Wednesday nights. I've never objected to it, it's not my place to tell her otherwise, my daughter has enjoyed it so that's all that matters to me. She has invited me to several church events and I've attended to support and be with my daughter. She has no idea of my own personal views. \n\nFor context to the story and a dad brag, my daughter is very bright and has skipped ahead 2 grades this year. I'm very proud of her. I'm sure some might say this is fake because of the verbage but my disclaimer is the reason why she sounds mature. Sometimes she's my baby girl and sometimes she's a bright intelligent young woman. This story is about my young adult.\n\nI, for obvious reasons since I'm posting here, am an atheist but I have never imposed my beliefs on my daughter. I picked her up this past Friday and she just exploded on me, venting the entire 30 min ride home. We hadn't seen each other since the inauguration and she was quite... Upset. What came spewing forth from her, was a surprisingly up to date synopsis of the current administrations choices. Which then led into her complaining about religion because she peaced together that SOMEHOW religion is being used to make these awful decisions about people and their rights.\n\nWhich lead to her telling me that she didn't understand how people could call themselves Christian and yet condone purposely malicious acts. Especially to just normal people and to good people. I had asked her what happened to have her draw up this conclusion. She said that during a Sunday school lesson, they were talking about sins and how the teachers were \"influencing\" things she thought were just normal every day things, as sins.\n\nUnfortunately, this lead to a personal note to my daughter. You see, my daughter was born out of wedlock and they just so happened to mention that children born outside of wedlock were a sin and evil. To which my daughter raised her hand and pointed out that she was born out of wedlock but she felt she was a good person (who coincidentally, is also very popular at school and church) and the whole class fell silent. This threw a serious wrench in their lesson plan and the only rebuttal after the awkward silence, was that they would now have to speak with her mother on such things and my daughter left church that day, rightfully upset and crying.\n\nHer friends texted her that everyone was talking about her and her mom now and my daughter wants no part of the church anymore. She said if that was true, it marked the second time she was aware that church people were talking bad about someone behind their back and she wants no part of them being hypocrites. She was glad to get away and be with me that weekend, as it meant she didn't have to go to church this Sunday.\n\nOn one hand, I'm extremely proud she's unveiled the church for what it is on her own terms but I'm so broken hearted over the reasons WHY. She's 13... She shouldn't be knowing about politics or the bigotry of people this early on in life and I'm very upset that this innocence has been robbed from her. Yes I know , you can't shelter them forever but I at least wanted to have her enjoy her childhood. I didn't know really know what to do or how to help her other than let her vent and cry. \n\nI took my family to the Aquarium this weekend, as a distraction from current events but man was Sunday a gloomy day as we came back to reality.",

      "text": "The killing of Jonathon Joss is something that really disturbed and angered me. Especially the details of what was done with remains of their dog that died in the house fire. It never ceases to amaze how evil and cruel people can be. During childhood, it's very common for kids to fear that there are monsters hiding under their beds or in their closets. Part of adulthood is realizing that the actual monsters are other humans.  I know not all Christians or Muslims would do something so unfathomably heinous, but I doubt any atheist on earth would do something like this because we aren't instructed to hate gay people simply for existing. I just get more disappointed with humanity every day that passes. What a fucking pathetic, loathsome species we are. SMH.",

In the 8th verse it’s stated that a burning pillar on a rock just appeared out of nowhere and “he thought he saw Jesus, God, lots of angels, and the 12 apostles. Mind you this is 600BC, aka 600 years before Jesus was born. There’s so much more bs in this book and I’ve not even reached the 10th verse. Joseph Smith either must’ve been a great troll or utterly clinically insane.\n\nEdit: looked into Scientology, Narnia is more believable than that shite hahahahaha",

      "title": "My Son attends an extremely religious college. He asked me if I, as an atheist, would mind answering some questions about religion for a class he is taking. Here are my answers.",
      "text": "# 1. Do you have a background in religion? If so, what is it?\n\nMy childhood was \"Christian\" based. That is to say, my broader family was “Christian”. My Mother married into the Catholic religion (Roman Catholic) when I was about five years old. I was exposed to the concept of religion as a small child and my exposure after that was intermittent but fairly regular. I am no stranger to religion.\n\nI explored theism as a concept when I was in High School. I attended a local Christian church for several years. I enjoyed the company of my pastor and I made a few friends. Almost all of them were good people and were not overly judgmental. I enjoyed the time, but those experiences never changed my feeling that there is no god and that the concepts taught at my church could be better learned elsewhere.\n\nReligion has remained a curiosity to me throughout my life. I have studied the elements of the abrahamic religions and I have explored ideologies like Buddhism and Existentialism. Almost all of them get too close to spirituality (the required acceptance of empty ideas) for me to have any desire to participate actively.\n\nMy mind remains open, but it may be putting it lightly to say that I am a skeptic.\n\n# 2. Was there ever a time you believed in God? If so, why did you think it changed?\n\nI have never been convinced that there is or ever was any kind of deity. Not even in my early childhood. I believe in things that are true and I see no reason to think that religion of any kind contains historic mystical truth.\n\nThe scientific method is the best way to answer any kind of question. Applying verifiable data, researching the topic, testing with rigorous experimentation, peer review, and iteration is the best way to draw a reasonable conclusion. I love the fact that, even if a claim is not verified during a scientific process, something was still learned. There is no failure in science, just unexpected learning.\n\nReligion is the opposite of the aforementioned process. Where science is progressive, religion is regressive. Popular religious teachings are dogmatic – they will have a curious mind accept a concept unconditionally because “that is how it was written” rather than allowing the idea to be explored and improved upon.\n\n# 3. How important is spirituality to your life now? Has this changed over time? If so, why?\n\nThe term \"spirituality\" encompasses more than a belief in a god. It also encompasses any supernatural element, regardless of whether or not it is related to any kind of theology. That being said, I am not spiritual and I never have been. Not even a little bit.\n\n# 4. In terms of religion, who has had the biggest influence on your life?\n\nMy Son is the very best example of what religion can be. My Mother is a close second. These are people that, in my opinion, would be good people with or without religion. The fact that they believe in a deity may be something I do not agree with, but it does not diminish my love for them. That love was earned through actions and expression, two things that you don't need religion to uncover.\n\nBut not all influences have been positive. I have encountered too many people who bastardize the concept of religion and use it as a means to enrich their own lives or to subjugate others. The contradictory teachings and backwards principles in the Bible only serve to make this problem worse. Following any teaching blindly (religious or otherwise) leads to bad results. This has been proven over and over again throughout history.\n\nReligion has done far more harm to humanity (and nature) than any good it may have done throughout the ages. As a concept, it is a net negative.\n\n# 5. Who do you think Jesus was, and why?\n\nThere is no definite proof that Jesus, in the biblical sense, ever existed. The Bible stories were written, at best, a full 30 years after Jesus' supposed death (and then translated and re-translated too many times to count). They are just a husk of their original Hebrew source. The Septuagint and its retranslations (which vary wildly) are so filled with basic mistakes of geography, mistakes of law, and contradictions that they do not lend to any serious discussion.\n\nIs the \"concept\" of Jesus important? Perhaps in a philosophical sense. As an example, a key foundation of modern morals is the Sermon on the Mount, I think mostly because (as noted in the Beatitudes) it addresses the idea that a humble nature will allow a person to achieve more than any degree of pride, riches, or ego.\n\n# 6. Are there any features of the world that give you pause and make you think there might be a God?\n\nNo. None.\n\nI can easily see how dark times (which many say we are experiencing right now) might cause a person to turn to forces that they hope will protect them in some way. Oh, if only wanting it badly enough could make it so…\n\nI have personally always felt that reliance on my family and community (and the natural world) are more than enough to help me through times of need. In turn, I feel a tremendous responsibility to give back and support those whom I am close to during their hard times.\n\n# 7. Are there any things that attract you to religion in general or Christianity in particular? And are there any things that turn you away?\n\nI am not attracted to religion in any way, organized or not. The concept of a deity, while I can see how it served a purpose at a time when there were no other mechanisms to help organize (i.e. control) societies, is no longer necessary.\n\nIn our current age of enlightenment (scientific discovery and desire to rule through representation and democratic principles) the idea of organized religion serves more as a tool for the powerful to control the gullible. We are seeing it happen at the highest levels of our government as I write this. It is abhorrent.\n\n# 8. What experiences have most shaped your spiritual life?\n\nI explored Christianity when I was younger. I also studied various abrahamic concepts throughout my life. I have always striven to allow those around me who are religious to feel comfortable in my presence, and I have succeeded sometimes (not always).\n\nI have been rejected from social groups because of my atheism. When it first happened, I was not hurt, but I was confused. I did not (and I still do not) understand why a person would reject an offer of friendship and brotherhood over the idea of a fictional being that does not offer tangible support of any kind.\n\n# 9. If you were to breakdown the key reasons you don't believe into intellectual, emotional, personal or other factors, how would you rate them?\n\nIntellectual: The human race evolved without a god. The concept of a deity is a construct that likely served a purpose in the past, but only serves to harm society in our modern age. It was never real and, while I am happy to admit that I could be wrong about the concept of a creator, I cannot in good conscience promote or endorse such an ideology.\n\nEmotional: While my love for those who are close to me comes first, and while I will ALWAYS be available to those who need me regardless of their affiliation with religion, I must admit that I feel a bit of sadness for people who choose to make religious dogma the guiding principle in their life.\n\nPersonal: I have never felt as if I have any “emptiness” in my life. That idea is often expressed in religious circles (“Jesus filled the hole in my heart” or “The void in my soul is filled with hope every Sunday”). I am a very introspective person; I like to think that I am in touch with my emotions. I think that I am willing to be convinced by others if their position is convincing. I have never seen any indication, no matter how small, that leads to the concept of a creator. I have definitely never seen any evidence that said creator has “plans” or wants the human race to act a certain way.\n\n# 10. What might convince you to believe in God?\n\nI cannot think of a single experience, concept, person, or thing that could \"convince\" me to believe in the supernatural. I cannot imagine a kind of evidence exists that is capable of that.\n\nMy ultimate desire is to believe what is true. To that end, I am open to any idea as long as it carries with it appropriate evidence.",

The reason is obvious: your decision, announced yesterday, to censor an article by fellow Board member Jerry Coyne, and to slander him as an opponent of LGBTQIA+ rights.\n\nCoyne:\n\n> But because you took down my article that critiqued Kat Grant’s piece, which amounts to quashing discussion of a perfectly discuss-able issue, and in fact had previously agreed that I could publish that piece—not a small amount of work—and then put it up after a bit of editing, well, that is a censorious behavior I cannot abide.\n\nDawkins:\n\n> an act of unseemly panic when you caved in to hysterical squeals from predictable quarters and retrospectively censored that excellent rebuttal. Moreover, to summarily take it down without even informing the author of your intention was an act of lamentable discourtesy to a member of your own Honorary Board. A Board which I now leave with regret.\n\n\nThe latest news is that the [FFRF has dissolved its entire honorary board](https://whyevolutionistrue.com/2025/01/07/more-fallout-from-the-big-kerffrfle-freedom-from-religion-foundation-dissolves-its-entire-honorary-board-and-other-news/).\n\nCoyne says he and others have previously criticized FFRF for \"mission creep\"--using the resources of the organization to extend its mission at the expense of the purpose for which the organization was founded:\n\n> The only actions I’ve taken have been to write to both of you—sometimes in conjunction with Steve, Dan (Dennett), or Richard—warning of the dangers of mission creep, of violating your stated goals to adhere to “progressive” political or ideological positions. Mission creep was surely instantiated in your decision to cancel my piece when its discussion of biology and its relationship to sex in humans violated “progressive” gender ideology. This was in fact the third time that I and others have tried to warn the FFRF about the dangers of expanding its mission into political territory. But it is now clear that this is exactly what you intend to do.",

      "text": "As part of my program, i have classes where im taught about different religions and faith systems. Although im not religious myself, i do think its interesting to learn about religions and their origins, as they are deeply imbued in culture and history. The only problem i have is the teacher. She claims we must look at religion in a objective manner to study it (which i fully agree with!), but throughout the year she has showed very biased views. For example, even though we have learnt that there is no correct way to practice religion, because it is a very subjective experience, she says that jihadi terrorists are keeping Allah \"hostage\" (her wording), that they are using Islam as a \"cover\" tocommit crimes. This seems very biased to me, because how are you to say they arent religious because they are evil? This is just one example to illustrate why i cant fully take her serious.\n\nBut on to the main issue. At some point during the year, atheism naturally came up. And here, she INSISTED that atheism is a religion like any other. When several in the class disagreed and asked her what faith system atheism uses, she argued that believing in the Big Bang theory is also a type of belief/faith. Now, that is a whole can of worms in itself, but we then argued that being an atheist doesn't not necessarily mean you believe in that theory, some atheists truly dont believe in anything at all. She had no response for that. \n\nI just found the logic so strange, and was wondering what this subreddit has to say about. Have you also encountered people who insist atheism is a religion? To me, it felt like she was trying to be a subversive smart-ass.",

      "text": "I'm so fucking tired of hearing about god. It's always god this, god that. I live in a religious household AND go to a religious school, I can't get a fucking break from religion. Every single conversation I have with my family has to lead back to god. It's so fucking infuriating.\n\n\"Oh, you wanna get into a good university? Pray to god.\"\n\n\"You wanna get a job? Pray to god.\"\n\n\"You wanna get good grades? Pray to god.\"\n\n\"It's not up to you who you get married to. It's already written, you don't get to decide.\"\n\n\"You don't want kids? It's up to god, not up to you.\" (This fucker (my dad) yelled at me for an hour because I said I didn't want kids. Who the hell gave you the right to tell me what I can do with my body? He claims that you need kids to spread the message of Islam. So, he just wanted kids so he could indoctrinate them and make them live miserable lives. Fun.) I think it is up to me whether I have unprotected sex or not, you sound stupid. Most muslim people just don't use protection because kids are a \"gift\" from god. (They end up having as many as 20 kids.) They claim that women who have more kids are guaranteed heaven. Such bullshit. No wonder it's the fastest growing religion.\n\nShut. the. fuck. up.\n\nYou're telling me god can help me with college applications yet can't help millions of people dying from cancer, hunger, murder, etc? He has awful fucking priorities.\n\nDon't even get me started on quran and islamic studies classes. They're so fucking idiotic. Quran class sounds like a fucking cult, we all chant quran verses in unison, it's a nightmare. And islamic studies is just useless. Nobody gives a fuck about Joseph and his brothers or Moses and his staff. Go fuck yourself. (Not to mention my highly misogynistic teacher who supports wife-beating and blames women for getting raped.)\n\nThe constant slut-shaming is so exhausting. Why the fuck am I getting shamed for wearing a t-shirt at home while my brother can wear shorts and walk around shirtless??? They act like your brothers are attracted to you or something, it's so fucking weird. How about you stop sexualizing me and teach him that it's normal for women to have bodies???? My dad is constantly telling me to cover up at home and telling me I'm going to go to hell for not doing so. What the fuck is wrong with you??? And honestly, if hell existed, I'd rather be in it than heaven. Heaven is just a 7th century warlord's wet dream. Men get to dick down 72 virgins while women get... rivers of milk and a palace...? But, at least they can wear skirts!\n\nWomen in Islam are just treated like sex toys. Everything we do has to be about sex. Don't wear perfume, don't wear makeup, don't show your hair, don't wear jewellery, don't wear cute outfits, don't wear tight oufits, don't style your bin bag (abaya). Why can't we do all this? Because it tempts men and if we get raped, then it's our fault for having a strand of hair showing. So many muslim women are waiting until they die to wear a cute skirt. It doesn't get any more miserable than that.\n\nMen in Islam are treated like rabid animals who go insane at the sight of an ankle. It's so fucking stupid. And because this is what they're taught, it breeds men like this. In many Islamic countries, women and children get raped if they don't wear the hijab, or don't wear a bin bag. Those men will always blame women for getting raped, because this is what Islam teaches them. It doesn't teach mutual respect and empathy, it always places men on a pedestal. Men and women can't even be friends. Love doesn't exist in Islam.\n\nSo many fucking rules for no reason. It makes life so miserable. Don't eat pork, don't drink alcohol, don't listen to music, don't watch movies, don't celebrate birthdays, don't be friends with jews, don't date, don't get tattoos, don't get plastic surgery, pray 5 times a day, etc. God has some weird fucking obsession with prohibiting random bullshit that harms nobody.\n\nI still need to survive 1.5 more years of this bs. I'm going to go insane.\n\nI'd rather have been born a Christian. I hate all religions but atleast Christian women aren't forced to dress up as bin bags.\n\n(oops i swore a lot, i'm js really frustrated 😭)",

I understand that some women don’t agree with every part of their religion, but then why follow it at all? \nIt baffles me when i see women promoting the misogynistic aspects of their religion and pushing it onto other women. It is an absolutely bizarre phenomenon. \n\nDon’t get me wrong, i also dont understand how most men on this planet still believe in misogynistic religions. do most men on this planet not see women as human beings? also, these misogynistic religions make men look like violent perverts, so why do they follow them?",

This is damaging to young brains. I also think that churches, mosques, etc should be 18+. Children should be legally protected from religion. \n\nAfter figuring out that religion is a bunch of lies myself at the age of 15, i developed severe trust issues because i realized that my whole world view was a lie and that the people who i thought i could trust the most were liars. I was living in fear, not knowing what is real and what is not. Children should never be lied to, as it can cause severe mental health issues down the line. \n\n\n**Edit: a lot of you are saying that religion should be taught in a way that discusses all major religions equally, such as “Christians believe X” and “Muslims believe Y”, etc. The problem with this is that usually the beliefs of these religions are sugar coated and made to look good. If something has to be sugar coated, it shouldn’t be taught at all. Religions should only be discussed in a historical context in social studies. That’s it.",

      "text": "When you look at the history of Christianity and how it has spread, it has largely been through force. Force from male leaders in government, church, and society. So if you tie in patriarchy and white supremacy, so much of Christianity especially in the West and via colonialism has been spread through violence, force, and aggression. Some examples are Native Americans being nearly genocided, raped, etc. by Christian European colonizers. Then with slavery that brought many West and Central Africans to North and South America, and forced Christianity into them while destroying or demonizing native beliefs. It even goes further with reconstruction of gender, sexuality, culture, etc. but I digress. \n\nThe reason a lot of Christians try to justify slavery or male violence and cruelty against minorities and women is because they know these systems of oppression are not only fundamental to a lot of the early beliefs, but are intrinsic to the history of Christianity.",

I'm 18F and South Asian, so personally I love a lot of his content on racism, immigration etc (and watching reaction videos to that awful Jubilee video where he had to argue against literal bigots). So when I saw this video come up on my feed I was pretty conflicted. Most comments were praising him for highlighting how peaceful Islam is (which I heavily disagree with), but many comments I saw criticising his points were mostly from Islamaphobic, racist people. The very few rational comments constructively criticising his argument were pretty recent and had very little traction. \n\nSo yeah, any thoughts?",

I've only ever known one Mormon, and I asked him straight up how he could believe in a religion when it was demonstrated that Joseph Smith lied about the translation from the plates that no one saw, and he couldn't give a satisfying answer.\n\nBut that was just one guy. Sure, there have been door knockers coming over on missions from the States, but I've only ever known one person that lives here that is a Mormon.\n\nAnd yet, when a newly-constructed Mormon church opened here, I saw that the car park was packed every fucking weekend. Seeing just how many people live in my area are genuine gullible idiots is very upsetting. I can understand why people would follow mainstream Christianity, because it's mostly unfalsifiable, but Mormonism? Seriously? Unfalsifiability is not a good reason to believe in something, in fact it's a reason *not* to believe in something, but at least it's *a* reason. \"You can't prove it wrong\" is a strong argument for some people.\n\nBut not only *can* you prove Mormonism wrong, it *has* been proven wrong. The scientific method was applied to Joseph Smith's claims and the experiment to test the accuracy of his \"translations\" failed to recreate the same results. He lied, and yet people believed him. Too many people believed him. And seeing reminders of just how many people is very saddening.",

      "text": "I lie about religion a lot. I accept that most people are religious, and most people trust you more if you share the same denomination or have a similar religion.\n\nMy parents were agnostic and constantly told my grandparents that we went to church every Sunday, when in reality, I didn’t even know what a church was until I was 17. I was lucky to have parents who never forced religion on me, unlike many people on this sub. Because of that, I don’t have any disgust toward church.\n\nI’ve engaged in many debates with religious people, but I realized they’re not really arguing to change their minds, they just want to shout whatever belief they have. So I stopped pretending to debate, especially since I’ve seen how deconstruction can be devastating, as it happened to one of my close friend.\n\nThe reason I’m asking this sub is because I lie about religion, especially for personal gain. I’m currently living in Vancouver, Canada, and I literally pay only $600 CAD for rent because my coworker thinks I’m Christian and told me about a one-bedroom with a private bathroom and shared kitchen near my work that only accepts Christians. I asked if they were super religious, and they said no, just make sure to be Christian which was the only catch.\n\nI just moved in there, but my friend, who knows I’m atheist, thinks I’m being unethical. Do you think lying in this case makes it bad?\n\nEdit: that my friend is also atheist, like me, but left the church.",

Yesterday we were sitting at a table in a local park when a grown man and two young boys maybe 16 or so came up to me and asked if they could give me some pamphlet they had. I said well it depends on what it is and he said it’s about the lord and and the Bible. I said no thanks, I don’t want it. He said “ why, don’t you believe in god?” I said well no i don’t because there is no evidence. His argument back to me was well just look at the sky and that’s proof! Hahaha I couldn’t believe it. I just said no it’s not proof and then he said well how about when a woman gets pregnant and has a child that’s proof. I said where are you coming up with this argument ? None of those things are proof of God. I said if God is omnipotent and omnipresent why doesn’t he just make himself known to all of us instead of having boys like you run around harassing people trying to convince us? His brilliant answer was “well if a person saw God he might think it’s a UFO.” So I politely said look I’m not interested I already told you why don’t you just move along and leave us alone I don’t want to talk to you about this. Right then three other young man came up and stood around him so my 13 year old Mentee and I were surrounded by six young men/boys glaring at us trying to prove their point. Things got heated back-and-forth and finally I said look I already told you I’m not interested go spread your message to someone that cares I don’t want to hear it. They finally left, I looked at my Mentee Daniel and he looked very scared and said let’s hurry up and get out of  here. I asked him if he was upset about the conversation and he said no I was worried about all those guys surrounding us. It really ticked me off I wasn’t afraid but the fact that they made him afraid really pissed me off. Should I have it differently?",

Why would a god allow for text teaching his words to become outdated and riddled with metaphors.How do you know which is a metaphor and which is real. Oh and they love to spam the phrase \"free will\". I don't believe you can consider yourself progressive if your religious. You have to reject being progressive or being religious you cant be both. You can't be a feminist if you follow a religion that states that women are lesser than men. You can't advocate for gay rights while following a religion that says being queer is a sin. You cannot be against racism while following a religion that forced upon people through missionary work ultimately robbing those people of their culture.Religion is conservative. \n\nEdit:\nI want to further add that a religious person can genuinely be progressive. Many progressive people who have spoken out and made changes in the world have been religious, however what comes with that is often rejection of parts of their religious text which leads me to question whether they truly follow their religion.I should've phrased the title something along the lines of Religion is a conservative idea therefore you cannot be a progressive religious person without contradicting one or the other",

I've stopped saying I \"respect religion\" because I don't, and  if other atheists can say this and remain safe, they should. I don't even entirely respect people's right to practice religion, especially when it is harming others, such as parents who brain wash and or physically beat religion into their children , or who let children die of treatable diseases citing their \"beliefs\".  I wish religion would dissappear and something PRO social takes its place, which can happen, and has had some success in largely secular countries where human rights are actually respected . I'd really like to hear of any organizations that have elimination of religion as a goal, if anyone knows of any.",

      "text": "Before I go into this, I'm not atheist, but Buddhist and an ex-christian. This also may be a Hot take to some of you.  Despite growing up Christian I didn't really have any issues or problems with it. It was when I got on and discovered the internet, when I not only started being ashamed of this religion but disgusted. First of all Christians will SWEAR to be the least judgmental religion, but when TikTok became popular, religion wars were HOT. Christian's actually LOVED to come of Satanists and atheists it was actually a crazy ass time. All I saw was \"They think their rocks are gonna save them\". Meanwhile they would them post some shit like \"We'll respect your religion If you respect ours!\" and usually NOBODY was dissing Christian's, so the attacks were always unprovoked. Not only that but when someone would share their religious trauma or any trauma at all, there would always be multiple Christian's to remind them it's \"God's plan\". Saw someone say this to someone who was kidnapped?? I think It was around 2019 on TikTok when Christian's started to despise EACHOTHER 🥴. The amount of times I was called a \"Fake Christian \" because I either didn't know a Bible verse, or disagreed with something in the Bible. Like dude who are you to make that decision 🙏🏾😭. Last but not least, Christian's actually have an UNGODLY problem with forcing their religion. If someone says they don't believe in God, they proceed to say \"God loves you\". Which, is indeed, a subtle but still way to force religion. But if you told them \"Satan loves you\" may God break the internet.  But even though that was the most common way they would try to aggravate atheists,  I remember seeing this one specific Christian on TikTok who was extremely sexist, he also happened to be a pedophile. Not only that, but he hated on people who were LGBTQ, While being LGBTQ himself 🤦🏾‍♀️. (He got caught on Grindr hooking up while multiple trans woman.) He would physically hurt people and break into places just to spread the word, the dude was an actual problem. Last thing I have to say, is Christian's disrespect towards Muslims is beyond me. They call their religion a \"Cult\" and a \"Poor choice of living\" but at the end of the day, the person is Jolly and happy asf to be in their religion so It's not an issue. There's really no love like Christian hate 🤦🏾‍♀️.",

Why are they so obsessed with gay people?\n\nHaving kids out of wedlock, premarital sex, lust, envy, jealousy, gluttony. I could go on.\n\nI mean I know why. It's because THEY themselves are and committ every last one of those \"sins\" daily. So it's easier for them to put the focus elsewhere to feel like they're \"doing God's work\" but in reality they're everything they preach against. But they'd rather focus on a so called \"sin\" they feel like they're protected from. Which isn't necessarily the case all the time because we all know many of them have homosexual desires. They've been exposed many times. But that's a whole different conversation itself.",

She's kind, smart and empathetic but we hit a roadblock constantly when talking about religion.\n\nFor background I was raised Catholic, but I do have exposure to hinduism as my dad's family is mostly hindu although he is an atheist. When I turned 18 I stopped going to church with my mum although I still follow her on occasion when she insists. \n\nSo back to the small issue we have run into, when we get to talking about religion, and I tell her I'm not into religion but I'm okay if you are, she constantly refers to hinduism as something you are born into and to be respectful when talking about it as it's not a religion. So far I haven't actually said anything about it cause I'm afraid of offending her. \n\nHow do I explain to her my side and to counter her argument while being polite as the last thing I want to do is belittle her\n\n\nUPDATE: Thank you everyone for your responses, I really appreciate all of them. I got some really good advice and some not so good ones but the community in this sub is always relatively polite. As for my gf and I, she's not devout, an extremist or a follower of the caste system and I guess her being offended by me challenging her beliefs were all in my head cause she was pretty open to it. We had a constructive conversation that reinforced my will to marry her ASAP. Yeah I know its a little early but when you know, you know right? \n\n Wish us luck and thanks again everyone!",

I've seen some stuff (specifically over family illness) and it's got me questioning.\n\nI'm also about of a history nerd. So obviously, the fact that there are so many older religions than Judaism / Christianity puts the old brain into overdrive.\n\nI still kind of want to believe there's a god, just because. I'm also not actually bothered if this is it and then we die. I'm not scared of dying. So..particularly for those of you who had faith. What changed your mind?\n\nI don't know where I'm going to end up. I've asked on the Christian subreddit before and not really had anything satisfactory, so thought I would try here.\n\nI don't know if this makes a difference, but I'm UK based, where religion is probably less of a thing than the US.\n\nEdit to say: thank you for engaging. It's  really interesting to number of responses. Most have been really thoughtful and engaging. So e have been aggressive and off-putting.\n\nWhat I will say, interestingly, is that you have engaged me far more than a Christian group I reached out to a little while ago (when I was in a pretty bad place). \n\nThanks for engaging with me. I've had far more responses than I can engage with. But up appreciate them all! (Even the aggressive ones... It tells me something)",

Im not a lawyer but it seems like we should file a class action suit to stop it. Anyone know how? \n\nEdit: so apparently \"class action\" is not the correct type of suit. Perhaps there is a different type of legal action we can take? For those recommending legal action groups, appreciate it, but they need plaintiffs. So perhaps that is part of the action. What I am generally after is we should be organizing for the coming attack and legal action is stage one.",

      "text": "I remember it like it was yesterday. It was 1998, so I was 7 years old and my mother took me to the mall movie theater to see The Prince of Egypt. I remember the blue tile and green curtains. That I was holding my mother's hand. I remember the disclosure that is displayed before the film starts:\n\n\"While artistic and historical license has been taken, we believe that this film is true to the essence, values and integrity of a story that is a cornerstone of faith for millions of people worldwide.\"\n\nI also remember loving the movie. It was gorgeously animated and heart wrenching. It showcased man's cruelty and greed so beautifully. The music was excellent. It was just a polished movie through and through.\n\nBut then I remember I didn't love it any more. Just minutes before the movie's climax and conclusion, I found myself sobbing and covering my eyes. I was horrified more than I'd ever been from an intentionally scary movie.\n\nGod was *killing babies*.\n\nI saw a toddler carrying a ceramic pot through a doorway. Then God swoops in and murders that kid and I saw the child's arm fall limp back out of the doorway.\n\nThe scene plays out quietly and with precision. God's ghostly wisps do not hesitate. He flies into cribs, bedrooms, through windows.\n\nThis movie that was supposed to be a story about how God helped the faithful escape the cruelty of the faithless... this movie that was advertised in the first seconds as being true to the essence and values and integrity of a story that is a cornerstone of faith for millions of people...\n\nThis beautiful movie that had charmed me had a scene that established God canonically as a *mass baby murderer*.\n\nThat scene and that movie left a seed of disgust and repulsion for the Christian God in me. Over the next decade or so, it provided the wiggle room for asking questions of whether God really is \"good\". The problem of evil, etc.\n\nIf not for The Prince of Egypt, I may have grown into a perfectly content and faithful Christian. But I could not and could never love a baby murderer.\n\nFrankly, if there is a God, and the story of Moses is true, I'd hate that God.",

      "text": "I was diagnosed with stage 4 breast cancer in early 2020, and I've been on various treatments, which don't seem to be working as well as they used to. I've mostly made peace with it, but some of my religious friends and family have some surprising anxiety over my salvation before I die. \n\nI'm not particularly bothered by it. I was raised Christian, but I don't have any major belief in this or any other religion. I'm not a spiritual person, and I don't particularly care to speculate how consciousness continues without neurons or a brain.\n\nIt's unsettling to me that in the past 2 months 3 different people have found it necessary to ask me whether I believe in demons. No, that's not a typo. Demons. I... I don't wanna insult anybody here, but come on. Demons?\n\nAll 3 of these people are Christian. My initial reaction used to be like, \"Do you also believe in Jinn from Islamic faith?\" But ever since the cancer stuff, I feel less militant about my atheism, like, \"just live and let live, man.\" I don't feel the energy or need to argue or make my point.\n\n\"You just want to think you know everything. You have an answer for everything and a question for everything...\" I'm just tired, people. I'm not searching for answers. I don't wanna fight or argue. I'm not all that curious to know. It's okay not to know.\n\nWhy do Christians insist that atheists wanna know everything when we're not the ones claiming to know anything? Whyyy is my illness so painful to them? It's okay not to be afraid. It's okay to just have peace at the end of my lifetime, but some of them don't seem to agree with that.\n\nIt's like they want me to be more afraid, or something like that. I've kind of read some stuff about stoicism, which has helped my anxiety a lot, but Christians I know seem to think philosophy and psychology are tools of \"the devil\" not unlike science.\n\nI love some of these Christians, you know? I don't want my last days/years to be spent arguing with or avoiding them. I'm still (mostly) healthy, and I still have time to enjoy a lot. But a few of my Christian loved ones keep treating me like I'm on death's door and gotta hurry up and \"repent.\"\n\nSorry, I know I'm mainly just venting. Life is too short to sit around thinking of Heaven and demons. I may as well start worrying about fairies and werewolves too while I'm at it. They get so insulted when I say that though. I just mean to keep it light.\n\nI'm starting a new treatment later this month, and someone in my family has offered to come with me for the first infusion, and I admit I'd love to not have to be alone my first time, but if they do, I'll quite possibly be a captive audience, unable to walk away due to being hooked up to an IV bag of chemo. \n\nAs time goes on, and as I get more medicated, this talk about demons could scare me later at some point while I'm under the influence of narcotics and such. I don't wanna end up afraid. Should I just go alone and have some peace and quiet? My therapist urges me to get more interpersonal support.\n\nWhat would you do?",

A lack of faith is often tragically accompanied by the loss of meaning in life, the neglect of mercy, appalling violations of human dignity, the crisis of the family and so many other wounds that afflict our society.*\n\n\n\n*Today, too, there are many settings in which Jesus, although appreciated as a man, is reduced to a kind of charismatic leader or superman. This is true not only among non-believers but also among many baptized Christians, who thus end up living, at this level, in* ***a state of de facto atheism***\\*.\\*",

      "text": "For those of you who were once theists, what was the first domino that fell in your faith, resulting in you starting your deconstruction?\n\nFor me, while I never really believed in the first place, the first domino to fall in me wanting to be a Christian was how you could have this massive book that is supposed to be the inerrant word of God, yet you could take 5 different Christians, ask them to interpret the meaning of any part it, and they'd come back with 5 different answers.\n\nAnd they'd all say they'd prayed and fasted over it and had been directed by God himself to that conclusion, so that would indicate that God isn't being cohesive enough for humans.\n\nAnd this leads to a logical problem. Either God wrote the Bible(or any other scripture) to be incoherent, and couldn't change it, meaning that he isn't omnipotent, or he wrote the scripture like that and didn't care to make it more cohesive, meaning that he isn't omnibenevolent, given the amount of lives that have been ruined or lost over ancient scripture.\n\nBut when I ended up being very confused on what God was expecting of me, with the fate of burning in hell for all of eternity potentially being at stake if the dogma was true, I started to understand that the answer I received would depend more on *who* I asked than *what* I asked. I realized there was no reliable method for reaching any objective truth about anything written in those pages because \"God\" was telling everyone either what they wanted to hear or what they'd been told they needed to hear.\n\nIt was all about trusting that the people you asked happen to be right, and the people who disagree with them happen to be wrong; basically a metaphor for religion in itself. That realization really rocked the foundations of my slight faith and while it didn't make me proclaim that I was an atheist that day, it got the ball rolling, and boy, did it roll.\n\nIf the house of cards came tumbling down for you at some point, which card was the first to go?\n\nAlso, if you are interested, you could join r/AskBlackAtheists.",

      "text": "Trump is rich, boastful, vengeful, and dishonest, aren’t these things Jesus condemns? Why do American Christians love him?\n\nCollected a few points\n\n**Wealth and Materialism**\n\nJesus warned about the dangers of wealth:\n\"It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for someone who is rich to enter the kingdom of God.\" (Matthew 19:24)\n\nTrump openly flaunts his wealth, making it a key part of his identity.\n\n**Pride and Arrogance**\n\nThe modern version of Christianity values humility, yet Trump is famously boastful:\n\n\"For all those who exalt themselves will be humbled, and those who humble themselves will be exalted.\" (Luke 14:11)\n\nHis speeches and self-praise contradict the Christian ideal of modesty.\n\n**Lack of Forgiveness and Compassion**\n\nJesus preached mercy and forgiveness:\n\n\"Love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you.\" (Matthew 5:44)\n\nTrump often seeks revenge, insults critics, and rarely admits wrongdoing.\n\n**Dishonesty and Falsehoods**\n\nThe Bible condemns lying:\n\n\"Do not lie to each other, since you have taken off your old self with its practices.\" (Colossians 3:9)\n\nTrump has a well-documented history of making false statements.\n\n**Lack of Sexual Morality**\n\nChristianity promotes faithfulness and self-control:\n\n\"But among you there must not be even a hint of sexual immorality, or of any kind of impurity.\" (Ephesians 5:3)\n\nTrump's history of affairs, crude remarks, and objectification of women contradict this.\n\n**Greed and Love of Money**\n\nThe Bible warns against prioritising wealth:\n\n\"For the love of money is a root of all kinds of evil.\" (1 Timothy 6:10)\n\nTrump often emphasises money, deals, and financial success above all.\n\nIt seems I have a knack for digging up Bible quotes. Last time, [it was about God](https://old.reddit.com/r/atheism/comments/1ihebxu/discussing_the_bibles_darkest_moments_over_a_pint/). This time, it’s about Trump and why he’s the least Christian Christian leader.\n\n--------\n\nEDIT: wow, thanks for all the attention, RIP inbox\n\nI’ve read a lot of responses, but not all of them (it’s just impossible at this point)\n\nWhile my post might seem more rhetorical than an actual question, I was genuinely curious. I’ve never been to the US, and the Christians I know, who seem to be genuine believers, absolutely can’t stand Trump. I don’t personally know a single person who likes him, so this whole phenomenon has always puzzled me.\n\nSomeone linked this article:\n\nhttps://www.vox.com/identities/2018/3/5/16796892/trump-cyrus-christian-right-bible-cbn-evangelical-propaganda\n\nI think it gives a solid explanation that helps me understand the mindset behind his Christian support. \n\nIn brief:\n\n* Many American Christians don’t see Trump as a good Christian but as a modern-day Cyrus the Great—a flawed, non-believing leader whom God is using for a greater purpose\n\n* Right-wing Christian media actively pushes this narrative, reinforcing the idea that Trump is chosen by God.\nFor many, supporting Trump isn’t about personal morality but about getting results on issues like abortion, religious freedom, and conservative judges\n\n* Some evangelicals feel America is in moral decline and believe they need a strongman to fight for their values, even if he’s personally flawed\n\n* The focus is more on power and influence rather than individual piety\n\nThis perspective makes a lot of sense to me now, although I feel it's a tad sad. Thank you all for all the answers!",

I couldn't see how it was possible for \"God\" to be all-knowing, all-powerful, present everywhere, and be loving, AND for Sandy Hook to still happen--when the smallest thing could possibly have prevented the tragedy.  Then I read the Havard Step study, as a heart patient myself, which basically proved prayer doesn't work.  Finally, COVID solidified things for me--specifically the Christian anti-vaxxers whose \"prayer warriors united\" but they still died horrible deaths, even as they were the most \"faithful.\"  Websites like Sorry Antivaxxer and FB groups like the Herman Cain Awards were enough for me to become 100% atheist.\n\nJust wondering if there are any similar journeys like mine?",

I hate that churches lie about this. What happens is that you stay in church for a LONG time. Then everyone around you speak as if everything they say is 100% fact. Then you go on for years never questioning anything. Since you’ve been in the church for long the you should know better than to question the church\n\nIt becomes inconceivable to voice your doubt at some point.

      "title": "Watching Christians support Trump has officially made me realize there is no God. ",
      "text": "I was raised in a VERY Christian household. We went to a Methodist church and Sunday school on Sunday mornings. Then we would drive about 30 min to go to an Assembly of God church on Sunday and Wednesday nights. And my parents were heavily involved in a prayer group that met Friday nights. Plus anything else either church had going on. I spent most of my childhood either at church or church activities.\n\nWhat I thought Christians believed is that God is love. That the love of money is the root of all evil. That a person's heart is shown by the fruits of their spirit. Those are love, joy, peace, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, and self control. That lying is an abomination of God. That Jesus taught to follow the laws of man and God. And most importantly, to love and do unto others as you would want done to you.\n\nThe fact that Trump is unapologetically proud to be the literal opposite of all of these values, and yet Christians are convinced he is the Christian salvation of America, proves to me that there is no divine spirit, or \"God\". If there was a God, would he not speak this truth to the Christian leaders of this country? Would he not speak to the hearts of the pastors who are supposedly speaking on behalf of God? \n\nWatching all of this unfold over the last couple of years has just solidified for me, that there is no God speaking to anyone. I have just seen, in real time with my own family, how easily people can be brainwashed and manipulated into disregarding all of the values that they supposedly believe in and live by. These are very scary times.",

It is:\n\n\n✔ A loaded question – It assumes that taxation and prosperity are mutually exclusive.\n✔ A historical distortion – It ignores periods where higher taxes coincided with economic growth.\n✔ A rhetorical trap – It frames taxation as inherently harmful, disregarding its role in public investment and stability.\n\n\nLet’s completely dismantle this question and expose its bad-faith intent.\n\n\n\n🔥 Step 1: Flip the Burden of Proof – “Name a Time When Tax Cuts Alone Led to Lasting Prosperity”\n\n\n✔ 🔥 You:\n\n\n“You’re implying taxation is always bad for the economy—so name a time when massive tax cuts alone led to long-term prosperity for everyone.”\n\n\n✔ 🔥 You:\n\n\n“Reagan’s tax cuts led to a ballooning deficit and wage stagnation. Bush’s tax cuts led to more inequality. Trump’s tax cuts exploded the debt and primarily benefited the rich. So tell me, when did tax cuts create lasting prosperity?”\n\n\n✔ 🔥 You:\n\n\n“If cutting taxes is the key to prosperity, why did the economy crash after Bush’s tax cuts but thrive under Clinton’s higher taxes?”\n\n\n🚨 Why This Works:\n\n\n✔ It exposes that tax cuts alone don’t guarantee prosperity.\n✔ It forces them to confront real-world economic failures caused by reckless tax cuts.\n\n\n\n🔥 Step 2: Call Out the False Premise – Taxes Fund the Economy, They Don’t Kill It\n\n\n✔ 🔥 You:\n\n\n“Who do you think funds roads, schools, and infrastructure? Low taxes didn’t build the U.S. highway system—taxes did.”\n\n\n✔ 🔥 You:\n\n\n“When tax rates on the wealthy were highest in the 1940s-1960s, we had one of the most prosperous middle classes in history. Why?”\n\n\n✔ 🔥 You:\n\n\n“Name a time when slashing taxes on the rich increased wages, improved infrastructure, and balanced the budget. You can’t.”\n\n\n\n🚨 Why This Works:\n\n\n✔ It dismantles the idea that taxation is purely negative.\n\n\n✔ It forces them to acknowledge the economic role of taxation in growth and stability.\n\n\n🔥 Step 3: Provide Historical Evidence of High-Tax Prosperity\n\n\n✔ 🔥 You:\n\n\n“The 1950s and 1960s saw a booming middle class with a 91% top marginal tax rate. Were we not prosperous then?”\n\n\n✔ 🔥 You:\n\n\n“Clinton raised taxes in the 1990s, and the economy thrived with record job growth and a budget surplus. So was that not prosperity?”\n \n\n✔ 🔥 You:\n\n\n“Post-WWII America saw massive government investment in infrastructure, education, and industry, all funded by high taxes. Did that not create prosperity?”\n\n\n🚨 Why This Works:\n\n\n✔ It presents undeniable evidence that high taxes and economic growth have coexisted.\n✔ It forces them to explain why they ignore history.\n\n\n🔥 Step 4: Shut Down the Talking Point as Disingenuous\n\n\n✔ 🔥 You:\n\n\n“This is just a trick question designed to ignore history. Taxation isn’t about ‘prosperity’ in a vacuum—it’s about funding the things that create prosperity.”\n\n\n\n✔ 🔥 You:\n“Your question assumes taxation is inherently bad, but every major economy uses taxes to fund growth. Are you saying every country in the world is wrong?”\n\n\n\n✔ 🔥 You:\n“This is just Reaganomics repackaged. And we already saw how that turned out—stagnant wages, rising inequality, and exploding deficits.”\n\n\n\n🚨 Why This Works:\n\n\n✔ It exposes the question as a rhetorical trap, not an honest debate point.\n✔ It forces them to acknowledge the actual role of taxation.\n\n\n\n🔥 Final Verdict: The Question is a Bad-Faith Trap, Not an Honest Economic Argument\n\n\n✔ Taxes have historically funded economic growth, infrastructure, and public services.\n✔ High-tax periods have coincided with economic booms and a thriving middle class.\n✔ Massive tax cuts have historically benefited the rich while worsening inequality and deficits.\n✔ The question is designed to ignore all nuance and falsely equate taxation with economic failure.\n\n\n\n🚨 Bottom Line: The moment you expose this as a trick question based on historical ignorance, their argument collapses.\n\n**Edit 2** \n\nWow, I didn't realize how many of my fellow americans have become so jaded because of trumps BS.  Its going to be okay everyone. We will get through this. If you want hope, look up what an Extinction Burst is in psychology. MAGA is an extinction burst for white supremacy and male dominance\n\n**Edit 3**\n\nI will ask the mods if I can make a post just for the PDF, so it can be used by anyone.\n\n**Edit 4**\n\nUntil I get a response back from the mods, here is the [PDF](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1WnIknS-5XfdaN3i1LWNrT_SD0SK_UNzP/view?usp=sharing)\n\n**Edit 5** \n\nHere is the [list!](https://www.reddit.com/r/atheism/comments/1istqm1/here_is_the_list_of_maga_arguments_i_compiled_to/)",

      "text": "I left the Christian faith and don't want to talk about religion anymore with anybody, but somehow I found myself debating with a theist the other day. This person said that I was wrong to believe in science but not god. He said that believing in science also needs faith, because I didn't witness scientist making the experiments, I am not a scientist so I don't understand the intricacies of their research, I just believe in their accounts, etc. His message was that if I believe in their accounts, I should also believe in the Bible, etc., since they both equally require belief and that it's a double standard to say religion requires faith to believe in it while saying believing in science doesn't require faith.\n\n\n\nI was not ready for this challenge and had never heard this argument before, but I knew this was bullshit and completely outrageous. I countered saying that science provides proof and if I really wanted to, I could attend clinical drug trials and see how drugs work on certain patients, how the process is documented to FDA standards, etc. But I was countered saying I cannot see the drug molecules acting and it still takes faith to believe the drugs work, same with the Bible, etc. I was told that the proof science provides is just a story, that it is just someone's idea and not necessarily the truth.\n\n\n\nI was quite angry at this bullshit and I knew this line of reasoning is garbage. Now after the fact, I am thinking I should have countered with Sagan's standard (extraordinary claims require extraordinary proof): science does not make any claims outside of physical reality. It simply describes how things work. Yes, some are models or theories, but it is our best understanding and if anyone wants to challenge them, they are more than welcome to bring in their idea of how things work. This is how science works and has always worked. Religion on the other hand makes the extraordinary claim that a whole world outside of the physical realm exists and that there is this thing called god that has there unbelievable powers. Such claim is extraordinary and requires extraordinary proof. In the absence of any proof at all, then there is \"faith\". This is not the case with science.\n\n\n\nStill, I believe there are better and stronger arguments against this \"science requires faith, too!\" nonsense. How would you counter this?",

      "text": "I was randomly watching this exchange between Charlie Kirk the conservative and a rando college student [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ozfac2VFPmc).\n\nI saw this grown man outside just chilling, yelling his opinions at what appears to be college aged teens/YAs.\n\nHe asserted the usual suspects:\n\n1. Can science disprove the existence of an afterlife?\n2. You can't explain what started the big bang. I say god did it based on faith. You believe God didn't do it based, not on evidence (since you can't explain), so by definition faith. Thus Atheist = Christians as they both rely on faith.\n3. How do atheists explain the origin of the universe if not through God?\n4. If the universe had a beginning with the Big Bang, doesn't that prove there must be a God to start it?\n5. What created god if he created the universe? God is everything - the alpha and the omega so he always existed.\n\nI was listening to this and was agitated. It occurred to me it was somewhat difficult to answer these on the spot as many years elapsed since astrobiology, writing down all atheist positions with answers, Intro to philosophy back in undergrad over 12 years back.\n\nI couldn't believe in deities or the religious position due to multitude of things: 1.) mass religious text plagiarism (all have great floods, many have immaculate conception, etc.) 2) Engineering inefficiencies - why create billions of trillions of planets for a single one, 3.)ontological arguments - e.g. can God turn number 4 into the color yellow? 5.)Problem of gratuitous evil (floods, hurricanes, earthquakes kill innocent people - nothing to do w/ free will), 6.) There's just better secular answers to everything supposedly caused by supernatural forces (HAAD, credibility enhancing displays, prob stats explains miracles) 7.) law of non-contradiction. There's no way EVERY one TRUE religion can be correct. There were over 20k religions throughout history and 14k denominations of Christianity alone.\n\nQuestions:\n\n1. Do you all even \"prep\" for an eventual encounter in which you'll have to defend your religious position?\n2. Do you \"always know what to say back\"?\n3. How important is it to you to be able to \"Debate\" people who pompously assert the validity of the God hypothesis, etc.",

      "text": "Hey! Casual conversation, I just wanted to get some input from anyone that feels so inclined. \n\nI recently moved from Canada to the USA. In my 30+ years of being Canadian I have never been approached by anyone to talk about God or Jesus, other than the occasional person suffering from clear profound mental health challenges on the street. \n\nI have been here in the USA for a whole 40 hours and I  was approached in a Target to talk about God/Faith. I politely declined by stating \"oh no thank you, I'm atheist so that's not my thing. Have a good one!\" As I slowly walked backwards in fear. Frankly all my interactions with people asking me about God are mentally unstable so being unconfrontational is usually the best course of action and to move on. But after the interaction I really got thinking.... Is this going to be a normal thing here? The person that asked me was clearly mentally stable, well put together and made a point to go seek out people in the target. \n\nI just wanted to get some feedback if there are other Canadians who have moved to the USA who found this. Also for Americans, is this a normal thing or was this just something random that happened that I shouldn't really expect? Do you guys confront them or run away like I did?  (For reference, I've moved to Southern California)\n\nI just want to prepare myself as Ive never had to deal with this sort of thing before and I'll be honest... It kind of scares me. I grew up in an Atheist house hold and frankly I feel quite ignorant on how to deal with these people.\n\nThanks!!",

I remember going to project 2025 website and it was a recruitment site for you to get prescreened to work in the new govt. I thought that was strange. But it makes sense now. Step 3 Ignore the Courts - attack Madison v Marbury, the supreme court decision that said the supreme court interprets the constitution and can strike down laws that are unconstitutional! It's the one case that gives the supreme court power beyond being just an advisory board. But the supreme court already gutted some of their power by saying the president is immune from criminal prosecution for official acts and a presumption of immunity for all other acts. Step 4 only allow those to run for Congress that are loyal to Trump. Step 5 centralize police and federalize the national guard. Step 6 shut down independent media and end the independence of universities/colleges. Step 7 turn out mobs. This is their plan. And now I sound crazy because it is. But they are doing it and it's out in the open and not enough people are paying attention. \n\nTrump is using Christianity. He is co-opting the faith and changing it to be cruel. It’s easy to have a Christian justify murder and suffering as justifiable because that is part of their dogma. Trump and JD Vance can’t do their plan without Christians- they are his base. \n\nhttps://youtu.be/5RpPTRcz1no?si=n_6EWclEd5RgFQ0Z\n\n\nWatch this YouTube!",

He reacted so emotionally about a simple economic concept, frustrated and angry that I would even DARE to question what Trump said. Refused to listen, kept interrupting saying things like \"that's wrong\", and refusing to explain why. Finally said \"i don't care, Trump is always right\".

      "text": "Sorry I will have to vent a little...\n\nLifelong Christian here that is slowly becoming an atheist. I was all-in for God. I even went to a Bible college and now feel stupid. I wasted so many years of my life. I feel so stupid and betrayed. I am so stupid that I trusted a God that probably is not even real. I think I was living in a dream world with rosy glasses on. I debated atheists in the past and thought I had it all figured out... Somehow I was not even bothered by all the contradictions in the Bible and ignored that God must be a f*cking assh*le for allowing all the suffering in this world. \n\nSo what happened to me? I trusted God too much with a decision. Heck, without God I would have decided differently. \"I took a step in faith.\" Everything went so f*cking wrong that at first I was so convinced that only Satan could arrange for something like this. But then I started to question my faith because I ended up severely depressed. And what is a core symptom of depression? Hopelessness. And this hit me. Without hope my faith was gone. Sure with depression there are a lot of cognitive distortions but regarding God and the Bible I never saw more clearly. I woke up. I looked behind the curtain. I don't think there's a way back for me. \n\nCurious if some had a similar experience. Depression is a b*tch but seems to be f*cking useful to wake up from religion. My life is f*cked up anyway and I am not able to work anymore. I am a fool who trusted God.",

Or like if a child tries to tell their parent who otherwise is fairly open minded and all the sudden the parent becomes annoyed and is like \"You think you know everything but one day you'll accept that God is real and you aren't greater than Him.\" Stuff like that is a form of psychological abuse to me because you're basically gaslighting your child into thinking they're a bad person for genuinely not relating to your religion at all.",

I said yes to a degree, everyone had some form of faith regardless of whether they believe in a deity or not. However, looking back, I sort of take my answer back.\n\nAs far as I remember, I interpreted the definition of faith as believing in something without scientific evidence. When I googled a textbook definition of faith, it just said something around the lines of \"strong belief into something\" which I agree people have. Example, I have faith in my friend that he will pass his coding test he studied hard for. However, wouldn't that just be belief? Because it's not faith—in a sense that there was a pattern of my friend passing his previous tests. So my belief he will pass is from predetermined successful scenarios where he DID pass.\n\nSo is, essentially, faith still universal in that sense or its not? \n\nAnd then my professor quoted something Riched Niebuhr related about faith being an ideal thing or transcendent value\n\nAt this point this is insane brain fart, idk if I'm making sense.\n\nWhat does faith really mean? Is it true even atheists and agnostics have faith?? Am I wrong about what defines faith?\n\nTLDR: WHAT\n\n\nEdit: BRAIN FARTING AGAIN!!! Discussion stated that love and faith go together. So essentially???????? Faith exists???? What?? I'm confused\n\n\nAlso this is like a Christian class since my school is a Catholic school and its a needed subject to take regardless of ur religious denomination",

I said that, from a practical perspective, christianity spread so easily because it was mostly a religion of peace much like buddhism (at far as I know). Of course, christianity reached far away thanks to the preaching of the apostles, I can't deny that. My brother then said that their martyrdom was a big catalyst for christianity to further spread, arguing that if their faith was so powerful they willingly died in horrible ways defending it, then they surely must've seen something. \"Nobody risks their lives preaching a religion that, for ancient people, gave no material reward\". \nI don't believe in none of that mumbo jumbo because logically it doesn't make sense that every other religion has their own martyrs who died in equally horroble ways defendind their faiths, but these died for the real deal. In my opinion, the apostles endured those horrible faiths because they firmly believed in a set of values that were proven to work in ancient times, something worth dying for a better future. Of course, the apostles could've really believed in what they said because Jesus was most likely a real guy, but we know too little about him outside of the bible to be sure of what he actually did. It all comes down to faith, and as some of us know, one should't live only with faith.",

It would be foolish to publish it as someone with no actual “education” so I look forward to working towards that title at least, even if I think it’s unnecessary. \n\nAnyways I love religious studies because not only do I learn the history of religions, but also why people think the way they do. It’s almost like studying psychology - it is fascinating how things like cognitive dissonance and placebo affect take place in nearly every religious person’s life. \n\nI also find it interesting because I see it in my own family - I could thrust so much evidence in my father’s face supporting evolution and he will somehow always find a way to deny it. \n\nI don’t think a book will magically fix that but by god it will help to have just a solid text of logic, reasoning, and facts supporting atheism. It will mostly consist of “logical” arguments, rather than actual science numbers and facts (cause let’s be honest, religious people don’t care about facts anyways). For example I tackle issues like the existence of human souls, heaven and hell, the existence of Satan, etc. rather than “How carbon dating works”, although the book may benefit from a few chapters like that. \n\nAnyways just wondering if anyone else loves religious studies too. I’m sure it’s somewhat popular in atheists too!",

      "text": "Thought I should post this here since I think you guys will get a kick out of this one:\n\nSo I (the atheist in question) and my best friend (let’s call her Jane, she’s a Born Again Christian) have been friends for nearly two decades. We have always known we have very opposing views when it comes to spirituality but have always respected each other in that regard. Recently, we have both been going through some hard time in our lives. Just after graduating from a medical program, I was diagnosed with a condition that has rendered me disabled and unable to work. Jane lost her dad to cancer, which was a blow to both our friends and family. \n\nA few months after his passing, I noticed a sudden shift in Jane’s behavior. She became more outspoken about her faith, in some ways that made me uncomfortable. I understood that this was her way of grieving so I thought nothing of it. I meet up with her to catch up on things when she suddenly caught me off guard by telling me that she wanted to end the friendship. Stunned, I asked her why. Did I do something wrong? Was it something I said? She said it was none of those things. She said that she’s been experiencing a sudden revival of her faith and was taking it more seriously. She said that it was because of my difficult upbringing (I experienced child abuse) and recent incurable diagnosis that she thought it was best to end the friendship/distance herself from me (she apparently couldn’t decide what she wanted to do) because it was hindering her growth in her spiritual journey. She said I have so many problems in my life because I live in sin and continuously choose to not let God into my life. She said that my body is sick and that I can’t seem to find a cure not matter what doctor or therapist I go to because sin is living in my body. She even had the nerve to tell me to forgive my mother (the source of the abuse), which was appalling to me because I confided that information in her over the years and she was so supportive to it then. But now? Suddenly she’s done a one-eighty on me. I was in such a state of shock I couldn’t find the words to defend myself, in all honesty. I left her house sobbing. I haven’t cried that hard in a long time. Im at one of the lowest points in my life and you decide to tell me that I made myself sick? Better yet—that I DESERVE it? By the way, she thought by telling me this that it would somehow convince me to become a Christian. It did the exact opposite. It made me firmly plant my heels even harder into the ground that I am PROUD to be an atheist. \n\nBut don’t worry. The outrage finally kicked in and I finally confronted her about it. I ended the friendship for good, I made the decision for her. I’m still so angry about it, I can’t even begin to describe it. I feel so fucking betrayed. \n\nEdit: Hey all, just wanted to come in here and say thank you to everyone for the overwhelming support. It has helped easy the pain as I grieve. Many of you have shared similar stories like mine. I’m sorry for those of you that have experienced that, sending virtual hugs to everyone 🫂 ❤️",

Mostly I let it be at that point since I feel like that's a win.\n\nHitchens used to say that even if you could get to deism, you still have all the work ahead of you to get to a particular religion.  That strikes me as a bit of a concession that it's harder to disprove a general deist position (which it is).  When I've watched old Hitchens debates around the \"cosmological argument\" and stuff, they're so boring. No zingers like with pointing out scripture.\n\nAnyway, how do you handle the \"spiritual not religious\" claim?",

These arguments (much like Rick Santorum’s back in the day) are based on the lie that the United States is a Christian nation.\n\nThat is a flat out lie.\n\nThe United States was established as a secular nation. That was done for a couple of reasons. First, King George of England, who was also the head of the Anglican Church, used that church to spy on colonialists during the revolutionary war. Also, the founders were very aware of the destruction caused by the religious wars of Europe, including the 30 years war and the inquisition. The inquisition is very important to remember in this instance, because the inquisition prosecuted thought crimes. Simply put, it was illegal to think you could be any other religion besides Catholic. \n\nThought crimes are blatantly unamerican. And yet, this allegedly closeted gay Republican senator wants to bend the freedom from religion clause to fit his political agenda of subservience upon the American people. \nI got two words for Josh: FUCK YOU.\n\nhttps://www.peoplefor.org/rightwingwatch/sen-josh-hawley-says-us-being-destroyed-secular-spiritual-oppression",

They strongly criticize religions like Christianity and Islam, calling them man-made, misleading, and unscientific because they’re based on faith, not proven facts.\n\nBut surprisingly, these same people strongly believe in African spirituality. They say it’s advanced science, that it involves communication with nature, and that it holds special knowledge only understood by a few. Some even believe African traditions had ways of making or stopping rain long before modern science developed cloud seeding.\n\nSo the question is: How can someone reject Abrahamic religions for being faith-based, but then fully support African spirituality, which is also based on belief and not proven science?",

      "text": "There need to be a category for people who call themselves \"Spiritual\". Like seriously wtf does that even mean, (Spiritual)?\n\nI came across one of those Spiritual YouTube channels. It was a very popular channel. The YouTuber was using his \"spiritual\" views to promote anti LGBTQ BS towards the Rapper Lil Nas X. Saying that kids shouldn't be seeing men kiss other men.\n\nThere are two things that frustrates me the most with spiritual people.\n\n1: Spiritual people are so vague about what they believe in. It's hard to pinpoint their beliefs. It's like they combined a bunch of different Religions into one inconsistent Religion, that makes Christianity look like a poster child for Religion consistency. \n\n2: Spiritual people often like to separate themselves from Religion. Saying that they are nothing like Religious people. Despite a lot of spiritual people believing in a lot of woo woo concepts, conspiracy theories, or anti LGBTQ talking points like the YouTuber I brought up. So they basically have the same beliefs as Religious folks.\n\nI could be wrong here. But here's my theory though.\n\nI think Spiritual people don't become Christians or Muslims, because they are lazy. They don't want to follow strict rules. But they won't automatically become atheists though, since that's too nihilistic to them lol. Spiritual folks still want to believe in the supernatural, or even agree with certain beliefs in Christianity or Islam. So they make up their own rules, in a way where they can pretty much just have their cake and eat it too.\n\nIn conclusion.\n\nThe reason why I make this post. Because I won't be surprised if some people think we don't have to worry about people who call themselves \"spiritual\", since they are not problematic like Religious people. When in reality they are problematic.",

      "title": "The thoughts of an atheist in rural Texas on the current state of MAGA.",
      "text": "For a little background on myself, I am a rural Texan and atheist. I concede that much of this is purely anecdotal and coming from my own personal experience, but I believe it to be sound commentary on how MAGA is reacting and will react to the renewed Epstein controversy. I do not buy into this perspective some misguided people will tell you where \"the fissures are opening in MAGA! The cracks are widening! The walls are closing in!\"\n\nUgh...\n\nI keep seeing liberals/progressives/leftists sharing content on multiple social media platforms pushing this notion that this Epstein controversy will divide and destroy MAGA, and I do not believe this will be the case. Let's just put aside that these people have ignored massive red flags, day after day, for a decade. They ignored all the incompetence, corruption and scandals before, and I do not see how this will be any different than some of that short-lived hesistation we saw just after January 6th. Sure, the Espstein stuff is a doozy and MAGA influencers seem to be scattered on the topic but I do not think it will stick in the long term. 90% of my county, and the surrounding counties, all voted for Trump all 3 times. The churches here were all adorned with Trump flags and signs, an act that was technically a violation of their tax exempt status, but under this new regime it is legal as of this past week.\n\nDespite the MAGA fascist insistence that I don't really understand their agenda, I believe I do because I am up to my elbows in them and have been my entire life. Given this is an atheist discussion group I won't fixate on the hypernationalist or prejudicial component of MAGA, it is certainly there, but it is the religious fanaticism that really captures these people, and it doesn't matter that Trump couldn't name a single Bible verse if his life depended on it. Even I can do that, John 3:16 is the default. \n\nMAGA is a religion, and having a pedo religious leader hasn't stopped them before. Let's not fool ourselves with wishful thinking that they are even capable of genuine permanent change because their beliefs pre-date Trump, he is just a messianic figure within those beliefs. Trump isn't the disease, he is a terminal symptom. That image of Trump raising his fist over his head with blood trailing across his face is in their same regard as a depiction of a crucified white Jesus. These people genuinely believe the divine hand of God protected Trump from that bullet, but not the firefighter who lost his life that day.\n\nThese people have been brainwashed to be this way for precisely this very moment since the day they took their first steps as toddlers. From day one they have been taught that \"the experts are all wrong\" about evolution, cosmology, climate science, history, race, economics and everything in between. \nThey have been on a steady diet of right wing propaganda on AM radio, cable news and in the last couple decades the more toxic far right sphere of influence online. They were molded during their formative and developmental years to be this way. I myself only narrowly escaped the same fate because I read a lot, and might even owe my progressive attitudes to Star Trek. The vast majority of them do not read, will not ever read, and maybe even can't read. Their delusions were hard baked into their very being since conception.  This didn't begin when Trump entered politics by claiming Obama was really born in Kenya and a secret Muslim who was going to install shariah law. \n\nThis saga of idiocy has been going on since at least Reagan turned the Evangelical churches into a wing of the Republican Party, if not since very beginning of written human history. Some younger folks might not remember the political environment of the GQP when Trump ran for the 2012 RNC primary, with his only major press endorsement coming from the National Enquirer, I'm not joking. The build up to Trump was insane before he \"came down the escalator.\" Even over a decade later the public was still reeling from the 9/11 attacks, and every country music song turned from ballads about the blue collar worker into cringeworthy patriotic slop about eagles, flags, God and the troops! At the time it seemed hard to imagine the absurdity of the Republican Party could get any worse with the introduction of the Tea Party, Glenn Beck and Tucker Carlson. There were these constant hysterics about Obama's plan to have door-to-door gun confiscations, shariah law, martial law, and ACORN youth brigades. These right wing loons believed there were FEMA camps under Walmarts where white Christians would be held in concentration camps. Sarah Palin who had just lost the election as John McCain's running mate was all over Fox News claiming there would be Obamacare death panels. Texas governor Greg Abbott activated the state guard to investigate the Jade Helm military exercise because he thought there was a chance Obama was using the military to invade our state to arrest Republican officials. That didn't age well since Trump has done basically that himself in varying blue areas. Equally as hypocritical these nuts thought Obama was mishandling Ebola and risking a pandemic. My personal favorite is when this proto-MAGA believed curtains that Jakie Kennedy put in the White House many decades before were really Obama's Islamic prayer rugs. From claims of a Planned Parenthood fetus deli to accusations of Justice Scalia being assassinated, this is just a small taste of the absolute God damn meltdown these people were having under Obama and are still having.\n\nDespite exactly none of their predictions coming true they just kept believing one giant whopper after the next, each bogus headline was like another Seventh Seal being broken. The four horsemen are always at the gates of 'Murica for these neo-reactionaries.  Never has there been a people so wrong in perpetuity. Their fear mongering propaganda nurtured their beliefs that the end times prophesied in Revelations was here, and Trump is their salvation. \n\nIf anything, what we are witnessing right now as it relates to Trump's involvement with Epstein is merely MAGA trying to get their story straight. It is a temporary pause while they regroup and reform. Once the news cycle shifts they will be right back on the Trump train. I have seen these people try to argue that Biden was indeed replaced by a robot-clone, because dear leader said so. From windmill noise cancer to Haitians in Ohio eating dogs, there is no red line for Trump. He can do or say anything and get away with it, even shoot someone on 5th Avenue. He can be a felon, an adjudicated sex offender, a self described dictator who publicly promised to abuse his power and they will not care. He can lie about no cuts to social security or Medicaid, and they will not care even when it comes at their own expense. These people have the self preservation of a fanatical suicide bomber.\n\nA dash of premillennial dispensationalism mixed with a little prosperity gospel and you have the perfect indoctrination to keep lowly peasants in line and unquestioning. With Trump it has reached a level akin to \"the Divine Right Of Kings\" where God himself chose this guy. They believe their very souls are at stake in a \"spiritual war,\" a Jihad all their own. It is their holy crusade only under the red, white and blue banner of old glory.\n\nMost of these people already knew there was a Trump and Epstein connection, and they didn't care. In fact I am to the point where I am dropping usage of the term \"cult\" and using \"religion\" in it's place since I am convinced this will go on and on even after Trump is long gone and buried under some state-religion monument, with a pricey ticket booth at the front gate.\n\nYou can't turn off the decades of delusion these people have been under, no matter what. When you read about mental health care professionals deprogramming patients who have escaped a cult they have to first separate that individual from the cult's influence. How exactly do you remove someone from a cult that is streamed across radio waves, piped into every home in America with cables, and just a keystroke away online?\n\nYou don't. You can't. \n\nThese people cannot be rehabilitated, they aren't going to snap out of it. I live with them and have spent decades trying to reason with them. I don't care how many tik-tok videos you show me of MAGA members fleeing the movement for whatever personal reason, MAGA is never going away just as Mormonism didn't, or any of the Abrahamic mythologies. If they are stupid enough to be on board with MAGA until now then they truly are \"irredeemable deplorables.\"",

      "text": "I was raised in an upper middle class family, went to a good private school, where none of my friends really believed in god. My parents took us to Baptist church on Easter and Xmas Eve and told us god was real. I stopped believing in him when I was around 10, and haven’t since. Around 13 I went through a cringe edgy atheist phase where I became a satanist and heavily looked down upon people who believed in god/ needed that crutch to handle life and their death. I felt morally superior to people who needed to believe they will see their loved ones again and their soul will exist for eternity instead of accepting that this is it and it’s a beautiful thing that this ends. Got very into Camus, and absurdism and nihilism.  \n\nI do now see the biological and historical benefits to ritualistic and repetitive actions like prayer beads, getting up and down to pray. The community singing in a beautiful building, etc. \n\nRecently I have wanted to, not find a purpose but, have started to appreciate and acknowledge the importance of tradition and culture, and your ancestors. That I don’t have to be alone and rational all the time. \n\nThe thing is, I don’t believe in god, hell or heaven. Even though I want to. I first, just don’t believe in the Muslim, Christian, or Jewish idea of god. And I don’t agree with many teachings in the Bible, especially as a woman. And from my cringe edgy days I still hold onto the opinion that you can’t pick and choose parts of the Bible to practice to make it fit your modern life. \n\nI’ve thought about something like Germanic paganism or something , since I am ethnically German and a first generation us citizen on moms side and second gen on dads side. \n\nAny advice? Any personal stories that you can relate? Anything?? \n\nEdit: maybe I need to just start reading more philosophical schools of thought again. One’s on the opposite spectrum from what I’ve always gravitated towards, absurdism/nihilism. I’m going to start meditation and mindfulness. Look into secular Buddhism, and going to attend all the classic religious places of worship to remind myself of my core beliefs. Or take pieces that would help me from them without abandoning logic.",

      "text": "Hello r/atheism,\n\nHow do I \"cure\" my religious/spiritual relapses? \n\nI was once a socially conservative Christian during my teen years, then after no longer experiencing what I interpreted as the presence of God, began to doubt God. Then, I eventually became atheist after processing as many arguments for the non-existence of God as possible. I was then atheist for a couple years.   \n  \nHowever, my yearning for God, prayer, worship was always there, and caused me to relapse back into Christianity. But I was only Christian for a month, and left knowing I was too progressive for all of this. Why did I relapse? I thought by coming back, I could conjure or make God appear, despite how silly it sounds. \n\n**And sadly my life has had this pattern ever since**: be atheist for a while, yearn for mysticism, explore a religion intensively and borderline practice it, before admitting it's all effectively a combination of applied poetry and psychology.   \n  \nWhenever I do this, I border between knowing that I'm just having fun, and wanting to in some sensible way experience the mysticism I once had to slapping my self in the face, and making sure I don't lose myself entirely. It's as if there is residual religious madman in me wanting to explore religion and have fun, and at the same time, a solidly consistent atheist that keeps me safe and in check on my shoulders.\n\n**But I want to bring this cycle to an end**. How do I \"cure\" my religious/spiritual relapses, and finally get to a place where I'm solidly atheist for good? I know deep down, I'm atheist, but there is some part of my mind that's stubborn, and won't let me be the person I know I should be.\n\n**A possible solution I have is that I need something as profound as mysticism, prayer, worship, ritual, and the like, and poetry and photography (hobbies I've explored) just don't reach such highs.**",

      "text": "Spiritual Care\n\nGreetings, I am a board certified clinical chaplain and spiritual counselor. I work in hospice and other spaces in the field of end of life care. I am also certified in Crisis Counseling, Trauma Informed Care, and Mental Health First Aid. I have sat with and helped people through literally the worst moments and circumstances imaginable, including personally bearing witness to hundreds of deaths.\n\nOne of the things I care the most about is serving patients and families who are atheists. Why? Because often they assume they do not need my services, which I understand. A cardinal rule of chaplaincy is to leave when asked. In fact, in most clinical settings, we are the only clinical discipline that patients can just ask to leave. Happy to.\n\nThat being said, the vast majority of the time in which I can take 1-2 minutes to explain what my role can entail with a non-religious person, they invite me to stay. And those visits can be so rich and meaningful, for both of us.\n\nI remember one woman with terminal lung cancer. After announcing that she didn’t “believe in anything” I acknowledged her and promised that my purpose was not to change her mind—at all. She softened. I validated her anxiety over someone like me being in the room. I asked if she’d be willing to hear what I could do for her, and then assured her that afterword I would promptly leave if she desired.\n\nThat interaction was the beginning of a weeks-long relationship through which she was able to talk freely about her spirituality. She shared why she became an atheist, some family stories, her initial anger about her diagnosis, and her hopes and dreams. She was not afraid to die. She asked me to do her funeral and together we planned it out. We found many ways to honor who she was as a human being, acknowledge the beauty of her life, comfort her grieving family, and offer hope in the midst of her death. ALL of it without a single mention of God, the divine, heaven, etc. It is 100% possible for atheists to cultivate a rich spirituality without God. I do my weddings under the same principle.\n\nA good clinical chaplain may not even be religious themselves. Although I am an ordained minister in a liberal, mainline Protestant denomination, I don’t think I would be well-suited for this work if I were super religious. Indeed, while I would not call myself an atheist, as a philosophy major and deeply critical thinker, I draw VERY few conclusions about God and religion, the afterlife, etc. I simply believe that conclusions are unnecessary at best and a hindrance to self-discovery at worst.\n\nMy goal in posting here is simply to raise awareness among your people about the values of giving spiritual care a chance if you find yourself in the hospital, facing a difficult diagnosis, in hospice, etc. Or in other areas of your life.\n\nFinally, your interaction with any chaplain leaves you sour because they proselytized or otherwise did not respect you, please tell your nurse manager or a social worker.\n\nMy other goal in posting is just to start a convo. I welcome folks to share their experiences with spirituality in whatever context. I am not here\nto change anyone’s mind so I won’t engage in arguing or even really any kind of “defense” of what I’ve shared. People have their own good reasons to disagree with me and that is just fine with me.",

I feel like I'm going to be spiritually attacked. \n\nI grew up Christian but at 11 switched to a very basic pagan view point (animism, reincarnation, spirits and gods exist but I don't want to pray to them, no interest in witchcraft). I kept that belief for many years but about 3 years ago I got heavily into researching both buddhism and hinduism. I switched my beliefs back and forth. Is there a soul? No? An ever changing combination of 5 aggregates? Yes? A drop of divinity that will one day rejoin Brahman? I couldn't decide. \n\nI'm feeling very unsafe right now but I don't want to pray to anyone. I wear an iron necklace and sometimes carry salt for spiritual protection. It's just not feeling like enough. \n\nI do get supernatural persecution delusions that aren't based in any religion just creatures I've observed. Sometimes I can admit it's just my brain but I still struggle. Now I don't think it's any threats I've faced before just a general sense of doom like I need spiritual protection. \n\nPlease talk me down. Tell me it's not real. Tell me I'm safe. I'm at home with my husband so I'm physically safe just mentally unwell. \n\nI want to be an atheist so I can stop this fear but I feel energy so strongly is that just my schizoaffective??",

      "text": "I grew up in the Christian faith (church of Christ specifically). It’s a very buy the book, Bible focused denomination, and while I questioned some stuff as a kid, I wanted to make my parents proud and so I “believed.” I put that in quotes because when I think of my belief that the cup next to me is purple it’s concrete. Whereas my memory of having a belief in God was a choice to create something in my mind and then believe in it.\n\nWhen I went to law school, things started to unravel because I started to think about things more critically. Then I discovered I was gay and things really took a turn for me. I spent hours and hours obsessing over Bible verses trying to figure out if I was gonna burn in hell forever. Oddly enough, my belief in god was the strongest when I was the most afraid of the punishment that was certainly coming my way just because I fell in love with someone who happened to have boobs. \n\nI took a deep dive into the anti-theist/humanist side of the internet during this time and discovered the writings of Bart D. Ehrman. I credit his work as giving me that final push off the Jesus train and into the world of self acceptance. \n\nGrowing up with such a focus on the spiritual still nagged at me though. Not that I feel cheated that I suddenly didn’t believe a God existed, but I still had this general sense of a connectedness to people and the earth that I couldn’t explain. Connection to the earth is somewhat science based (I.e., how putting bare feet in dirt has a direct impact on a human body) but feelings of awe at the stars or the energetic connectedness don’t have a scientific component that I know of, at least not one that I’ve found or understand. I’ve also had experiences with meditation groups, where there is a tangible feeling of connection that feels almost like electricity. Again, it’s probably all scientific, but I have not necessarily found resources explaining a scientific reason for that experience. I also have a very, very rich emotional life, and feel extremely connected to the experience of human emotion.\n\nSo I feel like I’m left in this weird limbo. If someone asks me if I believe in God, my answer is usually a shrug, sometimes a no, and on rare occasion a yes. I’m not uncomfortable with the lack of certainty, but it does leave me wondering whether other people who landed as atheists also then found themselves waffling between agnosticism or humanism or some other quasi-belief? For those that landed somewhere in the ether like me, what is your emotional life like?\n\nAnd for those who consider themselves strong atheists (which I understand to mean in an active belief that there is no god), how did you arrive at such certainty? And same question I posed for the wafflers, how would you describe your emotional life?",

I haven't been a christian for a long time, but I was looking into it for the past year and recently determined that I in fact do not believe it to be true. I have been able to rationalize away almost any argument that that my friend have given to support their beliefs, however there is one thing that puzzles me.\n\nSome of them tell me of blatent \"revelations\" that they have had. For example, one of them says that a light appeared to them in their room one day and they had a conversation with god through it. Another claims to have woken up to their sheets hovering over them after asking god to reveal himself. While I know this may sound crazy to those who read this, these are people that I trust with my life and the life of anyone that I care about. I have 0 reason to believe that they would lie to me, so I have to assume that these were experiences that they truly believe happened to them.\n\nHas anyone else been in a similar situation to me? How were you able to \"explain away\" the experiences in your own head? \n\nI'm not looking for simple answers such as \"they are delusional\" because I assure you they are not.",

They started telling me about tarot, self-worth, astrology — the small stuff. Eventually, they started dropping more facts like energies and intuition. Then they told me they could read minds, though the didn't have control over when they could. That made me skeptical, but I continued with it. Then healing stones where introduced. I had already accepted the energy thing so I decided to run with it. It was when a god and souls were added that when I started questioning it. I was met with hostility as a result of my questioning. I was even accused of being an anticulturist. That's what led me to drop the belief system immediately. If someone tells you to not question something, you absolutely should question it. That was a major red flag. I deconstructed over a bit of time and found my way back to thinking critically. Not my first rodeo, I was Christian for most of my life. But new age spirituality claims to not be a religion yet operates like one. I was wondering others' thoughts on it. Just want to discuss.",

This isn't about being anti-Christian—I respect everyone's right to their faith and beliefs—but the intertwining of religion and state in ways that push specific religious agendas feels deeply concerning.\n\nIt raises questions about the erosion of separation between church and state, the marginalization of those with different beliefs (or no beliefs), and the potential for these ideologies to impact policy in ways that affect everyone's freedoms. The new administration hasn't even taken office yet and there's already bills being passed, bibles being put in schools, and so much more.\n\nI was raised in the church, and I respect everyone's beliefs, but I don't want my legislation to be influenced by religious texts at all, not even a little bit. America was formed to create a land with religious freedoms, and I feel like we've completely lost sight of that.\n\nAm I overthinking this, or are others seeing this too? How do you cope with or push back against what feels like an overwhelming tide of Christian nationalism taking over the country? How do I continue to give my child full freedom to make their own spiritual decisions if there's public indoctrination that is programmed into our school systems following the abolishment of the Department of Education?\n\nI'd love to hear your thoughts, experiences, insights, and if any of you share these fears.",

      "text": "After leaving religion, I struggled for a long time with not having a sense of purpose. Without belief in a higher power or afterlife, everything felt kind of hollow. I didn’t have a framework for what I was supposed to do with my life, how to process grief, or how to handle the fear of dying. I envied religious people, not for their beliefs, but for the clarity and comfort those beliefs seemed to give them.\n\nEventually, I realized I could still engage in ritual, reflection, and intention-setting without needing to believe in anything supernatural. Things like manifestation, tarot, even burning sage. I don’t see these as magic spells, but they do work for me. And the reason they work is psychological. Manifestation helps me stay focused on what I want. Tarot gives me a way to think through situations with clarity. Burning sage isn’t about “cleansing energy,” it’s about marking a reset, like writing an angry letter to get something off your chest and then burning it.\n\nIt’s basically the placebo effect. And the placebo effect still works. Just because something is symbolic doesn’t mean it’s useless. These tools help me externalize internal struggles. They help me process emotions and turn vague thoughts into something I can actually work through. That’s what matters.\n\n\nI used to be terrified of death. The idea that everything just ends with no resolution was deeply unsettling. Like the last episode of The Sopranos… cut to black, no warning, no closure. I hated the idea that I wouldn’t be able to watch over my kids, like I was always told I would growing up. It made life feel abrupt and unfair, like there wasn’t enough time to wrap things up.\n\nBut now I see it differently. I find so much beauty in the idea that the earth has sustained me my entire life… every breath, every bite, every moment. And in death, I get to give something back. I’ve decided I don’t want to be cremated or embalmed. I want to return to the soil, to become part of the system that kept me alive. That thought doesn’t scare me anymore. It brings me peace.\n\nI know this is a bit rambly, but I really hope that this reaches even just one person that it might help. The point is, even without belief in the supernatural, I’ve found meaning. Not from outside myself, but from within. And if you’re feeling lost, you can too.",

Even if it doesn’t make sense logically, it gives them peace. In fact I also noticed my atheist friends(just 3; it’s hard to find atheists) have hard time coping with life difficulties than believers. \n\nI am confident in my capacity to overcome any situation with my rational and willpower except the one fear I mentioned. Some situations I have no control over and moreover I have no control over how my wife & kids will approach a problem, whether they will make rational choices or not. This sends me down some scary spiral that I can’t find way out of. \n\nHow do fellow atheists deal with such fear? I’m sure I am not alone at this point in the philosophical journey.",

Do you need religion and the supernatural to feel that something is so important to you that it's sacred to you? No. This is how every Human Being should feel about his own life.",

      "text": "You’ve probably heard by now that earlier today the us bombed Iran and just now Donald Trump just addressed the nation where he basically said if Iran doesn’t agree to peace, he’ll do much worse than he just did to them. Anyway I was texting my friend about this. Me and her share many of the same political beliefs however she believes in god and I don’t. I was just venting to her about how I’m scared about what’s gonna happen and this is what she said: “I’m sorry but you should be, Ik you don’t believe in him but I was you I’d dead ass get close to god now if you really don’t wanna get drafted” \n\nI’m just kinda annoyed with her, it seems like she’s threatening me with being drafted unless I get close to god. This isn’t the first time she’s urged me to get close to god in order to get what I want. I just don’t like being told that if I don’t get close to god bad things are gonna happen to me. If god was real would he really be letting all this shit happen right now?\n\nUPDATE\n\nHere’s how the conversation continued \nMe: Are you trying to insult me? Sorry I don’t understand what you mean \n\nHer: Yk I believe in god and I believe that whoever isn’t with him well things don’t go exactly how they want too \n\nMe: Ohh okay well I respect your beliefs but I’m gonna have to ask you to please not project that onto me. I know you’re just trying help but you telling me bad things will happen if I’m not close to god is not what I need rn so if you could please keep that to yourself I appreciate it.\nSince it’s hard to understand tone over text I’m not trying to be passive aggressive I’m just respectfully asking you to keep that to yourself. Is that okay?\n\nHer: I’m telling you the truth if you don’t like to hear it it’s on you \nIf you don’t like the way I am why do you keep coming back? \n\nFor context on that last text we had a fight about a month ago and didn’t speak for sometime. I actually reached out to her a few days ago because she is an El Salvadoran immigrant and with all the mass deportations I thought it would be the right thing to reach out to her and see if she’s okay.\n\nEDIT: I think I should clear something up. She’s not a Christian. Me and her actually share a lot of the same beliefs about the corruption of organized religion. She’s more of a spiritual person. She believes in the Christian god but doesn’t go to church although I’m pretty sure she reads the Bible and prays.",

      "text": "Sorry for the clickbaity title. I will explain what I mean in a little bit after a brief background. I live and grew up in a very catholic country and in a very conservative family. Thankfully, I had a very science based education so growing up I did not really believe in the theology at all. But we all know that religion is more than just the theology. There is a whole cultural framework around religion — it pervades the self, your family, the clan, the city and even the nation (e.g. I instinctually stop eating when someone decides to say grace, to how the community idea of a good time is like a bible social get together or retreat, or how divorce is illegal because it is a catholic nation)\n\nI guess that was the part I did not easily escape. In my middle age I am trying to deconstruct myself to be more authentic to myself. In my own home I try to enforce my boundaries by saying no I don’t appreciate people stopping my party to say grace or having the hospital clerk put my religion as none. \n\nBut some things have been so engrained, I don’t know what to do. One of those things is the sense of “spirituality” every Sunday getting together with people singing, enjoying, doing activities together. I used to think this was “spirituality”, but I realize that it is that sense of belongingness and connection with people. Similar to how you feel connected with other people at a concert. \n\nI am struggling to find that connection and belongingness — something that came so naturally every Sunday. I have tried connecting with hobby groups that share my interests but surprise surprise they are conservative evangelicals haha like fml (yes they share my hobbies). \n\nAtheists tend not to flock together or when we do we don’t share anything (except non-belief).\n\nAs atheists or maybe as secular people where do you find your sense of belonging, community, connection to a bigger movement or “spirituality” as I used to define it.",

      "text": "I am so, so tired of being invited to \"team building\" events at work that are based around new age spiritual/mystical concepts like the \"law of attraction.\" Even if management can't technically force us to attend, there is a strong social pressure behind it. \n\nAt a secular company like the one I work for, it would never be seen as acceptable to ask one's coworkers to join in a religious event. The company culture is all about diversity and inclusion. Pressuring someone else to participate in your religion would be reported to HR and dealt with. \n\nBut this stuff is not seen as a religion. It's a spiritual belief that I absolutely do not share, yet it's treated as a neutral thing that's appropriate for the workplace. \"Manifesting\" is such a popular concept these days, you can't get away from it. And people will talk about it so seriously, like it's not just a personal belief of theirs but a universally accepted fact. \n\nIt makes me so incredibly uncomfortable to be asked to do things like \"find my inner spirit warrior\", and talk about my greatest traumas and failings in front of coworkers, and meditate and visualize my own death alongside them. It is absolutely crazy what they ask you to do at these events. If we were doing normal team building stuff, playing games and getting to know each other, that would be fine. You don't need mysticism to bond with your team. \n\nYet I'm pressured to attend these events and participate enthusiastically. If I don't attend, or if i express my skepticism, I feel that I'm running the risk of being seen as a poor team player and passed over for a promotion. \n\nOf course, there is a very lucrative industry behind this stuff. Grifter gurus host these events for all kinds of corporations. I'm just so frustrated at how widely accepted it is, and how hard it is to get out of it.",

      "text": "We are lesbians who live in a tiny conservative town in ontario. The closest we get to spirituality is the spirit of life. But not in a it takes precedent over science way. More of like a standing in a sunny pasture while the bees buzz makes you feel connected to nature way.\n\nAnyways, our 7 year old has been arguing with her friends a lot lately about god. They are all loud and pushy, and my kid is autistic so it takes her a beat to respond to stuff. The 3 other girls believe in god and having varying levels of religious families. We had to have a sit down at her birthday party and explain to the other kids that we dont believe that in our household because she kept telling them to stop talking about it and playing it and they were upset.\n\nThe most recent thing her bff has been into is heaven and hell. She is super chatty and will nonstop preach. Obviously I dont want to tell her she's wrong, but it's a bit muc. Plus it kind of annoys me that this 7 year old girl wants to pretend to be an angel of heaven but okay, everyone plays weird games when they're 7. It's just a fun thing to her. My kid thought it was funny and was the devil of hell and liked that she got to say bad words and be evil lol\n\nAfter the friend left, I told her that heaven and hell are not real. That it's just a story to try and convince people to be nice, but that we be nice because it's the right thing to do. We talked about that if you need to be rewarded to be nice, you're not really being nice.\n\nShe has become a bit enamoured with this heaven and hell thing. She wanted to write about animals going heaven on her drawing today. She seemed a bit ashamed to tell me it, which I dont want her to feel. I agreed that it would be cute, but asked her that she knows heaven isn't real right? and she quickly looked away and said yeah... but god is. And then looked straight at me. I asked her who told her that, and she quickly said nevermind and then very insistantly told me she didnt believe that and she believes what I believe. Which is not what I want for her! I told her I want her to be her own person and find her own beliefs, but that I don't think any god that exist would want me to go to hell for loving her other mom. And that the god they are talking about is the same one who told the settlers to kill all the native people (in canada the curriculum is very focused on native history and we live between 3 reservations), and I don't think any god would do that. That people just use it as an excuse to be mean. We've talked about it many times so she was receptive to that part.\n\nI feel like I fumbled it and I don't know what to do. I need advice. Is it too extreme to tell the friend that we dont do/play stuff like that in our home? I'm sure plenty of religious families would push religion to playmates in their homes so it feels fair.... but it also feels like not my place.",

      "text": "So ive been thinking about this quite often lately... i started dating this amazing girl for 3-4 months now. I met her via Bumble (ive never had any success in dating apps) i actually wanted to delete the app when i saw the match with her.\n\nShe studys art and is amazing in it, im in the military since january and my service will end on the last day of october.\n\nWe have the best times together if were together personally, no arguments no problems.\n\nFirst problem i did notice even on bumble is that she is \"religios\" well she says she doesnt like religion as it is portrayed but she is Christian, has like multiple bibles at homw etc. I knew it from the start.. i dont have a problem with this i myself have many spiritual beliefs and was raised accordingly from my mom. My mom isnt religious but has knowledge abt higher powers etc. Long story short i do have a bond to a \"higher power\" but i dont like religions like christianity , islam , or juddaism. My grandmother is an orthodox christian herself but is not that strict with her beliefs.\n\nMe and my gf as i said have the best times together ive never had sush a cute and loving relationship and it breaks my heart to write this out.\n\nShe doesnt accept my beliefs or my viewpoint on the world, she says she was also like this 2 years ago till she accepted christ. I myself gathered my information on spirituality etc. Since iam 25 Ive had many experiences which religious people would see as meeting god or talking to god.\n\nBut she doesnt really tolerates it or is looking at me with sideyes.. i find this sad.\n\nFunny thing is she wants to be a christian so hard etc. But still she has had sex with me , she smokes weed with me and does other things which wouldnt be considersted christian.\n\nShe tried to convinve me to believe a few times but still respected my no. She even bought me a bible which she would like me to read but i somehow cant, it somehow feels wrong. The whole christian religion feels wrong for me on many levels somewhere deep inside my heart something isnt adding up and i also feel it in my gut. I could never convert.\n\nI told her i respect her believs and if she wants i can read abt some teachings from the bible if this would help us. This was okay for her i mean the bible still has knowledge and knowledge is important you just need to be careful to not be sucked into something..\n\n3 weeks ago or 4 weeks ago dumb arguments started over chat since im not here on the weekdays only on the weekends.\n\nIm a seargant in the kitchen / KitchenChef. I have many respnsibilitys for sll the 900-1000 people here. We went into dumb arguments abt dumb things which made her jealous or anxious. And im not the best over chat. Long story short the arguments reached a very unhealthy standart especially the last 3 weeks it felt like we were constantly arguing and it hurt me so much because i really love her and try to improve my ways for her and her feelings because she is important to me.\n\nSomehow i felt that there were borderline like symtoms. Like she makes me feel very bad abt things she does and if i speak up im always defending myself and dont care abt her feelings etc, she is very sensitive yes. But slso the christian thing comes in waves, some smaller and then sometimes very big waves and sometimes none.\n\nWe had a big argument 2 weeks ago where i went crashout and had like 1-2 hrs of sleep every day so i went crashout because of all the stress and how i was treatinf her, so i told her i cant do this no more and we should break up. That was over facetime she hung up and i instantly regretted it.. I also told her this, last week was turbulent because she wanted me to win her over which i did.\n\nNow she told me the only way of a better future and no more arguments is if i accept jesus/ christ. Instead of going into herself and learn some self discipline like i have to do too she says we need to pray to jesus etc and he will help us. I call BS Also she said rhere wont be a future if i wont accept christ. Hell... sometimes i feel like i have a tighter connection to love and god than many religios people. She wants me to go to bible study which i told her no. All in all she wants me to convert and accept.\n\nYou see as i said i built my believs brick by brick since iam 14/15 iam 25 now she is 8 months older than me.\n\n2019 i was jobless i was a heroin junkie i was on my worst time ever, ive never prayed to god or jesus. Maybe i \"prayed\" in my mind to a higher power but not really.\n\nI went cold turkey one day out of fear of my future , for myself my mom and orher family members, who gladly helped me. one of many keypoints which brought me through cold turkey was avatar the last airbender and zukos / iroh's story and lore. And the music wow the music was amazing.\n\nI crawled out of the depths of my own hell, ive seen things, ive felt things which i wouldnt wish my worst enemy.\n\nStep by step i climbed the ladder went sober , got a apprentice ship , graduated. Now im a chef , went into the military january 2025 Signed to become a seargant and fullfill my duty's.\n\nIm hqppy with where iam and im not afraid of death \\ Hell or heaven because i know there wont be such thing, in my vision there will be the right thing after death for each individuall and his beliefs.\n\nFor me religions are all instructions to reach the same goal in the end.. to be enlighted.\n\nAnd there are many ways to become enlightend but the journey starts in. Your inner self.\n\nI dont trust the bible because i dont trust the people who translated it over and over again.\n\nI love my girlfriend and i would do anything in the world for her which im able to do, but i wont convert i also talked with my mother and she told me to not fall for it ,,its a trap!\"\n\nIm in a really dumb situation.. because i never loved anyone like i loved her, i could see myself with her in the future if we come to terms with our beliefs and handle ourselfs with dignity and respect.\n\nBut the way she says things sometimes abt christianity the light goes off for me.. deep inside i know if she really wants that and wont accept anything else we wont last and idk what to do.\n\nI feel like if she finds a xhristian man he will exploit her... i have a very weird gut feeling abt this. She even was on christian dating sites but still fell in love for me in the end?\n\nIdk it feels like shes trying to fight our love and tries to run away from her problems / our problems and just wants to give them to christ to not deal with them.. and it hurts.\n\nShe is one of the most mature people i got to know.. and also one of the most imature people i know.\n\nIdk what to do weve had a few plans for this and next year and we are really working on ourselves and its going good.. till the religion thing comes on.. and it makes me crazy... hahah sometimes i feel like Guts from berserk trying to fight of the godhand.. sounds dumb ik. But it feels like ut sometimes.\n\nI just had to get this off my chest i know the answers already but i hope we can work out.. without doing ultimatums. If it ends in an ultimatum ill be gone.. no matter how much it hurts..\n\nThank you guys and im sorry for my english its not the best im from switzerland. Not an english speaking country.\n\n\nEDIT: Thank you all for all the comments i definetly can pick a few and will try to sit down at one last talk with her this weekend. If she doesnt accept whats and will be going on well have to go separate ways. Thank you guys i appreciate it",

      "text": "I’m curious if there are people like me out there who are atheists and also struggle with serious mental health issues and thus feel their commitment to hard science challenged by a cold-hearted psychiatric industrial complex. For context, I have multiple overlapping diagnoses (bipolar, drug-resistant depression, and ADHD) and the older I get the more demoralizing I find being told by medical professionals that my brain is broken and the only thing to do is take more pills and do another course of cognitive behavioral therapy which, as far as I’m concerned, is all about turning people into functioning cogs in the capitalist machine as opposed to achieving any sort of deep fulfillment and happiness.\n\nOn the one hand, I care about things being true and effective, which is why I’m allergic to both organized religion and most new-age woo woo. On the other hand, I feel like any time I find a therapy modality that works for me, whether it’s Jungian analysis, EMDR, or somatic experiencing, I do a deep dive and find out that it’s been written off by the medical establishment as either pseudoscientific or otherwise lacking in evident effectiveness. I’ve recently been down the rabbit hole of Jungian archetypes and shadow work, even going so far as to use Tarot cards as a tool for shadow work. Of course I don’t believe that Tarot cards can actually predict the future or anything, but I’ve found this sort of supposedly unscientific inner work to be very powerful for coming to terms with the abuse I suffered as a child and unaddressed emotional wounding generally.\n\nI fear all this makes me a bad atheist, but at the same time I give fewer fucks as I get older. I just know that the psychiatric model of mental health care is predicated on efficiency, profit, and minimal empathy. And I guess it speaks to the bigger existential question of whether my life and the shit I endured actually means anything beyond having a broken brain that needs fixing with meds and prescriptive therapy models. This is why I can’t bring myself to give up on spirituality completely.\n\nTL,DR: I want to know if anyone else has struggled with what seems to be a clash between cold, hard evidence and cold-hearted treatment at the hands of medical authority figures. If so, how have you reconciled this?\n\nEdit after the fact: This is in no way to say that I’m anti-mental health medications. They’ve literally saved my life. On the other hand, some have just turned me into a numbed out zombie. I just want to believe that there’s more to life than not wanting to off yourself.",

      "text": "1. Wtf does the word spirituality even mean?\n\nEveryone who claims to be spiritual has a different definition of spirituality, this word has completely lost its meaning. These 'spiritual' people can't even define the word properly.\n\n\n\n2. Vague and Unfalsifiable Claims:  \nSpirituality thrives on ambiguity. Whether it’s “energy,” “vibrations,” or “the universe has a plan,” these concepts are so nebulous that they’re impossible to disprove. Sound familiar? It’s the same trick religion has been pulling for centuries i.e; making claims that can’t be tested or verified, so they’re always “true” in the eyes of believers.\n\n3. The Commodification of Enlightenment: Spirituality has become a multi-billion-dollar industry. From crystal healing to reiki, from astrology apps to $200 yoga retreats, it’s all about selling you the promise of inner peace. But isn’t it ironic that the path to “enlightenment” seems to require a credit card? It’s almost as if spirituality is less about finding truth and more about keeping you hooked on the next purchase.\n\n4. The Rejection of Critical Thinking: Spirituality often encourages people to “trust their intuition” or “follow their heart” over evidence and reason. While intuition can be useful, it’s not a reliable guide to understanding reality. This anti-intellectualism is dangerous as it leads people to reject science, medicine, and critical thought in favor of pseudoscience and magical thinking.\n\n5. The Illusion of Control: Spirituality gives people the illusion that they can control the uncontrollable. Whether it’s manifesting your dream job or “aligning your chakras,” it’s comforting to think we have power over our lives. But life is messy, random, and often unfair. Pretending otherwise might feel good, but it doesn’t change the reality of our circumstances.\n\n6. The Privilege of Spiritual Bypassing: \nLet’s be real, spirituality is often a luxury for those who can afford to ignore the harsher realities of life. Telling someone living in poverty or facing systemic oppression to “just vibrate higher” is not only tone-deaf but deeply dismissive of their struggles. Spirituality can become a way to avoid addressing real-world problems, both personal and societal.\n\n7 India:\nhere in india people are scammed in the name of spiritual practices for billions of rupees. Not to mention, so many of these spiritual leaders and so called 'gurus' have criminal backgrounds and have committed gut-wrenching acts like murder and rape(just google 'asaram baapu child rape case' and how may have Sadhguru murdered his wife). They lure girls in the name of religion and spirituality and then abuse them. \nFuck you Sadhguru, asaram baapu,  ram rahim, ranveer alahbadia, ramdev, ISKCON, Ravi Shankar",

      "text": "Generation Z is the least religious generation in American history. And, they are becoming less religiously identified as each year passes. In 2019, 46.7% of Generation Z had no religious affiliation. \n\nIn 2022, the share of Generation Z with no religious affiliation is 48.5%, according to the Cooperative Election Study. It is statistically justifiable to say that by the time the United States has another presidential election, half of Generation Z will identify as atheist, agnostic, or nothing in particular. \n\nEvery day in the United States, thousands of religiously conservative members of the Silent and Boomer generation are dying off. At the same time, thousands of members of Generation Z are celebrating their 18th birthday, becoming official adults.\n\nWith nearly half of young people religiously unaffiliated, this generation of young Americans could be the first generation in the US to switch from the majority being religious to the majority being nonreligious - changing American religion and society in ways that we can only begin to understand.\n\nAbout 80% of student members of the [Secular Student Alliance](https://secularstudents.org) come from religious families and households. From a new study published in Psychology of Religion and Spirituality, formerly religious individuals are more likely to experience a lack of belongingness compared to those who were never religious, and this feeling of not fitting in predicts an increased tendency to conceal their nonreligious identity by keeping it separate from their public persona.  Students like these join the SSA to find a sense of belonging, are less likely to conceal their nonreligious identity, and become advocates for secular values in our society.",

She constantly back tracks. She was raised Catholic but is now probably more unitarian and believes in the fundemental teachings of Jesus. I say things like the Bible can be used for good but also look at all the bad it has caused also. \"I agree the Bible says no to gays ect but Jesus said blah blah blah\". I'm not trying to prove her wrong and say she's dumb, I'm just trying to show her what is actually happening here on earth as a human and how none of that has any basis in my own reality. Not necessarily the meditation part but the fact that I'm supposed to have some \"inner light spiritual awareness awakening\" bullshit. I am a good person. I don't murder, I don't drink, I dont drugs (I smoke weed sometimes with my friends). I've been struggling with my minimum wage job cutting hours and getting less money and having to live at home. I keep telling her the things I am depressed about are very real and tangible things like President Cheeto or how I'm getting screwed financially and yet somehow it always come back to if you meditate you will find your inner blah blah blah. So what it sounds like to me is, accept it. Once you meditate your problems go away. I'm like no, I literally need to find a new job. I don't need to contemplate how I'm getting fucked. I know the answer. It's phisically another job for more money. The same thing happened in college too. I said things like, do I have ADD? What is the point of this bullshit math? Ah well if you meditate your problems become clearer ect ect. I'm not against meditation and I'm not saying it doesn't work for people. I'm just a \"rubber hits the road\" kind of guy. I've tried meditation but every time anyone tries to explain how to do it, it always comes back to souls and nature and inner spark ect. After countless hours of trying meditation I have figured out that I really want to build and repair guitars. Sure fine but no no, where? \"Right here in the back yard\"  Ah, well no, ... Like I did it wrong. I was supposed to... What? Be ok with all the actual problems with the world? Ah nuclear war and global warming but also woo-sa it won't affect you if you let it. So I just don't worry about money and a place to live on my own or any sort of stability or job security? This I why I'm here in the first place. I was always told I'm smart and I'll figure it out and we all struggle. So should I live one day at a time not worried about it? Or should I maybe do concrete things like job search? So I just accept I'm poor? What can I say to her that isn't \"come back to reality\"",

      "text": "I am a phone saleswoman / Office worker and have been for about 8 years now. As sales numbers fluctuate up and down, there are observable patterns of harder and easier markets in the calendar year. As an American, Christianity is extremely common here and it's very very, very noticeable the way religious holidays impact the attitudes of Christians. For example today is Good Friday, which, according to their beliefs, is the day their religious icon Jesus died. As a person who doesn't believe, this day means absolutely nothing to me. But a large number of customers both today and even the day before today, who were previously friendly and eager to talk to us, have turned hostile and aggressive even when they have no reason to be and we're just helping them with something customer service related which we often do as this company offers multiple services. I've seen this exact thing happen around just about every Christian holiday. People can unusually nasty, sour, and aggressive before Christmas, Thanksgiving, Easter, Ash Wednesday, Lent, Good Friday, Palm Sunday- it doesn't even matter if it's a big holiday or some minor thing- it's as if the sheer fact that there is a spiritual holiday, makes people act strange, short tempered, and touchy about everything. It is so weird. Does anyone else know what I'm talking about?",

      "text": "Hello everyone, I had a conversation with a friend who is a practicing Witch last night about the roles of magic in activism, and given current circumstances it's come up more as of late. She spoke about casting spells, offerings and rituals that in her anecdotal experience have helped in small ways contribute to progress and action. Things like going to town Hall meetings where a public policy is being pushed for and doing a small quote ritual in the background. When said policy is passed she believed she was apart of that in some capacity. \n\nThis is seemingly a sentiment that is echoed throughout theological circles both of the Occult kind and I'm sure the larger more institutionalized religions (I am not as familiar or close to those) present here in America especially, the idea of prayer and giving and spirituality to aid or help a cause or champion for others. \n\nMy question now is how do people in this sub particularly feel about this kind of practice and faith among activism and pushing for change? Is it a non-issue? Is It hopeful? Inspiring? Irresponsible? \n\nI come here to ask because I myself am an atheist and I found myself pulling back on my first thoughts of frustration when I dwelled on the idea of people who would do spells to champion a cause instead of going out and physically being a part of the change as opposed to spiritually part of it. I'd rather not give in to a negative first reaction without seeking the opinions and thoughts of others before arriving to a conclusion. I appreciate any discussion and thoughts!",

      "text": "Hi all! First off, I am a secular atheist and a cis female. I haven’t believed in anything paranormal, spiritual, or religious in my whole life. I never truly believed, even when I mentioned god or Jesus as a child. Secondly, I was sexually abused for a long time by a boy whose Mormon mother knowingly allowed it when I was a baby, toddler, and child. The boy grew into a Mormon man and now as children of his own that I cannot say for certain he hasn’t abused himself.\n\n\nAnyway onto my predicament. I have noticed that with the slow, gradual fall of larger, more organized religion, I have seen more women become interested in spiritual practices. This is something that boggles my mind because, to me, it’s not any different than religion. Instead of believing that god will fix all your problems, now you’re saying that your crystals will, or the moon, or that if you simply change a few words in a sentence, it now means something completely different than what you intend.\n\n\nIt’s baffling me because many of these women do see that they were victims under religion. They know that they were held hostage by sexist teachings, deliberate misinformation or disinformation, homophobic and racist doctrines, and other harmful rhetorics. But they can’t see that spiritual practices have these harmful effects as well, especially the misinformation and disinformation part. They throw themselves into spirituality and ignore science and fact, but why? Why does reason allude them?\n\nI understand that these women desire empowerment the they lacked in organized religion but they don’t see that spirituality is just as nonsensical and even dangerous as the religion they claim to have left. To me, it’s not that much of a leap from praying over a crystal to praying over an alter. It’s not much of a leap from taking strange Chinese medicinal herbs to claiming that vaccines cause autism.\n\n\nI, as a woman and an atheist, often get accused of being internally misogynistic and sexist against my own sex when I openly criticize spirituality. I don’t think I am, I’m concerned. I want women to be educated and to seek answers along the road to equal rights, not give up at the most convenient stopping point because “learning is hard” and “the unknown is frightening.” Yes, those things are true, but if we want a better world for women, we have to learn and embrace the unknown. A better world for women will be a better world for everyone and I think that starts with abandoning religion *and* spirituality.",

She even sometimes believes that people are performing black magic on her and this is her explanation of why something bad may have happened to her. if there's bugs in the house, that's a sign of people performing black magic on her, nope not an infestation or food possibly laying around attracting them, it's definitely someone with a voodoo doll and candles performing some elaborate ritual. These feelings of hers are based off nothing but her being able to \"sense it\" and that her muertos(dead ancestors) \"told her so\". I love my mother to bits even though me and her have had a really rocky relationship but I'm so fucking tired of my mom giving into this delusion, my mom believes that her steadfast belief in religion and spirituality is somehow helping her, but quite frankly I reckon it just ruined her life more than it helped, the paranoia that comes with religion and believing that someone or something is basically praying on your downfall and that \"evil forces\" at play is just downright ridiculous. And this is how religion and these baseless spiritual beliefs completely divides humanity as a whole, people believing that there are people around them performing black magic and hexxing them ultimately leads to them becoming unstable and irrational, making brash decisions based off some spiritual feeling. I'm so tired of religion and superstition ruining peoples lives such as my mom's, i wish i was born in a world where religion and superstition went the way of the dodo. any thoughts yall?",

      "text": "What are people’s thoughts on the Indigenous spiritual traditions of the Americas? While I’m not Indigenous myself, I’m closely connected to that world and have spent time out in the back country with some very revered elders sourcing traditional medicines and participating in pipe ceremonies and whatnot. I consider myself an atheist with regard to the world’s major religions but find myself making an exception for Buddhism, which is explicitly non-theistic, and the native traditions of my own backyard. (I live in western Canada and am most familiar with the Cree and Blackfoot spiritual traditions.)\n\nThere are three reasons why I can’t bear to jettison my reverence for these traditions. Firstly, apart from people passing out from exhaustion or blood loss from the Sun Dance or possibly psychosis from a bad peyote trip, there strikes me as being absolutely no harm in these traditions. Secondly, what was done to Indigenous spirituality by white colonists (in the name of Christianity of course) was 100% criminal, and for that reason alone I’m delighted to see it thrive again. And thirdly, while I don’t believe that sweetgrass and tobacco smoke can literally carry prayers from this world to the spirit realm, the “creator” that the elders talk about is a very abstract concept and the belief system itself, which emphasizes the interconnectivity of all living things, seems factually true to me.\n\nI guess at heart this makes me a sort of allegorical pagan with a deep reverence for the natural world, one who’s not above asking the forest permission for safe passage before a hike or trail run. Does this make me a bad atheist or is this healthy spirituality?",

We talked briefly about religion, but nothing about \"spiritual\" stuff.\n\nThen eventually she told me that while I was really good-looking, she didn't think we were compatible in various ways. Some of the things she quoted was that she had a religion, and I had not, and she leaned toward that being a dealbreaker. She also didn't like that I didn't believe in the transcendent (we never talked about that, so it was a bit frightening that she could read me so well).\n\nInitially I felt sad that she did not want to pursue anything with me, given that we had very good personal chemistry and I really enjoyed being with her. But when thinking about it, if she is going to reject me for not believing in a lot of stupid shit, then she is not worth having. And I can't deny feeling rather proud for being rejected for basically being a skeptic and an atheist.\n\nMind you, this did not take place in the US.

      "text": "Does God exist? Well, no, but it has recently occurred to me that's far from the most interesting question on the topic.\n\nI have been an atheist all my life, but I do believe there is value in spirituality. Mostly this has taken the form of Zen meditation (without any of the dogma), but I recently moved into a place with a Quaker meeting hall around the corner. The Quakers are pretty cool with atheists (in fact, a [significant proportion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nontheist_Quakers) of them are atheists), but they are definitely in the Christian tradition. I've been attending Quaker meetings, and this has given me pause to think more about God than I have done for a long time.\n\nSo, one answer to the question \"Does God exist?\" is no, but my new answer is, \"Does freedom exist? Does justice exist? Does eleven exist? Does Captain Ahab exist?\" A far more interesting question than \"Does God exist?\" is \"What is the nature of God?\" Just as it can be illuminating and inspiring to think about Captain Ahab, there is a tremendous amount of wisdom and insight to be gained by considering the nature of God.\n\nMy local Quakers have two meetings on a Sunday. In the first, everyone sits around for half an hour listening to/for God. In the second, everyone sits around for an hour listening to/for God and then speaking to the group if they feel moved by the Spirit to speak. I generally attend the first one. I don’t listen to/for God outside myself; some more questions I’d find boring and answer no to would be, “Does God exist outside you?” “Did God exist before humanity existed?” “If we’re very, very quiet, will we be able to hear God?”\n\nI now think of God as that which is simultaneously profound and ineffable, inexpressible, or unknowable. As human knowledge has expanded, the inexpressible and unknowable have changed (not necessarily shrunk - think of the missing link paradox, where every time you find a missing evolutionary link, you just create a new missing link on either side), but there are methods for getting in touch with our wonder at them that have remained remarkably constant and are still productive. The religious traditions that speak to me (Zen, Quakerism) involve sitting quietly and experiencing what is moving and extraordinary about being human and alive and that is beyond logic and words.\n\nDoes God exist? No, but if we’re very, very quiet we may realise we could hear God all along.\n\nWhat is the nature of God? Sort of like tinnitus, but profound.",

      "text": "The concept of Spiritual bypassing was identified by psychotherapist John Welwood back in the 80s. He defined it as a \"tendency to use spiritual ideas and practices to sidestep or avoid facing unresolved emotional issues, psychological wounds, and unfinished developmental tasks.\"\n\nI found a more expansive explanation here: [Spiritual bypassing as a defense mechanism](https://www.verywellmind.com/what-is-spiritual-bypassing-5081640)\n\nI see this psychological concept being deployed on a larger scale in society when complex societal and scientific systems are reduced to fundamentalist religious concepts. \n\nAn example is women's right to bodily autonomy and access to healthcare during pregnancy. This issue is reduced to \"abortion\". The extremely complex concept of pregnancy is dismissed in favor of \"fetal rights\" and a reliance on \"natural processes\". \n\nThe pro-life movement does not aim to protect and further the complex systems that support life in general but only to protect unborn human life. \n\nLGBTQ people are \"abominations\" who \"choose a lifestyle\". \n\nThe impacts of climate change are dismissed as \"after the apocalypse, Jesus comes back to save the righteous\". Calls for action on climate change are dismissed with \"life will continue\" or simply \"gods will take care of it\" . Suffering is accepted as \"building character\". \n\nStewardship of the planet is dismissed as \"gods gave the world to humans to exploit and abuse\". We've seen religious government officials pray for rain during droughts rather than work on legislation to limit emissions and stabilize the climate. We see it as the outpouring of thoughts and prayers during national disasters. \n\nCelibacy is reduced to \"abstinence from sex with women\" not \"abstinence from all sexual activity\". This has allowed for widespread pedophilia within church systems. \n\nEconomic inequality is explained as \"many homeless people choose that lifestyle\", and \"prosperity theory\" - which essentially means \"the wealthy are more deserving than the poor which is proven by the simple fact that they are wealthy\". If you're poor, you need to \"manifest wealth\". \n\nWork that is essential to the function of society is dismissed as \"unskilled labor\". Complex life forms like humans are reduced to \"workers\" and \"consumers\". \n\nI wonder if others have noticed how this concept is being deployed on a societal level to avoid the self reflection and sacrifice needed to change the status quo?",

I miss them dearly and it is so painful, especially the thought of never seeing them again terrifies me the most. Being an atheist and in many ways not spiritual at all, I do not find comfort and hope in the promise of seeing them again - something that seems to be sustaining a lot of people, even if they are not organized religion per se, a lot of people seem to believe in a soul or afterlife or higher power.\n\nI am not like that at all. And obviously I cannot start believing it now that it is convenient. That would be silly.\n\nI mean, yes the idea of seeing my friend one day sounds so good and soothing and I can see why so many people do believe it, but I just don't function that way.  It doesn't bring me solace or hope because deep down I know it is not true and that me, for example, dreaming about them is not them visiting\n\nI mean why would a dead person visit me in my dreams anyway? Why not visit me while I am awake and cry for them? Why does it have to be in a dream?\n\nIt's kinda like when someone loses an arm and still can feel it.  Obviously the arm is not there, it's just your brain trying to adjust. If the arm was a person, the religious person would say it's the person or their spirit talking to you blah blah blah.\n\nOther examples are people who lose their pets and think it had a soul and they will see them again. But why does your dog have a soul but not the cow whose flesh you eat? or the mouse you kill in a mouse trap? Why your pet?\n\nIt's all so arbitrary and just like made up to make people feel better.\n\nThis guy I know who also lost someone close to him tells me to look into the bhagavad gita etc and assures me it is not religion but very beautiful. But i feel nothing when I read it. It invokes nothing on me. It honestly just feels like he likes what it says and makes him feel good, like an emotional pacifier, so he CHOOSES to believe it, not because it is true.   But I cannot just **choose** to believe stuff cause it sounds good. I am adamant that it actually be true. That is why I am not religious: I just cannot believe in shit in the ***hopes*** or on the off chance that it may be true. Or believe in stuff because I dont know either way so I might as well.\n\nThen I might as well say santa clause and the easter bunny are real. What's the difference between them and god?\n\nAs I said, I dont function that way but somehow envy people who do. That's how they are able to go through life losing a child and endure other horrible things.\n\nThey say there are no atheists in fox--holes but I am one. When I am in distress, I am less likely to have faith and believe in a higher power, not more likely. It goes without saying I am not religious, but I am not spiritual either.\n\nAnyone else feeling that? Like you dont have a bone of spirituality in you and are completely grounded in reality and facts and believe that which is perceived as spiritual ultimately has a biological or physical explanation rather than a supernatural/spiritual one? I dont even believe in a soul. I think it's just your synapses firing and once that is gone, so is everything about you. The energy that dissipates is the carbon bonds breaking and releasing heat.  It's not a soul flying away in incorporeal form. Even writing that out sounds stupid to be honest. I can't believe people believe that let alone find comfort in it.",

      "title": "how my ex told me our breakup was \"god's will\" for my spiritual growth",
      "text": "This is one of those stories that still makes my blood boil every time I think about it. A few years ago, I was in a relationship that I thought was going somewhere. We were together for almost two years, and everything seemed perfect on the surface. But then, out of nowhere, my ex broke up with me. I was devastated. We had talked about getting married, starting a family, and all the future plans that you make with someone you think you’ll be with forever.\n\nAfter the breakup, I was a wreck. I tried to understand what went wrong and how things fell apart so quickly. I reached out to my ex, hoping for some closure, some explanation that would help me make sense of everything. Instead of the empathy I expected, I got something that honestly made me feel worse.\n\nShe told me that the breakup wasn’t because of anything either of us did, but rather because “it was God’s will.” She said, “I think God is guiding me to grow spiritually, and I need to go through this separation to become a better person.” She went on to say that I should also see this as a “blessing” because it was part of God’s plan for me to grow too. According to her, it wasn’t just a breakup, it was a divine intervention, a lesson that I needed to learn.\n\nI was stunned. Here I was, heartbroken, emotionally drained, and confused, and she was trying to frame the whole thing as something positive, a divine opportunity for growth. To say I was angry would be an understatement. I just wanted her to admit that maybe we weren’t right for each other or that there were actual reasons for the breakup, but instead, it was turned into this spiritual journey, as if God had orchestrated this whole thing for my personal development.\n\nAt that point, I realized that I couldn’t be with someone who believed that their emotional decisions were based on some kind of divine guidance. It made me feel like nothing was ever truly real – like everything, even our relationship, was just a part of some cosmic test. It felt like my feelings didn’t matter; they were just part of some bigger plan that I couldn’t even understand.\n\nThat experience was a huge turning point for me. It made me start questioning everything about religion and how people use it to justify the choices they make. If we’re constantly told that everything is “God’s will,” then how can we ever trust our own instincts, feelings, or decisions? I couldn’t live in a world where everything was just some preordained plan, and nothing had real meaning outside of it.\n\nI don’t think I’ll ever fully understand how someone can frame a painful breakup as a “blessing” just because it’s part of some spiritual journey. It made me realize I wanted to make my own decisions, without the need for divine justification. Life is too short to live as if everything is some lesson sent from above. Sometimes things just don’t work out, and that’s okay.",

      "text": "Like, I can infer why psychologically. Just, there is no arguing against it. And then you come off as the bad guy for trying to apply critical thinking to them? So its a lose lose, idk what to do. And in some cases, it makes people moral, like look at this [https://youtu.be/RdWsxBbyLm4](https://youtu.be/RdWsxBbyLm4) some people are psychoes. You attack their spirituality its no different from a theist fundamentalist half the time. Society is scary, and half of why is because people are so incomprehensibly irrational, that they would kill for the sense of self importance or purpose they get from delusional moments. And, if we even fully inform them of their delusionality, and if they actually believe it, they might just have a meltdown then accomplish even less with themselves than otherwise. Like, some people, its the only thing keeping them going. So, what then? There are no good answers its just lesser of multiple evils. Except, even lets say, I became a super polite guy at arguing, instead of getting stupendously pissed at very specific fallacies. Like, I would be cast as a villain anyways. \n\n  \nAnd this is why some people choose to just, enable their fallacies til they become fools. Like, trolling theists with satanism. Idk if thats the best way, but its hella based on the statue issues n stuff. And then, they also, the niche I am talking about, are anti-organized religion too afaik. So its like, do I even wanna attack a potential ally? Tho, they do view me as the black sheep I am sure still. \n\n  \nBut its a community online I have been a part of for a while, and its just a couple of people. But, they are accomplishing more in their life than I have I guess. I mean, its debatable, idk how much people I have swayed online over the years. But this is a prime example of Reaction Formation cuz I couldn't keep my cool n do enough critical thinking, so they dove against logic. \n\nOr maybe they are just prodding at me to see how much I can tolerate of their bs. Idk.",
