      "text": "TW: Self-harm, addiction, suicide, depression, eating disorders, abuse\n\nI (24F) have a long history of mental health issues. My mother was emotionally abusive, I had undiagnosed ADHD, and began suffering from depression and suicidal thoughts when I was 10 years old.\n\nThe past 10 years have been a fight. I developed an eating disorder and fainted at school. I began to self harm. I have been in and out of therapy and tried many different medications.\n\nAt 19, during the pandemic, I began to heavily abuse alcohol. I knew I had a problem but I didn't care. I just wanted the pain to stop.\n\nA year in, I attended an AA meeting at my local church. I have nothing against religion, but for me, it is a huge source of trauma. The group was not advitised as being religious, so it was a shock. I sat there, shaking, slightly tipsy, consumed with shame, fear, self-hatred, and a feeling of dread. I felt I would never be free. I felt I would always be broken. I felt I would never be able to improve and was destined to die from alcoholism or by my own hand. I felt so very alone. I hadn't spoken to my friends in a while- I was convinced everyone hated me.\n\nI realised nothing was ever going to get better, and that my life was not worth living. I felt utterly broken.\n\nThree years later, I finally found a therapist that I feel understands me. I have found the correct combination of medication. I have taken up meditation, exercise, and work two jobs I enjoy. I have hobbies again.\n\nI still struggle, but things are better. I am able to stand the pain without breaking.\n\nI have always loved to sing, so I took up singing lessons. I love it. My teacher told me I have some real talent, and wants to introduce me to some artists who are interested in writing/playing with me.\n\nShe puts on this \"concert\" every year, where lots of her students- kids, teenagers, the elderly, a huge range of ages and skill level- will perform a song or piano piece in front of friends and family.\n\nI said no at first, but eventually I realised something. I have come so far, but I am never going to be \"normal\". I am never going to be able to meet a new person without feeling shaky. I am never going to be able to be able to answer the phone without deep breathing first. I am never going to be able to stand up on a stage without feeling like I'll puke or pass out.\n\nBut what's the alternative? I never do anything, ever. Because I'm too scared of getting hurt. I lived my life that way for 23 years, hoping to find a cure for all my fear. But that cure doesn't exist. And I don't want to curl up and rot anymore. I want to live, even if it means pain.\n\n\"Do it scared\" my therapist said. So that's what I did.\n\nThe concert was held in the same church as that horrid AA meeting, all those years ago.\n\nI couldn't sleep the night before, I couldn't eat, and I was shaking so badly I could hardly stand. I'd never sung in public before, and I was terrified. Drinking crossed my mind. Self-harm crossed my mind. Backing out crossed my mind more than once. Self-pity, hatred, loneliness. My mother's voice rang in my head. I did not think anyone would come to support me. It was so small and silly, after all.\n\nBut I walked into that church, two years sober, on wobbly legs, and stood on the stage.\n\nAnd I sang.\n\nMy best friend came. She surprised me entirely. She beamed and clapped and cheered along with all the other sweet people who attended. She bought me flowers. I burst into tears later. She hugged me and told me she was so proud of me, that I was amazing. I felt so much love. I used to be so afraid and ashamed to show emotion. Now, it's like I can't stop. And I don't want to.\n\nHours later, I am staring out at the night sky. I thought I would never be able to do anything like this. And later, I thought I would never be able to do it without alcohol.\n\nIf I'd backed out, it wouldn't have been a failing. But I'm so glad I did it.\n\nThree years ago, I was suicidal, an active alcoholic, lonely and afraid.\n\nToday, I am sober, my best friend bought me flowers, and I sung one of my favourite songs in front of 50 people. It was small, but to me it felt so big. And that's okay, isn't it? To give small things significance? I used to wonder why anyone cared when \"nothing really mattered\". But now, now it all matters to me. Because I realised if I don't give the small things meaning, nothing ever really matters at all. And I want them to matter.\n\nI am still afraid. I am still terrified.\n\nBut now I know I can do it. Now I know it cannot break me.\n\nWhen people used to tell me \"it gets better\", I used to think it was bullshit. But now, I understand. For the first time, I truly get it.\n\nI am so grateful today. I know how lucky I am, and my chest feels too small for all the emotion I feel. I always thought that was a flaw in me, to feel so much. Now I feel it is a gift. A double edged sword, but a gift all the same. What a privilidge to be human, and to feel so damn much.\n\nI'm going to keep moving forward, even if I slow to a crawl. I am proud of myself, even if no one else ever is.\n\nMy mother's voice is quiet for now. I drowned it out. Something I always longed to do and never thought I ever could. That's proved you wrong, I thought. Because I may be afraid and shaky and small on that stage, but I still stood up and sang. After all these years, I found my voice. And it soared, in that tiny church. My god, it soared.\n\nI'm glad I'm still here. And I am glad I am alive.",

ECT (electroshock therapy) took effect May 2024 and it’s been a full year without miserable pain ever since. That kinda hit me last week.\n\nBecause this year has sucked and still does. But sitting homeless in a field with a left foot with no skin was actually the happiest I’ve ever been. It’s been the best year of my life.\n\nSo the agreement has in fact been fulfilled. I was hoping for better but yes, that’ll do. I’ll go quiet though i’d really prefer not to right now if it’s just the same. But this is all bonus time from here.",

Everyone loved her and approved of her.\n\nI took a walk today and in a quiet moment of reflection, I realized that I’m super lucky. I have everything I’ve ever wanted in my life. I’m so grateful for all of it. Here are just a few things:\n\n* My partner: We communicate so well and are aligned on every level—emotionally, mentally, and in our values. We’ve never fought, because we handle conflicts with such openness and respect for each other. I didn’t know relationships like this existed, and I feel incredibly lucky to have found her. She is the love of my life. \n* My work: My job pays well, is very secure, and gives me a great work/life balance. Being able to work remotely has changed my life. I'm one of the lucky ones that was positively impacted by Covid.\n* My friends: I'm so grateful for my friends. I’m surrounded by people who genuinely care, lift me up, and inspire me to grow. I couldn’t ask for a better support system. They've always been there for me, and I hope to be the same for them.\n* My home: I love where I live! My neighborhood is clean, safe, and has an amazing view that I get to wake up to every day. It’s a joy to host friends here and share great moments in a space that feels like a true home.\n* My health: I’m taking better care of myself than ever before. My body is in the best shape it’s ever been, and I’m proud of the progress I’ve made.\n* My car: This one is silly and superficial, but I love my car. It gives me such joy to drive it. The perfect blend of comfort, luxury, and performance. I used to think driving was just to go from point A to point B, but my car has taught me that you should also enjoy the journey.\n\nI’ve had my share of setbacks and painful lessons, but today I’ve risen above it all. \n\nLife isn’t perfect, and I know nothing lasts forever. But for this brief moment in time, I am the luckiest person on this planet, and I want to share my gratitude with you all!\n\nI wish you all the best life has to offer! <3",

Moved to the US in 2020 all by myself with one suitcase, very little money and no family. I always knew as a kid I belonged here and would always dream of living in this country. Well, hard work and determination pays off. \n\nI had just graduated from college. I had been in the US multiple times before, so this was my final decision to move mid Covid as there was only one charter flight. \n\nIn the past 4 years, I have learned how to thrive on my own, put one foot in front of the other and make my dreams come true. I am beyond thankful and grateful for all the blessings in my life, all the lessons and people I’ve met here. It’s been a great journey. And I am thankful to be able to help my family as well. \n\nI hope that this post inspired someone out there. No matter the circumstances, you can do it. The Universe has your back! 🤍🙏🏼",

Honestly, I know you hate thinking about the past, but just let it go.\n\nI really hope you didn’t ruin my dream of studying psychology at university, because you’re absolutely capable of it, you idiot.\n\nI also hope things are better in your life now… That dad is still around, that you’ve made friends—both girls and guys—and that you’ve managed to keep them. Back in 2020, I’m feeling terrible because of Juliette and this constant loneliness. Please don’t make me go through that again at your age.\n\nBut anyway, don’t worry. Everything will turn out fine. Remember, whenever we’ve wanted something, we’ve always ended up achieving it in the end. Stay a good person—I didn’t make all these sacrifices for you to turn into a complete jerk.\n\nI don’t know about you, but here, I’m still a huge fan of comics, and Spider-Man is still the most inspiring character. Never stray from the right path: “When you can help someone, you have a moral obligation to do so.”\n\nI trust you, future me. You’re (my age) now. You have responsibilities, duties—don’t give up, I’m really counting on you.\n\nAlright, I’ll stop here. I’ve got some ironing to do. Have a great day, and happy birthday, Raph (I just hope no one’s still calling you “Loulou” by now—it’s unbearable).\n\nYou’ve come such a long way…\n\nOkay, for real, I’ll leave you alone now. But if you’re reading this with someone you love, hold onto her with everything you’ve got. Love her endlessly. Don’t make the same mistakes I did. Don’t be stupid. Give me the chance to feel happy and fulfilled too.\n\nAlright, I’m done for real this time. (I hope you’ve stayed handsome.)",

      "text": "I’m not sure how it came about, but I was with him on the phone and we were joking around. I just started a work situation which will remove me from my home country to another for two months at a time, every couple months. This was the first two months, and I was a bit worried about our relationship. However, it all went perfectly. I was not worried at all, even though I struggle with intense anxiety. We didn’t text much or feel the need to constantly talk, but sometimes when I grabbed my phone to text him that I missed him, I would see he had texted me the same just minutes before. I’m happy to have time to focus on myself, but also miss him dearly. \n\nAnyway, I was joking about this “timeline” I have for my life which would include getting engaged and/or married in my late twenties, and how I told my friend that “if he doesn’t change drastically, I wanna get engaged to him in 3 years” and he immediately went “oh, I told my friend more like in 2 years…” \n\nOur relationship is still quite fresh, so this engagement estimate might or might not happen; and in any case the wedding would not immediately follow. But, not so long ago, I was in a severely abusive relationship that I still fight the effects of. I thought my life was forever changed, and that it would take me ages to find happiness again, and that I’d never be ready to trust someone again. As I said it’s fresh, so the honeymoon feelings are still very real, but I’ve never felt so safe and cared for in any other relationship, at any time in it. He just doesn’t give me anything to stress or worry about. We resolve our conflicts very well, and he honestly inspires me to become a better person, which I’ve also never felt before. I’m making leaps and bounds in therapy and combatting the lasting effects of being in an abusive situation such as PTSD, anxiety, and anger. He’s just so nice to me that it makes me want to be nothing but nice and caring back! And I don’t have to be the bigger person at all, it’s simply what he deserves for how he treats me and everyone else in his life.\n\nAfter being in an abusive situation; it feels impossible to trust again, but he proves to me time and time again that he appreciates me as I appreciate him, and that I am not being duped again, and that he does really care for me. I always like when he tells me he talks about me to his friends, but the fact that he’s talking about possibly proposing to me made me feel so unbelievably fuzzy. We’re both young, it might not happen that way, but the fact that he wants to right now and is voicing that makes me so happy. It’s also nice because I’ve known I wanted to get married eventually for a while, but could not imagine any of my exes at the end of the isle, for some reason? It just felt out of place, or unrealistic, or it just didn’t make sense as an image. \nI can imagine him clear as day though, and think about it sometimes.",

Not just momentarily, not just pretending — I’m truly content with where I’m at in life. I’ve wished for this for so long, and now that I’m here, it feels surreal.\n\nIt hasn’t been an easy journey. I’ve battled depression, mental health struggles, and navigated the storm of a toxic relationship with my mother. I’ve moved multiple times just to find peace, stability, and a sense of home. There were days I questioned if things would ever get better, if all this effort would be worth it. But I kept going. I chose healing. I chose myself.\n\nNow, I’m in a stable living situation with a steady job, and I’m studying nursing — something I’m passionate about because I want to help others the way I once needed help myself. It’s a demanding path, but I’m sticking with it, and I’m proud of my progress.\n\nI’ve also started focusing on my physical health — working out, eating better, taking it slow but steady. I finally have a gym I like and a workout plan that feels good. For once, I feel like I’m moving in the right direction in all areas of life.\n\nFamily-wise, I’ve set boundaries, and that’s given me peace. Personally, I’m connecting with someone who makes me feel safe, respected, and appreciated — things I used to only hope for. It’s still early, but I like the direction it’s going.\n\nMost importantly, I’m proud of who I am. I’ve worked so hard to heal and grow. I’ve turned pain into purpose. For the first time in a long time, I don’t feel like I’m just surviving — I’m living. And it feels amazing.\n\nIf you’re still in the middle of your storm, please don’t give up. You might not see it yet, but your peace is coming. It is possible. I’m living proof.\n\nThank you for reading — I just wanted to share my joy with someone.",

Welp, let me tell you a thing about my admin.\n\nMY PRINCIPAL IS AMAZING!! The dedication she has to our students and us teachers is absolutely awe inspiring. The kind of awe that makes a teacher want to follow their principal to their next green pasture. I think I have to be one of the most fortunate beginning teachers ever. Our community is *tough*, in *every* possible way, and she perseveres. Takes it all in stride and does what is best for the students and the community, every single time. She supports the students. She supports the staff. She is truly, truly the best. \n\nI love my principals. I can't believe how fortunate I am. \n\nI'm so happy!\n\nThank you for coming to this TEDTalk",

      "text": "This year has been a part of the worst period of my whole life, as stress from the Early College High School I go to and low self-esteem led me into serious depression. I have always been an all A's student, and I've always wanted to strive for something higher. Last year, I achieved the rank of Eagle Scout in the Scouting Program, and the year before that, I earned my Black Belt in Tae Kwon Do. However, I never felt like it was enough, especially since it always felt like my mind would betray me at times and I would always look at the negative things I've done versus the positive things (I have ADHD). All of these accumulating bad thoughts mixed with the stress from the Early College I was talking about, mixed with loneliness and consistent rude comments by my peers led me to feel like my life was crashing down around March of this year. I would have occasional good episodes since then, but the majority of the March-July period was plagued with awful feelings and negative thoughts that I believe no human being should ever have to go through. I was almost certain I had developed depression or bipolar disorder (Most likely the latter, as it runs in the biological family). However, I feel like in the past week my life has flipped around and I finally have my life in order! I have started working at Sonic, which is just a bike ride away from my house, and I've started going to the gym, which has totally boosted my self-esteem. Compared to about 2 weeks ago, where I was still undergoing agonizing sadness and loneliness, now I feel struck with happiness and purpose. I was so scared not long ago, but now I feel more certain than ever about my future, and I am so grateful for the change in mindset that I could cry tears of joy right now! Sorry for the long essay, I was just feeling really, really happy and I wanted to share my experience!",

      "text": "I was diagnosed with severe clinical depression at 12 years old, and for the next ten years of my life I was in and out of mental hospitals and struggling in almost every aspect of my life. When I made it to young adulthood, I got into my first relationship, which ended up being so toxic and emotionally devastating that I was left in an even worse state then before.\n\nOver a year ago I moved out of the house I shared with my ex and went back to my parents place, then I got a new job in a field related to my passion. There, I met the most incredible people who became my closest friends, and suddenly I found myself looking forward to every day that I got to go to work instead of dreading waking up in the morning like I used to. At first I didnt expect this stability to last—every day that passed I was anxiously waiting for everything to come crashing down around me. A month passed, and it didnt, then two months, six months, and now ten entire months have passed of me being in remission, without symptoms of depression, and I'm in the best place I've ever been in my life. I just graduated with my first college degree with a 4.0, and the relationship I'm currently in has been so mutually supportive and conducive to my growth as a person that it brings me to tears at the reminder of how I'm genuinely respected and loved so deeply. I'm no longer crying myself to sleep or isolated from everyone I care about—I'm making time to see friends multiple times per week, I can afford to travel regularly to see my partner who lives a couple hours away, and I'm pursuing my second degree at university to great success.\n\nPeople told me my whole life that it would get better, and the words felt so empty because I couldn't picture a future where I would actually want to be alive, but now I'm here and its real and I'm so grateful for this chance to still fill my lungs with air. I can't promise everyone that life will one day be perfect, but things will always change, and sometimes that change is in the most amazing way possible.",

It's a custom little leather notebook engraved with a world map with hearts in both of our countries and a dotted line connecting them. I'm planning on adding some cute little personalized artwork, writing, and map cutouts inside representing our journey. He's a huge map nerd, so I think he absolutely is going to adore it!!!\n\nWhat makes this so special to me is just how hard i've worked to make this happen. We both had not the best lives filled with many challenges, to put it lightly. This isn't just a love story, but a part of my own. I went from someone who was mute, anorexic, unable to even step a single foot outside of my house due to  disabling mental health conditions, to somebody who has faced some of my biggest fears (such as getting a job in retail), takes good care of my body, and am truly now see life through eyes of optimism and hope.

      "text": "Hello everybody!\n\nTo start, I used to just be your average standard white male, I was quite lost however from a young age because I did not really know what I wanted to do with my life.\n\nHigh school was never really a fun time for me, I hated studying and in general had okay grades but in my IGCSES, and A levels, not really in school exams, those had been a disaster. I just kinda refused to follow the system because my professors didn't really treat me as a person it felt like, more like a pest?\n\nEither way, I decided to apply to a local uni and managed to get into their psychology bachelor degree. I have to say that I never really wanted to study psychology, I always loved economics but was never really good at it, but nonetheless I tried my best and ended up receiving a 3.1/4 GPA which is quite good i'd say!\n\nI started uni during 2020, and ending now in 2025, in my country its normally 4 years, but I had quite a few issues with my health during 2023-2024, which caused me to take fewer classes thereby extending my degree time. \n\nEither way, I am now doing my thesis, and finishing up this semester. I am quite happy with what I have achieved, mostly because I did not really think I'd amount to anything. I am of course a bit scared for the future, especially about my masters or if I want to work, or what to do really. \n\nBut I really do wanna keep moving forward. Right now I am suffering with a weight issue, have been for my whole life, but in general I believe getting work for a year and focusing my main goal to losing the extra weight I have might be a priority than going for my masters.\n\nEither way, feels kinda good that I managed to get my life into a certain path or to mean something really. A lot of males I am sure are also feeling lost as well as women, never give up brothers and sisters, hope we can all unite during these troubling times, and I hope you all find something that also makes you happy in life!",

Before sharing his writing with anyone, he applies three self-editing techniques.\n\n# 1. Give it time\n\n>Time is a writer’s best friend. The work improves by being set aside and re-approached with fresh eyes. - *George Saunders*\n\n*Austin* *Kleon* suggests, *You need to let it sit for at least a day. Put it in the drawer and go out the door and come back to look at it with fresh eyes.*\n\nI keep multiple posts in different stages of drafting, allowing me to revisit them with a fresh perspective. This process helps refine my ideas and introduce new angles.\n\n# 2. Print it out\n\n>To write is human, to edit is divine. - *Stephen King*\n\nPrinting out a draft text and editing with a pencil in hand can be incredibly helpful. The goal is to create distance from the work you’ve poured so much effort into. You want to make it feel unfamiliar (almost as if someone else wrote it) so you can critique it with fresh eyes and make meaningful improvements.\n\nWhen I was office based, I printed out many documents because I found hard copies easier to edit. While I miss that convenience, I know the environment is better off for it.\n\n# 3. Read aloud\n\n>If you force yourself to read your writing aloud, you will hear things you missed on the silent page - repetitions, clumsy phrases, clichés and a general lack of rhythm. - *William Zinsser*\n\n*Austin* *Kleon* recounts, *Something I learned when I did an audiobook for the first time. Everyone should do the audiobook before they put the book out because when you have to read the text, you realise how bad it is. So one of the hacks I do is put on headphones and pull up the manuscript and read it like I would read it to an audiobook.*\n\nIn a similar vein, I read my blog post aloud and make amendments if the text does not flow. Then I record myself.\n\n# Other resources\n\n[*Creative Momentum*](https://abitgamey.substack.com/p/creative-momentum) post by *Phil Martin*\n\n[*Steal Like an Artist*](https://abitgamey.substack.com/p/steal-like-an-artist) post by *Phil Martin*\n\n*Austin Kleon* says, *Write the book you want to read.* I take this approach with my blog. So I know at least one person will like it.\n\nHave fun.\n\n*Phil…*",

      "title": "Reflecting on a Transformative Year: Teaching, Personal Growth and Finding Myself ",
      "text": "I’ve written a reflective post of my year that I was going to post but I don’t know how well it will go with people I know, so instead I’d like to share it here… \n\nThis year has been nothing short of transformative. After years of hard work, late nights, and moments of doubt, I finally completed my degree in teaching—a goal that once felt so far out of reach. For a long time, it was a dream others doubted I could achieve, but here I am, standing on the other side of that accomplishment with pride and gratitude.\n\nFinishing my degree wasn’t just about earning a qualification—it was about proving to myself that perseverance and dedication can turn even the most daunting goals into reality.\n\nBut the journey didn’t stop there. This year also marked the start of my career as a teacher. My first year in the classroom has been full of ups and downs, surprises, and so much growth. Teaching has challenged me in ways I never imagined but has also been one of the most rewarding experiences of my life. Helping young minds grow, seeing their lightbulb moments, and navigating the complexities of this role has reinforced why I chose this path.\n\nOn top of that, I took a leap of faith and moved far away to live in a remote area. My earlier experiences taught me the grounding and healing power of new environments, and I knew this move was exactly what I needed.\n\nLiving here has been a roller coaster of a time—eye-opening, challenging, and deeply rewarding. To experience the serenity and vastness of the landscape daily has been exactly what my heart and mind needed to reset and recharge. The quiet moments and connection to nature have reminded me what it means to truly live. It’s a slower, more intentional way of being, and it has given me a clarity I didn’t know I was missing.\n\nBecoming My True Self\nThis year has also deepened my journey of becoming my most authentic self. Transitioning has been a process of discovering, embracing, and becoming the person I’ve always known myself to be. With each passing year, the changes I’ve experienced—physically, emotionally, and mentally—have brought me closer to alignment with my true self.\n\nIt hasn’t always been an easy journey, but the rewards have been transformative. I’ve grown in confidence, self-acceptance, and pride in who I am. Living authentically is not just about external changes; it’s about stepping into life as the person I’ve always been, and I can honestly say I’ve never felt more at home in myself.\n\nThe Power of Connection\nOne of the most meaningful parts of this year has been the connections I’ve built with the people around me. Working alongside others, learning from diverse perspectives, and immersing myself in a rich culture of understanding have strengthened me in ways I didn’t expect. These experiences have helped me develop a deeper sense of belonging and purpose in my work and personal life.\n\nFinding common ground with others, sharing knowledge, and collaborating on meaningful goals have reminded me of the power of community, even in the most unfamiliar places. These relationships have been a source of inspiration and growth, showing me that connection is at the heart of resilience and fulfillment.\n\nThis year wouldn’t have been possible without the incredible people in my life. To everyone who has supported me, encouraged me, and believed in me—thank you. Your kindness and words of affirmation have kept me going when things felt overwhelming.\n\nA special acknowledgment goes to someone very dear to me who is no longer here. Their unwavering belief in me and their endless support are the reasons I’ve been able to accomplish all of this. I know their spirit has been with me every step of the way, and I truly wouldn’t be where I am without the love and encouragement they gave me.\n\nAnd, as if this year wasn’t full enough, I also added a new dog to my little fur family. Their companionship has been a constant source of joy, humor, and love, making my days brighter and my life richer.\n\nLooking back, this year has been about embracing change, leaning into challenges, and celebrating milestones that once felt impossible. Completing my degree, starting my teaching career, and building a life that feels authentically mine are things I’m immensely proud of.\n\nAs I welcome the new year, I carry with me the lessons of resilience, self-trust, and gratitude for how far I’ve come. Here’s to another year of growth, connection, and new adventures.\n\nHappy New Year, everyone—may it be kind, bold, and full of possibility.",

I’ve been getting out of the house more, trying new things, and putting a little more effort into dressing how I *want* to feel\n\nOne of the most unexpected but heartwarming things that’s happened is that I’ve been getting the sweetest compliments from older ladies about my outfits. It’s like their little words of encouragement are a hug for my soul.  Those moments have seriously boosted my confidence, and now I feel so much more comfortable stepping outside, enjoying the world and my own vibe <3",

I cannotttt stop staring at them like a lovestruck fool. \n\nI missed their smell, their laughter, the way the house feels when they’re around, their voices floating around the house, the way everything feels brighter when they’re near, literally EVERYTHING sooooo freaking much and the second they walked in I was like smother them in kisses and hugged them like I was never letting go ever againnnn.\n\nI dragged my mama to my new pilates place today and was literally gushing to everyone from the parking lot to the trainer to all the people around just beaming at everyone like hellooo hi THIS is my mama ☺️ Like a little kid showing off her favorite shiny toy to the ENTIRE world with sooooo much pride and joy. \n\nI’m 29 and I know I don’t look normal doing this probably look completely ridiculous but do I care? Nah, nope, nada not even one single bit. My mama and papa are the CUTEST cutiepattotie beans on this entire planet and I cannot stop obsessing over them. My heart is just bursting exploding into rainbow confetti. Like how are they so precious, who allowed this much cuteness to exist in two humans. \n\nRight now I’m literally just sitting here staring at them while they talk, grinning like a lovesick fool, heart going boom boom boom. I don’t even feel like talking much. I can’t even focus on answering their questions or what they’re saying just grinning like an idiot, feeling so overwhelmed and happy like my heart is too full.\n\nGod how blessed am I. How on earth did I get this lucky to have these two absolute angels as my parents 🥹💖 I feel like the luckiest, happiest little kid in the whole wide universe and I never ever ever ever want this feeling to end.",

The answer has been staring me in the face all along!\n\nI have tried everything from changing routines and exposure to different things, changing shower gels until i ended up with hypoallergenic baby shower gel, changing to different fabrics in clothes, etc.\n\nAnd today, after returning to my room, the answer finally hit me! \n\nI was just cuddling our husky puppy when the symptoms started again... the same husky puppy who we bought after a foster to adopt fell through, a foster who was a husky... who we had at the exact same time my pre-existing symptoms worsened.\n\n  \n...Symptoms that first began when, funnily enough, we adopted our now 2-year-old cat... the cat that used to curl up on my head to go to sleep... the cat who now prefers the outdoors, which explains why symptoms had improved slightly until the foster husky. \n\nI- How did I not piece this together!? I'm so excited to finally have figured it out, I thought I was going crazy because of how awful I felt 24/7 for 2 years! I'm not crazy, I'm just allergic to animal fur! \n\n(All of our other pets have either had short, wiry fur that i refuse to touch or go near because sensory issues, or they are a tortoise).\n\nEverything makes so much sense now, and I will probably be taking allergy medication until I can move out (not currently capable of living alone because disabilities, for context. Fun times).\n\nI hope that everybody has an awesome day. I'm so damn happy right now. I feel like when Penny in Big Bang Theory had the parenting book that she called 'The answer key to the Sheldon test'. \n\n:))))",

She said, “How are you doing todaaay, hun?” I replied, “I’m doing well.”\n\nThen she asked, “What do you want today, baby?” And after bringing me my order, she added, “You want a bag with that, baby?”\n\nI wish I could imitate her exact slang—it was so warm and natural. Boy, I felt so happy inside. 😂 A grown man like me being called baby and honey!

      "text": "https://preview.redd.it/ic6npxscwyif1.png?width=640&format=png&auto=webp&s=adf0282a9aa6fa2a184be8d7eb0210c390b07eab\n\nSo last weekend I discovered an indie movie called Turbo Kid. Before I can explain why it's turned into such a big deal for me I need to give you a quick over view of my health.\n\nI have a degenerative neurological issue of some kind. Given that after the last round of tests I am being sent to an MS specialist, I have a theory that will be the diagnosis. It makes doing anything very hard, between functionality issues and pain.\n\nI had seen the trailer for the movie Turbo Kid and it was something I wanted to see. I mentally added it to the list of 45,861 movies I wish I could see.\n\nLast Saturday night I felt well enough to try to watch something and I picked Turbo Kid cause it was the last trailer I had seen. Not only was I able to watch it and enjoy it without my issues getting in the way but I got to watch it with my spouse, something that only can happen every few months, if not only once or twice a year a year anymore.\n\nWe both loved the movie, and since then we put on the soundtrack for the movie or the game all the time cause we love it and they're both incredible and it helps bolster and continue my happy mood.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/p0l7zpxcxyif1.png?width=1080&format=png&auto=webp&s=64ce623e47b8194e991d306df5e8b270aa47658d\n\nThere is also an 16-bit Turbo Rider game that I have been playing as much as the pain will let me. Though between Sunday evening and last night that only amounted to about 5 hours. When I'm playing it I am giddy, having fun, and not thinking on my health. Something that happens very rarely anymore.\n\nI know it may seem silly but this little indie film and subsequent game and soundtracks have brought me back to my pre-degredation self even if only for a time. And now when things get bad, and they have gotten bad since my spouse and I can now play the music and do our best to smile through it together.\n\nIt's made me so happy I had to share that happiness somewhere. I hope it's okay I shared it here.",

It took me about 45 minutes or so and I definitely struggled with getting the lug nuts loose but I did it!! I went home that night and rolled some slots on grizzly's quest just to treat myself.  \nThe best part was when an older guy stopped to ask if I needed help and I got to say 'thanks I got it'. It might feel like a simple adult milestone for other ppl but I'm genuinely proud of myself :D",

The kind where you wake up tired and go to bed more tired, wondering if anything you do really matters. But when I opened Reddit and saw that tiny golden hand glowing under my comment, it instantly made me smile in a way I haven’t in a while. \nIt wasn’t just the award itself, but the fact that someone cared enough to actually spend something of theirs just to say they felt like I was worth acknowledging.\n\nI know it’s small, but it made me feel seen. And that feeling? Honestly priceless.\n\nSo, to whoever gave me that award: thank you from the bottom of my heart. You probably have no idea how much you brightened my day.\n\n💛✨",

Which, being pregnant and baby boy wanting pizza and and tacos consistently is a bit of a nightmare. \n\nAnyways, I found a pizza chain whose bread doesn't spike my blood sugar!\n\n Like yes, i still need to take insulin, but to put into perspective, my blood sugar after breakfast (yogurt and walnuts, 45g of carbs, 40 units of insulin) was 144. My sugar after this 70g of carbs, bread wrapped, pepperoni cheesy goodness with 36 units of insulin was 115. \n\nAnd this pattern is consistent - so it's a win that I can have something I'm desperately craving without my blood sugar hurting my baby :D",

      "text": "So TLDR on this one, i started working again in April, after a very long unemployment stint, before April i was unemployed for 18 months of the prior 2 years, during this time i very obviously fell behind on alot of bills, i was barely keeping afloat by taking personal loans from friends and family, i was Ubering on the side as much as i could while collecting unemployment, doing hundreds of apps a week, all in all just slowly drowning in debt as i fought off eviction most months.\n\nI would let certain bills go cause i needed to pay more important bills, i would let certain utilities turn off that were less important so i can make sure the other ones stayed on....etc.... it was a very bad time, and all the while i was falling further and further behind on everything, including child support for my 2 kids, it was at the point my ex was taking me to court, in total i owed like 12,000 in child support from the unemployment, i tried my best to make some payments when i could but more often than not i ended the weeks with negative funds and i was doing all i could to not go homeless....\n\nWell the week of the court hearing for the issue i finally landed a job offer, and the job offer was a good one..it felt TO good personally and i had some misgivings but it was enough for the court to give me a little leniency to start working and attempt to get back on track, the first step was i had 2 moths to pay 3,000 in arrears (while keeping current on normal child support) which i did so i was not put in jail.... so thats good...\n\nNow here we are in august, im still working, and still making my payments, iv caught up on most of my back utilities, I'm over halfway paid up on the owed child support from the past 2 years, im paying back some of my personal, friend and family loans slowly. I still usually limp to my next check in most cases, but its a limp with a few hundred left over after making all my payments, and that's by design. I generally give my self like 2-300 of a buffer to use to get me from check to check, and i throw all of the rest of my income into paying debt off as fast as i can,\n\nI am on track to be caught up with child support by end of November and once thats sorted i can take the money i will now have and throw it into some of my other debts to pay those off as fast as i can.\n\ni am in a much better place overall so im just happy about that",

I also finally beat my father at a game of Snooker, which genuinely made my day, for context he is an ex top 100 In the World Snooker Rankings, he had a few drinks and isn't as good as he used to be but I still celebrated alot. The best part of my day wasn't even that though, their is this adorable and beautiful girl in my life who I had been crushing on for as as I could remember, she wished me happy birthday and asked me if I wanted to hang out sometime. Ofcourse I said yes and as I'm writing I've just come back from the best date ever. After I decided to go to a bar with my father and tried alcohol for the first time (it's legal in the UK at my age) and after my parents surprised me with a motorbike. This was just the best fucking day ever!",

Think… The Poison Maiden of Ancient India, Aswang of Philippines, Calon Arang of Indonesia, Gumiho from South Korea, And so many more!!! \n\nI can’t wait to share them all!!!! \n\nI think I’m starting to realize I’m actually a tiny gremlin or a menace… but hey! It’s a fun kinda menace, right?!?",

I tried to pay for my meal one day and the card declined.   \n  \nI didn't know what that meant at the time so i asked a random older lady if she could tell me what it means. She told me it means I have no money, and so she took out *her* credit card, and paid for my lunch for me. I don't think I've ever thanked someone so many times in my life and it still doesn't feel like enough. I wish there were more words in the english language to express how much that meant to me. I don't think I'll ever forget that. It made me want to be a kinder person.",

      "text": "TLDR: my queerplatonic partner (who I was just friends with at the time) bought me In Stars and Time on a whim of wanting to get me interested in it. It caused me to fall down a rabbit hole of content before finding a separate discord server themed around it where I've met 6 of the most wonderful human beings and caused me to become closer to the original friend to the point of a relationship.\n\n  \nLast year I was not in a good mental health state (it's still not amazing, but better). My friend (who I'll call L, they use any pronouns) who I had been talking to for around a month or so brought up how they could afford to buy me an indie game they recommended, In Stars and Time. Go play this game if you haven't already, I'm not spoiling anything but PLEASE go play.  They bought it for me because they wanted me to get hyperfixated on it so I would talk to them about it. First playing it, I didn't think it was my game.\n\n  \nI now have 122 hours in it and have almost 100%ed it apart from one achievement that barely anyone has it, working up to it though!! This game has made me bawl my eyes out, has made me laugh and has both emotionally ruined me and helped me at the same time. L fueled me through this game by pinging me in spoiler free posts on Tumblr which lead me to find a specific AU I found interesting. I followed it and noticed they had a community discord which I figured I'd join because why the hell not. I made a stupid joke in reference to the au (a particular character was stuck in a room you can only unlock late game in the au) and the discord roles named after the main character (Siffrin) and a major character (Loop). I made a joke about how there should be a time-out mode for people with the Loop role so they'd only be able to talk in The Room channel. It led to two secret channels (one themed after each role) which then spiralled into a roleplay with everyone. \n\nSix people plus L stood out, C (they/she), P (also they/she) M (any/all), W (also any/all) B (he/him) and Ly (it/its) \n\nThese people are so fucking wonderful. They're the sweetest people I've ever spoken to, they're so kind and caring and funny and just the most wonderful people. There's a bunch of inside jokes we all have, we all affectionately bully each other over silly things, they're all so creative (P has a 20000 word story which she's written in just over a week, C has the most Fucked Up characters and most beautiful art, Ly drew art for a Stomach Book album cover!! (thats so fucking cool!! what do you mean im friends with it?!) B has amazing art and stories too, M is amazing with their story writing). Through this, me and L wrote characters together that caused us to become closer. We made up silly one-off stories or AUs, he drew my characters with his constantly, she's bought me more and more gifts too without me asking (I'm not the kind of person to ask for those things, I feel bad lol). and through this we opened up to each other more, I know a lot of things about them that no one else knows and vice versa. in March I got the courage to ask them  if she wanted to be in a queerplatonic relationship with me and she said yes.\n\n  \nMy friends have listened to my 1 am breakdowns without judgement, reassuring me and supporting me. One caught on to a way I was texting and helped me through that without even realising. \n\n  \nAll of this feels very ironic and fitting considering the main themes of the game but still. Shout out to this stupid indie-timeloop game for causing me to find the best people I know.",

      "text": "Our last foster had gotten adopted, so we went to the shelter for another one and asked which one needed the most help. The staff introduced to a white, young adult pittie named Moe. He came to the shelter from a hoarding case as a puppy with mange. His leg also hadn't developed properly, likely due to growing up in a cage. His mange had been cured, but his behavioral issues needed work. He had been at the shelter for 6 months. He had a cage mate, but he had been separated since he ended up fighting. We have other dogs at home, so this was a risk. \n\nWe agreed to take the risk and decided to foster him. He had to be carried to and from the car, as he refused to move otherwise. He was set in a crate. At first, he growled at the other dogs from the crate, and we weren't sure if this was going to work. We slowly introduced him to the other dogs until he no longer showed aggression towards them. We left the crate door open, but he stayed in there for days at a time.\n\n A couple months passed, and he had received zero adoption interest. Rescues wouldn't take him since he's a pittie. We know he needs a special kind of home, and that the average adopter may not be able to meet his needs and respect his boundaries. If triggered, he could end up biting someone and get euthanized. So, we decided to adopt him. Ever since, he has been a complete mama's boy. He is the snuggliest out of all our dogs and demands to go for walks. We also adopted a younger dog for him to play with since our other dogs are older. He is still wary of other people, but he is the least reactive. He passes by other people and dogs out on walks without barking. He loves car rides and is very well behaved during them. This is substantial considering he used to be scared of going in the car. \n\nI post this story to hopefully inspire others to visit their local shelter and give a dog a second chance.",

      "title": "I replaced social media with reading and my brain finally started healing",
      "text": "A few months ago, I came home from work, collapsed on my bed, and did the usual: mindlessly scrolled TikTok until my brain was mush. I kept telling myself, “I deserve this -I’m tired, I need to decompress.” But let’s be honest, it wasn’t helping. I wasn’t relaxed. I was numb. I wanted to feel better, get smarter, improve my focus…but I didn’t have the energy. Then I read Atomic Habits, and something clicked. I didn’t need to change everything. \n\nI just needed to start tiny.\n\nSo I ran a little experiment:\n- 10-minute walk after dinner (no gym, no pressure)\n- One short HIIT workout on days I had the energy\n- And most importantly: I replaced TikTok with a short daily reading habit.\n\nInstead of grabbing my phone and doomscrolling the moment I got bored, I swapped the TikTok icon with a reading app and committed to 15 minutes every night before bed. I also stacked listening to audiobooks with things I was already doing - at the gym, while cleaning, even in the shower. (Shoutout to Atomic Habits for the idea: pair a new habit with an existing one and it’ll actually stick.) Over time, it became muscle memory - and way more satisfying than doomscrolling.\n\nThe first week was HARD. I’d still open my phone looking for TikTok out of habit. But slowly… my brain stopped craving dopamine hits and started craving actual stories and ideas. After 60 days, I’d finished 8 books (more than I read all last year), my sleep improved, my brain fog eased, and weirdly enough - I felt more myself again.\n\nHere are some underrated tips that helped me break free from social media brain rot and rebuild my focus:\n\n- Hide the app, change the trigger. Replacing TikTok with a reading app where the icon used to be actually works.\n- Don’t read to be productive - read to enjoy. Pick short, fun stuff at first.\n- Habit stack like a boss. Link your reading time to routines: tea time, brushing your teeth, or commuting.\n- If you’re too tired to read, listen. Audiobooks count. No gatekeeping here.\n- Make it visible. Keep your current read on your lock screen or desk. Reminders work.\n- Track books, not screen time. Seeing your “books finished” list grow is more satisfying than you think.\n\n\nSome resources that helped me A TON (besides therapy):\n\nBooks:\n- Atomic Habits by James Clear - Insanely good habit science meets real-life hacks. Best book for anyone who’s ever felt stuck in a rut. It changed how I think about motivation and momentum.\n- Digital Minimalism by Cal Newport - This one will make you rethink your entire relationship with tech. Powerful read. If you’ve ever felt like your brain’s fried 24/7, read this.\n- The Power of Now by Eckhart Tolle - A spiritual classic that’s actually digestible. If your anxiety spirals at night, this one will feel like a warm blanket for your mind.\n\n\nTools:\n- MadFit (YouTube): My go-to for low-effort, high-reward movement. Her 10-minute apartment-friendly workouts are perfect for days when the gym feels impossible. No talking, just music and good vibes.\n\n- BeFreed: My brother at UC Berkeley put me on this. It’s a smart reading / book summary app that’s perfect if you’re too busy to read full books or struggle to stay consistent. You can choose how you want to read: 10-min skims, 40-min deep dives, or 20-min fun storytelling versions of dense non-fiction. I usually listen to the fun storytelling mode while commuting or at the gym - it helps me actually enjoy books I used to find way too dry. If one really hooks me, I’ll switch to the 40 mins deep dive. I was super skeptical at first, but after testing it with a book I’d already read, I was shocked - it covered 95% of the key points and examples. I honestly don’t think I’ll ever spend 15+ hours reading a non-fiction book again.\n\n- Forest:  This app helped me stay off my phone while reading. You plant a little tree that grows as you stay focused - and dies if you leave to scroll 😭. Weirdly motivating, especially paired with short reading sessions.\n\nReading literally saved my mental health. I used to feel so drained all the time, constantly comparing myself to people online, scrolling to escape. Now, I read to come back to myself. If you’re in that stuck, burnt-out place - this is your sign. Try one small switch. One short read. One walk without your phone. It really adds up.\nAnd if no one’s told you lately: you’re not broken. You’re just tired. Start small. You got this. 💛",

      "text": "I originally posted this on r/relationshipgoals, but was advised to share here. Please remove post if not allowed.\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nHi, I'm kind of new to reddit, so not sure if this is the right place to post this, but I just needed to brag about my wife somewhere. Apologies for the long post.\n\nSo fairly recently I got back into reading after a long dry spell and I had no idea where to start. The previous Christmas I had gotten my wife a Kindle though, so she fortunately had plenty of recommendations for me. Well, I say fortunately, but she was (and is) mostly reading things like ACOTAR, which really isn't my cup of tea. Nevertheless, I finished them so she could vent to me about Tamlin and whatnot, and that seemed to make her really happy.\n\nStill not sure what I was looking for, I decided to follow her recommendation one more time and read something she described as \"light-hearted, sarcastic comedy in a fairytale world\", which sounded great. Yup, she got me again, romance and smut galore. The non-romantic stuff, however, actually matched her description and I had a great time reading it. Not only that, but it really inspired me.\n\nI wrote a couple of books in our native language during my late teens/early twenties, but to be fair they were quite generic and only about 300 pages long. I still like them, but they're not the most original works. Reading these comedy books recommended by my wife opened my eyes though. I don't have to write \"properly\" and in a serious tone? I can make my main character kind of a sarcastic asshole and make stupid references, etc? I can write in English, just 'cause I think their words for stuff sound cooler?\n\nLong story short, I wrote a book. It took me the better part of a year and there was a lot of proofreading and editing at the end. My wife, amazing as she is, cheered me on along the way and helped in whatever ways she could. She also encouraged me to release the book in Amazon Bookstore for next to nothing, just so that friends, family, and maybe the occassional could get to read it too.\n\nWhen the time came to release it, however, my wife was starting to act kind of distant about the whole thing. I suggested we celebrate the occasion somehow (which we usually like to do, even for smaller things), but only got non-committal responses. I didn't think much of it, but then suddenly, some time later (but still before the date of publication) my wife came around and agreed that we should do something as a small celebration, like go to a slightly fancier restaurant and order some champagne.\n\nThe evening arrived and as we arrived in the \"restaurant district\" of our city, my wife started leading me towards a place I'd never even noticed before. I was slightly surprised, but figured she had heard about it from a friend or something and wanted to try it out. Boy had I been underestimating her.\n\nAs we entered, I was met with cheers, golden banners, music, people dressed in suits and nice dresses, and champagne galore. As it turns out, for the last couple of months, my wife had been organizing a book release party for me, complete with custom merch, a signing station with laminated pictures of my book cover (since the book was digital only) and a freaking journalist from the local paper to interview me.\n\nIt was the sweetest, most thoughtful thing I had ever experienced. I'm a bit of an introvert, but I went around, hugging everyone and smiling like a fool the whole time. It was truly amazing and I still can't believe she did all that for me, I'm so lucky to have her and every day I try to make sure she knows that.",

      "text": "I truly doubted about posting this cause it could be seen as bragging... but Ive seen the butterfly effect its had, and I know I was inspired by other stories of acts of kindness. So, feeling very shy, here I go :) \n\nLast Tuesday I was walking around my block and I saw a sign taped to a wall: \"Dont leave stuff here, next time we will call the police\". It was in a place thats a bit protected from the elements and sometimes homeless people sleep there. \n\nI was so angry. What was wrong with people? It was in a part of the building that doesnt have car access, barely anyone passes, no doors close, I could not think of a reason anyone could care if someone slept there. The homeless people weve had in our neighbourhood never have caused any trouble, some have stayed for months and are quiet, respectful and *just want to be able to exist in peace*, dammit. \n\nI mulled over it all day. I told some neighbours, they got pissed too. I said I was going to put another sign, answering back. My neighbours (Jason) girlfriend (Mary) said, we should bring them something to eat! I thought it was a great idea! I couldnt at that moment, but we would do it in the evening. \n\nI am part of an urban vegetable garden, so I went to see if there was any fruits or veggies I could pick up from the common areas. I found my friend Grace there, told her the story, she sympatized a lot and helped me gather fruits, small branches of grapes that were still left on the vines from the past harvest. I thanked her so much, I wouldnt have found so much without her help. \n\nJason and Mary couldnt go that day in the end, so I went alone to where the sign was. I found 3 people close and I politely asked if theh knew what the sign was all about. One of them said it was cause of him... he had left some clothes there. He kept em in some bushes now. I must have gotten an angry face cause he said it was okay, he didnt mind keeping em in the bushes. \n\nI told em some neighbours were very mad at the situation, and showed him two signs:\n- One, for the wall: \"Is it really that difficult to have compassion for someone who doesnt have a refuge? If theyre not creating trouble, littering, or leaving around objects that could hurt pets or children, what is the problem? If it hurts your sighr so much, give them a curtain.\"\n\"To whoever put this sign: I hope karma never leaves you in a situation when you have to carry your sleeping bag all day with you for fear of it being stolen. To whoever felt mensced by this sign: not all of us neighbours hate you. You are people and deserve to be treated as such:. \n\n- A second one, in the bag with food I brought: \"A loving reminder that not all neighbours despise you. Im not the only one that despised that sign. At least as far as Im concerned, and no matter how long or short of a period you stay here, as long as were all civic, respectful and safe, WE ARE NEIGHBOURS. These are some fresh fruits, picked this afternoon, i Hope you enjoy them\".\n\nThe man, and his friends (kids that lived in the block and apparently had known this person for years with no problem) were so touched. He took the note and put it with so much care inside his backpack. We hugged, then I remembered (duh) to ask for his name! And I realized I had seen him before! His name is Emilio. I gave him a bit bottle of cold water and some canned food last August. Hes very nice and polite. \n\nHe told me some neighbours had been throwing trash at him from the upper windows, even water... trying to make him leave. My blood boiled. He was actually very understanding. Apparently, a year ago someone else had put a bunch of clothes where he was sleeping, put gasoline on them and set em on fire. He understood people could have gotten scared... he was taking it all with so much grace and understanding, I dont think I would have been capable. Apparently the person who put the original sign came to talk to him, apologized and gave him a coffee. But didnt take the sign off. And also, people were *throwing stuff at him*. I hanged my sign right next to the other one.\n\nThe wonderful thing... is that the next day Grace, my vegetable garden friend, called me. Told me she had been so sad about that sign, she had cooked several meals for this man, but she was in a rush, could I go pick em up and give them to him? OF COURSE!!!! There was actually so much that I gave him half and kept the other half in my fridge to give him some days later 😅\n\nBut my neighbours Jason and Mary still are going to bring him something to eat, they bought some melons. And yesterday I told the story to my dad... and when I mentioned Emilio putting so lovingly the note I gave him in his half-broken backpack, he stood up saying he was sure he had some backpacks somewhere he wasnt using and it could help!\n\nAnd... one sign brought another. My idea of the sign brought Marys idea of food, which I borrowed. Then Grace upped that two orders of magnitude xD then my dad got invested too. \n\nAnd all of us could have looked at the sign and said nothing, or heard the story and do nothing... but this week, Emilio woke up to a menacing sign- and by the end of it, he has received fruits, toilet paper, a water bottle, some plastic, easy to transport cutlery, food for a whole week (Jesus, Grace xD) and when I go to see him again hell receive 2 new backpacks and a suitcase (my dad insists I give him all options to choose, or for him to keep all). \n\nAnd... it kinda makes my heart sing! ^^ Years ago I wouldnt have had any idea what to do. Ive seen so many videos of people just, extending kindness, that the idea of letting know (whoever it was, I didnt know I knew the man already) that they were respected came to my mind. I know seeing that kind of content inspired me, and started a chain of events.\n\nSo I really dont want this to be ablut me- its about Emilio. It could be about Grace cause, damn, I only wanted to have a small detail with whoever it was, but she must have cooked for hours (spent time, ingredients, containers), and even asked me where he was in case another day she brought more xD \n\n\nBut mostly, I wanna share in case this inspires someone, like other content inspired me in the past 🥰\n\n- Edited to change names, as Ive seen its correct Reddit etiquette 😅",

A few weeks ago, I noticed a small note near the register—she was trying to get custody of her 10-year-old brother after losing both parents. No drama, just… quietly trying to keep her family together.\n\nPeople started pitching in. A few regulars donated. Someone made a GoFundMe. The café owner matched it. One of the knitting ladies who comes in every morning gave $1,000. It spread a little, and they raised enough to cover legal costs and then some.\n\nShe found out during a shift and just stood there wiping the counter with tears in her eyes. Now her little brother comes in sometimes after school with his backpack and a muffin, doing homework at the corner table.\n\nIt’s been one of the most quietly beautiful things I’ve ever seen.",

At first, I figured my dad had asked someone to help out while we were gone. But when I asked him, he was surprised to see the tidy garden as well.\n\nThe next morning, I looked outside and saw our 70-something neighbor quietly weeding, gloves on, just whistling to himself like it was a regular part of his day. I was curious why he was doing this, and he just said, “Didn’t want you coming home to a mess,” smiled, and strolled casually back to his yard.\n\nI don’t even know what to say. He took this time to help us out when he could have spent it on himself or anywhere else. Some people have their own quiet ways of expressing kindness, and it is absolutely heartwarming.\n\nEdit + Update: The day after I found out, we made him a big homemade apple pie using my mom’s recipe, he absolutely loved it! And as a proper thank-you, we’re taking him out to dinner tomorrow.",

I was confused and so was my twin but my dad said he remembered being told it a few weeks ago!!\n\nMore recently, he drove me and my twin 30 minutes to view a movie we'd been looking forward to! When we got back we were talking about it in the car.\n\nLater, my twin saw our dad on the wiki LITERALLY researching the movie and it's lore!!! By choice!! I just thought it was so heartwarming that he was doing that to understand our interests, and it means so much to me as small and insignificant as it may seem :))) I love my dad so so much 💖",

While chatting, she mentioned she’d send me extra money so I could buy an iPhone. I told her I didn’t need it, that I’d get a cheaper Android later. She paused, then said, “I just want to see my kid have an iPhone like others, not Android.”\n\nThis is the same woman who’s been using her phone since 2018, wears the same old shoes, and still wants to send *me* money for something she’d never buy for herself.\n\nI don’t want her money—I want her to have everything she sacrifices for me. But this Thanksgiving, I’m grateful for her selfless love. ❤️",

      "text": "Today, while in a cab, I stopped at a red light and witnessed something truly heartwarming in just under five minutes.\n\nAn elderly woman, likely a street vendor, stood by the roadside when a well-dressed man approached her and touched her feet as a way of paying respect in our Indian culture. That’s what caught my attention. He asked where she had been, mentioning that he had been looking for her elsewhere. Then, with genuine concern, he inquired about her well-being and whether she had everything she needed.\n\nI then noticed that both her feet were in bandages and covered with shoes, indicating that a dressing had been done. The man gestured toward her feet and asked if she was okay, to which she reassured him that she was fine and thanked him. Before leaving, he touched her feet once again, asking for her blessings. She placed both her hands on his head and wholeheartedly blessed him.\n\nIn a world where so much is done for likes and content, this moment felt incredibly pure. No cameras, no audience—just a simple, powerful exchange of kindness and respect. It left my eyes wet for a moment because I could truly feel the warmth in it.\n\nI don’t have any video proof, just this moment that I witnessed—and that was enough.",

      "text": "This is going back close to 12 years now, but the impact of what happened has stuck with me.\n\nBack then, I used to work for a call center as an agent. Now I am a quiet, and introverted person. Most times, people don’t notice me because I keep to myself and keep my head down while I work. BUT, I am also the sort of person that pays attention to the things around me and if I say something, it is generally short but very relevant/impactful.\n\nThe General Manager (and later CO) at the place I worked, I’ll call him MS, was a man who could be friendly one moment and raging up a storm the next. He never once insulted staff but he still intimidated others when he got angry. He also had an absolute love for Australian cricket, and every Friday without fail, he would send a company-wide (30 staff members in all) email with the weekly results. I think only he cared but nobody dared speak ill of his cricket.\n\nOne day, we had a virus attack our systems and after IT purged it, MS sent a company-wide email about the importance of not opening unknown links or attachments and to report any suspicious emails.\n\nI don’t know what possessed me to do it, but I hit “Reply All” and sent back something along the lines of \"Now that you mention it, I have been getting these strange emails every week detailing Australian cricket scores.\"\n\nIt is no word of a lie when I say the whole building went quiet. I mean, after I sent that email I genuinely thought I F’D up. But then you could hear MS’ belly laugh roar through the entire building (I resumed breathing at that point). What I hadn’t realized at that time though, is that by sending that email, I fell on his radar.\n\nAfter that, he would approach me – especially during work events – and we would talk. Whenever there was a team leader position open, he would ask me why I didn’t apply, and I would tell him, that I didn’t feel confident in my abilities. At no point did he ever push me into taking a role I didn’t want. But he would listen and make a comment about how he thought I would be good for the role, but never pushed.\n\nIn time, his confidence in me did help, and while he was still working for the company, I became a trainer and even later took on an HR role. Eventually, MS would have to leave the company due to health reasons, but every now and then our paths would cross. The last I spoke with him was back in 2020, and I was happy to tell him I became a team leader. MS had been happy to hear that and he told me that he knew I had it in me.\n\nMS passed away from his illness a few weeks later, but his belief in me stayed with me. When I had to leave the company we both worked at, I knew my worth. When I joined a company that was abusive to its staff, I did not put up with it. When I found another company that I enjoyed working at, I was confident to see myself learn and grow.\n\nToday, I have accepted a managerial position in my company and wish I could share the news with MS. I know he would have been proud and told me that he knew I had it in me.",

      "text": "Two years ago, my sister and mother were in a car accident that almost cost them their lives. It was bad, the entire car was crushed and in blazes. Since then, even though they both lived and have recovered for the most part, I have found it hard to be thankful or in the Christmas spirit. But this year as I was buying some turkeys to give to my church's turkey drive for the food bank, I overheard a stressed out mom, with her five or six yr old son, complaining about some dead beat dad and that she couldn't afford a few microwave meals to feed them until payday.  \nI turned around and I paid it for them and handed them a $20 for whatever they needed and asked why the son only had on ripped jeans and an old T shirt with the cold weather. The mom admitted that she couldn't afford to get either of them anything warm to wear.\n\nSo, me being the over prepared Boy Scout I am for campouts and also lazy for not taking my pack out of the car yet, I had a few extra jackets and all that in the car. So I asked if they would like to follow me out and see if any of it fits them. The mom said she couldn't ask me to do that but I said that if my mom heard of that and I didn't do whatever I could for them, I would never hear the end of her anger.  \nSo they came out to the car and I gave them a few things to keep them warm.\n\nShe insisted that she couldn't take it from me and not pay me back so I told them the story of two years ago and how when I needed it most, I had one single person there for me and it was time I paid it forward and the best way to pay me back was, once able to, pay it forward themselves. \n\nIt is safe to say that I can now see a reason to be thankful for everything this year and I just hope that I can make a difference in more people's lives like I was maybe able to do for them.",

      "text": "This isn't a tear-jerker, but I've (48m) been married to my wife (46f) for 26 years and we have 3 kids. I work a full time corporate job and have been working evenings part time as a bartender for the last 2 years to bring in extra income. After working fine dining the last 2 years, last week I started working at a hotel bar, nothing fancy, but like a mid-level hotel, like a Holiday Inn.\n\nAnyway, last night I'm coming back from the kitchen and I come back at the bar to see my father in law seated at one of the bar stools. He said he just wanted to come see the bar and see how I was doing. He ordered a quick drink and went on his way after about 10 minutes. My mother in law was in the car on a call from family overseas during all this. He then asked if I was off on Friday, which I am, so he told me not to make plans at night so we can go watch Superman at the movies.\n\nAgain, not a quick story that is going to ask who's cutting onions near you, but we all hear horror stories about terrible in laws. I'm 48 years old now and this man is so different from the man I met when I was 21. He looks after me like his own son and doesn't seek out time with his other son in law like he does with me. Time, and his grandchildren, have softened him. \n\nI truly love that man. Have a great day, everyone!",

      "text": "Had an interview for a role I wasn’t even sure I wanted. I was mainly treating it as practice. But during the chat, the interviewer straight-up said, “You’re clearly well-prepared. Ever considered aiming higher?” Ohh, wait what?\n\nI didn't actually prepare specifically for this interview, but I was very interested in the position. I prepared extensively, researching relevant IQB (interview question bank), finding YouTube videos, and practicing with mock interviews. The night before, I recorded a few answers using Beyz interview helper (camera on, timer running). It was awkward at first, but it helped me sort out some of the messiness.\n\nThe next day, I wasn't rushed or dazed like usual. I was just... focused. When the interviewer asked follow-up questions, I actually loved being able to improvise. It was a much more pleasant conversation than the mock interview. He felt I didn't need to build experience from scratch cuz I had already done a lot of preparation. He suggested I apply to better companies! I haven't heard such a positive response in a long time...\n\nThis company might not be what I was looking for, but just that conversation gave me more confidence than I thought I would.\n\nHas anyone else experienced an unexpectedly powerful interview moment? One where you're unsure at first, but then come out feeling a little proud?",

      "title": "My mom sacrificed everything for us — she’s my hero",
      "text": "My mom married young. My dad used to beat her almost every day. I still remember those moments like movie scenes: my mom crying, and me — just a little kid with tears in my eyes — hugging her and whispering, “Don’t cry, Mom.” Then I would cry with her.\n\nOne day, my dad left us and went to France. At that time, my brother and I were still in elementary school. Mom was still young and beautiful, and she could have divorced him, built a new life, and found a healthy relationship (something she truly needed). But instead, she made her decision based on us. She didn’t think of herself at all.\n\nShe devoted all her time to raising us, making sure we never went down the wrong path. She even made my dad stay in contact so we wouldn’t feel abandoned. Only later did I realize how much effort she put into protecting us from that pain. She even made excuses for him, so we wouldn’t think he left because of us.\n\nWhen we reached middle school, many kids our age were already drinking and using drugs, but she made sure that didn’t happen to us. She was so strong. She never let us feel that we didn’t have a father to protect us.\n\nI’ll never forget one day when I got into a fight with another kid. I beat him up, and later his dad came and slapped me. It didn’t even hurt, but I cried like a baby — not because of the slap, but because deep down I felt the absence of my own dad. Some man told me, “Don’t cry, you’re a man.” I wished I could explain why I was crying. But my mom didn’t let it slide — she actually confronted that man and slapped him back. That was her: always making sure we never felt “less.”\n\nShe did all of this while fighting breast cancer, which came back several times — both before and after my dad left. And she beat it. She is the strongest woman I know.\n\nNow my mom is 55, but she looks much older, like 75. She sacrificed decades of her life for us. I want her to live long, at least to 75 and beyond, and I want to pay her back, even if it’s only 0.0001% of what she gave us.\n\nOne day I asked her if she ever felt scared staying home alone with just us kids. She said: “I lived every night in fear.”\nThat broke me. As a child, I never realized it. I thought she wasn’t afraid at all, because she always acted strong for us. After she told me that, I went to my room and cried.\n\nThis post describes only 0.0001% of what my mom went through for us. Even a movie wouldn’t do her story justice. I just needed to share it, because nobody knows what tomorrow will bring.\n\nI hope one day I’ll have the courage to tell her all of this to her face. But I know it will make her cry, and I don’t want to do that to her again.\n\nMy dad is dead now. I used to hate him, but honestly, I didn’t really know him. I don’t know if my mom forgives him, but I think I do. He didn’t leave us for another family or betray her in that way. I don’t know why he left, but I hope one day — in the afterlife, if it exists — I can ask him.\n\nFor now, all I know is: my mom is my hero.",

      "text": "I was getting really nervous about “move in” day and having to do it all alone. For some context, I (30F) am a teacher and after being at the same school for 6 years, was just recently reassigned due to budget cuts. I will now be teaching a new grade level, in a new building, with all new staff and administration. I’ve had many big feelings about this, and have cried so much over leaving all of my friends behind, but regardless I am thankful to have a job.\n\nThis week, my new classroom was done being cleaned so I was allowed to go in and pick up my keys to start moving. I had been so nervous about this move because I was going to have to do the big haul by myself in order to maximize the time left before school starts. My husband was denied the time off and he works long hours, and it just didn’t seem fair to ask anyone else in my family to take time off work to help me move. I also have a baby, so I was prepared to have to wear him in his carrier and tackle the boxes and furniture on my own. \n\n(I think it’s also important to note that all of my teacher friends also got disbursed to a different building so they had to move their own stuff.. another reason I felt like I shouldn’t ask them for help.)\n\nWell yesterday morning, I went to pick up my classroom keys..\n\nAnd when I arrived back home, my brother in law was already parked in my driveway and waiting to help me get loaded up!! \n\nShortly after, my teacher friend pulled in with coffee in hand (for me) and also ready to help!! \n\nIn 1 hour we had all 3 cars loaded up and ready to go, and by noon we had moved most of my stuff into my classroom!\n\nMy mom is planning to take time off work this morning to help me start getting organized.\n\nI’m just feeling so grateful for the help I’m being given. My brother in law switched his days off to be able to help me, and my friend prioritized moving me in before going to her own classroom. All without being asked.\n\nI came home with my heart so full of gratitude, to find boxes on my front step! I was initially so confused because I was sure we had taken everything but then I realized they were sealed Amazon packages and when I opened them I found that it was stuff off my wishlist!! From total strangers!! I was already so emotional over the day I had, so this act of kindness just had me sobbing. \n\nAnyways, my village came through today, and now, I get to start doing the fun part, which is creating a beautiful space to welcome my new students come September ❤️",

He cried like a baby and the toys have been on display throughout our different homes, always religiously in their original packaging.\nFast forward to today, about 30 years after losing those toys and 6 years after finding them again, he finally opened them and is playing with them with our 5 year old son, being the amazing father he has been missing from his own childhood. Our dogs are trying to catch the darts Mr Freeze shoots, I'm watching them all from the couch while the second child we were told we could never have is kicking wildly in my belly. \n\nCycles can be broken. We can be the parents we ourselves needed. It's never too late.",

My passion is learning from everything on how they do narrative and use cameras to do so, much more than animation sometimes. \n\nUsually, my parents aren't even open to watch an animation movie, even watching the first one I did back in the day took 2 days for them to finish... And for videogames, let's say they don't appreciate them. So it's not really their cup of tea. And though they're happy I work in what I like, I sometimes feel very lonely for not being able to share this with them.\n\nTonight, as I'm staying with them for a couple of months, they asked me to watch an animation movie I had recommended them the other day (I sometimes recommend them stuff to watch though I know they won't). \n\nIt felt like it was my birthday. \n\nIt meant the world to me. We watched it, they enjoyed it and even laughed. They asked me technical stuff. I was bamboozled and high on happiness, especially because I commented about seeing cool camera movements in another movie and they gave me space to show them.\n\nIm over the moon.",

His mom said that he’s shy and he’s working on it at this children’s institute. She was coaching him on what to say, and how to use eye contact. Then I asked if I could give him a high five and he did. This shy little boy who is working on his social anxiety gave me a high five. I told him that he was so brave and that I was honored to get this high five. I suffer with an anxiety disorder myself and it healed something in me when I saw him overcome his anxiety for just a moment. His mom is also an amazing woman. She’s constantly there for him and reassuring him that he’s brave. Wherever he is I know he’s going to be amazing.",

      "text": "I took my two Chihuahuas, Coco and Pixie and  to the park the other evening. They're  both tiny, and both act like they own every square inch of grass they step on. If you’ve ever had a Chihuahua, you know exactly what I mean, 5 pounds of sass in a body the size of a shoe.\n\nWe found a quiet spot under a tree where I could sit and have a moment. I lit a joint, took a slow breath, and let the dogs roam within the leash’s limit. Pixie barking at literally nothing, and Coco trying to eat a leaf like it’s a five-star meal.\n\nA woman maybe in her 60s wandered by and paused when she saw the dogs. “Chihuahuas?” she smiled, already reaching into her bag. “I had two of them. Mine were named Taco and Bubbles.”\n\nI laughed and told her my guys’ names, and before I knew it, she sat beside me on the bench. Just two strangers bonding over our love of neurotic little dogs and the chaos they bring.\n\nShe asked if she could pet them, and when Pixie actually let her (a miracle), she teared up a bit and said, “I haven’t touched a Chihuahua in two years. Lost both of mine during the pandemic. They got me through the darkest days.”\n\nI offered her the joint. She looked surprised, then laughed softly and said, “Sure, why not? I haven’t smoked since I was your age.” (For the record, I’m 40. It was a compliment. I’ll take it.)\n\nSo there we sat. Two humans from totally different lives, passing a joint, petting two ridiculous dogs, sharing stories about loss and love and the wild ways dogs and weed can heal a heart.\n\nBefore she left, she said, “You’re doing a good job with them. You can tell they feel safe.”\n\nI don’t know why, but that broke me a little. And sometimes you just need a stranger to notice.\n\nSo yeah. Thank you, Taco and Bubbles’ mom. For sitting. For sharing. For reminding me that the world still has quiet kindness tucked in unexpected places.❤️🐾🐾❤️",

Just then a man came by walking his dog. She was a big three-legged model, a pit bull mix by the looks of her. Pretty rough-looking actually. The man was on his phone. Without missing a beat, doggo comes right up to me... I have an \"Oh no\" moment... What does she do? Slobbers all over my hands, then hobbles casually away with her owner like she does that to people all the time.\n\nThat night I couldn't resist telling my mom I was kissed by a stranger at the bus stop!",

I don’t remember when it started but my boyfriend’s dad would always say hi when he was passing by (My store is on his way to work). He still does it. All my coworkers and bosses know who he is. He doesn’t have my number he just always checks to see if I’m working. I think it’s so cute and wanted to share.",

However, I would always whisper it after my dad left for work. \n\nMind you, I'm twenty years old and currently in university, but I would always say \"Bye Daddy, I love you\" just to myself everytime he leaves. What I didn't know was he had a camera installed two months ago when we went on vacation to monitor the dogs and front door, and noticed I would whisper it everytime he left. \n\nMy grandmother recently died and he shared this with me to comfort me, telling me about how it's his favourite part of his day and how he would check the camera everytime he got to work to listen to it. I remember him telling me, \"I'm glad you still secretly call me that. It reminds me that deep inside, you're still my little girl.\"\n\nI hope this little tidbit brightens someone's day.",

So, I took that spider in and plopped it in a spot in my bathroom and let it do it's things too.\n\n I check on both of them and one day that one I find outside is gone (I expected that), but I find various little spider babies and I gave a quiet applause that my original bathroom spider isn't alone anymore and I smiled happily seeing it with that little nest of young. I keep checking on them each day and I won't post pics (to avoid scaring people), but that's something I've worked on I think is rather wholesome.",
