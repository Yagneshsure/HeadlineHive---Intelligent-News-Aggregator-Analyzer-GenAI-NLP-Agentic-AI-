      "text": "https://www.revisor.mn.gov/bills/text.php?number=SF2589&version=0&session=ls94&session_year=2025&session_number=0\n\nThis bill was just introduced to the Minnesota Legislature. It won't pass, but this is probably just the beginning of something very dangerous. It paves the way for individuals who are politically opposed to Trump to be labeled as mentally ill, subjecting them to involuntary hospitalization or civil commitment. There are huge implications on the practitioner side as well. Say a patient presents to a medical appointment and expresses frustration at the current administration because they lost their job, disability benefits, etc. A few weeks later, something pushes them over the edge and they do something radical. You're now liable because you didn't hospitalize them when they showed signs of \"mental illness\", I.e. reporting frustration about Trump. Bill's text is covered below.\n\n\"A bill for an act\nrelating to mental health; modifying the definition of mental illness; adding a definition for Trump Derangement Syndrome; amending Minnesota Statutes 2024, sections 245.462, subdivision 20, by adding a subdivision; 245I.02, subdivision 29, by adding a subdivision.\n\nBE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF MINNESOTA:\n\nSection 1. Minnesota Statutes 2024, section 245.462, subdivision 20, is amended to read:\nSubd. 20. Mental illness. (a) \"Mental illness\" means Trump Derangement Syndrome or an organic disorder of the brain or a clinically significant disorder of thought, mood, perception, orientation, memory, or behavior that is detailed in a diagnostic codes list published by the commissioner, and that seriously limits a person's capacity to function in primary aspects of daily living such as personal relations, living arrangements, work, and recreation.\n(b) An \"adult with acute mental illness\" means an adult who has a mental illness that is serious enough to require prompt intervention.\n\n(c) For purposes of case management and community support services, a \"person with serious and persistent mental illness\" means an adult who has a mental illness and meets at least one of the following criteria:\n\n(1) the adult has undergone two or more episodes of inpatient care for a mental illness within the preceding 24 months;\n\n(2) the adult has experienced a continuous psychiatric hospitalization or residential treatment exceeding six months' duration within the preceding 12 months;\n\n(3) the adult has been treated by a crisis team two or more times within the preceding 24 months;\n\n(4) the adult:\n\n(i) has a diagnosis of schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, major depression, schizoaffective disorder, or borderline personality disorder;\n\n(ii) indicates a significant impairment in functioning; and\n\n(iii) has a written opinion from a mental health professional, in the last three years, stating that the adult is reasonably likely to have future episodes requiring inpatient or residential treatment, of a frequency described in clause (1) or (2), unless ongoing case management or community support services are provided;\n\n(5) the adult has, in the last three years, been committed by a court as a person who is mentally ill under chapter 253B, or the adult's commitment has been stayed or continued;\n\n(6) the adult (i) was eligible under clauses (1) to (5), but the specified time period has expired or the adult was eligible as a child under section 245.4871, subdivision 6; and (ii) has a written opinion from a mental health professional, in the last three years, stating that the adult is reasonably likely to have future episodes requiring inpatient or residential treatment, of a frequency described in clause (1) or (2), unless ongoing case management or community support services are provided; or\n\n(7) the adult was eligible as a child under section 245.4871, subdivision 6, and is age 21 or younger.\n\nSec. 2. Minnesota Statutes 2024, section 245.462, is amended by adding a subdivision to read:\nSubd. 28. Trump Derangement Syndrome. \"Trump Derangement Syndrome\" means the acute onset of paranoia in otherwise normal persons that is in reaction to the policies and presidencies of President Donald J. Trump. Symptoms may include Trump-induced general hysteria, which produces an inability to distinguish between legitimate policy differences and signs of psychic pathology in President Donald J. Trump's behavior. This may be expressed by:\n(1) verbal expressions of intense hostility toward President Donald J. Trump; and\n\n(2) overt acts of aggression and violence against anyone supporting President Donald J. Trump or anything that symbolizes President Donald J. Trump.\n\nSec. 3. Minnesota Statutes 2024, section 245I.02, subdivision 29, is amended to read:\nSubd. 29. Mental illness. \"Mental illness\" means Trump Derangement Syndrome or any of the conditions included in the most recent editions of the DC: 0-5 Diagnostic Classification of Mental Health and Development Disorders of Infancy and Early Childhood published by Zero to Three or the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders published by the American Psychiatric Association.\nSec. 4. Minnesota Statutes 2024, section 245I.02, is amended by adding a subdivision to read:\nSubd. 40a. Trump Derangement Syndrome. \"Trump Derangement Syndrome\" means the acute onset of paranoia in otherwise normal persons that is in reaction to the policies and presidencies of President Donald J. Trump. Symptoms may include Trump-induced general hysteria, which produces an inability to distinguish between legitimate policy differences and signs of psychic pathology in President Donald J. Trump's behavior. This may be expressed by:\n(1) verbal expressions of intense hostility toward President Donald J. Trump; and\n\n(2) overt acts of aggression and violence against anyone supporting President Donald J. Trump or anything that symbolizes President Donald J. Trump.\"",

      "text": "I had the most infuriating experience with an insurance company today and I need to vent about it.\n\nI'm a pulmonologist. Saw a patient in clinic Friday with symptoms concerning for COPD/chronic bronchitis. I do what pulmonologists do, and ordered PFTs. At my institution, it can sometimes take a few weeks to get testing done. In straightforward cases, or if patients are particularly symptomatic, I'll order an inhaler for them to start using. For classic chronic bronchitis, without severe symptoms, I will usually start a LAMA. At that visit, on 1/3, I sent a prescription for tiotropium 2.5 mcg.\n\nI got a message on Monday 1/6 from her insurance company that they would not cover tiotropium 2.5 mcg, but tiotropium 1.25 mcg would be covered. Whatever. I sent a new prescription for 1.25 mcg dose and deleted the message from my inbox.\n\nToday, 1/7, I get another message. Now insurance says they won't cover tiotropium 1.25 mcg without a trial of Advair, Breo, Symbicort, or Dulera. For those of you who don't keep up with brand names, those are all ICS/LABA inhalers. Not a LAMA among them. Now, GOLD guidelines say it is reasonable to start LAMA/LABA as first line therapy, but you definitely shouldn't start an ICS in a COPD patient without checking a peripheral eosinophil count, and even then only after you have them on a LAMA and a LABA. I think there must be a misunderstanding. Thankfully, there's a callback number.\n\nThis person (who made me give my NPI number immediately after I already typed it in), reiterated what was said in the last message. Tiotropium would not be covered at any dose until the patient had a trial of an ICS/LABA. This is nonsensical. I asked what diagnosis code she was seeing associated with the prescription - did I mistakenly code it as asthma? Then this algorithm would make sense. Her reply? \"I can't see a diagnosis code.\" I tell her that the stepwise therapy she is telling me to do is directly contrary to GOLD guidelines. She says that she can only tell me that tiotropium won't be covered without a trial of one of the other inhalers. I ask her to speak to anyone with a clinical background.\n\nFinally she gets a pharmacist on the phone. I explain the patient's diagnosis and how the alternative I was told to prescribe is inappropriate. I tell her I am happy to send another LAMA if they have one that is preferred. She says she doesn't know if any LAMAs are preferred. I asked her if umeclidinium requires a PA or failure of an ICS/LABA. She says no, that should be covered.\n\nI fucking hate insurance companies. \n\nThey are literally trying to dictate how to practice medicine without even guessing what a patient's diagnosis is. They are deliberately obfuscating what medications in a certain class are covered. If the initial message had just said, \"please use umeclidinium if possible\" I would have sent it without a second thought. But they wasted 30 minutes of my time on the phone to get a goddamn first line medication approved. This is infuriating.",

I'm in disbelief. I’d love to hear the thoughts of American healthcare workers on this.",
      "text": "First off, if this exact content has already been posted, feel free to toss it gently into the recycling bin—I totally understand. I just needed to get this off my chest for my own peace of mind, and I’m also curious to hear how those of you living in the U.S. are feeling about it... because I'm over here in New Zealand, watching in horrified confusion from afar.\n\nAlso, just a heads-up—I'm *only* a student, so most of you definitely know way more than I do! But even from where I stand, it feels surprisingly easy to debunk what RFK Jr. is saying. Like… painfully easy.\n\nWhat he said isn’t just medically inaccurate—it’s like trying to fix a broken leg with duct tape. His comment shows a complete misunderstanding of how we manage infectious diseases and public health...\n\nNew Zealand may still feel the ripple effects of his anti-vaccine stance, as we also have misinformed parents here who may feel validated by what he’s saying.\n\nAs you all already know, **measles is a vaccine-preventable disease**, and **prevention**—not treatment—is the cornerstone of our approach. The MMR (measles, mumps, rubella) vaccine is safe, rigorously tested, and about 97% effective after two doses. It has been instrumental in reducing measles cases and **saving countless lives.**\n\nSuggesting that measles can just be “treated” once you’ve got it is like saying you can just \"fix\" a flat tire by driving faster. It completely downplays the severity and danger of the disease—and sadly, some folks might actually believe what RFK Jr. is selling.\n\nContrary to his insane claim, there is **no antiviral cure** for measles. Treatment is limited to **supportive care**—managing symptoms like fever and dehydration, and administering vitamin A in severe cases. This kind of care cannot prevent the complications measles can cause: **pneumonia, encephalitis, permanent disability, and even death**—particularly in children, infants, and the immunocompromised.  \nThe most vulnerable in society are going to pay with their lives for his stupidity.\n\nBy promoting the idea that there are \"many good treatments,\" Kennedy risks misleading the public into believing that **vaccination is unnecessary**. This is not only false—it is **dangerous**. It erodes public trust in science, contributes to vaccine hesitancy.\n\nWe are standing of the shoulders of giants who spent decades bringing measles under control. The resurgence of this disease in recent years is directly linked to misinformation.  **Vaccines save lives. misinformation costs them.**\n\nI'm emailing MPs and advocating for medical staff from the US can have an easy pathway to residency in NZ. We are aware some of the best academics, doctors, nurses and scientists are in the US.\n\nArchive link to override the Washington post paywall with the article: [https://archive.is/Duhzw](https://archive.is/Duhzw)\n\nGodspeed to anyone in the US, you have my respect.",

Framed by Green’s travels with Partners in Health and punctuated by unforgettable patient encounters, the book is an urgent reminder that while tuberculosis (TB) may be ancient, our neglect of it is very modern.\n\nGreen masterfully blends historical narrative with deeply personal storytelling, creating a work that is as informative as it is moving. He traces TB's trajectory from its presence in Neolithic human remains to Robert Koch’s groundbreaking 1882 discovery of the tuberculosis bacillus. Along the way, we see humanity’s evolving, often flawed responses to the disease: from sanatoriums and enforced isolation to modern treatment barriers shaped by pharmaceutical profiteering and global apathy.\n\nOne of the book’s most affecting stories takes place in Sierra Leone, where Green meets Henry, a young man with drug-resistant TB, chicken legs, and a smile that radiates through the page. Henry’s story humanizes the global statistics, reminding us that behind each MDR/XDR TB case is a person with hopes, family, and an often unspoken fear.\n\nGreen doesn’t flinch from the emotional cost of TB: the social isolation, the lingering stigma, and the historical indifference to TB patients in colonized regions. While the book primarily centers on his relationship with Henry in Sierra Leone, Green weaves in historical vignettes that echo the same themes. One especially striking moment recounts a father who, after losing one daughter to tuberculosis, continues writing letters to his surviving daughter in the deceased sister’s handwriting—hoping to shield her from grief while she was isolated in a sanatorium. It’s a gut-wrenching snapshot of protective love in a time when emotional honesty was seen as a medical risk.\n\nThe book is also an indictment of our collective failure: even with effective medications, TB remains the deadliest infectious disease on Earth. Why? Because, as Green writes, “the cure is where the disease is not, and the disease is where the cure is not.” That quote alone encapsulates the structural neglect that defines modern medicine’s global health landscape.\n\nFor healthcare professionals, this book offers an eye-opening look at the intersection of infectious disease, poverty, and policy. (It’s also available as a free audiobook on Spotify for Premium users—perfect for a post-call wind-down or your commute.) It’s a call to action, a reminder that clinical knowledge must be paired with advocacy if we’re to make a dent in global health inequity. TB may seem like a disease of the past—but its persistence is a mirror of the world we’ve made.\n\nRead it. Reflect. Then help change the story.",

That includes 10,000 in layoffs as well as another 10,000 workers who are taking early retirements or buyout offers that were given to nearly all federal employees by the Trump administration.\n\nMost of the cuts will come from the public health agencies: The Food and Drug Administration, responsible for setting standards for Americans’ foods and medications, will shed 3,500 workers, while the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which tracks infectious disease outbreaks, will cut 2,400 positions.\n\nMeanwhile, the National Institutes for Health, the world’s leading public health research agency, will lose 1,200 people. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, which oversees health coverage for older and poor Americans, will shed 300 jobs.\n\nI imagine a lot of people in this community interact with the Department of Health and Human Services directly or indirectly, so thought it might be useful to bring this to your attention.",

Smith was declared brain dead. Her family has been by her side every day since, including her young son, who they said still believes his mother is just sleeping. She’s been breathing through machines for more than 90 days,” Newkirk said. “It’s torture for me. I see my daughter breathing, but she’s not there. And her son—I bring him to see her.” \n\n>Newkirk said doctors told the family the baby has fluid on the brain and they're not sure how much fluid. They're concerned about his health.“She’s pregnant with my grandson. But he may be blind, may not be able to walk, may not survive once he’s born,” Newkirk said. \n\n>Under Georgia’s heartbeat law, abortion is banned once cardiac activity is detected — typically around six weeks into pregnancy.  The law includes limited exceptions for rape, incest, or if the mother’s life is in danger. But in Adriana’s case, the law created a legal gray area.\n \n>Because she is brain dead — no longer considered at risk herself — her medical team is legally required to maintain life support until the fetus reaches viability. The family said doctors told them they are not legally allowed to consider other options.\n\nNot mentioned in this article but she was 9 weeks pregnant when she died. Insane to me that apparently the only legal option to turn her into a zombie incubator for 6-7 months.",

      "text": "As a Canadian I find the US healthcare system baffling. Since the shooting of the UnitedHealthcare CEO, I’ve read multiple articles written from the perspective of health insurance workers that seem to assume that given they work in the same system as doctors and nurses, they should be treated with the same respect. I find this puzzling since I had this image in my mind of health insurance as populated by accountants crunching the numbers rather than folks who heal the sick. My question is do doctors and nurses in the US view health insurance workers as colleagues?\n\nThe news items I refer to are:\n\nThis article in [The New York Times (Gift link)](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/11/us/health-insurance-uhc-ceo-shooting.html?unlocked_article_code=1.g04.BHaU.TZjmXrFYtqAO&smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare) from today:\n\nI was struck in particular by this paragraph:\n\n>In a message sent to employees on Wednesday evening, Mr. Witty, the United executive, stressed the positive impact the company has on people’s lives and getting the care they need. “Never forget: What you do matters. It really, really matters. There is no higher calling than helping people. Nothing more vital to the human condition than health care. And while these days have been dark, our patients, members, customers are sending us light.”\n\nAnd this from WBUR:  \n [https://www.wbur.org/hereandnow/2024/12/05/health-care-threats](https://www.wbur.org/hereandnow/2024/12/05/health-care-threats)",

      "title": "Dr. Oz Pushed for AI Health Care in First Medicare Agency Town Hall",
      "text": "https://www.wired.com/story/dr-oz-ai-health-care-medicare-cms-town-hall/\n\nDr. Mehmet Oz, the new administrator for the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), spent much of his first all-staff meeting on Monday promoting the use of artificial intelligence at the agency and praising Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s “Make America Healthy Again Initiative,” sources tell WIRED.\n\nDuring the meeting, Oz discussed possibly prioritizing AI avatars over frontline health care workers.\n\nOz claimed that if a patient went to a doctor for a diabetes diagnosis, it would be “$100” per hour, while an appointment with an AI avatar would cost considerably less, at just “$2” an hour. Oz also claimed that patients have rated the care they’ve received from an AI avatar as equal to or better than a human doctor. (Research suggests patients are actually [more skeptical](https://www.psychologytoday.com/au/blog/the-digital-self/202407/trust-me-im-an-ai-doctor) of medical advice given by AI.) Because of technologies like machine learning and AI, Oz claimed, it is now possible to scale “good ideas” in an affordable and fast way.\n\nCMS has explored the use of AI for the last several years, according to archived versions of an agency [website](https://ai.cms.gov/) dedicated to the topic, and the agency released an updated “[AI Playbook](https://web.archive.org/web/20230208180546/https://ai.cms.gov/assets/CMS_AI_Playbook.pdf)” in 2022. But those efforts appear to have focused on finding ways to leverage vast CMS datasets, rather than involving AI directly in patient care.\n\n“Dr. Oz brings decades of experience as a physician and an innovator to CMS. We are not going to respond to deliberately misleading leaks about a nearly hour-long meeting he held with all CMS staff,\" said CMS spokesperson Catherine Howden in an emailed statement.\n\nThe Senate confirmed Oz as CMS’s new administrator on April 3. CMS, which runs Medicare, Medicaid, and Healthcare.gov, is part of the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), where [health care conspiracist](https://www.nytimes.com/article/rfk-conspiracy-theories-fact-check.html) RFK Jr. currently serves as department secretary. CMS spent more than $1.5 trillion in fiscal year 2024, which [accounted for](https://www.cms.gov/files/document/cms-financial-report-fiscal-year-2024.pdf) more than one-fifth of total government outlays. The agency employs nearly 7,000 employees, and provides health care coverage for almost half of the US. Current CMS employees describe the agency as “the most policy-dense organization in government” where the administrator must make decisions on where to spend billions of dollars on certain treatments in a zero-sum environment.\n\n“Please join incoming CMS Administrator Dr. Mehmet Oz and other senior leaders to learn more about his vision and priorities for CMS,” stated the meeting description, which was called for Monday at 1:00 pm EST. “This is an internal event, and all CMS staff are invited to participate virtually. Staff who are onsite at CMS office locations should consider gathering in available offices or conference space.”\n\nOz has seemingly never worked in health care policy before, but served as a physician for many years before becoming the star of *The Dr. Oz Show*. He has promoted a number of [provably incorrect](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/12/26/us/politics/dr-oz-medical-advice.html) medical tips—including the use of hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine as a treatment for Covid—and weight-loss pills that Oz admitted in a 2014 Senate subcommittee hearing “don’t have the scientific muster to present as fact.” He also unsuccessfully ran for a Senate seat in Pennsylvania, losing to current senator John Fetterman.\n\nAt the meeting, Oz spoke extensively about his family’s history, the origins of his name, and his educational background at Harvard and the University of Pennsylvania (including his football career), before talking about CMS.\n\nOz told CMS employees that it was their “patriotic duty” to take care of themselves as it would help decrease the cost of health care, citing the costs of running Medicare and Medicaid throughout the country. (During his Senate [confirmation hearing](https://apple.news/AYZG71BNHTbisEUN87Q3IpQ) for CMS administrator, Oz also claimed “it is our patriotic duty to be healthy,” connecting personal exercise to the overall reduction of expenses for Medicare and Medicaid.)\n\nOz spoke at length during the meeting about obesity in the US and what it costs CMS, without citing any provable statistics. He said that addressing obesity was one of his top priorities. (The Biden administration had suggested that Medicare and Medicaid cover costs for weight-loss drugs, an initiative that the [Trump administration has so far declined to expand](https://apple.news/AMY8I49xQT1qx6hM_-xbqRA). Oz has repeatedly drawn criticism for promoting “miracle” weight-loss cures on The Dr. Oz Show.)\n\n“I’m not sure he knows what we do here,” said one CMS employee who listened to the call. “He was talking about nutrition and exercise. That’s not what Medicare does. We care for people in nursing homes. We deal with dying people.”\n\nWhen asked how he would prefer to be briefed on complex policy issues, Oz told staffers, You’ll find that I am not purposely but deliberately naive about a lot of issues. Sources tell WIRED that this seemed to them like a roundabout way for Oz to say that he is focused not on personal or political motivations, but the facts. Oz also claimed that CMS needed to do a better job of addressing “fraud and waste” at the agency, two purported targets of Elon Musk and his so-called Department of Government Efficiency.\n\nOz also endorsed MAHA: Make America Healthy Again, an [HHS priority](https://www.hhs.gov/press-room/hhs-restructuring-doge.html) that was originally a cornerstone of RFK Jr.’s 2024 presidential campaign. In the CMS meeting, Oz stated that MAHA is all about “curiosity.” (Kennedy, who has championed MAHA, has also [repeatedly and dangerously](https://apple.news/AgYYGzu-RRgic-NMkrTOQfQ) promoted anti-vaccine opinions, doctors, and activists.)\n\n“Reinforcements are coming to the agency,” Oz said, speaking of doctors and clinicians he claims have been left behind or left out of CMS’s work; or even those who wouldn’t have previously wanted to work at CMS before.\n\nThe idea of bringing new people to CMS, where hundreds of employees were recently fired as part of a [sweeping reduction in force](https://apple.news/Aklqup8EVTxC_o9ANnbXqTg) (RIF) at HHS, was upsetting to those who were present at the meeting. “That was frankly insulting to the CMS staff,” says a source. “We have incredible people here.”\n\n——————\n\nMy thoughts: If it was so easy, why haven’t other countries done it already? Why hasn’t an HMO done this already? (Those of us who were around in the 90s know HMOs tried to replace physicians with a rudimentary AI and PAs using flowsheets and failed)\n\nI think this stems from overconfidence. “People google their symptoms and figure out what OTC stuff to take all the time, why not have an AI do it with prescription treatments?”\n\nI’d expect this kind of nonsense from a layperson, but a licensed doctor? Is this surgeon so out of touch with the practice of medicine that he doesn’t see the problems? We can’t even automate refills properly, and he wants to jump to AI consultation?\n\nWe can’t even have AI reliably read EKGs yet. The sepsis alerts and other EMR AI tricks are less reliable than a med student who lacks clinical experience. If we relied on it now, it would discharge patients who are clinically sick despite good labs or vital numbers and overtreat patients who are fine but look bad in their numbers. We gripe on this sub about midlevels providing worse outcomes without saving any money, and AI is potentially even worse. It’s not a panacea for anyone except in terms of savings. This is far too rosy and overconfident in the potential of AI promises but it’s just vaporware.",

I make it clear to clients that I'm not a licensed therapist, and I don't work with insurance companies. But I seriously cannot find information about whether I'm technically using my MD, since I'm working with people, or whether I'm supposed to completely divorce myself from my MD, in order to be ethical. Does anyone know people in this situation? Who could I consult about what my MD license actually covers? I don't even know what flavor of lawyer might be helpful--not the malpractice ones, lol!",

      "text": "One of the loudest, most prominent COVID contrarians, Robert Malone, was appointed to CDC’s vaccine advisory committee. It turns out he’s still pushing violent rhetoric at public health officials, despite now being one himself. Senator Blumenthal just called for his dismissal, writing:\n\n“Just hours before a police officer was brutally murdered and CDC headquarters would be scarred with bullets, forcing hundreds employees into lockdown, Dr. Robert Malone, whom you recently appointed to the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP), uploaded a post to his personal blog that included an image of a revolver loaded with a single bullet and the words ‘Five out of six scientists have proven that Russian roulette is harmless.’ Less than 48 hours after the attack, Dr. Malone issued a meme-filled post that included violent and threatening images that appeared to be directed at government officials, writing, ‘if you need a disarmed society to govern, you suck at governing.’Malone has displayed an unfathomable failure of judgment and heartlessness for thefamily of slain Officer Rose, and for the thousands of CDC staff on whom the work of ACIP depends. Dr. Malone’s escalating and violent rhetoric—including in the aftermath of this tragic incident—has no place on a panel responsible for determining immunization recommendations for children and adults throughout our country. I therefore call on you to immediately fire Dr. Malone from his role on ACIP.”\n\n[https://www.hsgac.senate.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025-08-13-Letter-from-Sen-Blumenthal-to-HHS.pdf](https://www.hsgac.senate.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025-08-13-Letter-from-Sen-Blumenthal-to-HHS.pdf)",

      "text": "This is absolutely a pet peeve of mine, but it's something I see daily, and have QUESTIONS about.\n\nThere's a startup calling itself Function Health, I'm not linking to them but they're easy to Google if you're curious. Mark Hyman is involved in some capacity as founder/booster/face of the brand. I'm not sure exactly what his role is, and I don't care. \n\nThe basic idea is, you pay them a bunch of money, and they write you some ginormous lab orders. You go to a medical testing company to get all those labs drawn (hi, that's where I come in), and then Function takes the results and plugs them into some kind of proprietary AI thing, because of FUCKING COURSE there's gotta be \"AI\" involved somewhere. Then they put all the numbers on a nice pretty Personal Dashboard for you to look at. Then they send you for even more labs at regular intervals, all so that you can \\~optimize your health journey\\~.\n\n  \nMost of the people buying into this look like they are in decent-to-excellent health already; some are on the older side but I see plenty who are in their 20s and 30s. They seem to be under the impression that what they are doing is preventative care. I suppose maybe if one of those tests comes back out of range, and they actually go find a doctor to ask about it, someone might catch a problem early that might otherwise have gotten a lot worse? Or maybe seeing pretty numbers provides that extra incentive to work out and eat veggies - scary number go down, good number go up? However, Function itself doesn't appear to provide any kind of treatment or even referrals; as far as I can tell they're just selling medical testing in bulk, direct-to-consumer, with a shiny coat of techno-paint.\n\nMeanwhile, I end up spending a lot of time drawing and processing these ginormous orders, which frequently causes delays for people coming in for the lab work their doctors ordered, which is usually MUCH simpler. On the plus side, at least Function clients typically have easy veins - or at least, the returning ones do. Self-selection in action; it really sucks to be the person with tiny veins that like to collapse, when the lab order is asking for 10+ tubes. Especially when the tests are totally voluntary, and mostly for issues you probably don't have. \n\nI think that about covers what I know. Does anyone know more? Am I accurately smelling a scam, or is Function actually \\~revolutionizing healthcare\\~ as they claim?",

Invest lots of resources. At Stanford, Shah said, it took eight to 10 months and 115 man-hours just to audit two models for fairness and reliability.\n\nExperts interviewed by KFF Health News floated the idea of artificial intelligence monitoring artificial intelligence, with some (human) data whiz monitoring both. All acknowledged that would require organizations to spend even more money — a tough ask given the realities of hospital budgets and the limited supply of AI tech specialists.\n\n“It’s great to have a vision where we’re melting icebergs in order to have a model monitoring their model,” Shah said. “But is that really what I wanted? How many more people are we going to need?”'\n\n--\n\nStarter comment: Any software especially ones intended to assist with diagnosis needs to have regular updates and QA/QI. How much money to maintain AI over the long-term is an interesting question, especially for bugs, updating for new research, and uncertain clinical situations.",

      "title": "Shifting Sands in Public Health: Reflections on the CDC’s COVID-19 Vaccine Guidance",
      "text": "Date: May 27, 2025\n\n# CDC Update: What Happened?\n\nIn a move that has stunned much of the medical community, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has removed recommendations for COVID-19 vaccination in healthy children and pregnant women. The announcement, made via a social media video by Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., did not follow the usual protocols for public health policy development. There was no convening of the CDC’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP), no new large-scale study, no meeting minutes—just a camera, a platform, and a gut feeling.\n\nSecretary Kennedy claimed the removal was due to a lack of evidence supporting boosters in these populations and framed it as a return to \"individualized care.\" However, critics were quick to point out that removing a universal recommendation, especially without supporting evidence or expert review, has serious implications: for insurance coverage, vaccine access, and public trust.\n\nPregnant women, once considered a high-risk group for COVID complications, are now left without national guidance on a vaccine that once dramatically reduced poor maternal and fetal outcomes. Children, while at lower personal risk, also play a role in community transmission—another fact seemingly ignored in the abrupt reversal.\n\n# The Noble Nocturnist’s Reaction: More Than a Gut Feeling\n\nI’ll be blunt: this move by the CDC, spearheaded by RFK Jr., doesn’t feel like public health policy—it feels like performance art. The kind you do when you want applause from a crowd, not better outcomes for patients. There was no ACIP review. No FDA signal. No new peer-reviewed trial. Just… vibes.\n\nIt’s hard to reconcile this with how vaccine policy has traditionally been formed—slow, data-driven, consensus-based, often to a fault. The whole process used to involve rigorous vetting through layers of expert committees. Now it’s one guy with a social media account and a microphone saying, “Nah, we’re good.” Imagine replacing decades of epidemiology, maternal-fetal medicine, and immunology with “my uncle said so at dinner.” That’s where we are.\n\nThere’s a dark irony in watching someone who once told the world not to trust him for medical advice suddenly become the national voice of vaccine guidance. He doesn’t just disregard expert panels—he leapfrogs them entirely. It’s “policy by podcast guest,” not policy by evidence.\n\nAnd let’s be real—when ideology leads policy, patients pay. In their wallets. With their health. And sometimes, with their lives. I was a hospitalist during the darkest days of the pandemic. I’ve watched young pregnant women—just a short time from their due date—crash and burn from COVID. High flow, Bi-PAP, Intubated. And that was after we had some of the tools to prevent it.\n\n \\*\\*Losing Our Footing: Outcomes Among Pregnant vs Non-pregnant People with COVID-19\\*\\*\n\n| **Outcome**                   | **Relative Risk (Pregnant vs. Non-Pregnant)** | **References**     |\n|------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|--------------------|\n| Hospitalization              | 3.0–5.0                                       | [1–3]              |\n| Requiring supplemental oxygen| 1.5–2.0*                                      | [3–4]              |\n| ICU admission                | 1.5–3.0                                       | [5][6][3–4]        |\n| Mechanical ventilation       | 1.7–2.9                                       | [5][3–4]           |\n| ECMO                         | 2.4                                           | [3]                |\n| Death                        | 1.0–1.7                                       | [3, 6]             |\n\n\nThe outcomes data on COVID in pregnancy isn’t ambiguous. Pregnant people are at significantly higher risk for ICU admission, intubation, and death.These findings are supported by large cohort studies and meta-analyses, and are consistent with the previous consensus of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and major obstetric societies, which recommend COVID-19 vaccination for all pregnant individuals to reduce the risk of severe maternal and perinatal complications.\\\\\\[7\\\\\\]\\\\\\[9-10\\\\\\]  The vaccine offers real protection, and pulling back recommendations without a robust evidentiary basis endangers that progress. But hey, maybe all the evidence “felt sus” and just “didn’t hit right” with the current administration’s rhetoric.\n\nSure, I’ll acknowledge the ACIP didn’t originally recommend boosters for all healthy individuals either. And yes, the CDC overrode them back then—also controversial, although arguably retrospectively the data shows they made the right choice in the table below.  So political influence on public health isn’t new. But that precedent doesn’t justify doubling down. It highlights the exact danger of removing data and transparency from the equation.\n\n\\*\\*The Walls Coming Down: Outcomes of Vaccinated vs Unvaccinated Pregnant People with COVID-19\\*\\*\n\n| **Outcome**                          | **Relative Risk (Unvaccinated vs. Vaccinated)** | **References**    |\n|-------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|-------------------|\n| Preterm birth                       | 1.5–1.7                                          | [1–3]             |\n| Hospitalization                     | 2.0–3.0                                          | [1, 3–4]          |\n| Requiring supplemental oxygen       | 2.0–3.0*                                         | [1, 4–5]          |\n| Respiratory failure                 | 2.0–3.0*                                         | [1, 4–5]          |\n| Intubation/mechanical ventilation   | 2.0–3.0*                                         | [1, 4–5]          |\n| ECMO                                | 2.0–3.0*                                         | [1, 4–5]          |\n| Death                               | 2.0–4.0                                          | [1, 3–5]          |\n\n\nIf you're wondering why this decision happened without process, well… welcome to Trump’s America, where the governing philosophy seems to be “do it loud, do it fast, and if it owns the libs, even better.” And why would you need evidence when millions of people will celebrate it just for the spectacle?\n\nI’m not the only one feeling this. Behind closed doors, in break rooms and group chats, doctors are seething. This isn't just about guidelines—it’s about being gaslit after years of trauma. I hope every policymaker who backed this gets the healthcare system they voted for. But they won’t. They’ll get concierge care, fly out of state, and leave the rest behind.\n\nFor the rest of us? We’ll keep treating the fallout. As usual.\n\n# Global Context: Through the Looking Glass\n\nGlobally, the rest of the medical world is still living in a reality where infectious disease follows immunology and public health decisions come with citations. The World Health Organization continues to recommend COVID-19 vaccination for pregnant women and other at-risk groups based on—brace yourself—actual outcomes data. But here in the U.S., our national policy now apparently runs on gut feelings, campaign slogans, and whatever RFK Jr. hallucinated into a microphone that morning.\n\nThis isn’t just an American quirk anymore. It’s a full-blown, exportable model of anti-intellectual governance: let’s politicize science, undermine public health institutions, and then act surprised when nobody trusts doctors, vaccines, or public policy. If the CDC can’t be counted on to follow its own advisory committee, why should your patients believe anything else they say? Today it’s COVID boosters for pregnant women—tomorrow it’s what, skipping tetanus shots because animal bites are “natural”?\n\nWe're creating a perfect storm: scientific inconsistency + political interference + social media soundbites = total erosion of trust in anything with a stethoscope or a degree. And guess who pays the price? Not the rich. Not the anti-vax podcast influencers cashing checks from supplement sponsors. No—it’s the uninsured pregnant woman in rural America. The immunocompromised patient in a marginalized community who can’t “just go to a better hospital.” It’s public health’s most vulnerable who get torched when the fire starts at the top.\n\n# A Canary Gasping in the Coal Mine\n\nThis new CDC recommendation isn’t just a policy misstep—it’s a demolition of credibility, brick by brick. In a post-fact, vibes-only administration that flirts with fascism and courts anti-vax sentiment like it’s prom night, we’ve decided to discard decades of progress in evidence-based medicine because it… well, because it makes certain people feel better.\n\nIf the past five years have taught us anything, it’s that trust in medicine isn’t infinite. It has to be earned—through consistency, transparency, and an uncomfortable amount of humility. What we’re watching instead is a slow-motion institutional self-immolation, where agencies burn their own reputations to keep a disinformation bonfire going for a few more political points.\n\nAnd here we are. Again. Watching policy change not with peer-reviewed data or a new meta-analysis, but with a social media video and a shrug. It’s enough to make you want to scream—or at least start practicing medicine in Canada.\n\nBut in the meantime, we stay. We vaccinate where we can. We explain (again) to confused patients why something the CDC just said doesn’t make sense. We work the night shift, pull the consult, run the code—and we keep trying to patch the holes punched in the public’s faith in healthcare, one exhausted encounter at a time.\n\nBecause somebody has to.\n\n Citations\n\n1.

Today I admitted a baby whose life was probably saved by the NBS. It detected a condition for which he had no symptoms, and the NBS folks were able to collaborate with doctors to contact the family, get the baby into the hospital, and already on proper management for the condition. The baby had no clinical symptoms but labwork was very clear that this baby would have become critically ill at any moment had he not been admitted. Without the Newborn Screening and public health providers, this baby would not have been brought to a hospital until he was possibly past the point of saving. So, thanks everyone who works to make these systems function, and fuck you to anyone trying to interfere (at a local, state, or federal level). If this isn't allowed here, apologies!",

It fell short, as multiple federal reports indicated that insurance companies routinely exploited loopholes to avoid paying rates for mental health services that were commensurate with those for other health care. This can lead providers to drop clients and can saddle people with debt. A 2024 survey found that 1 in 4 Americans in frequent mental distress could not see a doctor due to cost.\n\nThe Department of Health and Human Services and two other federal agencies attempted to sew up these loopholes in 2024. But it appears that the agencies’ new leadership will walk back these regulatory updates after a lawsuit challenged them. On May 9, three federal agencies, including HHS, notified the judge that they will not force companies to comply with the current regulations, including potentially modifying or rescinding the regulation. \n\nRead the rest in the article.",

Closing an imaginary border does nothing for the current outbreak nor prevents one, especially when you have 191 other countries, some of whom have heavier TB burden than Mexico**",

A large number of studies generally support not just the safety but benefit of coffee even at the high end of moderation. \n\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28853910/\n\nMeta analysis suggests all cause mortality benefit that peaks around 3.5 cups a day:\n\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31055709/\n\nThere is also a line of literature that serum cholesterol and cardiovascular risk can be raised by coffee consumption (these are very small effects), but that a significant portion of this is mediated by diterpenes - cafestol, and kahweol and that this can be mitigated through paper filters. Which is nice, although historically my favorite forms of coffee (espresso and French press) are not really so amenable to paper filtering. \n\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29735059/\n\nWhen patients ask me I generally tell them that I think coffee consumption in moderation is probably net good for most adults (and every once in a while, newspapers will run pieces urging people to teetotal coffee for health purposes, and there just does not seem to be any science behind this). For myself, because I’m getting older and my cholesterol (but not really my cardiac risk score) is trending up, I’m also interested in any small things that might cumulatively keep my lipids healthy. \n\nNow we’re *actually* drinking coffee with a paper filter because my expensive super auto died and I haven’t gotten it fixed yet.

Also intentionally vague for the same reason.\n\nSo I work at a large children's hospital in the US and am currently involved in the care of a patient with a condition that ultimately will have him in our hospital for several weeks. She needs repeated treatments that are expensive (will probably be around $10,000 just to get the treatment course done), and all the treatments need to be done as an inpatient. She has had (and will continue to get) several MRIs, ongoing ancillary therapists, involvement of several specialists, has spent several days in the ICU and is a high-risk patient that may return, etc. Basically, this kid has an expensive and long hospital course that's going to be followed by an expensive and long bout of acute rehab.\nParents are interesting people. Not unreasonable people at all (with regards to the hospitalization itself) and, in general, incredibly nice and caring parents. They haven't been pushing back on treatment or anything of the sort. Dad stays at home and Mom works, I don't know what she does but the vibe I get is that it isn't necessarily the best paying job.\n\nNevertheless, I found out today that they do not have insurance. I did digging and I found out that they are involved in a health care sharing ministry plan, and I honestly don't know anything about this nor do I know what it means for the kid. He doesn't have Medicaid or CHIP to my knowledge.\n\nI'm off service tomorrow and I've never encountered this before and I'm genuinely curious on the implications of this on the kid's hospital and rehab course. There were some talks that the HCSM wouldn't cover the rehab, but I guess our LCSW spoke to the HCSM directly and they said they cover it.\n\nDoes anyone know anything about these, how they work, and the implications of having this vs just having some really shitty insurance? How are HCSMs when it comes to major hospitalizations with significant costs? What happens to the family if some things aren't covered?",

      "text": "https://techcrunch.com/2025/01/24/unitedhealth-confirms-190-million-americans-affected-by-change-healthcare-data-breach/\n\n“Change Healthcare has determined the estimated total number of individuals impacted by the Change Healthcare cyberattack is approximately 190 million,” said Tyler Mason, a spokesperson for UnitedHealth Group in an email to TechCrunch. “The vast majority of those people have already been provided individual or substitute notice. The final number will be confirmed and filed with the Office for Civil Rights at a later date.” \nUnitedHealth’s spokesperson said the company was “not aware of any misuse of individuals’ information as a result of this incident and has not seen electronic medical record databases appear in the data during the analysis.” \nThe February 2024 cyberattack is the largest breach of medical data in U.S. history and caused months of outages across the U.S. healthcare system. Change Healthcare, a health tech giant and UnitedHealth subsidiary, is one of the largest handlers of health, medical data, and patient records; it’s also one of the biggest processors of healthcare claims in the United States.\nThe data breach resulted in the theft of massive quantities of health and insurance-related information, some of which was published online by the hackers who claimed responsibility for the breach. **Change Healthcare subsequently paid at least two ransoms to prevent further publication of the stolen files.**\nUnitedHealth previously put the number of affected individuals at around 100 million people when the company filed its preliminary analysis with the Office for Civil Rights, the unit under the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services that investigates data breaches.\nIn its data breach notice, **Change Healthcare said that the cybercriminals stole names and addresses, dates of birth, phone numbers, email addresses, and government identity documents, which included Social Security numbers, driver’s license numbers, and passport numbers. The stolen health data also includes diagnoses, medications, test results, imaging, and care and treatment plans, as well as health insurance information. Change said the data also includes financial and banking information found in patient claims.**",

      "text": "[Primary Article](https://www.acpjournals.org/doi/10.7326/ANNALS-24-03933?utm_source=cmpnr&utm_campaign=lfa_250624_1&utm_content=1&cmp=1&utm_medium=email)\n\n**Abstract**\n\nLarge language models (LLMs) offer substantial promise for improving health care; however, some risks warrant evaluation and discussion. This study assessed the effectiveness of safeguards in foundational LLMs against malicious instruction into health disinformation chatbots. Five foundational LLMs—OpenAI’s GPT-4o, Google’s Gemini 1.5 Pro, Anthropic’s Claude 3.5 Sonnet, Meta’s Llama 3.2-90B Vision, and xAI’s Grok Beta—were evaluated via their application programming interfaces (APIs). Each API received system-level instructions to produce incorrect responses to health queries, delivered in a formal, authoritative, convincing, and scientific tone. Ten health questions were posed to each customized chatbot in duplicate. Exploratory analyses assessed the feasibility of creating a customized generative pretrained transformer (GPT) within the OpenAI GPT Store and searched to identify if any publicly accessible GPTs in the store seemed to respond with disinformation. Of the 100 health queries posed across the 5 customized LLM API chatbots, 88 (88%) responses were health disinformation. Four of the 5 chatbots (GPT-4o, Gemini 1.5 Pro, Llama 3.2-90B Vision, and Grok Beta) generated disinformation in 100% (20 of 20) of their responses, whereas Claude 3.5 Sonnet responded with disinformation in 40% (8 of 20). The disinformation included claimed vaccine–autism links, HIV being airborne, cancer-curing diets, sunscreen risks, genetically modified organism conspiracies, attention deficit–hyperactivity disorder and depression myths, garlic replacing antibiotics, and 5G causing infertility. Exploratory analyses further showed that the OpenAI GPT Store could currently be instructed to generate similar disinformation. Overall, LLM APIs and the OpenAI GPT Store were shown to be vulnerable to malicious system-level instructions to covertly create health disinformation chatbots. These findings highlight the urgent need for robust output screening safeguards to ensure public health safety in an era of rapidly evolving technologies.\n\n**Starter Comment**\n\nThe related editorial linked below provides a timely commentary on the potential of commerically available APIs in the most popular chatbot LLMs, strongly urging every stakeholder to seriously consider the harm of malicious actors spreading medical disinformation from many topics includes HIV, vaccines, autism, and homeopathic practices. That a research group is able to co-opt an API into a misinformation spreader is of concern, with 4 of 5 (except Gemini) not providing safeguards the responses to 100 submitted health questions. I strongly urge that we let the implementation of generative AI and LLMs undergo a measured and careful consideration, including an alpha and beta test to catch the errors and harms made by LLM outputs.\n\n[Editorial](https://www.acpjournals.org/doi/10.7326/ANNALS-25-02035?utm_source=cmpnr&utm_campaign=lfa_250624_1&utm_content=1&cmp=1&utm_medium=email)",

      "text": "Hi all,\n\nI am a GP. I have now had two patients in the last three months ask a variation of the question in the title regarding alcohol processing, which I think is a result of more people having access to keychain breathalyzers. They were both healthy young men in their early 30s with close to average height and weight who drink moderately but do not get drunk as quickly as their both male and female peers. One does not experience hangovers and one does moderately. \n\nOne was considering stopping drinking because he cannot get drunk without drinking over 6 drinks in about 90 minutes, and even so blows around a 0.04 after doing so typically, which he is concerned is binge drinking. They both wanted to know whether this means that drinking was less harmful (per drink) because it was more quickly processed by their body. \n\nI couldn't really answer that question fully and am wondering how anyone here has if asked a similar question. Funny enough, no one has asked the opposite question (I'm a massive lightweight: Is that bad for me?) \n\nI told them that they likely have above average production of alcohol dehydrogenase. I could've told them that neither seemed to have **acute** adverse symptoms from moderate or even relatively heavy consumption for a normal person, but didn't want to. Honestly, I would think that if they do not increase consumption, they probably have greater protection than those who process alcohol like the rest of us (about 0.015% BAC per drink for men and 0.02 for women).\n\nHow have you dealt with this or questions like it and what am I missing?",

      "text": "I’m a 2nd-year MD/MPH student, and I just got an email from my epidemiology professor saying we’ll be using the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) datasets for an upcoming project. However, it was then followed up by a distressed email stating the data is now unavailable. This data, and other datasets, are being scrubbed from the CDC and other government websites right now.\n\nThis is a huge issue for public health research and education, and it's happening at a time when access to this kind of data is more critical than ever. Some folks, like /u/veryconsciouswater, are working to upload what they have to the Internet Archive, but this data shouldn’t be disappearing in the first place.\n\nI wanted to flag this to the community because it could have major implications for research, education, and transparency in the public health field. If you're relying on this data, or if this is something that concerns you, please be aware of what's going on. \n\nDo what you can to preserve as much as possible!\n\nEdit #1 (1/31/2025): /r/publichealth and /r/DataHoarder subreddits are currently trying to archive things. If you have anything, please share!\n\nEdit #2 (2/1/2025):\nSome people wanted more specifics and an ELI5.\n\n● ELI5:\nThe CDC used to have a bunch of data that scientists and doctors could look at to study diseases, like COVID-19, vaccines, and deaths. But recently, they removed or changed some of these datasets, making them harder to find or use.\n\nThink of it like a big library where people go to read books about health. Public health professionals could correlate data between these 'books' to study trends, look at patterns, etc. This can guide future studies, policy decisions, and lets people know what is currently going on with population health. \n\nFor me, a student, I used to be able to download datasets in basically a large spreadsheet. I could then use statical software, like SAS or R, to look at data trends, make graphs, find p-values, odd ratios, etc. And now I can't. \n\nThese are the datasets that were publicly or semi-publicly available. I don't think anyone knows what is happening with the non-public data that the CDC and health departments collect. \n\n\n\n● Specifics:\nSome examples of now missing datasets include (on mobile so hyperlinking these are hard, but they're a google away):\n\n• Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) CDC Data (website is down). BRFSS websites for some state websites are still up, but the data won't download.\n--- A nationwide survey that tracks health behaviors, chronic diseases, and preventive care use among adults.\n\n• Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance System (YRBSS) (gives a \"webpage not found error\")\n--- A survey that monitors health behaviors in high school students, including drug use, mental health, and sexual health.\n\n• Social Vulnerability Index (website is down)\n--- A tool used to identify communities most at risk from disasters, disease outbreaks, and other public health threats.\n\n• Environmental Justice Index (website is down)\n--- A dataset that helps measure how environmental hazards disproportionately impact different communities, especially marginalized populations.\n\n\n● Not datasets per se, but still valuable on a public health level that is going missing:\n\n• Atlas Plus Tool (website is down)\n--- A platform providing data on HIV, viral hepatitis, STDs, and tuberculosis, with detailed information on various demographics, including LGBTQ+ populations\n\n• Current STI Treatment Guidelines for medical providers\n--- A guideline that provided medical providers with up-to-date information on how to treat STIs.\n\n• Numerous LGBTQ+ related webpages on federal websites are being scrubbed. Too many to link.\n\nFinal Edit (2/1/2025):\nLink to the data is ready [Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/DataHoarder/s/k2OBgo7ypp)!",

Anthem's policy would not have increased costs for their enrollees. Rather, it would have reduced payments for some of the most overpaid physicians in America. And when millionaire doctors beat back cost controls — as they\nhave here — patients pay the price through higher premiums.\nAnthem's policy would have cost anesthesiologists, not their enrollees\nAnesthesia services are billed partially on the basis of how long a procedure takes. This creates an incentive for anesthesiologists to err on the side of exaggerating how long their services were required during an operation. And there is evidence that some anesthesiologists may engage in overbilling by overstating the length of a procedure, or the degree of risk a patient faces in undergoing anesthesia.”\n\n“But the avarice and inefficiencies of private insurers are not the sole — or even primary — reasons why vital medical services are often unaffordable and inaccessible in the United States. The bigger issue is that America’s health care providers — hospitals, physicians, and drug companies — charge much higher rates than their peers in other wealthy nations. “\n\nThis reporter with no understanding of what goes on in the system and probably got paid by fucking BCBS to shit post this to our incredibly ill informed nation.",

The closest I've had are a couple times, a patient complains that at another ED, they did \"some tests\" and then discharged them and told them to take otc pain meds, which the patients were annoyed at.\n\nAre there legions of doctors that exist somewhere who just tell all patients that they're faking, or whatever else the complaints online call out??? Do all my colleagues who seem to be trying their best, and doing everything they reasonably can, do their personalities completely flip when I'm not interacting with them, and they become huge assholes towards every patient??? Heck, maybe I do it too. Maybe I tell patients that they're all druggie pieces of shit, all faking because they're women, and I just black out during those conversations and then wake up and move on with the rest of my day after ruining someone else's. \n\nSeriously though, where do all these comments come from? Of course there are shitty doctors, just like shitty lawyers, engineers, chefs, etc. But holy fuck you would think me, you, and basically 90 percent of the people on this subreddit are almost psychopathically non empathetic based on reddit comments.",

Saw a 71 yo patient for the first time 2 weeks ago. Just got out of the hospital after a 4 week admission due to sepsis (UTI) and numerous complications. She was in rehab for a few weeks after as well. About 2 weeks into her admission she developed a severe persistent cough. She had this cough for about a month now and had several near syncopal episodes from it and could barely get a word out. Vitals all stable, chest xray by hospital and rehab like 2 weeks ago were negative and they were just treating it like a URI. Never did any further imaging. No peripheral swelling, no chest pain, just SOB and severe dry cough.\n\nHeard crackles in the left lung base which was new, got an urgent chest xray. Given history was concerned for PE or HCAP. Talking with the radiologist, new opacity in the left lung most favoring pneumonia. But she had no infectious signs, no fevers/chills/or any productive sputum. Asked if it could be a PE, and they said yes if it was a large infarct but more likely pneumonia. CT would ultimately differentiate. Gut said PE, so sent her to the hospital. Had large bilateral PE (worse left side) and went into respiratory failure that night. Required O2 and support, nearly required emergent thrombectomy. \n\nShe improved quickly, was discharged and saw her in office today. She was near in tears thanking me and was so happy she could get up and move around and felt so much better. \n\nIt’s easy to get burnt out at times, but was glad to make a difference where the result was nearly catastrophic. And reminded me that while I have my gripes, can’t imagine myself doing anything else and very grateful to be in this position. What moment has made you have a similar reaction?",

      "text": "I came across a recent news release that highlighted the rate of burnout in internal medicine doctors in the US, that was based on an Annals of Internal Medicine Study.\n\nNews source: https://www.acpjournals.org/doi/10.7326/ANNALS-24-02896\n\nPeer-reviewed source: https://www.acpjournals.org/doi/10.7326/ANNALS-24-02896\n\nJust thought it would be of interest to this sub.\n\nIn one sense, 10% is probably an underestimate - at least in my experience here in Australia, it's closer to 70% (source: https://www.ama.com.au/sites/default/files/documents/AMA_PS_Health_and_wellbeing_of_doctors_16_7_20.pdf), especially post-COVID, the shortage of health workforce and the increasing focus on KPIs.\n\nLet's hope this issue improves so we don't lose the doctors we have, and attract a new generation that can help change the system and culture.",

      "text": "We spend a lot of time and effort treating a lot of conditions in medicine. But when you look at the increase in life expectancy over the last century, the vast majority of gains have occurred due to advances in 3 (overlapping) areas:\n\n  \n1. Infectious disease treatment\n\n2. Maternal mortality\n\n3. Infant mortality\n\nIronically, these are the areas where there is the most patient/public resistance to accepted medical practice.\n\n#1 is obvious, anti-vaxxerism/vaccine hesitancy. This one is probably *caused* by its own success, people don't see infectious diseases as nearly as much of a threat anymore because our public health campaigns, vaccines, and antibiotics have been so successful in reducing infectious disease as a cause of death.\n\n  \n#2 though, perhaps less visible, but there is a *ton* of resistance to appropriate medical care for childbirth. Lots of doulas pushing non-evidence based practices, a large movement towards birthing centers even for high risk births (I've seen  a few of them in the ED after disastrous complications recently, which is why this jumps to mind). The common refrain is \"we were giving birth for millenia before we had hospitals\", which always makes me think \"yea but women were dying in childbirth at insanely high rates\".\n\n#3: Overlaps with both of the above, with the added portion of resistance to routine infant care. I've encountered anti-vaxxers on a neonatology rotation who didn't want their kids to even get vitamin K?\n\nMeanwhile we are comparatively far less effective at treating lifestyle illnesses, but there's no widespread movement to prove that hypertension actually isn't bad for you or you don't need anti-diabetes drugs. People don't follow recommendations, sure, but they don't actively believe that the recommendations are wrong. Maybe the main area where outcomes and public trust in medicine converge is trauma care, where we have made huge strides in treating it and people generally accept what their doctors recommend. But in general, I find it interesting that the areas where we have been most successful are now subject to the most resistance from the public.",

We talked about how that is a life sentence before age 1.  \n* They know about polio.  \n* I talked about the baby I watched die of pneumococcal sepsis.  Another mother at our feet.

We had to do our own IVs at the NYC hospital.  The babies were just so sick and all we could do was keep them hydrated and wait for them to recover.  And then in the fall of 2006 the rotavirus vaccine came out.  And in February of 2008 I was the senior on the floor and... there weren't any rotavirus kids.  It was just gone.\n\nAnd I asked that mother, now that she'd asked me which vaccines were important, I was going to turn the questions around.

      "text": "Yesterday was a happy day for me. I saw a patient who was medically complex and undergoing chemo for a recently diagnosed malignancy. He saw me for symptoms from a lesion that were initially thought to be 2/2 his malignancy, but these symptoms persisted despite weeks of chemo with good response otherwise. Being concerned that he had a concurrent second malignancy or an inflammatory lesion, I decided that he needed a repeat MRI and biopsy. He also needed steroids for his very debilitating and worsening symptoms. The problem: he has IDDM, and the time was Friday afternoon.\n\nI didn't want him to show up in the ED over the weekend in HHS. But the poor guy begged me for steroids (which he needed). Could I adjust his insulin regimen? Sure, I could adjust his insulin as confidently as an endocrinologist can perform a Whipple. His PCP is outside of our academic hospital system. After sending the patient to get labs, promising him that I would try my best, I sighed, sent a message to our surgeons requesting an urgent biopsy, and dialed the number on his PCP's Epic profile page, fully expecting an automated message telling me that they would get back to me on Monday when their office reopens.\n\nTo my surprise, the PCP himself picked up the phone. After I introduced myself, he responded with a voice too upbeat for a busy PCP on a Friday afternoon: \"are you calling about Mr. X? His sister called me. His whole family sees me, I know him very well, I already talked to them about his insulin on steroids, I also got his MRI moved up to Monday. Anything I'm missing?\"\n\nWe discussed a few more details about this patient's case, but no, sir, you did not miss anything. Shortly after we exchanged pleasantries and ended the phone call, the secretary from surgery informed me that the patient's biopsy has been scheduled on Tuesday. Within an hour, what I thought (from plenty of experience) was a Friday Afternoon Mission Impossible turned into a warm fuzzy and, shall I say, fun process, almost like a mental jacuzzi. I felt happy. I still feel happy today ruminating on the events of yesterday. Rather than work, it felt more like team sports. Maybe this was what medicine was like \"back in the day\"?\n\nOn this sub we have been discussing events recently that (rightfully) incited feelings of anxiety, resentment, sadness, and anger. I thought I would share something that warmed my exhausted heart and refilled my empty tank just a bit ;)",

      "text": "I see work comp cases in clinic all the time. I am not referring here to the utilization review process in general which is already harmful enough,  I'm referring to the fact that work comp companies can and do frequently decide they disagree with you that your patient is injured, and they can just stop paying for things and require a qualified medical examiner. \n\nThe QME is generally not going to say a patient has no injury when they have no injury, they might disagree with you about the degree of injury but unless you are lying about the injury or are a complete idiot who shouldn't be practicing medicine 9/10 times they are going to agee the patient does have some degree of impairment still. I believe this is a routine practice by work comp companies to try to get out of paying for cases that aren't resolving quickly in a straightforward fashion- the qme sees the patient and says things aren't so bad despite the injury still causing some degree of impairment and the patient still requiring some degree of treatment and the statutory period in which they are allowed to just settle out the case not being up yet. Work comp basically gets to force a discharge with some paltry settlement. My only recourse against this is to tell the patient they need a lawyer.   \n\nWhat claps my cheeks here is that someone without my 4 years of med school, 3 years of residency, 8 years post residency experience treating work related injuries, is allowed to accuse me either of lying or incompetence without any justification to back it up. The most recent case of this bullshit happened when all the patient really needs to get better is more PT. They are impugning my abilities and/or good character because I want my patient to have a bit more PT.  I even said if she had no further improvement or still had symptoms after another round I would be willing to discharge the case.  Nope, I'm just a big old idiot enabler who probably doctored her mri report, right.  \n\nHow the HELL is this acceptable, and why can't something be done about it. FUCK this country for treating corporations as infallible and allowing them to rampantly do things that would normally be seen as a gross violation of the law. If I came into millions through the lottery I would retain my career and personally sue every single one of these pieces of shit companies for slander and tortious interference.",

However, putting aside incidentalomas and other findings which could result in additional diagnostics and patient anxiety, I saw a young person (<40 years old) who was asymptomatic/healthy without family history and paid out of pocket $2200 (FSA eligible) and discovered a legit renal cell carcinoma that was still stage I, but definitely large enough that it was resected immediately rather than observed. One could debate whether the cancer-related outcome will be different in case it would have grown slowly enough to eventually be discovered anyway +/- eventually manifested symptoms that could have prompted workup that would have been early enough to cure, but I'm sure that many other people in this person's circle will be motivated to pursue these costly scans. Apparently the image quality was decent rather than some of the low quality MRIs that are done at some standalone places.\n\nI'm curious if you've taken care of people who had independently pursued these full body MRIs, if they discovered anything significant, and how you approach counseling and advising them and the people in their circles about them. Or... have you pursued them yourselves? What do you think of them?",

They believe that doctors in the U.S. earn very well, and that this is a kind of safety net.\n\nBut no one is actually living there, seeing the real market and the changes happening.\n\nSo I want to ask you, as American doctors:\n\t•\tDo you think the quality of life for doctors in the U.S. is declining or is going to decline in the coming years?\n\t•\tCould the growing number of immigrant physicians, many accepting lower salaries and tougher working conditions, eventually hurt the system and devalue U.S.-trained physicians?\n\t•\tAre these new laws allowing more foreign doctors — even those who aren’t ECFMG-certified — going to damage the job market long-term, or am I just being overly pessimistic?\n\nI’m planning to apply for residency in Florida in the next 2–4 years.\n\nI really appreciate your opinion!",

      "text": "[https://radiologybusiness.com/topics/healthcare-management/legal-news/appeals-court-upholds-landmark-75m-verdict-against-radiologist-er-doc](https://radiologybusiness.com/topics/healthcare-management/legal-news/appeals-court-upholds-landmark-75m-verdict-against-radiologist-er-doc)\n\nAn appeals court recently upheld a “landmark” $75 million verdict against a radiologist and emergency physician, plaintiff attorneys announced Tuesday. \n\nThe case dates back nearly a decade, to October 2015, when Jonathan Buckelew collapsed while receiving chiropractic care for his neck. He was transported to a hospital leading to a series of negligent events, *Radiology Business* reported [previously](http://radiologybusiness.com/topics/patient-care/75m-malpractice-verdict-splits-fault-between-er-doctor-radiologist).\n\nEmergency imaging showed Buckelew, 32 at the time, suffered a brainstem stroke—a diagnosis that should have prompted immediate treatment. However, his attorneys argued that the care team failed to reach a definitive diagnosis until the patient’s second day in the hospital. During the protracted wait, Buckelew’s brain was so severely damaged that he is now permanently stricken with “[locked-in syndrome](https://rarediseases.org/rare-diseases/locked-in-syndrome/#:~:text=Locked%2Din%20syndrome%20is%20a,the%20movements%20of%20the%20eyes.),” rendering him unable to feel or control any voluntary muscle groups except those of his eyes.\n\nA jury sided with the man in 2022, awarding $46 million in civil damages and $29 million in medical expenses. About 60% of the sum was pinned on the EM physician, and 40% on the radiologist, while other clinicians were cleared. \n\n**Matthew Womack, MD, an emergency doc at North Fulton Hospital at the time, fought the decision.** But a Georgia Court of Appeals affirmed the $40 million ruling against him on March 10. **Plaintiff attorneys believe this is the largest ER malpractice verdict in the state’s history.** \n\n“This decision is a victory not just for Jonathan Buckelew and his family, but for patient safety in Georgia,” Lloyd Bell, founding partner of [Bell Law Firm](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.belllawfirm.com%2F&esheet=54228022&newsitemid=20250325615172&lan=en-US&anchor=Bell+Law+Firm&index=3&md5=271bf87a7c29a641c2c592d0390104e2) and co-counsel in the case, said in a [statement](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20250325615172/en/Georgia-Court-of-Appeals-Affirms-Record-Verdict-in-Locked-in-Syndrome-Case) shared March 25. “The court of appeals has made it clear that emergency room physicians must be held accountable when their actions—or inaction—lead to catastrophic harm.”\n\nBell Law emphasized that the ruling “upholds this verdict in full.” According to court [documents](http://belllawfirm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/25-03-10-Opinion.pdf), radiologist James Waldschmidt, MD, also appealed but later filed a notice that Buckelew’s claims against him “had been resolved,” and he withdrew. \n\nWaldschmidt’s attorney had previously pointed the jury to evidence showing the radiologist read Buckelew’s imaging “with an eye to answering the specific question” of whether one of his arteries was torn. The attorney had compared a stroke to a forest fire.\n\n“\\[Waldschmidt’s\\] job is not to go down there and put \\[the fire\\] out,” the radiologist’s attorney said previously. “His job is to identify the smoke, and he did that.”\n\nA 10-year case. Since this was lost on appeal I assume this means bankruptcy and asset loss for the ER doc. Name dragged through the mud online. I wouldn't be surprised if he was experiencing SI. I know I would.\n\nWhat a f\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*g clown world.\n\nGeorgia has no cap on non-economic damages. Think about that when picking a state to practice medicine in.",

Now, several of those items – including “national origin,” “politics” and “marital status” – have been removed from that list.\n\n> Medical staff are still required to treat veterans regardless of race, color, religion and sex, and all veterans remain entitled to treatment. But individual workers are now free to decline to care for patients based on personal characteristics not explicitly prohibited by federal law.\n\n> Doctors and other medical staff can also be barred from working at VA hospitals based on their marital status, political party affiliation or union activity, documents reviewed by the Guardian show. \n\n> Similarly, the bylaw on “decisions regarding medical staff membership” no longer forbids VA hospitals from discriminating against candidates for staff positions based on national origin, sexual orientation, marital status, membership in a labor organization or “lawful political party affiliation”.\n\n> Sources at multiple VA hospitals, speaking on condition of anonymity because of fear of retaliation, told the Guardian that the rule changes were imposed without consultation with the system’s doctors – a characterization the VA’s [Press Secretary] Kasperowicz did not dispute.",

      "text": "I have been a NICU Respiratory Therapist for almost 10 years. In the largest NICU in my state. I have seen a lot of sad cases and infant death but I’m struggling quite a bit with this one. More than I have in a long time. My state like many others recently made abortion illegal with few exceptions. So I knew this day was going to come but nothing prepared me for just how bad this was. The baby had a severe case of a horrible extremely painful and gruesome fetal anomaly which I won’t say what it was. The anomaly isn’t always fatal so it doesn’t fall under one of the exceptions in the state for fatal anomalies. But with how horrible of an anomaly this was the mother tried to do the abortion at home. I don’t know much about the mother’s situation and I wouldn’t share anything if I did. But my state is at the very bottom in the country for access to prenatal care. So I would guess that she wasn’t made aware of the disease until late in the pregnancy. So when she attempted the abortion and had excessive blood loss and came to the maternity ED, the baby was far enough along we are required to resuscitate. \n\nEven though the baby was not wanted, I still had to resuscitate. I had to get an airway and secure it and again in my 10 years experience, this was the most grisly thing I have ever done. And for what, the baby didn’t even live to 24 hours old. It was horrifying. \n\nIt’s been weeks now and I can’t get it out of my head. Due to the abortion ban, I knew something like this would happen but never like this. My heart is broken for that mom. My heart is broken for that baby and how much pain it must have been in. But the biggest feeling I have is anger for all those people that voted for it. I have been talking about and showing google pictures of the disease to everyone I know so they too can know the gravity of what this abortion ban means. Even though there are exceptions in the law, it doesn’t matter because either our access is so low that women are not able to get abortions even when they are suppose to be allowed to or they have a technically not 100% fatal disease and so are not except. This is so inhumane, I don’t know how I’m going to carry on doing what I do. Is this going to be my new normal? I have always had to deal with patients that I thought to myself they should have been aborted. But the parents made the decision to try anyway. But for this baby NO ONE I mean NO ONE in that deliver room wanted this baby. Everyone in the room from the mom, the dad, to the neonatologist did not want to have this baby born and have to resuscitate but some law maker and the people that voted for it that are not even in the fucking room or in the same universe of understanding are forcing us to. Im sitting here sick to my stomach about what happened and for the future of what this means and I don’t know if I can carry on with this.",

      "text": "I'm a PM&R attending who works in a private hospital seeing consults and managing patients on the rehab unit. I do many peer to peers with insurance to get patients into rehab; I'm pretty good at them at this point and have a (reasonably) high denial overturn rate.  \n  \nThere have always been a handful of calls where it feels like no matter what I do or say, or how clear cut the case is from my perspective, their decision to deny was made before I picked up the phone. But today was the most egregious example I've ever had.  \n  \nCall from a managed Medicare medical director about a middle aged gentleman with stroke. Severe aphasia but cooperative, mod-max assist, supportive family - really a slam dunk that I was surprised was denied in the first place, but thought would be an easy overturn.  \n  \nI pitch my case to the insurance doc. Again, there are zero red flags on his chart that would make him unsuitable for inpatient rehab. And lo and behold, the insurance doc agrees with me! She says \"I 100% agree with you. He absolutely needs inpatient rehab, no question, he meets every criteria.\"  \n  \nGreat. As I get ready to move on with my day, she continues: \"Unfortunately, I'm just not empowered to approve him at this time.\"  \n  \nHuh?  \n  \nI pause for several moments and ask, what do you mean? You just said he meets criteria and absolutely needs rehab. She states \"Like I said, I'm just not empowered to overturn this case. I highly suggest you place an expedited appeal, and I will be rooting for you that it gets overturned.\"  \n  \nI was incredulous. I told her that he was a slam dunk rehab admission and reiterated the facts (as if that would help). I asked, how can you agree with me but not rule in his favor?  \n  \nShe told me \"As an individual I agree, but as a (insurance) representative, I'm not empowered to overturn this request.\"  \n  \nI should have pressed harder but honestly I was so stunned that I just sort of mutely ended the call. I've dealt with a lot of bullshit denials before, but they have always at least had *some* argument, however stupid, for why the services were not required. This was the first time I had someone say, yup, you're exactly right, we just don't care.  \n  \nWhat is the point of insurance if they don't help you when you actually need it? What is the point of me doing a peer to peer if the decision was made long before I pick up the phone? Make it make sense.",

General public already have perceptions as doctors as rich or greedy and flexing your 750k salary as a radiologist or whatever other high paying salary specialty isn’t a good look. Especially in this economy where people are already hurting and seeing healthcare as super expensive and they can easily see us the rich scapegoat. You will find public will have very little sympathy when we complain about pay cuts if all they see are these salaries. \n\nI get it, your ego feels good when you post it. But lots of people don’t see the years of work, sacrifice, student debt, etc behind the salary. They just see the high salary. We already don’t have the best perception. \n\nI’m all for salary transparency among colleagues and residents so they’re aware of the market but showing off in public like that doesn’t help anyone. \n\nLower paying specialties rarely post on public forums so people are all thinking doctors are all making 500k+.

And the measles gave you lifetime protection against measles infection...The vaccine doesn’t do that. The vaccine is effective for some people for life, but for many people it wanes.” **We're nearly 40 years into routine 2-dose vaccines without boosters and yet measles haven't spread among most vaccinated people. Also anong the current outbreak in New Mexico and Texas, 250/256 of the official cases have not received a dose of the MMR vaccine - all of the 29 hospitalized patients are unvaccinated, and both people (1 child and 1 adult) who died did not have immunity to measles (ie unvaccinated)**\n\n\"“[The MMR vaccine] does not appear to provide maternal immunity, it used to be that very young kids were protected by breast milk...Women who get vaccinated do not provide that level of immunity that the natural measles infection did. So you’re now seeing measles hit very very young kids and hitting older people within whom the vaccine has waned.” **Pants-on-fire false.

It causes all the illnesses that measles itself cause, like encephalitis and blindness, etc., so people ought to be able to make that choice for themselves...[but the vaccine does] stop the spread of the disease.” **We have had real world data on the MMR vaccine since Lyndon B Johnson's presidency, MLK's \"I have a dream\", and the Beatles' peak...if the vaccines were causing more encephalitis and blindness than measles itself, the WHO and CDC would've pulled it in the 1980s, but alas they still recommend it even 50-60 years later**\n\nAll quotes from the Daily Beast article, based on RFK Jr.'s interview with Sean Hannity on Fox News:\nhttps://www.foxnews.com/video/6369907937112",

      "text": "**Your input is being solicited!**  This appeal for medical professionals to comment was posted June 12 at [https://www.help.senate.gov/ranking/newsroom/news/ranking-member-sanders-asks-health-care-providers-for-information-on-republicans-budget-bill](https://www.help.senate.gov/ranking/newsroom/news/ranking-member-sanders-asks-health-care-providers-for-information-on-republicans-budget-bill) and is republished here entire:\n\n   \\- - -\n\nU.S. Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions\n\n06.12.2025\n\n# Ranking Member Sanders Asks Health Care Providers for Information on Republicans’ Budget Bill\n\nWASHINGTON – Today, Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), Ranking Member of the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions (HELP), requested information from health care providers across the country on the impact of Trump’s “big, beautiful” budget bill.\n\nThis bill will slash federal health care programs by over $1 trillion and throw 16 million people off their health insurance. Congress has a solemn responsibility to the American people to gather input on the impact of these policies before the bill is considered on the Senate floor. But Republicans are rushing this bill forward without holding a single committee hearing or markup. Ranking Member Sanders welcomes information from all health care providers, including community health centers, hospitals, rural health clinics, individual clinicians and provider groups.\n\nResponses may be submitted to [*providerinput@help.senate.gov*](mailto:providerinput@help.senate.gov) by **June 20, 2025.** Read the full request letter [here](https://www.sanders.senate.gov/wp-content/uploads/6.12.25-Letter-to-Providers-Final.pdf) or below.\n\nTo: All Interested Health Care Providers\n\nThe Senate is currently considering the largest cuts to federal health care programs in the history of Medicaid and the Affordable Care Act (ACA). These cuts—outlined in the budget reconciliation bill that just passed the House—will slash federal health care programs by over $1 trillion[\\[1\\]](https://www.cbo.gov/publication/61461) and eliminate enhanced premium tax credits, causing 16 million people to lose their health insurance.[\\[2\\]](https://www.cbo.gov/system/files/2025-06/Wyden-Pallone-Neal_Letter_6-4-25.pdf)\n\nThe bill could turn the crisis in American health care into a national emergency. Researchers at the Yale School of Public Health and the Leonard Davis Institute of Health Economics at the University of Pennsylvania estimate that, as a result of these cuts and other provisions in the bill, over 51,000 people will die unnecessarily every year.[\\[3\\]](https://www.sanders.senate.gov/wp-content/uploads/LDI-Yale-Letter-Final-1.pdf) Seniors will see their premiums go up,[\\[4\\]](https://www.cbo.gov/system/files/2025-05/Wyden-Pallone_Letter.pdf) children and people with disabilities will lose their health insurance,[\\[5\\]](https://ccf.georgetown.edu/2025/05/06/rescinding-the-eligibility-and-enrollment-rule-would-thwart-efforts-to-improve-efficiency-in-medicaid-and-efforts-to-reduce-improper-payments/) and working families who are struggling to get by will have to pay a $35 “sick tax” when they need to go to the doctor or the hospital.[\\[6\\]](https://www.congress.gov/bill/119th-congress/house-bill/1/text)\n\nRemarkably, despite the major changes contemplated, the Senate is poised to pass the reconciliation bill without the benefit of a single committee hearing or markup. No doctor, nurse, hospital, community health center, or nursing home has been formally consulted to help explain to the American people what these proposed changes would actually mean. In contrast, when Congress enacted the ACA, the Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee (HELP Committee) held the longest markup in its history, considering hundreds of amendments from members of both parties and soliciting feedback from hospitals, community health centers, and nursing homes.\n\nFor this reason, I am seeking input from health care providers across the country. The HELP Committee needs to hear from the nation’s providers about what this means for organizations and their patients. I ask that you submit answers to the following questions to [providerinput@help.senate.gov](mailto:providerinput@help.senate.gov) by June 20, 2025:\n\n1. How would the health care provisions in the House reconciliation bill impact your ability to care for patients?\n2. Would the proposed cuts to Medicaid and the ACA require you to cut back on clinical staff, services, or care delivery? Please explain if possible.\n3. What do you think will be the overall effect of the health care provisions in the House reconciliation bill on the American people?\n\nThe House reconciliation bill also contains a series of technical provisions that will seriously impact patient care. If appropriate, I ask that you also answer the following specific questions:\n\n1. Would Medicaid work requirements, more frequent Medicaid eligibility reviews, and more burdensome documentation requirements associated with enrollment in ACA coverage require you to hire specialized administrative staff? If so, how many staff members do you anticipate hiring?\n2. How many additional hours of paperwork do you anticipate having to complete on behalf of patients to help them keep their insurance coverage?\n3. How do you anticipate the moratorium on Medicaid provider taxes will affect access to care and payment rates for struggling providers in your state?\n4. What will be the impact of changing the financing of the ACA’s cost-sharing reductions from “silver loading” to direct payment? Will it result in more uninsured residents or more bad debt for providers?\n5. How will rescinding the eligibility and enrollment regulations impact seniors, people with disabilities, and children? Will it result in higher premiums, higher out-of-pocket costs, and higher uninsured rates for these populations?\n\nThank you in advance for your thoughtful responses to these questions.\n\nSincerely,\n\nBernard Sanders  \nRanking Member  \nU.S. Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions\n\n \\- - -",

Obviously, hospital and private equity want them to reduce labor costs, at the expense of patient care. However, it really just hit me how low of a barrier it is to enter the field. A nurse in our office just told me she's starting next week in a NP course. This nurse has very limited critical thinking skills and while she is nice, she shouldn't be treating patients, just on a fundamental level. She's just not smart. She has trouble following basic instructions. I asked her where she was going and she mentioned it was an online school. Very limited clinical training, very small barrier to entry. Afterwards, my job will treat her expertise level as equal to mine, despite a huge difference in training, testing, etc. They will give her difficult cases (they seriously don't see a difference). \n\nI don't know.

      "text": "In this comment, for those interested, here’s the link to the peer reviewed journal article:\n\nhttps://www.mayoclinicproceedings.org/article/S0025-6196(24)00668-2/fulltext\n\nFrom the press release:\n\nhttps://med.stanford.edu/news/all-news/2025/04/doctor-burnout-rates-what-they-mean.html\n\nU.S. physician burnout rates drop yet remain worryingly high, Stanford Medicine-led study finds\n\nDoctors felt less occupational distress in 2023-2024 than they did during the COVID-19 pandemic, but nearly half said they experienced at least one symptom of burnout.\n\nFirst, some good news: In late 2023 and early 2024, significantly fewer U.S. physicians reported symptoms of job burnout than they did a few years earlier.\n\nThe not-so-good news: Their burnout rates remain stubbornly high compared with those of other American workers.\n\nThe studies are not only vital to understanding trends in physician well-being relative to the U.S. workforce but also to gauging the impact on the health care delivery system: On top of its workforce implications, evidence suggests that physician burnout worsens the quality of patient care, increases the risk of medical errors and decreases patient satisfaction.\n\nOf the respondents, 58.6% identified as men and 39.6% identified as women, a gender breakdown that approximately mirrors the profession nationally. Burnout rates differed between sexes, with female physicians at risk by about 27% more than male physicians after adjusting for age, specialty and other factors, the study found. Also, doctors in several specialties, including emergency medicine and general internal medicine, were at heightened risk for burnout. This is particularly concerning, Shanafelt said, given that these specialties are often patients’ first point of contact with a health care system.\n\n“Many physicians still love what they do, but they just can’t keep doing it at this pace in the current practice environment, with its administrative burdens and regulatory burdens, and the proliferation of asynchronous messaging with patients through the electronic health record,” Shanafelt said, referring to patients’ online correspondence with a doctor. “So physicians are, in essence, just saying, ‘I can’t keep working this way.’”",

She ultimately suffers anoxic brain injury and paralysis. \n\nThe lawsuit takes 3.5 years. She passes away in 7 years.\n\nThe only physician found to be negligent was the hospitalist who responded to the code blue. The attorney argues he should have stabilized the patient at the nursing station prior to sending her to the to the ICU.\n\nThis is interesting because I feel we rarely hear these cases from the side of the plaintiff attorney. We do a lot of retrospective reviews here, but we dont really get to hear the attorney tell it from their point of view. So thats one reason I wanted to post this up. \n\nThe second reason is to ask what we thought about the opinion. I'm not sure how they expected a hospitalist to stabilize a critical airway at a nursing station. I doubt they were trained to intubated or do cricothyrotomy. How could the hospitalist have been less negligent here?\n\nEDIT: this post is a goldmine for emergent management of this complication. Thank you for all the great info. When these terrible things happen, then best we can do is learn as much as possible from them.",

He has a lot of teachings, and he is highly regarded in the Shia community. He the head of Hezbollah.”\n\nThe officer asked how Alawieh feels about Nasrallah.\n\n“I think if you listen to one of his sermons, you would know what I mean,” she replied, according the transcript. “He is a religious, spiritual person.”\n\nThe officer asked her if she supported Hezbollah and what the organization stands for.\n\n“I don’t,” Alawieh replied.\n\nBut, the officer said, she had high regard for the leader of Hezbollah.\n\n“From a religious perspective,” she said.\n\nThe officer asked if she knew that Hezbollah had been designated as a terrorist organization. “Yes,” she said. “I’m not much into politics. But yes.”\n\nThe officer then asked her about the photos of Iran’s leader, Khamenei.\n\n“Again, I am a Shia Muslim,” Alawieh said. “He’s a religious figure. It has nothing to do with politics. It’s all religious, spiritual things.”\n\nThe officer asked why she deleted photos from her phone one or two days before flying into Logan.\n\n“Because I didn’t want the perception,” Alawieh said. “But I know I’m not doing anything wrong. I’m not related to anything politically or militarily.”\n\nThe interview ended with the officer telling her she would not be allowed to re-enter the United States.\n\nEDIT: the source also mentions that she visited his funeral. It wasn’t intentionally omitted from this post. The purpose of this post was to update people, like me, who were terrified for the past 24 hours to go see their families\n\n[Source + other important details](https://www.bostonglobe.com/2025/03/17/metro/deported-ri-doctor-rasha-alawieh-photos-hezbollah-iran-phone-prosecutors-say/)",

      "title": "“She Was Tearful About It”: The Nuances of Casey Means’s Medical Exit and Antiestablishment Origins",
      "text": "https://www.vanityfair.com/news/story/the-nuances-of-casey-means-medical-exit?srsltid=AfmBOopir8Q8LDSCTXCnbgZCXCsccLPEXpwRw78m3FokPlVZGiB2UYZd\n\nSo in a twist that, and I want you all to stay with me now, shocks nobody - she left because she was extended and couldn't even with the reality of having to repeat a year. Which is still insane to me, since ENT is ENT - you finish that shit. \n\nThere is a conversation to be had about the treatment of residents, yes. But this isn't that conversation. \n\nYou don't go into a surgical residency then bitch about \"traditional preventative medicine not being taught\" nah fam - apply to FM/IM to begin with. \n\nHer division chair:\n\n> Dr. Paul W. Flint, who was chairman of the Department of Otolaryngology—Head and Neck Surgery at OHSU at the time, tells Vanity Fair that when Means left the program, it was because she found the surgical work “too stressful” and was not able to continue in the residency.\n\n> “At least she had the strength to recognize that in her fourth year,” Flint says. “It took a lot of guts. I didn’t push her out the door.” He adds, however, that “you lose some credibility when you just drop out.” He says he believes that since then, she has mischaracterized US medicine as a “conspiracy” to keep people sick. “She’s wrong,” he says, adding, “It’s a certain attitude that denies all the successes that occur in medicine.”\n\nMore choice quotes\n\n> Two former residents she served alongside offer a version of her departure from the program that matches with Flint’s. They say that contrary to Means’s oft-told version of events, she exited due to her inability to handle the admittedly high pressure. They describe her as being deeply unhappy and fearful of harming patients, and say she took a leave of absence before departing altogether. The former residents also tell VF that they do not recognize the version of events laid out in the book. In their view, Means misrepresented her residency training and proclaimed a medical conspiracy against good health that simply doesn’t exist. (Both former residents have asked not to be named because they fear retaliation from the Trump administration.)\n\nThe daggers\n\n> He adds that the other residents had to “cover for her, and we’re a small department and all the call falls on them. That’s the problem with late departures.”\n> \n> After she left, the two former residents grew increasingly skeptical of her public claims. “I did not witness a spiritual awakening,” the former junior resident says. “It felt more and more like she was preying on the less educated and using the MD she had to tout these pseudoscience things.”\n> \n> The other former resident observes, “She’s a good person and does care for people and wants what’s best. But it feels disingenuous, demonizing your training. She didn’t make it through.” The former resident adds, “By trying to question our entire field and sowing distrust in medicine, it’s hard to ignore that she may benefit from that.”\n\n\nThe summary? Casey is a snake oil Muppet spewing yarn of her departure that doesn't line up with reality, all to claim she cares about public health when she doesn't, and is untrustworthy in any context much less the role that her sugar daddy wants her for.",

I think it's completely ridiculous that any medical professional, whether it be a doctor, EMS or pharmacist; should have to think (or say) something along the lines of \"I'm sorry, I can't help you. It's against the law.\" \n\nI'm sure I'm not just speaking for myself when I say that a large majority of us got into medicine because we wanted to do the morally right thing to help others with their ailments, however as federal & state laws continue to change, I find myself and others in our related fields unable to effectively (or sometimes at all) do that. Which I personally do not think is fair in the slightest to myself or the patients at risk.\n\nFor context, I got a call from my long time buddy, whom is an OBGYN being hit hard by new laws in Texas. He was calling as a friend outside of the professional space and he was on the verge of falling apart. He described to me how horrible he felt as a doctor to look at young teen in the eyes and tell her she'd have to carry a child that her body would barely be able to handle. He explained that she would survive the pregnancy & be okay with only a small margin for complications, but she was mentally clearly not capable nor ready to be a parent. He was extremely troubled with the situation and it bothered me as much as it bothered him. \n\nThis post serves as a comment / opinionated short rant & safe space for anyone in medicine to share their opinion on the limitations imposed upon them at a state or federal level. My heart goes out to everyone in this situation, I hope you stay strong for us. 💙",

      "title": "I tried a lot of AI medical scribes so you don't have to - my honest review",
      "text": "Hi everyone!\n\nI'm a family doc who also does hospitalist work, and I'm a big tech geek on the side. Ever since AI scribes started popping up, I got super curious that one of them could help out with charting. I posted this to the r/FamilyMedicine group and it got a lot of traction, so thought I'd post the new and updated list here too. Here's my honest take after spending about a year hopping between them.  \n  \n**1. Vero Scribe** ($79/month)  \nUnderdog but this is probably my favourite one that I keep returning to. After customizing the template, the learn feature is probably the biggest game changer for me and probably many others. It learns how you like your notes formatted and outputs all future notes like that. Accuracy has also been great which is the most important feature to most of us.\n\n**2. Freed AI** ($99/month)  \nVery basic but I think that's the point. It’s dead simple to use (which I guess is a plus), but it felt like there wasn’t much flexibility, just a few templates and not much ability to tweak how it works. Output was good for simple visits, but not robust enough for my more complex cases.\n\n**3. Heidi Health** (free tier or $99/month)  \nNot a bad scribe and generates consistent notes. I paid for the premium because I like my custom templates to generate notes exactly how I like them. Their chat functionality doesn't answer medical questions which I find a medical scribe should be able to do. Also, they seem really slow to add new features, their public roadmap is full of coming soon stuff that’s been sitting there forever.\n\n**4. Nabla** ($119/month)  \nSame vibe as Freed, clean UI, but felt bare-bones. If you want something super simple, it’ll do the trick, but most of us need more control and accuracy. Lacks a lot of specialty/custom options.\n\n**5. Scribeberry** ($99/month)  \nI couldn’t get behind this one, the output just wasn’t accurate for a lot of cases. Some errors in phrasing, missed important negatives in the ROS, etc. Did not stick around long enough to keep trying out all the features.\n\n**6. Tali AI** ($150/month)  \nThis one’s really popular, but my notes came out weirdly formatted and sometimes missed key details or summarized in a way that felt off. Also they use their chrome plugin as their main selling point, but I'd rather it not see all my web browsing history when I'm not doing clinical related duties.\n\n**Other stuff I noticed:**\n\n* **Privacy/PHI:** Most claim data is encrypted/secure and stays in US/Canada/Europe, but always check. Some are pretty transparent about it, others just claim but have no backing.\n* **EMR integration:** None of these are “true” plug-and-play in my EMR, but most of them have these features on the way.\n* **Cost:** Heidi has a free tier but there are not many templates to choose from, and I ended up paying the $99/month anyways. Tali came in at the most expensive at $150/month for their premium tier.\n\nWould love to hear what other people’s experiences have been, especially if you’ve used any others I missed, I would love to try them out. Happy to answer any questions. Hope you find this useful and happy charting!",

Most vocal have been radiologists and neurologists who point out that the diagnostic yield for acute, actionable findings (ie. subacute/acute infarct, bleed, hydrocephalus, mass, mass effect) is relatively low (ie. \\~10-15%). And overall leads to more unnecessary work and over utilization.\n\nThat said, 10% does not seem to be a particularly low number to find something acute in the head that could change management. Would you aspirin load and anticoagulate granny who had an unwitnessed syncopal episode sitting at the dinner table from an NSTEMI without a head CT? Also wouldn’t looking at the amount of cortical atrophy, chronic lacunar infarcts, silent cortical/frontal strokes help characterize the burden of vascular pathology that predispose them to become altered from relatively mild insults? \n\nSome references I have for diagnostic yield of CTH in the medical setting. Other suggestions are welcome:\n\nUse of Computed Tomography of the Head in Patients With Acute Atraumatic Altered Mental Status: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis. JAMA Netw Open. 2022\n\nA new clinical score for cranial CT in ED non-trauma patients: Definition and first validation. Am J Emerg Med. 2019\n\nAltered Mental Status in ICU Patients: Diagnostic Yield of Noncontrast Head CT for Abnormal and Communicable Findings. Crit Care Med. 2016\n\nWould like to hear what people think.\n\n  \nEdit: To everyone who keeps questioning where I got the number 10% from PLEASE SKIM THE 3 ARTICLES I POSTED",

      "text": "I'm a nurse practitioner in a nursing home and noticed a number of situations where the ER doctor doesn't update my patient's medications in their system when I send them out.  My patients go with a medication administration report and I suspect that a big part of the problem with the way it's formatted.  I had a patient go to the ED twice this year so far, both times her long acting insulin was decreased from 40 to 25 (both times due to it not being updated in their system as the H&P showed the 25 units as her home dose)\n\nI'm in the US and my nursing home facilities use PointClickCare.  The local hospitals all use Epic.\n\nHas anyone found a solution to this issue or have a suggestion?",

However, now that states have all kind of electronic medical record/prescription exchanges, and many smaller EHR systems do as well (i.e., anyone using the same system exchanges with each other), I am at a loss on recommendations.

      "text": "I graduated from a California allopathic medical school in the late-'90s. I decided to match into family medicine instead of radiology or anesthesiology because I enjoyed the personal interaction with patients and the detective work involved in diagnosing difficult cases and finding zebras. I was with my first employer, a hospital-based multi-specialty corporation, for almost 20 years. It started out great. My immediate supervisors were doctors who \"got it.\" I genuinely felt the core mission of the system was to deliver great care to the community.\n\nHowever, over a decade of working there, leadership changed. The CEO, a nurse, was replaced by an accountant/MBA. Within a couple of years, the work environment changed. The management style shifted from collaborative leadership to a top-down approach. The emphasis was placed on profit and expansion. Clinicians began to be micromanaged by non-medical supervisors. More than once, I was told by former front office staff, who had become office managers, that I should be more generous with antibiotics and narcotics based on patient reviews.\n\nI then went to another non-profit group that operated an HMO, and I loved it. The focus was on providing quality care at a reasonable price. During the last two years, however, the work environment has begun to resemble the profit-focused PPO system that I had escaped from. I am now at the point where I wake up before my alarm on workdays. I even recently had a dream about intentionally overdosing on a whole vial of Apidra while floating on a surfboard in the ocean. The expectations from patients, management, and value-based care metrics are impossible to meet at the same time.\n\nPrimary care, whether at a for-profit organization (HCA), a non-profit system (Kaiser), or an FQHC, is becoming a thankless job where patients suffer the effects of administrative harm, and clinicians are the fall guys. Over the last few years, I've witnessed several “new” clinicians get burned out about five years after residency. This would have been unheard of 20 years ago. When I started as an attending, several physicians in the clinic had 30+ years of practice. Now, I am the most senior physician at a clinic with 16 clinicians. As Kenny Rogers would say, I'm all out of aces.",

Think well into the 5 figures, possibly more. These surgeons then turn around and use this particular device during procedures. This is a novel device, so not just the next version of, let’s say, an artificial hip. It is also *very* expensive.\n\nI have been assured by various non-medical people that this sort of consultation fee is standard, above board, and does not constitute any sort of conflict of interest. Which doesn’t pass the sniff test for myself. But, I don’t do cutting edge surgery with novel devices. So, to my OR based colleagues, is this pretty standard?

His CT looks more confluent than you'd expect for pure CHF, very densely consolidated, ARDS appearing, maybe hemorrhage. He had only been sick a day or two.\n\nThe issue is thst i have zero records. Nothing. Nothing on EPIC. The patient can only give me a smattering of details that he had CHF, his kidneys are worse maybe bc of DM, HTN, that he might be considered for renal transplant, not entirely sure what his creatinine is, had one CHF exacerbation before we think and is on 60 mg lasix. \n\nOk fine, I call his hospital to try to obtain any records, labs, EF. Anything. I have a request for records form ready to fax. I have the wife who can talk, rhe patient is on BIPAP so not really able to help. This hospital, large, 800 beds says they will not provide any information, wont take a fax, cannot talk to an ER physician who could relay labs, nothing.

      "title": "Medical Device Companies Tells Hospitals They're No Longer Allowed to Fix Machine That Costs Six Figures",
      "text": "https://www.404media.co/medical-device-company-tells-hospitals-theyre-no-longer-allowed-to-fix-machine-that-costs-six-figures/\n\n\"Hospitals are increasingly being pushed into signing maintenance contracts directly with the manufacturers of medical equipment, which means that repair technicians employed by hospitals can no longer work on many devices and hospitals end up having to employ both their own repair techs and keep up maintenance contracts with device manufacturers. \n“One of my fears is that if a device goes down, we’re going to be subject to their field engineers’ availability,” a source who works in hospital medical device repair told 404 Media. 404 Media agreed to keep the source anonymous because they were not authorized by their hospital to speak to the media. “They may not be able to get here that same day or the next day, and if you’ve got people waiting to get an open-heart surgery, you have to tell them ‘Oh, the machine’s down, we’re going to have to postpone this.’ That’s detrimental to a patient who has a life-altering, very serious thing that they’re having to cancel and reschedule.” \nHaving to rely on a manufacturer’s repair network is the exact situation that farmers have found themselves in with John Deere tractors. Last week, the Federal Trade Commission sued John Deere for its monopolistic repair practices. The FTC specifically cited the fact that farmers have often been forced to wait days or weeks to get a John Deere “authorized” repair tech out to fix their tractors, which has resulted in farmers losing crops at critical harvest times. During the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic, some hospitals found themselves pirating repair software from Poland to repair broken ventilators because manufacturers’ repair technicians were spread so thin that hospitals had to wait weeks for repairs. \nThis specific ventilator repair crisis during COVID led experts at Harvard Medical School to write that “For years, manufacturers have curtailed the ability of hospitals to independently repair and maintain medical equipment by preventing access to the necessary knowledge, software, tools, and parts” in a piece calling for right-to-repair legislation. The FTC, meanwhile, suggested in a report that medical device manufacturers sometimes charge two-to-three times what an independent repair tech would charge for the same repair. \n“It's scary to think that you could buy a piece of medical equipment for your hospital, just to have the manufacturer wake up one day and decide they will monopolize all repairs for that product,” Nathan Proctor, senior director of consumer rights group PIRG’s campaign for the right to repair, told 404 Media. “The people who are trained to fix that equipment won't suddenly forget all they know, but they will suddenly be restricted from doing the repairs. I think that's just absurd.”\nManufacturer contracts like this lead, across the board, to higher costs for hospitals. \n“It’s no secret that America’s healthcare system is the most expensive, and this is one of the reasons why. These machines are actually highly reliable, we’ve had a low cost of service for it over the last few years. And when something isn’t right, we have people in-house who can fix it,” the source familiar with Terumo machine repair said. “But the cost of having a service contract with a manufacturer, you’re probably talking 10 times the cost. It’s not a big deal having a contract for one device, but when that starts happening across many devices, it adds up in the end. If you took every hospital in America and said for every medical device in the hospital, you need to put it on an OEM [original equipment manufacturer] maintenance contract, it would tank your financial system. You just can’t do that.”\nMedical equipment manufacturers have strongly lobbied against right to repair legislation all over the country, and have been successful in getting medical devices exempted from right to repair legislation by claiming that the machines are too sensitive and complex to be repaired by anyone besides the manufacturer. The medical device giant AdvaMed, for example, says “the risk to patient safety is too high.” \nBut, again, the people working on medical equipment in hospitals are often hospital employees or contractors whose job is to repair medical equipment, and who are being prevented from fixing equipment that a hospital has purchased. “Just because a guy has Terumo on his shirt doesn’t mean he’s a more competent technician” than an in-house hospital technician, the source familiar with Terumo device repair said.\"",

      "text": "I'm 3 years out of subspecialty training and approaching the half-way point to going up for promotion to associate professor from assistant professor. Time is about 70% clinical now/30% research. I'm working on reducing clinical time and was planning to begin a \"research fellowship\" at my institution that would protect half my time to prepare for larger grant applications. I've got 3 projects going on right now that should yield publications in the next 6 months or so, if I can finish them.\n\nHowever my spouse has an amazing, once in a lifetime job opportunity he's interviewing for and very interested in. It's an awesome opportunity for him and I don't want to keep him from it. However if he takes it, we'll have to relocate out of state, probably in the next 2 months. I know people move for spouse jobs all the time. My question is - how does one switch academic institutions without losing career progress? If I leave, my projects that I am leading and have spend 2 years on can't come with me. Same for the time spent finding collaborators and mentors, and the research fellowship I was planning to start in 3 months. Any advice on how to deal with pushing forward amidst a relocation in academic medicine would be greatly appreciated. Thank you all again.\n\n  \nEdit: He is not in academia, he is in big tech and the relocation would be to the Bay Area.",

      "text": "https://nashvillebanner.com/2025/07/20/doctor-denies-pregnant-woman-care/\n\n\"Last Thursday, at a town hall in Jonesborough, Tennessee, a 35-year-old woman shared her story: she was denied prenatal care by her physician because they objected to the fact that she wasn’t married, nor did she plan to be. She’d been with her partner for 15 years and they have a 13-year-old child.\n\nWhile going through her medical history, the physician told her that because she was unwed, they didn’t feel comfortable treating her, because it went against their values and she should seek care elsewhere. At the time of the appointment, the woman believed she was about four weeks into her pregnancy.\"\n\nAll this because\n\n\"On April 24th, Tennessee’s 2025 Medical Ethics Defense Act went into effect. It gives physicians, hospital systems and insurers, among others, the legal right to deny healthcare to patients based on religious, moral or ethical beliefs.\"\n\n\nI'll be the first to say, we're only hearing her side. But If this is true, the doctor is a piece of shit. I am sad that this OBGYN is one of our \"colleagues.\" How awful must you be to do this. I really hope this story blows up, and their practice faces significant backlash. I’m not big on cancel culture, but this is just bad medicine.\n\nOn a side note, can a physician in Tennessee now deny care to MAGA folks because it violates their \"moral or ethical beliefs\"? I would love to see this be challenged.",

      "text": "In the last seven months, the Medical Council of Canada has seen a 750% increase in the number of Americans creating accounts on its site to initiate the licensure process, NPR reported May 29.\n\nThe number of American physicians seeking to move to Canada to practice has ebbed and flowed for decades, usually in reaction to political and economic fluctuations, but it has never been this high, experts told NPR.\n\nHere are five things to know:\n\n1. The first step in becoming licensed in Canada is to create an account on physiciansapply.ca. In the past seven months, 615 physicians have created accounts, compared to 71 applicants during the same time last year. In recent years, Canadian provinces have relaxed some licensing regulations and expedited licensing for U.S.-trained physicians.\n\n2. Both medical licensing organizations and companies that recruit physicians into Canada reported many physicians citing the Trump administration as their primary reason for moving.\n\n3. The Trump administration declined to comment on the trend when asked by NPR, but did ask if the news outlet knew the number of physicians and their citizenship status. The news outlet did not provide or have this information.\n\n4. Some recruiting companies reported a 65% increase in the number of American physicians looking for Canadian jobs between January and April. The College of Physicians and Surgeons of Ontario said it received license applications from about 260 U.S.-trained physicians — and registered 116 of them — in the first quarter of 2025. British Columbia, another province, said it licensed 28 U.S.-trained physicians in the fiscal year that ended in February — triple the total of the prior year.\n\n5. Rural communities in Canada launched an advertising campaign after President Trump’s election to recruit American physicians. The campaign focuses on physicians in Florida and North and South Dakota. Its key selling point: “zero political interference in physician patient relationship.”\n\nhttps://www.beckershospitalreview.com/quality/hospital-physician-relationships/us-physicians-seeking-canadian-licensure-up-750-in-7-months-5-notes",

      "text": "I came to the US from my home country in the EU for residency after finishing intern year back home about ten years ago. I was excited to be where real innovative medicine was practiced and doctors were well-paid, and didn't have strong feelings one way or the other about private insurance (back home it is socialized healthcare). Over the past few years as an attending though I have been increasingly haunted by the feeling that I am profiting from blood money, even though I deliberately chose to work at a state hospital that provides care to uninsured patients we are still billing and bankrupting them. I scaled up my free clinic hours, my husband and I donate to M4A advocacy groups, I am not sure what more I can do. I tried waiving my copay for patients in my clinic who indicated it was a barrier. But, my chairman somehow found out about this and was LIVID, he just came in and shouted at me \"do you have any idea how much trouble this could get the whole department in\" and \"how could you possibly think this was an OK thing to do?\" I just broke down crying because, who is it hurting? It only comes out of my compensation, and made me feel like I was making a system that feels like a sea of sh!t just a tiny bit more human.  \n\nSomething else I have noticed is that Americans are sooooo sick. I did med school and internship in one of Europe's top teaching hospitals which handles the most medically and socially complex patients. The sickest patient I ever saw would be just a regular patient in America. You get young patients presenting with diseases in advanced stages that basically only exist in textbooks in my country, for example kids in their 20s with no kidneys anymore because of being unable to treat T1DM.\n\nAm I the only one to feel this way? I have been really contemplating moving back. Attendings make just above $100k, which is considered a very good salary in my country, I am just worried about whether my husband could take that adjustment psychologically as he is procedural and currently makes a lot more--he is American and when I have talked to him about it, his solutions basically amount to vote for Bernie Sanders.",

Starting April 22nd, I had a 17-day menstrual period. After that cycle started, I suddenly started getting episodes of pre-syncope after standing for too long (30 minutes-ish) or after standing up from sitting down. At the same time, I also started getting nausea every time I ate, shortness of breath with any slight exertion, severe fatigue, brain fog, random heart palpitations, a faint pink rash on my cheeks, joint pain and inflammation, and chest pain and shortness of breath that only occur when lying down. Every symptom started before April 29th and has either persisted or worsened as time went on. I genuinely cannot get through even a quiet day without struggle and cannot do the things I enjoy. My life is genuinely halted.\n\nBetween a 7-day halter monitor, blood tests, and a two ER visits (with CT scan, blood tests, EKGs, and X-rays), I was told everything was normal except very mild pericarditis (and an EKG that said \"possible left atrial enlargement, possible left ventricular hypertrophy, abnormal ECG\" that my PCP said was \"ridiculous\" when she saw it). I went through all the treatment for that, but nothing has changed. My primary care has stopped taking me seriously at this point. She won't even give me advice on how to get myself feeling better or even what kinds of specialists may be able to help my situation.\n\nI can't get in with another primary care for a couple months, though I do have an appointment set. I just can't wait that long to just get written off again so I want to walk into this appointment prepared.\n\nWhat tests am I missing or maybe need redone? What specialists should I maybe ask for referrals for? Does this sound like a chronic issue or something that may go away? I am just stuck and don't know how to advocate for myself so any assistance is greatly appreciated!",

I have tried every remedy possible, nebulisation, inhalers, cough drops, warm water and honey, teas, pills and cough syrups. It simply refuses to go away, in fact it gets worse with each passing hour. I feel so frustrated and helpless and I just want this cough to go away, its so painful and incessant. The cough drops do provide temporary relief but I've had to have the coughdrop in my mouth for every second of the day, which starts to get unpleasant and induce stomach-aches after a few hours. Please please help.",

I’ve had an ultrasound twice (via walk in clinic), report reads it’s on my lymph node, tech said it’s on my thyroid. \n\nIt doesn’t always bother me but every other week it “flares up” and causes difficulty swallowing and breathing. \n\nDoes not feel rock hard and sort of “wraps around” towards my throat if I push between my neck muscles, I can feel the full size of it extending inwards and downwards, it has doubled in size since my last ultrasound last summer. \n\nOther symptoms, unsure if even related to the lump: \nHair loss, frizzy hair\nFatigue and weakness \nJoint pain \nNeck pain around the lump every 2 weeks or so\n\nI don’t have time to take off work to line up at the clinic for another 4-5 hours, but do have access to Maple (virtual clinic). What would be my next steps in terms of getting this looked at? ENT? Blood work?",

      "text": "I was diagnosed in 2019 (19 years old) with OCD, anxiety and depression- but this focal point will be about OCD And possible symptoms.\n\nHas anyone found information or done research on how, and if, OCD affects the individual's information processing systems as well as the existence of over sharing or over explaining?\n\nI started a new job very recently and it was requested I join for a quick meet to discuss something and my anxiety sky-rocketed...I was so nervous, worried I had done something wrong.\n\nTurns out, I kinda did.\n\nThe individual was nice but explained that she and several others, especially in the small group chat they created (to discuss questions or ask advice), had noticed I tended to over explain or type mini essays when asking a question.\n\nI went back to the chat and noticed that yes, I had done so.\n\nShe made a comment that they were super busy and she sometimes didn't read through my messages because it was so much information, and that it even sounded like chat gpt sometimes.\n\nThis is something I have been self-conscious about for a few years now.\n\nI tend to overthink, over explain and sometimes understand certain things in a different way. My brain makes me come up with a variety of scenarios and I sometimes overthink or look at the information in such a way that others may not have done so.\n\nIn my undergrad at university was when I really started to notice it- my confidence had boosted a little since high school, and I had noticed some symptoms of mental illness peeking out some more in certain situations.\n\nI was laughed at sometimes for asking so many questions in class in order to understand properly, and sometimes people or myself will take note of how much I over explain things in person or over text.\n\nSo this meeting really made me feel even more self-conscious and so embarrassed that I had did something wrong. \n\nI'm not sure how to control it as I do sometimes struggle to understand things or look at information a certain way that makes me question it in some way. \n\nI'm not stupid academically, but when it comes to certain thinks I truly feel I am not understanding and feeling like I'm a little dumb.\n\nTo add even more context, at around 8 I had a head injury (I still have the slight bump on my forehead) and was diagnosed with epilepsy (I had \"Absence Seizures (formerly Petit Mal): Characterized by brief staring spells with possible eyelid fluttering or twitching\") and was put on medication for it. But I eventually grew out of it.\n\nI don't black out anymore, but sometimes wonder if that head trauma did affect my memory or information processing.\n\nI don't want to blame this habit of mine on anything, but I'm just looking for a way I could improve it or do some reading on it to better it. 🥲🙈\n\nHas anyone experienced this before?\n\nIS it OCD related?\n\nHave you come across any good reading on it?\n\nThanks in advance and have a good day!\n\n🤗🌱",

I found out I had a fossa stricture which was dilated.\n\nAfter a few months I repeated urinalysis and RBCs went down to 1.

      "text": "For context, I'm a 32 year old woman.\n\nAbout 4 years ago, shortly before the pandemic, I was diagnosed with generalized anxiety disorder and was prescribed venlafaxine.\n\nAll my life, up to and including my late 20's, I've weighted around 54 kg. to a maximum of 56 kg at worst. But ever since I started taking antidepressants it's been hell. I went from weighting 55 kg. to 95 kg. I told my psychiatrist about my concerns regarding my weight and they just brushed it off and said it could be age or lifestyle.\n\nNow, I'm well aware that metabolism slows down with age, but even then, gaining 40 kg in one year seems too much, even if it's age. I feel like they're not taking my concerns seriously, even though I've been very vocal about how I don't like the way I look and how it has affected my self-esteem. I've brought it up multiple times in our appointments but nothing is done about it.\n\nAnother thing I should point out is that barely anything has changed about my eating habits and lifestyle. I've always been on the sedentary side (even though I like to bike occasionally) and I've always eaten the same through the day. And still, with that, I always maintained a consistent weight.\n\nI understand that age may be a factor in weight gain, and that I should make the necessary adjustments, but I can't buy that it's the *only* reason for weight gain. I'm really frustrated because I feel like nobody is taking me seriously.",

This has happened (with less severity) several times today. The other times I had a hallucination with it.\n\nI’m also experiencing a very dry mouth (kinda spongy) and tremors. I feel light-headed and my nose/lip area is numb (but not making any movements). I think I can walk fine, but wouldn’t want to risk stairs on my own.\n\nI’m nearly positive it was due to Lybalvi (5/10 mg) as I just started it Tuesday and my other medications have been fine until now. Ive already taken the med out of my pill boxes.\n\nBut my main question is, do I need to go to the hospital or can I just wait out the side effects? I don’t have a car (or much money)so id have to call an ambulance. Also I have stuff to do tomorrow and would rather not be stuck in a hospital all night.",

Before my cold cure cure completely I had to return back and got into my second flight with that. \n\nI also have sinus problem since childhood and need to carry nasal spray regularly. Usually my cold goes away on 4 - 5 days but it's been 8 days and I still have symptoms of cold and my ears keep popping now and then. \n\nThe popping and pressure has reduced alot but the symptoms persist. There is no pain or discomfort in my ears and certainly no effects to my hearing. I have been taking cold meds for a while even after I got back but they don't seem to quick the pace of healing. \n\nIs there anything serious I need to be worried about? \n\nWhen I googled and asked chatgpt, it said that due to my sinus and catching a flight with cold has elongated the effects and might take 2-3 weeks to completely heal even though the usual times are much shorter. \n\nKindly do let me know if I need to visit a doctor.\n\nI am 24 male. 5'11 height.

      "text": "Hello, I’m a 21y/o female. I’ve been having problems since I was 19. I was wondering if anyone on here has any ideas? I feel like I’m in a circle of consistent pain.\n\nFor some information: my family has history of Breast Cancer, Ovarian Cancer, Pancreatic Cancer, Brain Cancer, Crohns, IBD, Lupus and POTS. \n\nSo, when I was 19 I woke up one night not able to stand up, I crawled to the bathroom and started to scream/cry due to severe stabbing pain. I was rushed to the ER by my mother. I had an ovarian cyst rupture and it was hemorrhaging.\n\nAfter that, it was very consistent. I could tell when I’d have cysts. Thankfully I’ve had one pop since then but it wasn’t too horrible as the beginning.\n\nStarted my journey to figure out what’s going on, my right ovary is consistent with signs of PCOS, they did bloodwork and i had low progesterone. I also grow hair on my face quite fast (thick black hair on upper lip and randomly on chin), but my testosterone levels were normal. I was put on progesterone and retested my blood later on- my levels are now normal. I got a colonoscopy and endoscopy and they said it was inflamed and I’d have to do another in 6months to a year. They said I just have IBS / GERD / Acid Reflux but show signs of a developing issue, but I’m too young to “diagnose”. \n\nNow, it’s clockwork. I’ll randomly start cramping to the point it’s a 10/10 pain. Just today I started to cramp, went to the bathroom. Fell to the ground in pain, cried in pain til my mother was able to come get me and take me to the ER. I was crying/screaming so loud my friends on discord could hear me two rooms over.\n\nER didnt even check my ovaries. They said it was IBS, they did a CT and sent me home.\n\nIt’s frustrating because my tests come back normal but I’m in so much chronic pain? It’s debilitating. I feel like I am crazy. Do you guys have any suggestions? \n\nI also do get a lot headaches and inconsistent bowel movement.",

      "text": "Guys hello I don’t know what to do. Ive been having Vision problems and they’ve been trying to find out what the cause is this whole time.\n\nTLDR: I feel like a past doctor brushed me off and now it could cause me to go blind.\n\nSo in March I went to my optometrist about a blind spot that I noticed in one eye and she recommended me to see a retina specialist because when she was examining she didn’t notice anything. I went to the retina specialist and he basically did the same examination she did then said “your eye is healthy it’s probably just your natural blind spot.” I said “no it’s not I know how a natural blind spot is and this is nothing like that.” He said “then maybe the issue is with your optic nerve so I recommend seeing an ophthalmologist to examine that.” He said he will contact the optometrist that recommended me and talk to her about the next steps.\n\nFast forward to my follow up with my optometrist, she said he did NOT contact her. She ends up recommending me some ophthalmologists in the area and I finally get an appointment with one he recommended a NUERO-ophthalmologist 😃 atp I’m stressed out (still am) but I gotta do the whole run around anyway.\n\nBetween this time I go back to my optometrist office however a different doctor and she asks me how the whole thing is going. I tell her everything and she asks if the retina specialist did a specific test called flourescin angiography (FA), I say no. She’s shocked because she would assume that would be a significant step. She says bring it up to the nuero when you can.\n\nThe Nuero tells me I need an MRI, I get that then have my follow-up in two weeks. Go to my follow up, they do more tests to compare the past ones. She says my optic nerve is healthy. I ask her about the experience with the retina specialist and ask her about the FA, she was also shocked I didn’t have that sooner. I started crying in the office which is so embarrassing but I was so frustrated and wanted answers. She asked if I want to go back to the retina specialist so he can do it I say no bc he brushed off the first time!\n\nShe recommends me her retina people and she says she actually had them as students b4 which made me really reassured because she is so nice and hears me out so I hope they will be the same. Overall I’m frustrated with that original retina specialist because if this ends up being a retinal issue it could’ve possibly been solved months ago instead of me having to do this run around. Now I’m worried that if there is dmg to my eye it won’t be treatable.\n\nI have recently heard about a thing that if a doctor brushed you off you need it in writing, but I believe it is too late to get that.",

      "text": "Context: 23, F, Canadian competitive figure skater. I eat somewhat healthy (I think I might under-eat but it’s my bloodwork says I get all my vitamins lol) \n\nConditions: Celiac’s disease, Chiari Malformation. \n\nOn Easter weekend I noticed I was SUPER bloated but chopped it up to my celiacs disease but it stuck for 2+ weeks. Eventually, this turned into rapid weight gain. I went from a healthy, 125lbs of muscle athlete to a 160lbs, extremely tired girl who lost all muscle in the span of a month and a half. \n\nBeing a figure skater, the weight gain destroyed my training. Not for looks (a bit obviously) but the science behind training. It messes everything up. Everything you learn goes down the drain. I called my doctor, we ran test after test. \n\nEverything came back normal other than: DHEA - low (3.4umol/L), AM Cortisol - high (612nmol/L), Ferritin - high (121ug/L) and Cortisol post dexamethasone - did not fully suppress (58nmol/L > 50nmol/L). Pelvic, stomach ultrasound and 24hr cortisol  urine collection was clear however. \n\nI have the classic symptoms that something is wrong with my adrenal glands; weight gain in thighs, stomach, arms and chin, loss of muscle mass, swelling in my face some days, bruising easily, new spider vains and sudden cellulite/stretch marks, orthostatic hypotension, insulin resistance, energy crashes so severe they cause issues at work, sleep issues, my joints are killing me especially in my hips, ect. \n\nLike they always say, my labs aren’t crazy and it’s “probably my birth control” but I’m 23. I shouldn’t be feeling like this especially so out of the blue with no reason. I’m out of muscle.  I’m at a point that I can’t look at myself in the mirror - I’ve NEVER gained weight in my life like this, never even a growth spurt. Ive tried everything… im even on Topamax right now - almost to prove a point at this rate. \n\nI’m just desperate. We know it’s not PCOS, it’s been tested and looked into and I’ve always been okay when it comes to this (and I’m sorry to the girlies who fight it daily). I’m not thinking Cushing’s neither since my labs aren’t that crazy but possibly MACS? Pseudo Cushing’s? Has anyone been in this situation? I just need help before I lose my mind… I’m on Topamax, that wouldn’t be a good mix lol :(",

That was diagnosed concussion #2. Exact same symptoms.\n\n2 weeks later, symptoms of concussion #2 were starting to lift. Then I woke up in the middle of the night noticing my arm was asleep. I lifted up my numb arm only for my hand to fall back hitting my head.

It is really this easy to get consecutive concussions from such seemingly minor injuries after my initial diagnosed concussion? Could something as minor as hitting my head with my limp hand become concussion #3, or could it just cause a symptom regression of concussion #2?\n\nI am grateful for any advice on this situation.

Did a stupid mistake and didnt consider that new sharps dont have dulled edges and went deeper than I have ever before. \n\nUsually I cut to superficial dermis and they clot within 10-15 minutes. Today I did deep dermis and it wouldnt stop bleeding in several places even after several hours. It has been 9 hours now and the wounds have stopped most bleeding but if Im not careful and move too much they bleed again. Some wounds dont even seem to have any clotting at all, just a very slightly gaping wound with bright red blood. \n\nThe wounds are on my upper thighs and its starting to feel kind of tingly and numb there. \nI have tried cleaning with water and scentfree soap, antibacterial wound cleaner, and applied preassure with a towel and a gauze, (dont have enough medical supplies at home and all apothecaries are closed now).\n\nShould I stay on the safe side and call a professional to look at it or do you think it will be fine?

      "text": "Hello! Yesterday I stepped on a thin metal wire sticking up from the floor, and it got impaled no more than 0.5cm into my heel. I pulled it out and it didn't (and still doesn't) hurt at all. It didn't bleed either and I couldn't really tell where it got stuck. I washed it with soap, and I've been putting Polysporin on it. Last year I got my tetanus booster, so I'm not really worried about that. There's a bit of redness no more than a few millimeters in diameter at the site, but it still doesn't hurt and it doesn't seem to be getting worse. \n\nAt this point can I feel secure in just continuing to put on Polysporin at home and monitor? I feel like it barely went into my heel, but I don't know how these things go, and I'm scared that I could get some other infection, even though the wire didn't look rusty or dirty. What are the chances an infection could develop from this?",

As soon as I started reflecting on everything that’s been going on, I began to hyperventilate, even though I’m normally comfortable with that activity.\n\nI really don’t want to go to the doctor right now, partly because I don’t want to worry my parents if it turns out to be something minor, like muscle spasms, etc",

      "text": "I (17 Trans MTF Scholar) having been experiencing increasingly worsening symptoms since around the age of 5. I take Valproic Acid, Fluoxetine, Dexlansoprazole, Lorasidone, Bisprolol and Buspirone. I am also prescribed Tramadol but I don't take it because I don't want to become addicted.\n\nI started having symptoms of impending doom, visual disturbances, mycolonic jerks and absurd fears of sleep due to thinking people would break into the house and hurt me at 5. A year after my more severe abuse started (possibly a connection between this and the fear of sleep). I had been assessed by occupational, speech and physical therapy and was told I most likely had Autism, Dyspraxia, Low Muscle Tone and had a need for speech therapy. Sometime before the age of 10 I started experiencing moderate pain. For more info from 4 to 14 my most severe abuse continued which often did lead to very severe but more acute pain as far as I can remember and I had a seperate major traumatic event at 9. By 10/11 I experienced bouts of depression/mania which went untreated until I was 14 and increasing paranoia at the age of 12. I developed an eating disorder at 14 which ended with me being mildly underweight. I also started experiencing tics, seizures, severe depression and mania, psychosis and my obsessive thoughts turned from uncomfortable to violent. After an attempt at my life I was medicated and admitted to hospital where I was diagnosed with Autism, Sensory Processing Disorder, OCD and Depression with Psychotic Features. These diagnoses did change including depression to Schizoaffective Disorder and addition of DID and Gender Dysphoria. We ruled out neurological causes, specifically Autoimmune Encephalitis and cancers/paraneoplastic syndromes. Around this age I started experiencing dizziness, blacking out of vision and fainting which is now considered an undiagnosed heart condition within the placeholder Unspecified Tachycardia. I also experienced worsening chronic pain now classified as Unspecified Chronic Widespread Pain by a physical therapist who educated me on nocioplastic pain. As well as, what a Gastroenterologist diagnosed as GERD (burning pain and esphogeal inflammation) and IBS-D (daily watery diarrhoea and blood without heamarroids and fissures). My seizures are full blown tonic clonic seizures before, during which and afterwards I often cannot talk. Last year at 16 my pain was so bad I often couldn't walk and when I could it was often whilst using something to lean on. It has gotten better to the point where I can usually walk however, my ankle is killing me to the point I cannot carry heavy loads, after a kilometre or a few hundred metres I will start limping even if going at a slow place and my walking buddies have informed they have to slow down to go at my pace because I walk weird even without limping.\n\nI just want to know why I am in so much pain?\nWhy I am having seizures after a normal EEG?\nWhat is the best doctor to pursue seeing with my current financial constraints?",

      "text": "I spent 12 years inside Adventist Health. I worked in one of their corporate branches and saw firsthand how their entire business model was built on a simple but fragile idea: serve rural markets, grow by acquisition, and survive on Medicaid and expansion subsidies.\n\nIt worked for a while. Then the political winds shifted. What we all knew back then (but didn’t say loudly enough) was this: the second the government started gutting Medicaid funding, rural hospitals would start bleeding out. The strategy should have changed years ago, but the leadership never built a real fallback.\n\nFor at least the last six years, most Adventist hospitals were running in the red. The big city hospitals, the ones that should have funded the rural mission, were often losing money too. Talent was hemorrhaging. Good clinical and support staff went elsewhere while corporate doubled down on administrative overhead and scattershot growth.\n\nNow, with the passage of this big beautiful bill (the one that slashes Medicaid even deeper while calling it reform), the clock just sped up. This is the death knell for any hospital whose entire survival depended on rural Medicaid volume and thin operating margins.\n\nWe all heard the phrase: eat or be eaten. If you didn’t scale, you’d get swallowed up by bigger systems with better deals from distributors and insurers. Adventist knew this was coming — they said it behind closed doors 11 years ago. But they never got aggressive enough where it counted: retaining talent, modernizing equipment, or defending the policies that kept the doors open.\n\nThe result is predictable. Rural closures mean lost revenue and shrinking leverage with supply chains. That means higher unit costs and more cuts in places that actually matter: bedside staff, engineers, clinical teams. The cycle feeds on itself until there’s nothing left to cut but the lights.\n\nIf there’s anything worth salvaging, it’s this: they need to invest what’s left in what keeps hospitals running — people and equipment. They should gut bloated admin layers and cut marketing spin to the bone. They should stop outsourcing critical support and remember why they brought engineers and IT back in-house in the first place: it’s cheaper and better to treat your people well than rent them by the hour.\n\nI don’t expect Adventist Health to survive as a system. I wish I did. I do hope the communities they served don’t get left behind with empty buildings and broken promises.",

      "text": "It wouldn't be rocket science to get it set up. I asked ChatGPT to design a prompt that would put together such a charter and it gave me the prompt, I had it run the prompt, and it set up a charter. It would take some time to get people on board. Below is the first section of it:\n\n\"Charter for the National Health Share Cooperative\n\nPreamble\n\nWe, the citizens of the United States, recognizing the fundamental importance of health and well-being, establish the National Health Share Cooperative (NHSC). This cooperative aims to provide an equitable, transparent, and sustainable health care system for all participants, independent of the traditional health insurance industry. Guided by principles of mutual care, accountability, and inclusivity, the NHSC serves as a beacon of health solidarity for our nation.\"\n\nI was curious because I participate in buying health care through my employer, and the yearly cost for the plan is $14000. There is no federal penalty for not carrying health coverage, but there is a state penalty in my state, California. The penalty is $850 per adult or 2.5% of your annual household income. However, the penalty is waived if I'm a member of a health share. A health share is usually set up by a religious organization, but it can be set up for ethical reasons as well, and it seems to be ethical to participate in a health share that basically provides unbiased, universal health care to every member. There are provisions to provide health care on an income related basis and fees waived for hardship.   \n  \nWhy don't we get this set up outside the system, boycott health insurance companies and let them die a natural death as we use the money for actual health care? Once they are buried deep, deep in the ground, we can hand the charter over to the federal government to extend Medicare to all.  \n\nIf this sounds like something people are interested in, I think we could just set up a website, maybe set up a ServiceNow backend to administer, and see if we can get this off the ground. If anyone is interested in looking at the entire charter, send me a message.\n\nI don't know if this breaks the rules for no advertising or surveys. I hope not. Anyway, if the post is rejected, maybe the administrators can steer me in the right direction?",

I spoke to a lady today who was confused on why she had to pay for a medical bill when her family had already met her out of pocket max for the year. She informed me she knows for a fact that they met it because before her husband passed away within the last 2 months and they were getting bills covered at 100%. I was also able to verify this info based off her account. She told me the reason she had to go to the hospital recently was because she thought she was having a heart attack with everything that has been going on and she needed to get emergency services. I had to tell a woman who just recently lost her husband that in the eyes of the health insurance world because her husband was taken off the account (because of death) everything that he personally contributed to their out of pocket max doesn’t matter anymore. It’s monstrous behavior to also add insult to injury to a grieving widow and make her pay for a bill that SHOULD be covered at 100%.\n\nHealth insurance companies are basically like “we understand he died. We understand he caused you to meet your OOP. We understand you already paid thousands and thousands of dollars for his medical expenses but….sorry please now also pay us for YOUR medical expenses.”\n\nThis is just vile behavior\n\nMy only option is to try and plead to the manager of the health facility to see if they can write this bill off for the grieving woman. I don’t even think that’s going to be an option.",

They sent everyone in the program new cards and then made it to where it’s a requirement to have an app on your smartphone to use your benefits. You have to use the app and scan a barcode on the app. This old couple had an old government phone that took 10 mins to download the app and the 80 year old man had no idea what his username and password are. I am so mad. All healthcare companies seem to do is make things less accessible for people.

Fortunately we were able to set them up with a username and password, but the app was “down” according to the customer service line when we called after we were unable to get the barcode to load so they could pay. They weren’t able to take their groceries home with them but they were extremely grateful for our help and they’ll be back to use their card another day.

Or am I overreacting and should I just let it go?\n\nAny advice would be appreciated.\n\nI have an amazing doctor who has never once treated me like because I responded to a question with not the right answer, he’s always just clarified and we’ve gone from there. Maybe I’m just being a bit of a Karen because this has me shook that I have to deal with this treatment to receive medication.",

They manufactured a \"mental health crisis\" by pathologising normal reactions and began a campaign of diagnosing hordes of people experiencing anxiety and depression.\nThen, Big Pharma intentionally misdiagnosed another horde of people with schizophrenia or bipolar disorder and reintroduced a slightly tweaked version of the neuroleptic major tranquilizers as antipsychotics which they prescribe like tylenol. They even dosed the elderly people in care homes with them (25 of residents in care homes are fed antipsychotics). \n\nAnd that wasn't enough, then big pharma raised the price of antipsychotics (for example, from $40 in England to $160 for the same treatment)\n\nNeeding more.profits pharma began widening its usage to include depression and OCD and autism. \n\nThe drug companies are raking in billions and creating an ongoing revenue stream via monthly dosing in many cases involuntarily administered. It's a chemical lobotomy and castration and they are administering it enmass. The majority of patients do not tolerate the drugs well and they are saddled with a host of side effects , which are largely ignored by the doctors.\n\nIt was reported that of the authors who selected and defined the DSM-IV psychiatric disorders, roughly half had financial relationships with the pharmaceutical industry...   ...raising the prospect of a direct conflict of interest. The same article concluded that the connections between panel members and the drug companies were particularly strong involving those diagnoses where drugs are the first line of treatment, such as schizophrenia and mood disorders, where 100% of the panel members had financial ties with the pharmaceutical industry.",

      "title": "Less people on Medicaid means cheaper healthcare for people who have private health insurance",
      "text": "We all know the American method of healthcare, crazy expensive for what we’re getting. You ask for an itemized receipt of a hospital stay and you get charged $100 for a bag of IV fluid that costs less than a dollar to make. Want to know why you’re getting charged that much? Because whether you like it or not, hospitals are a business and need to make some sort of profit in order to pay their employees. 58% of hospitals in the US are non profit hospitals, meaning the profit they make, go back into their facility and are not making profit to increase shareholder value. Private insurance carriers get charged crazy rates in order to cover the lack of payment that Medicaid and Medicare provides the hospitals for the exact same service.  The problem with the system now is that Medicaid and Medicare are not allowed to negotiate prices with hospitals.  Meaning, they set the rate, and they tell the hospitals what they are going to pay, regardless of the actual cost of the service provided. I worked in billing for a number of years and I’ll provide an example of how this works. \nSimple dental extraction surgery - the cost of the surgery done at a facility needs to go to pay the time of the nurses during the surgery, pre and post op.  That’s the time of at a minimum 4 nurses.  Then you have to think about the sanitation of the surgery room and all the supplies.  Then you have to think about the medication for pain after the surgery and anything they might need during the surgery.  Then you have to pay all the admin workers and other workers that do the sanitation.  The Medicaid payout for this surgery? $526 dollars.  Certainly not how much it cost to do the surgery. We would have to charge private insurance carriers $1500 for the exact same surgery. We can’t charge Medicaid more for the cost of the surgery simply because they won’t pay it, so being a business, that money has to come from somewhere so we charge private insurance carriers 200% more for the same surgery. \nEver wonder why it’s so expensive to go to an Emergency Room if you have private health insurance? It’s because 69% of all ER visits are from people who are on Medicaid or who don’t have insurance at all, meaning they can’t pay.  It’s illegal (and the moral thing to do) to refuse anyone healthcare because they don’t have insurance, so those patients get a lot of specialized and expensive care, and the hospital sees little to no money from that patient. How do the hospitals make up that difference? By charging private health insurance carriers a higher rate for the same level of care. \nBy reducing the amount of people on Medicaid and Medicare, it allows for hospitals to bill the actual cost to private insurance carriers.  Less Medicaid/Medicare patients means more money for the hospitals. When hospitals are actually making the margin required to pay for basic costs, then they don’t have to inflate prices for private insurance carriers. This benefits hospitals because they aren’t having to come up with crazy rates to charge because they are actually getting paid for their services.  This benefits hospital employees because more money for the hospitals means better pay and benefits.  This benefits patients because their insurance is being charged crazy numbers for the same level of care.  \nThe way to fix our system is to make it easier for people to have private insurance and less reliance on government insurance programs. This is what Obamacare attempted to do, and what should be expanded on in the future",

I currently get SSI and do not work so i have no clue. Is there no way for me to get coast-to-coast or even just regional out of state coverage outside of an employer's health insurance plan they give me?\n\nTo make a long story short, I've seen doctors for about five years for sudden chronic issues (mostly neurological) without a proper diagnosis. Used to cause awful memory problems, neuropathy, weakness, ear ringing, fatigue, etc. \n\nMass General keeps denying/bouncing back referrals, even after I've seen multiple neurologists in RI. Hartford Healthcare in CT now accepts my Medicaid, but they didn't used to a few years ago. Not sure why it changed.\n\nI ask because it feels like my issues are permanent now where maybe if I saw a doctor that deals with odder issues, I could've gotten treatment and moved on with my life. Neurologists in RI either dismissed me or didn't really seem interested. My main lingering issues are neuropathy and neck stiffness, albeit better than it was a few years ago.",

I will say, however, that my GPA for my major classes is a 3.5 and I did extremely well in those courses.\n\nMy work experience includes:\n\n\\-6 month internship at a psychiatric practice doing telemedicine scheduling and patient coordination\n\n\\-6 month internship at non-profit aimed at improving the mental health outcomes of young adults\n\n\\-6 month internship at academic medical center that focused on creating financial models to estimate the financial impacts of business strategies\n\n\\-2 years working a leadership team role at a CCRC (Director of LTC/Skilled Rehab Admissions)\n\n\\-6 months working at a federally funded organization in an administrative role working towards improving health outcomes for children 3 to 5\n\n\\-about to accept role working as an assistant director of a senior living community\n\nI really want to go to graduate school to have a deeper understanding of the business functions related to healthcare leadership, as well as, ways to improve health care access and healthcare policy. I am extremely interested in gerontology outside of health administration and want to shape my healthcare administration studies around senior living/long term care, specifically due to how the desires of the average aging American relation to their healthcare/changes in federal healthcare policy may shape and transform how this industry may deliver patient-centered services. With a Master's degree, I hope to get an LNHA certification, and want to eventually work in healthcare strategy/consulting.\n\nI would really appreciate any advice or suggestions to make my application stronger as I go forth on my higher education journey!",

A few months ago. 60 days has very likely passed (kicking myself, because I'm probably only a few days late and didn't know any of this). I had prior appointment setting up for imaging- I am getting an ultrasound and then have a possible removal procedure for my lymph nodes. They have been large and potentially problematic for a while, and I've started rapidly declining quickly so this is necessary to ensure that I don't have cancer, or if I do, to catch it. \n\nProblem is, I had no clue I was going to lose insurance, and no clue I only had 60 days after a QLE. The appointment was difficult to get, and I have no idea how long it will take to setup, get referrals, and wait after getting insurance. A year at least, and I don't know if that's time I have. I also don't know if this qualifies as a pre existing condition, even though no diagnosis is technically noted\n\nI am so lost. I don't know anything about insurance and I'm mostly alone. Is there other emergency insurance for expensive imaging? Will it even cover this sort of situation? What am I even supposed to do? Genuinley considering getting married to remedy this. I don't know.",

      "text": "# Hey all, this is my annual reach-out for any potential leads on affordable individual health insurance for someone in Pima County AZ. This time, I'm reaching out for any leads on catastrophic-equivalent coverage for peeps between 31-64.\n\nPima County fell thru the cracks for the self-employed in the ACA market.\n\nI am 53 and healthy. Before the ACA, I used to have individual health insurance for roughly $300/month with a $1000 deductible. The ACA ruined all of that for self employed folks making 75k/year in Pima county AZ.\n\nI disenrolled from my ACA plan in 2018 after realizing that paying for my health ins (550/mo totalling 6.6k/year, and a 6000 deductible) was more expensive than paying the annual penalty (5k) and out of pocket for my care. The triggering event for me ditching the ACA was after an accident where I broke my back and they would not cover the epidurals, and \\*even the surgery\\* for which I had to go to Europe due to the costs in the US. Yep, you read that right.\n\n(At least my back is better, but for almost $100k, my retirement $, for the surgery and a week in the hospital. It would have been 3G for the surgery (3 levels) plus 1G for the hospitalization in this country. Money can buy happiness after all!)\n\nI am almost an expert on self-pay discounts for visits, labs, imaging, services and medications, and my doc gives me samples of any brand medications I take (sample supplies are endless until a drug goes generic). So I have figured out how to afford to pay out of pocket for routine wellness checks etc, and am happy to give advice on that.\n\nI used a broker in 2018 for the first three months of a 'short term' accident/illness plan however that was a flop- the plan he signed me up for was even worse than the ACA plan regarding coverage, so brokers are out. I prefer requesting help from the community instead of someone who could financially benefit.\n\nI tried looking into at least twenty differnent association health care plans, but my address was not eligible for any of them and I cannot pretend that I am a religion that I'm not.\n\nEver since 2019 I was renewing a 'short term' accident/illness plan thru United Health Care every 3 months until they passed a bill at the end of 2024 allowing a maximum of 4 months out of the year, so I have been uninsured since April. Fortunately, other countries exist, and so does credit protection from medical debt. If I get a serious illness or non-emergency accident again I can go to Europe again or if I need emergency services (car accident) I can file for bankruptcy and get my credit score restored after the medical treatment. I've already consulted an atty about that.\n\nI really do not expect a miracle answer here, so no worries. I will probably qualify for medicare (only 12 years left!) before there is any reform in comprehensive health covg for the self employed; So at this point, I'm just reaching out for any leads on accident/illness coverage that lasts more than four months, from a reliable insurer.\n\nAnyone?\n\nBueller?",

It’s terrible insurance, but with 2 young kids and my job being self employed it is what it is. \n\nFast forward to this March, and someone got our credit card info and we had to cancel a couple cards. One of them made our automated UHC payment and we missed our March payment. 4/1 they canceled our policy without notifying us. \n\nHow in the hell is that possible? There has to be a cancelation policy that they have to follow right? I talked to 2 morons in a call center for 30 minutes and all I got from them was the invoice for my payment said if payment want received in 30 days policy expires. \n\nThey said that’s all they do, they don’t email, text or call when they are canceling the policy. \n\nOf course it comes back to me not updating everything on that cards payments, but I have a feature at PNC that’s supposed to take care of it. \n\nI just really want to talk to someone besides Jake and Mae B from wherever the fuck their call center is. I need a human who lives in USA that I can have a real conversation with to figure out wtf happened. \n\nCan anyone point me in the right direction??",

I have been out unpaid getting by on doctors notes and slowly depleting my savings, but the fact that my work can decide to fire me for my absence at any point is looming over me.\n\nI don’t have a lot of experience dealing with health insurance as I just recently left my parents coverage, so I apologize if this is common knowledge, but would it make any difference if I called them every day to try to get this authorization pushed through, or would I just be wasting my time?",

      "text": "Hello, for context I am a recent grad in Biotechnology on the business track from my university. I originally was set on the premed track, but after my experience with working in healthcare, I realized I wanted to make organizational changes for the betterment of the workers instead of working healthcare itself.\n\nI’ve worked both as a front desk/med tech for a private practice and as a CCT (nursing assistant essentially) in a hospital for over a year each (and I’m still working them), so I’m aware of the fallacies in the system and have heard the complaints of the workers and patients alike. I even experienced several staff shortages and even supply shortages which made me recognize how important it is to properly manage hospitals. I realized change needs to be made from the administrative end to help everyone, and I can’t really do that as a practitioner. \n\nHowever, I have no relevant experience in the admin field and I’m not exactly sure what the job entails since the field is so broad. All I know is I want to make change from the outside and I’m a hard worker with great letters of rec from my employers/teachers so I can succeed. What are the steps I need to take? Can someone give me a brief rundown of the field?\n\nAlso, I heard an MBA with a healthcare admin specialization is better than an MHA, but given how my major isn’t health admin or business I’m not sure which route is better. MHA I’ve also heard is harder to make good money than an MBA which also gives you more options, but again I want to pick a good masters that gives me the best income and connections within the healthcare field.",

She will only be here for a couple months, but I really want her to be able to use this time to get on some stable meds so when she returns back to Utah, she's in a better place mentally. She has bipolar depression with chronic suicidality resulting in MANY recent psych hospitalizations. She is from Utah and has Utah Medicaid. She has been on a laundry list of medications in the past, one of which helps her not feel suicidal: Vraylar.\n\nUnfortunately, this med is VERY expensive. The good news is, it is covered by Utah Medicaid! Awesome. A couple weeks ago we explained her situation to a doctor at a free clinic in my area, who wrote her a prescription. Awesome. We tried to fill the medication through the local pharmacy, but they were not willing to accept out-of-state Medicaid. Not awesome. We then tried to use amazon's delivery pharmacy service, but they also don't accept Medicaid. Also not awesome. We then got the prescription moved to a pharmacy in Utah with the intent of having a friend fill the script and mail it to us (I know this is uncouth, but we were out of options), but when the friend tried to fill it, they said Utah medicaid won’t cover a prescription writ by an out-of-state doctor. Not awesome.\n\nSo this is where we are now. Eff.\n\nShe isn't established with a doctor in Utah, so trying to do telehealth to get a prescription filled will almost certainly be a non-starter. I could try to get her switched to Michigan Medicaid, but a) by the time that happens she'll almost certainly be about ready to leave and b) then she would lose her Utah Medicaid. The free clinic doctors do not have trial coupons for this medication, we tried that. GoodRx doesn't have a coupon. The coupon on Vraylar's website can't be used if you have Medicaid. The only other thing I can think to try is go back to the free clinic and try to get her on a medication which I can get for cheap through goodRx, but then we're going back to taking a shot-in-the-dark for a medication that works... she has failed so many medications in the past that trying to guess a medication that works vs using the one we KNOW works feels like tossing a drowning man a water-logged pool noodle vs a life preserver.\n\nDo any of y'all have any ideas for how to get my friend the medication she needs? I feel like I have tried everything, and at this point think that things are hopeless. This post is sorta a last-resort thing, because IDK what else to do. This is literally life-or-death, and I have no idea what to do.\n\nThanks.",

The platform is called **Doctors Not Debt.** Our mission is to advocate for the protection of the Grad PLUS program, which the One Big Beautiful Bill, currently to be voted on in the Senate this month, would remove entirely. This is a detriment to the future of medicine, as 75% of medical students rely on the Grad PLUS program to afford the cost of medical school. If the bill is passed, medicine would be a viable path only for those who could afford the full cost of medical school out of pocket.\n\nThis cannot happen. With proper advocacy and a strong backlash in the form of calls from constituents and petition signatures, the clause in the bill listing the elimination of the Grad PLUS program can be removed. With the help of passionate and outspoken individuals, the bill can be largely voted against, preventing the bill from moving forward. This can only be done with the help of the community. (I do not represent a US political party nor have their interests in mind)\n\nI would kindly request that you share and sign this petition. Also, visit the website to learn how to call and get the attention of your representatives and Senators.\n\nThat's why they are in positions of power. Exercise your power to voice your opinion. The petition will be sent to NYS Congressional members, and hopefully to many others. Every signature matters.\n\n**This bill is currently in the Senate to be voted on.

I struggle a bit with memorizing large amounts of info, especially if it’s abstract or just textbook-heavy.\n\t•\tI genuinely enjoy detail-oriented work and the feeling of getting better at a physical skill over time — like I find satisfaction in precision, repetition, and mastering techniques.\n\t•\tThat said, I also have an interest in the whole body and not just the mouth. Sometimes I worry that dentistry might be too narrow for me.\n\t•\tLifestyle matters to me, but I’m also open to working hard if it’s something I really enjoy.\n\nI’ve tried looking into both paths, but I’m still confused. Dentistry seems like a great fit for my personality and skills, but medicine gives me a broader field to explore (though I know it’s a longer and harder road, especially with all the memorization). I’ve looked into specialties like ENT or surgery that seem to combine both worlds — hands-on + broader anatomy — but I just don’t know yet.\n\nHas anyone here faced the same decision or have insight from being in either field? What helped you choose?\n\nAny input — even brutally honest stuff — is welcome and appreciated. 🙏",

It has never been cheap, but it seems like lately it just gets outrageous. It's enough that when I refill my prescriptions the pharmacist always asks me if I'm sure I'm ok with paying so much, so I've started wondering if I'm doing something wrong.\n\nI currently take Fluticasone/salmeterol discus 500/50MCG (brand name Advair, generic wixela), up from the lower (more affordable) dosage because I'm doing allergy shots and my doc wanted it to be really well controlled. I just refilled it and am getting 3 inhalers (3 months supply) for $200 after insurance; retail would be over $1000 I think. It was actually $464 last time i refilled it for some reason. It doesn't seem to be any cheaper on goodrx.\n\nWhat's especially frustrating is I had to get an emergency refill in London (my luggage got stolen), and it was less than $50 for a disc, with no insurance or anything. Is this just how it is with that particular medicine in the U.S.? Is there a reason? Should I talk to my doctor about other options, like going back down to the lower dose? The allergy shots have been fine.",

      "text": "The human body is a complex machine comprised of multi organ system working in unison to maintain function and homeostasis.\n\nIn effect, any injury, disease or condition impacting one organ system can manifest and harm other organs. So basically disease don't always have a single organ point of origin or manifestation.\n\nHere lies the issue with contemporary medicine and it's concept of specialist medicine.  \n\nFor example we have psychiatrists, who are specialists in mental healthcare. Certain mental health issues and conditions can originate in the gut. Since psychiatrists don't specialize in the digestive system,  how can such a specialist provide effective care and treatment for all patients if they don't address certain root causes in mental health like gut health?\n\nThe same way hormones play a role in regulating behavior and mood. This is endocrinology, outside the specialty of psychiatry. Again, the psychiatrist is not capable of providing appropriate and effective care in such circumstances where the root cause are hormonal issues.\n\nAnother example is immunology. Again, immune function is shaped by both nutrition and gut health. These are outside the scope of the speciality of immunology. So in circumstances where immune system issues originate in the gut, the immunologist will  be incapable of addressing and treating the root cause.\n\n\nOne last example is cardiology. I will myself as an example. I had ongoing chronic issues with palpitations and exercise intolerance. The cardiologist performed tests but was incapable of identifying the root cause. Ultimately it was a deficiency of essential minerals like magnesium and not once did the specialist cardiologist allude to the fact it could be due to a deficiency.\n\n\nThis concept of specialist medicine requires a complete overhaul as it's not up to standard to comprehend and effectively treat disease and conditions which have multiple origins in the body.",

      "title": "Engineering vs Medicine vs Dentistry",
      "text": "Mid 20s career crisis,\n\nI'm in my mid 20s currently working for one of the FAANG with around 160-200k yearly salary (depending on stocks). Just got accepted into dental school & waitlisted for med school. I would like some advice on whether I should make a complete career switch and get into healthcare. Although at first glance this seem like a dumb question as I'm already making a lot, I think medical field especially Dentistry might be a better option in the long term. I would start by listing out the cons in tech:\n\nCons:  \n\\- **No job stability**: you can be making 500k and still lose your job because of layoffs and stack ranking which basically rank you against your fellow engineers and the bottom performer gets fired at each performance cycle. Some companies (such as mine) even has mandatory firing rate, where they have to fire x% of engineers per cycle to keep the talent fresh.  My manager quote on quote told me \"**You are expected to always improve and be better than your peers cuz thats how a fast pace company work, people are becoming more intelligent everyday and its your job to keep up**\".  Being promoted to a manager wouldn't help neither as companies are actually looking to trim down managerial positions so even if in your late 30s or 40s you can still get fired and I personally know manager who worked at the company for 15+ years and got fired just like that. What's the point of making so much salary if you get fired the next year.\n\n\\- **Insane bar for Interview:** Interviewing for a new job feels like taking a mini-MCAT all over again. You need to prep for LeetCode problems which are just coding brainteasers that have zero relevance to your actual job. Everyone I know who landed a top-tier job solved 300–500 problems (around 500-1000 hours of prep). Then you just have to hope the interviewer doesn’t throw you something ridiculously hard and unless you’ve already seen the question, you're probably not solving it in under an hour. If you fail even one question, regardless of having the right approach, you can get disqualified. Seniority doesn’t help in interviews so you’ll be grinding like everyone else and competing with people half of your age but whose brains are just faster than yours.\n\n\\- **Office politics** : You can get fired over the dumbest shit ever, toxic manager can nitpick on your work and throw some bs company values at you saying you are not good enough even after you did all the dirty work. My manager quote on quote  Basically you always feel like you're on thin ice and just a number. I once almost got fired because I took 1 month and half approved vacation, but then a reorg happened and the new manager was trying to fire me because they need to pick someone on the list and I had the least datapoint because I took time off during the cycle.  Lot of time I honestly just wanna smack them in their dumb face and tell them how dumb and hypocrite they are.\n\n\\- **AI** : all engineers I know are using AI to write their code, while it helps ease up the difficulty of the job, I believe in the future companies are going to hire less and less because of it.\n\n\\- **oncall** : you don't get paid for on-call and you can get paged anytime during your oncall rotation and you are expected to answer even on weekend.\n\nPros:\n\n\\- Not having to go back to school\n\n\\- Remote job opportunity\n\n\\- No overhead\n\n\\- Can start my life earlier (buy house, car, getting married)\n\nFor reference my partner is a dentist who just graduated and she is working 4 days a week and still making more than my yearly salary. She has incredible wlb and can spend the weekend not having to do some stupid coding problem or worry about losing their job as their interview is more of just a vibe check.\n\nFor context the university I got accepted is in Canada where the tuition is very low for med/dent. Yearly tuition is around 15-20k for Dentistry and 10k for Med. So I could technically graduate by 30-31 with minimal debt. However, I do want to take my partner into the equation as well as it would mean delaying our plans by 5 years, and I’m unsure how that dynamic would play out in the relationship.\n\n**Dentistry**\n\nThis is my 1st option because I can graduate in 5 years and make 200-300k right after school while not having to deal with none of the cons I mentionned above. It also gives me the opportunity of becoming an owner/specialist and making even more money in my late 30s & 40s (Possibly 500k - 1M).\n\nHowever if I'm wrong please let me know redditors.\n\n**Medicine:**\n\n2nd option cuz at least 7 years and I heard family medicine wlb is pretty bad with all the paperwork and quota from the government. It is cheaper than dentistry and you get the \"prestige\" of being a real MD but I don't think money wise it's that different than a general dentist unless you specialize. But then again speciality will be another 5 years of residency and I think the opportunity cost is just not worth it at that point. Again, please let me know if i'm wrong on this.\n\nIf you made it this far, thank you for bearing through my complains and any feedback or advice would be really really appreciated!\n\nSide Note: Both fields also allow me to incorporate which can save a ton of taxes( \\~20%), something I can't do in Tech.",

I'm asking because I just don't know if I want to remain in the network or not.  I'm really not happy with the way they run everything.  generally speaking, I feel like, ever since they took over a couple years ago, every aspect of healthcare for myself and my family has been more complicated than it really should be.  from getting a referral, to asking a non-urgent medical question, to making an appointment, to finding out about certain specialists, to whatever else you can think of... for example... is it normal that I am no longer able to get in touch with my general practitioner's office at all?  I have to call the general number for Penn Medicine, which essentially means I could be talking to any random person located in whatever call center, anywhere in the world. they're now the middle-person between me and my doctor, no matter what reason I need to reach my doctor's office.  sometimes I can actually speak to a person, sometimes I have to just leave a message and hope I get a call back that same day.  sometimes not.... is it just me, or does that seem extremely odd??",

Universal healthcare as a basic element of government is Christian, American, moral, and logical.\nThe founding fathers said \"it is self-evident that everyone has the right to life\", an enlightenment principle directly descended from Christian teachings. Christianity throughout all two millennia of its history has always been famous for trying to ease the suffering of the sick. Now in their time, of course, the Founding Fathers didn't really have anything in the way of medicine like we have. Maybe people still unconsciously think medical care is a luxury. But of course it's not anymore. \nAs for morality, I don't really need to go into how denying people what they need to survive is monstrous, do I?\nTying healthcare to work is ridiculous. How do you expect people to work if they're sick and dying? As for forcing people to work if they're not at their best, any manager knows their workers are going to work better when they're at their best, ie, when they're healthy. \n\nDenying people healthcare is like turning this country into some kind of Darwinian wilderness where only the luckiest survive. That's what we want our country to be?!",

      "text": "Please excuse any typos.  Here's the short version:  The primary care physician I had been seeing for a year said that she has to send me a termination letter after I told her I would not be back to her office.  I am worried that I will no longer be able to use anyone in that healthcare system because of how it looks to have been fired from a doctor's office.  I really like the gynecologist there and I'm also seeing a physical therapist in the same healthcare system for overuse injuries.  What should I do?  Is it OK to just not worry about it or do I have to find a new gynecologist and a new PT?\n\nHere's more detail:  I feel like such a loser and a weirdo even though my counselor says I didn't do anything wrong.  I have some chronic health issues, but only went to the primary for basic stuff.  I have seen this doctor five times in one year; the first time was for a new patient visit, the second was for an outer ear infection, the third time was for a sinus infection that wasn't clearing up that I developed after I had covid, and the fourth time was to check my thyroid and liver enzymes because things just felt off and those are usually the problem when I feel a certain way.  At the fourth visit, she told me that I worried about my health too much; she said I messaged her office too often.  I went back and looked at messages.  All the messages over the course of the year amounted to eight separate conversations. (One message was when the outer ear infection started and they couldn't work me in but gave me advice and another was about covid symptoms.  Four were me asking to be seen and setting up appointments.  Two were requests for medication refills.  Is that way too much?  I really feel like a jerk for bothering them now.)  She said that a couple of my messages were \"ugly\" because I described a yeast infection, but I never wrote her about that; I wrote to my gynecologist who is in the same office.  I think she must have read those messages even though they were clearly addressed to my gynecologist who always asks for the gory details.  She also said that I had too many things listed on my chart and that it made me look bad.  She implied that I am a hypochondriac and go to the doctor too much.  Then she told me that she would check labs just to make me feel better, but she knew that they would be just fine and that I should read the book \"Seven Habits of Highly Effective People.\"  Most of that fourth visit was spent lecturing me on this and telling me how the book she recommended had changed her life and that it could do the same for me.  She kept talking about the importance of being proactive, setting goals, having a positive attitude, and not dwelling on my health issues so much.  I really didn't think I was dwelling and all I wanted was to check labs that hadn't been checked in almost a year.  I told her I'd try to follow her advice, and then I left feeling like a total loser.  For that visit, I got a bill for $53 when my copay is usually $21.  When I got my labs back, my liver enzymes were high and my thyroid was off, so she changed my thyroid medicine and told me to quit taking tylenol.  I absolutely hated the new thyroid medicine, but was afraid to tell her because I was afraid she'd think I was being difficult.  I looked at the problem list in my chart that she was referring to and saw that she had added five new separate things (I can't really call most things on the list diagnoses, because the wording is too vague) and that there really were a ton of old things on the list that didn't need to be there!  I wrote to her on the patient portal and asked if I could have some of the \"current problems\" list edited because there was a lot of stuff on it that was no longer accurate and a lot of it was also repetitive; for example, one shoulder injury was listed seven different times by an orthopedist I saw four years ago.  I was told by her nurse that I'd have to make an appointment for this, so I did.  At that appointment, she refused to remove much of anything from my chart and when she started lecturing me again, this time about how I shouldn't worry so much about what was in my chart, I decided to voice my frustration.  I told her that she was the one who had pointed out how ridiculously long my problem list was.  I also told her that I really hadn't been looking for life advice at the last appointment, but I had read the terrible book she recommended just to be a good sport and didn't understand how asking for labs and asking her to clean up my chart was wrong if one of the seven habits was to be proactive.  I also told her I was annoyed that she had added five new things to the list after complaining about the length of the list.  I actually had to show her that she was the one who added those things because she insisted that she hadn't added anything.  When I told her that I was feeling frustrated, she told me that I should see a psychiatrist and that she wouldn't see me again if I didn't.  I told her that I had already found another doctor and that I was only back for one more visit because I needed someone to clean up my chart and I was told that a primary is the only one who can do it.  She said that I should just get my new doctor to do it.  When I told her that my new primary uses a different system, she insisted that every doctor's office had access to Epic.  I told her that that is not true.  She was frustrated and so was I.  I admit that I'm different than a lot of other people.  I think I stick out like a sore thumb.  I have an unusual sense of humor. I have facial tics and sometimes people think I'm nervous just because my face is twitchy.  Sometimes I really am nervous when I walk into a doctor's office, because I expect to be judged.  When I feel like a doctor is not listening, I feel like crying, but it is out of frustration and anger, not depression.  I am usually able to suppress it, but I had cried at the last visit after she started lecturing me, so she thought I was depressed and I was so afraid of saying the wrong thing that hadn't corrected her at that visit.  At this last visit, I told her that I was not depressed, but frustrated and angry that my concerns were being dismissed.  When I explained how I really felt, she actually got mad enough that she had to leave the room for a minute.  I probably seemed combative or difficult to her, but I didn't raise my voice or curse or anything like that; I had just had enough of her advice.  Either way, I am now thinking how annoyed I am that she didn't help me clean up the chart that everyone in that system sees (she only removed three things out of over sixty!), that I have another doctor's bill despite accomplishing nothing, and that she insists that she must send me a letter firing me as a patient when I don't want to use her anyway.  I also keep wondering how things on my chart like \"fibromyalgia\" and her addition of \"chronic pain syndrome\" affect the way doctors look at me.  I didn't even discuss pain with her other than to tell her that when my thyroid or my vitamin D is low, I hurt a lot.  Do too many visits to the orthopedist for tendonitis and a few torn tendons look bad?  Does neck and lower back pain due to bulging discs look bad?  Is it really that big of a deal if I've had my bladder removed due to severe interstitial cystitis?  She commented on how many pain meds I must be on, but the last time I was prescribed anything stronger than plain tylenol was in November and I don't ask for anything.  She also seemed to think that low dose naltrexone was a strong drug.  I don't ever want to see any doctor again and I can't stop thinking how annoying and awful I must be as a patient.  I feel ashamed to be me.",

      "text": "Conservative, Liberal. or Independent: Imagine your life and the lives of your children without access to healthcare.\n\nWe are not talking affordable healthcare here; we are talking about the total elimination of any government subsidized medical care for which untold millions and millions of American citizens rely.\n\nDestruction is the only plan the Republicans have to overhaul the Medicaid, Medicare, and American Care Act (Obamacare). They claim to be talking about fraud, waste, and abuse, but that is just the smokescreen of which they are hiding behind. There real aim is to drive all Americans back into privatized medicine: you remember: DENIED! Preexisting condition.\n\nWith complete lack of compassion or empathy (mostly because they have given themselves government provided healthcare for their families), Republicans are hell-bent to endorse the Trump/Musk/DOGE scheme of supporting the government by giving absurd tax cuts the rich while transferring the burden onto the backs of the common man.\n\nThey are cutting everything to achieve these vile ends by drastically reducing everything up to, and including, virtually all medical research. Not only are they endangering our lives, but in their slavish greed are risking their lives, too. It's as though they don't realize they breath the same air and drink the same water we do, and wealth is no protection from pandemics.\n\nSee this report:\n\n\n\nStory by Alex Henderson • \n\n© provided by AlterNet\n\nWhen Democrats recaptured the U.S. House of Representatives in the 2018 midterms and enjoyed a net gain of 41 seats, President Donald Trump's unpopular efforts to overturn the Affordable Care Act of 2010, a.k.a. Obamacare, were cited as a major factor. Obamacare, many Democratic strategists argued, had become a toxic issue for Republicans. But during his 2024 campaign, Trump once again called for the ACA to be repealed.\n\nIn an article published by the conservative website The Bulwark on April 19, journalist Jonathan Cohn warns that millions of Americans could lose their health insurance if Trump and House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-Louisiana) succeed in undermining Obamacare and Medicaid.\n\n\"The likelihood of Donald Trump and his allies in Congress taking Medicaid away from millions of low-income Americans — and, in the process, rolling back a huge piece of the Affordable Care Act — has increased significantly in the last two weeks,\" Cohn explains. \"The change has been easy to miss, because so many other stories are dominating the news — and because the main evidence is a subtle shift in Republican rhetoric. But that shift has been crystal clear if you follow the ins and outs of health care policy — and if you were listening closely to House Speaker Mike Johnson a week ago, when he appeared on Fox News.\"\n\nOn Fox News, Johnson said, \"We have to root out fraud, waste, and abuse. We have to eliminate people on, for example, on Medicaid who are not actually eligible to be there — able-bodied workers, for example, young men who are — who should never be on the program at all.\"\n\nJohnson's remarks, Cohn notes, \"may sound like a defense of Medicaid\" but included \"the language Medicaid critics have been using to describe a big, controversial downsizing of the program.\"\n\n\"Here, it helps to remember what the Affordable Care Act sought to accomplish, and the key role Medicaid played in that,\" Cohn writes. \"The law's main goal was to make decent health insurance available to all Americans, as part of a decades-long, still unfinished campaign to make health care a basic right, as it is in every other economically advanced nation. That meant getting coverage to the uninsured, including low-income Americans who didn't have a way to get insurance on their own because their jobs didn't offer coverage or made coverage available at premiums they couldn't afford, and because individual policies — the kind you buy on your own, not through a job — were either too expensive or unavailable to them because of pre-existing conditions.\"\n\n[https://www.thebulwark.com/p/health-insurance-for-millions-on-chopping-block-obamacare-medicaid-expansion-republicans-mike-johnson?r=np4n&triedRedirect=true](https://www.thebulwark.com/p/health-insurance-for-millions-on-chopping-block-obamacare-medicaid-expansion-republicans-mike-johnson?r=np4n&triedRedirect=true)",

      "text": "To legally practice medicine, doctors everywhere have to get a medical degree and then several years of on the job training. In the US, med schools charge $50k per year for four years. The government then pays $180k per year to train those graduates but only 1/3 of that goes to the resident. Why not flip the $12B spent to subsidize residencies and pay med school tuition instead? The doctor shortage shrinks quickly with triple the number entering each year. Doctors end up with have less debt due to fewer years of accrued interest. This also  incentivizes more to pursue primary care, where the shortage is greatest, and it would be fairer, more susceptible to the efficiency of market forces. 3 year residencies become much more appealing than 7 year ones when self funding.",

      "title": "Why is the US healthcare system such a rort? An Aussie perspective.",
      "text": "Trump is coming for Australia's Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS). This is incredibly important, so please ensure you understand what is at stake.\n\nTo start with, the PBS is a program funded by the Australian government to make prescription medicine affordable by essentially allowing Medicare to buy medication wholesale at a negotiated price.\n\nIf a medication is deemed both effective and cost-effective compared to existing drugs, the Australian government will negotiate a price directly with the pharmaceutical company. Because the government has enormous purchasing power, they can negotiate a far fairer price than anyone could attain as an individual.\n\nOnce a price is agreed, it is added to the PBS and Medicare subsidises the cost so no Australian pays more than $31.60 per script (or $7.60 for concession card holders).\n\nThis means that medication that costs Americans hundreds and sometimes thousands of dollars every script is always never more than $31.60 in Australia.\n\nIt's one of the pillars of our public health system that ensures no Australian is excluded access to healthcare because they can't afford it.\n\nSo what's the issue?\n\nUS pharmaceutical companies have a number of complaints about the PBS, but at its core is a concern that if Americans see how much less Australians are paying for their medication, even before the Medicare subsidies, they could demand similar prices there.\n\nThe argument is that pharmaceutical companies need this revenue to fund the research and development to create new drugs. Which sounds reasonable... until you look at the numbers.\n\nIn 2023, Pfizer only spent 16% of its revenue on research and development. In fact it spent $3 billion more on marketing and administration than it did on research and development, and still made $2.4 billion profit.\n\nIn that same year, Johnson and Johnson spent $15.4 billion on research and development, $24 billion on marketing and administration, and still made a profit of $13.3 billion.\n\nThis is replicated throughout the industry, with billions in profits being passed on to shareholders rather than the apparently crucial development of the next wonder drug.\n\nAdditionally, a study by the National Academy of Sciences found that every single drug approved by the FDA between 2010 and 2019 had received substantial public funding, with a total of $230 billion in public sector funding contributing to these drugs.\n\nThe most important thing to remember here is that US pharmaceutical companies are still making a sizeable profit from the Australian market. Every price negotiated through the PBS has to be considered fair and reasonable to both parties. In the 2022–23 financial year, the Australian government spent $16.7 billion on PBS medicines, the Australian people then spent an additional $1.6 billion on top of that. This is from a comparatively tiny market of only 25 million people.\n\nWe don't know exactly how much money the big US pharmaceutical companies make in Australia, but we do know our own largest pharmaceutical company, CSL Limited, made a profit of $2.6 billion last year, so there is clearly plenty of money to be made here.\n\nI genuinely see the utility in ensuring the pharmaceutical industry is lucrative to encourage further innovation, but this has to be balanced against the well being of individuals desperately seeking relief from crippling, chronic, or even terminal illness. The PBS allows us to get that balance right by ensuring companies still make profits without exploiting consumers.\n\nIf Trump attempts to turn the screws on this, it needs to be seen for what it is; an attack on our sovereignty, our values of fairness, and our way of life. This cannot be up for negotiation, and Albanese needs to be left in no doubt what the Australian people expect of him.\n\nIf Trump chooses to attack the fundamental right of Australians to access affordable healthcare then this is an attack on the Australian people. We must, therefore, seriously review the status of the US as an \"ally\". At this point, the viability of hosting troops, intelligence officers, and military installations from an increasingly hostile adversary must be reviewed.\n\nEdited to remove table with incorrect prices.",

I have the option of paying to keep it (about $13k/yr for my family of 3), or going to the marketplace.  There, I see another Anthem plan \"Healthkeepers\" (gold tier), whose *nominal* cost is also about $13k/yr, BUT with the tax credits (due to our reduced income) it will be about a quarter of that.\n\nI can confirm that both plans cover our biggest medicine costs (incl. my T2 diabetes), and our current doctors (perhaps because both plans are through Anthem).  (I am finding it kinda surprisingly difficult to get a nice clean *list* of what procedures and medicines a plan covers what portions of, beyond just copays and deductibles.)\n\nBut before committing to a big change (I can't go back to the employer plan once I pass up the opportunity), I wanted to check if people felt happy with their gold-tier marketplace plans, and maybe even specifically if they've noticed differences between the specific plans (CovaCare vs Healthkeepers).\n\nAny feedback appreciated very much!",

      "text": "Like Nursing, Respiratory Therapist, etc. I know two things about hiring: The Medical field is always understaffed, and they make it next to impossible for people with no experience to get experience. I'm not in the field, I thought about the latter of those two examples because I have lived with Asthma and allergies my whole life and it's interesting. It's also a 2 year degree. \n\nMy wife is a Medical Assistant, and after she finished school for it, not one would hire her because to get an entry-level job, you had to show three year's experience to start at the bottom. It was frustrating, because even volunteer positions said you had to have experience. She wound up delivering for DoorDash for a long time while she looked. Eventually she found a spot with a woman who she wowed in the interview and has happily been there for I want to say 4 years now. \n\nBut for these other roles if it's already hard to find people, and it's hard for recent grads to find work with no experience, why make it harder by telling them they need to go back to school for 2 more years, to get the same pay as if they had found a spot with the 2 year version of the degree, and then, naturally, still not hire them because they have no experience? \n\nAnd it's not just the medical field, a lot of \"regular\" jobs do the same thing with things like \"Must have proven track record\" for entry-level jobs.",

My husband is a disabled veteran and we don’t have much income (under $20,000 annual) as he’s not able to work. Unfortunately since he’s not considered 100% permanently disabled, I don’t qualify for an VA/military health insurance. I was diagnosed with a cancerous brain tumor at 14. Had surgery and chemotherapy. My tumor has remained stable for 10 years now, so I see a neurologist and neurosurgeon for seizure medicine regularly. I also have annual MRIs, so definitely need some kind of coverage, but I don’t think my condition/health is serious enough now to qualify for any Medicare. What am I looking for and what does it all mean. I’m seeing plans that are over $200 a month and I can’t afford that, but I also can’t afford my $750 seizure medicine. Not sure what to do.

However i thought it would be nice to have a clear direction at some point to make all the effort feel worthwhile and make sure I'm working toward the right goal.\n\nMy question is this: I have been for a few years now considering a career change to something im more interested in (currently work in marketing). I have always had an interest in science and specifically physiology & psychology. At one point i was looking to do clinical psych program, but recently I discovered that I would love to just **learn everything there is to possibly learn about the body**, and somehow in the future also integrate that with psychology. I'm really active in the health and wellness world and thats where a lot of my passion for this comes from. I'm also just so interested in understanding the body, and the mind, that at this stage I would love to just start learning. Now for the career path. its hard to tell exactly what i should aim to end up as. A medical doctor? A doctor of chiropractic? a Psychologist?\n\nPerhaps I'm not at a stage yet where I can make a final decision, to me so far it seems that becoming a medical doctor would afford me the opportunity to learn everything I want to, and then integrate other dimensions. But i thought it would be wise to get real-world answers and feedback from people or actual doctors to see if theres anything I'm ignorant of.\n\nI really appreciate any advice or feedback you could offer so thank you in advance. This has been a big problem I'm trying to solve and get some clarity around.",

      "title": "Lets rebuild the USA healthcare system, from the ground up. AI has it all figured out.  ",
      "text": "Here’s a blueprint from Planet Z’s top consulting minds on how to rebuild the U.S. healthcare system from the ground up – designed for sustainability, happiness, and efficiency:\n\n\n\n🚀 1. Universal Access to Healthcare\n\nModel: Healthcare is a right, not a privilege. •\tEnsure basic healthcare services are available to everyone, regardless of income or employment. •\tUse tiered systems: basic care for all, with private options for enhanced services. •\tFocus on preventive care to reduce long-term costs.\n\n\n\n🤖 2. AI and Robotics Integration\n\nModel: AI as the co-pilot for medical professionals. •\tDeploy AI diagnostic assistants that reduce errors and speed up decision-making. •\tUse robotic surgeons and care bots to handle routine procedures and patient care. •\tAutomate administrative tasks (billing, records) to cut down bureaucracy by 70%.\n\n\n\n🏥 3. Community-Based Health Hubs\n\nModel: Decentralized, local health centers. •\tEstablish community health hubs with telehealth options, staffed by AI, nurses, and general practitioners. •\tFocus on early intervention and mental health services. •\tEmbed health into schools, workplaces, and community centers.\n\n\n\n📊 4. Transparent Pricing\n\nModel: Simplicity and fairness in cost. •\tStandardize healthcare pricing – every procedure has a clear, universal cost. •\tNo surprise bills. Implement real-time cost estimations for patients. •\tUse blockchain for transparent medical billing.\n\n\n\n🌱 5. Preventive Care First\n\nModel: Stop treating sickness, start promoting health. •\tProvide free annual health check-ups, vaccines, and screenings. •\tIncentivize healthy lifestyles through tax breaks or financial rewards. •\tAI tracks health trends and nudges patients to stay on course.\n\n\n\n💼 6. Salary Overhaul for Medical Professionals\n\nModel: Fair pay, low burnout. •\tStandardize doctor/nurse salaries across the board to reduce hospital vs. private sector gaps. •\tCap malpractice insurance and introduce no-fault compensation models. •\tAI handles non-medical tasks, allowing doctors to focus 100% on patient care.\n\n\n\n🧬 7. Personalized Medicine\n\nModel: Tailored treatments. •\tUse genomics and biometric data for personalized therapies. •\tAI predicts disease risks and customizes treatment for individual biology. •\tRobot pharmacists craft tailored medications in real-time.\n\n\n\n💊 8. Pharmaceutical Reform\n\nModel: Fair drug pricing and innovation. •\tUse AI-driven drug discovery to cut development costs. •\tCap drug prices and mandate public transparency for R&D spending. •\tIncentivize pharmaceutical companies to invest in long-term cures over quick-fix treatments.\n\n\n\n📡 9. Remote and Telehealth Dominance\n\nModel: Health from home. •\tUse telehealth as the default for routine appointments. •\tAI monitors patients remotely and alerts doctors only for anomalies. •\tExpand mental health services via teletherapy and AI counselors.\n\n\n\n🌎 10. Global Collaboration\n\nModel: Shared health innovation. •\tPool medical data from all nations (privacy-protected) to advance AI diagnostics. •\tPlanet Z’s system shares breakthrough treatments across borders instantly. •\tCoordinate responses to pandemics globally, free of patent restrictions during crises.\n\n\n\n⚖️ 11. Mental Health Integration\n\nModel: Mind and body treated together. •\tMental health is as important as physical health. •\tEvery health center includes mental health specialists and AI-driven mental wellness programs. •\tSchools, workplaces, and public institutions provide free access to counseling and therapy.\n\n\n\n🏗️ 12. Continuous Feedback and Adaptation\n\nModel: A system that evolves. •\tUse real-time feedback from patients and healthcare workers to improve services. •\tAI analyzes health trends to predict future needs and adjust resources. •\tIncentivize constant innovation with rewards for breakthroughs in efficiency and care.\n\n\n\n🌌 Final Thought from Planet Z\n\n“Health is the foundation of happiness. Build systems that keep people healthy, not just alive.” Would your team on Earth like us to deploy simulation models for these reforms? We love collaborating across galaxies!",

      "text": "I am left angry and confused about an interaction I had at a party last night and want to see if any medical folks could weigh in. Am I overreacting or is this truly as f*cked up as it seemed?\n\nAt one point at the party I was chatting in a circle with two medical professionals who work somewhat closely at the same hospital, as well as two or three others who like me do not work in medicine. I had never met the medical folks before last night. To make it simpler I will call them Joe and Susan. \n\nJoe mentioned that he saw a patient recently with a gruesome and disfiguring injury from a freak accident. I had two main reactions to this… first one obviously was sadness for this person and their loved ones dealing with the aftermath of this horrible incident. I also was uncomfortable with the fact that they were so openly sharing details about this with people like me who are 0% involved. If I was the injured person or their loved one I would be so pissed knowing that doctors/nurses were sharing this tragedy as a “cool” anecdote at a party. (Joe’s tone was definitely like “OMG you wouldn’t believe this! So crazy 😝!” rather than sympathetic). \n\nBut then it got worse… Joe pulled out his phone and showed off a photo of this person’s injury to all of us in the conversation. It happened so quickly that I got a full view of a horrible gory injury before I could turn away. When he showed it to Susan (medical pro #2) she said something along the lines of “oh yeah I already saw that in the work album”. (I don’t remember exactly whether she said “work album” or “work group chat” but it was one of those). \n\nNot only was I horrified by the photo (100% NSFL) I was horrified that Joe chose to show it to a bunch of basically strangers at a party. And with a tone of gleeful excitement you might expect if he were showing off a photo of his dog in a Halloween costume or something.\n\nI get that shop talk is a thing and I know that people in medicine have very stressful, difficult jobs and need to blow off steam. But is this type of situation at all normal? It feels wrong and so insensitive to me.",

      "text": "**A vote-a-rama is happening in the Senate for the One Big Beautiful Bill as you read this.** During a vote-a-rama, Senators are on the floor voting on amendment after amendment, and their offices are tracking every single call in real time. This is the moment when your call is most likely to be noticed and can directly influence how a Senator votes.\n\nA clause in the **\"One Big Beautiful Bill\"** aims to eliminate the Grad PLUS loan program, a lifeline for graduate and professional students. Grad PLUS has been pivotal in making medical school tuition affordable for 75% of students. If the bill is enacted, thousands of future doctors will be priced out of pursuing medicine. The vote is THIS WEEK. Your call to an undecided Senator will truly decide the future of American healthcare for all. We are just **TWO “NO” votes away from stopping this**. Your call to an undecided Senator could be the tiebreaker vote to oppose the bill. Take ACTION!\n\nThe Senate is currently voting on the bill that can end Grad PLUS loans for medical students. The Grad PLUS program under the Direct PLUS program has put thousands for doctors through medical school in US. Around 70-75% of MD students rely on the program to cover the cost of attending medical school. Four out of five DO students rely on Grad PLUS to cover similar costs. The Grad PLUS loan funds the entire cost of attendance, including tuition and living expenses. Grad PLUS has made medical education a possibility for the average American. Moreover, it’s made the dreams of low-income and underrepresented students a reality and has provided them with the means to pursue medicine. Removing the program would mean turning medical education and training into a career path only accessible to the wealthy.\n\nThe AAMC projects a physician shortage of roughly 86,000 by 2036, which the bill would only exacerbate. As the number of physicians declines, the quality of care and patient outcomes would very likely deteriorate due to a lack of physician representation and care in an ever-growing patient population. Areas in dire need of doctors would be hit the hardest, impacting rural areas, underserved communities, and VA hospitals. We need doctors more than ever, and restricting access on the basis of income rather than potential and talent will be detrimental in the long run.\n\nYou can take action TODAY. Voice your opinions to those you have put into positions of power. The bill is currently in the Senate for voting. This prime time to call your Senators. During the vote-a-rama, the Senate is in constant debate, and members are proposing amendments to the bill. Many Senators are all ears and are eager to hear from their constituents in regards to the bill. Voting in alignment with their constituents can increase their chances of reelection. Staff are especially more attentive and responsive to outreach, as Senators want to understand the general consensus of their constituents before deciding. Take full advantage of this!

      "text": "Hi! I've been dealing with anthem for the past year or so and they want to deny every authorization request my surgeons and doctors make.  \n  \nHad multiple CT scans denied which ended up confirming my diagnosis of pheochromocytoma. Their explanation was that an ultrasound would be safer due to the lower radiation, luckily my doctors at UCSF are contracted with Anthem so they just had me do it in house rather than to a closer imaging center for me to get it covered. The crazy part is I had 2 endos, an endo surgeon and my PCP all try to get them to approve a CT scan on my abdomen.\n\n  \nI've even had my meds rejected prior to my surgery, I need to increase my dosage of alpha blockers so I would have lower surgery risks and apparently increasing medicine dosage is not allowed by anthem? Got around it by just having my endo write a new prescription to multiple pharmacies lol.  \n  \nI then had an ambry genetics test rejected because getting an adrenal tumor at 23 is normal according to anthem. It proceeded to tell me I have multiple endocrine neoplasia 2, and 99% odds of medullary thyroid cancer.\n\nWent in for an ultrasound which didn't require prior auth, and it turns out I have a nodule in my thyroid and high calcitonin which are signs of stage 1 cancer. \n\n  \nEnd of the day the total cost of my care after the discounts was around \\~150k in 2024 of which anthem paid 142k of it but it just makes getting care outside of the hospital so much harder. Every blood test, and imaging request I need to go to UCSF instead of a quest near my house because of anthem.",

      "text": "Hello all!\n\nSo, a little context; I'm a 35 year old English and Japanese teacher from Brazil, and I've been diagnosed with testicular cancer recently. I'll leave the details aside for now and cut to the point, I have been through surgery last Wednesday, and since I now have a whole month to wait for further information on my personal progress, I have put a lot of thought onto how grateful I am for how speedy and efficient the whole process have been up to here, since I'm doing everything through the Universal Heathcare System (SUS is the acronym here in Brazil).  \nRecent anxiety regarding the possibility of metastasis has made me more eager to share my thoughts on this matter (amongst others), especially since not many people talk about the Brazilian healthcare system in English; so I decided to make a YouTube video on the topic, and thought of gathering questions/ ask for the topics y'all are most interested about, **especially** from people in the US, where I know how critical the current state of affairs is.\n\nSo I'd appreciate very much if you ask me any questions at all, and comment on your assumptions/ things you'd like to know more about a place with such a system. Personal questions are also okay, but I might refrain from answering at my own discretion.\n\nSome extra info to help with context:\n\n* I have not paid for any medicine / exam / surgery (aside from taxes; feel free to ask about that side as well if interested, but I'm no expert)\n* Government owned Healthcare Units are located in every neighbourhood and open Mon-Fri, but bigger 24h ones are located in key areas throughout the cities for emergencies; more serious/delicate cases (such as cancer) are dealt by outsourcing to private hospitals. I have been treating my cancer in one of the best hospitals in the region, and the only difference I had from a patient with private health insurance was that I had to share my hospital room with another person instead of having a private suite for the post-op.\n* Upon confirming the possibility of cancer, I was referred to the oncologist with urgency, and scheduling took about a month. After the triage consultation I waited for 8 days for an opening with the oncologist surgeon, where they immediately scheduled the surgery for *nine days later*. All my exams and appointments needed where handled within the week. The speedy process shocked me beyond words (our system was not exactly famous for being efficient when I was growing up), and that's when I decided I'd share my experience with it.\n* The system is far from perfect, and I'm very open to talking about its failures as well. One personal anecdote here, but if the first doctor I went to about the matter had been thorough enough to put their gloves and touch me, I'd have known about the cancer half a year earlier, and that might be the difference between what stage I am right now (which I still don't know).\n\nAgain, any and all questions/thoughts are welcome! Thanks for reading, and happy Easter/Passover for those who celebrate it!",

      "text": "**Engineering vs Dentistry vs Medicine: Which one to choose?**\n\nMid 20s career crisis,\n\nI'm in my mid 20s currently working for one of the FAANG with around 160-200k yearly salary (depending on stocks). Just got accepted into dental school & waitlisted for med school. I would like some advice on whether I should make a complete career switch and get into healthcare. Although at first glance this seem like a dumb question as I'm already making a lot, I think medical field especially Dentistry might be a better option in the long term. I would start by listing out the cons in tech:\n\nCons:  \n\\- **No job stability**: you can be making 500k and still lose your job because of layoffs and stack ranking which basically rank you against your fellow engineers and the bottom performer gets fired at each performance cycle. Some companies (such as mine) even has mandatory firing rate, where they have to fire x% of engineers per cycle to keep the talent fresh.  My manager quote on quote told me \"**You are expected to always improve and be better than your peers cuz thats how a fast pace company work, people are becoming more intelligent everyday and its your job to keep up**\".  Being promoted to a manager wouldn't help neither as companies are actually looking to trim down managerial positions so even if in your late 30s or 40s you can still get fired and I personally know manager who worked at the company for 15+ years and got fired just like that. What's the point of making so much salary if you get fired the next year.\n\n\\- **Insane bar for Interview:** Interviewing for a new job feels like taking a mini-MCAT all over again. You need to prep for LeetCode problems which are just coding brainteasers that have zero relevance to your actual job. Everyone I know who landed a top-tier job solved 300–500 problems (around 500-1000 hours of prep). Then you just have to hope the interviewer doesn’t throw you something ridiculously hard and unless you’ve already seen the question, you're probably not solving it in under an hour. If you fail even one question, regardless of having the right approach, you can get disqualified. Seniority doesn’t help in interviews so you’ll be grinding like everyone else and competing with people half of your age but whose brains are just faster than yours.\n\n\\- **Office politics** : You can get fired over the dumbest shit ever, toxic manager can nitpick on your work and throw some bs company values at you saying you are not good enough even after you did all the dirty work. My manager quote on quote  Basically you always feel like you're on thin ice and just a number. I once almost got fired because I took 1 month and half approved vacation, but then a reorg happened and the new manager was trying to fire me because they need to pick someone on the list and I had the least datapoint because I took time off during the cycle.  Lot of time I honestly just wanna smack them in their dumb face and tell them how dumb and hypocrite they are.\n\n\\- **AI** : all engineers I know are using AI to write their code, while it helps ease up the difficulty of the job, I believe in the future companies are going to hire less and less because of it.\n\n\\- **oncall** : you don't get paid for on-call and you can get paged anytime during your oncall rotation and you are expected to answer even on weekend.\n\nPros:\n\n\\- Not having to go back to school\n\n\\- Remote job opportunity\n\n\\- No overhead\n\n\\- Can start my life earlier (buy house, car, getting married)\n\nFor reference my partner is a dentist who just graduated and she is working 4 days a week and still making more than my yearly salary. She has incredible wlb and can spend the weekend not having to do some stupid coding problem or worry about losing their job as their interview is more of just a vibe check.\n\nFor context the university I got accepted is in Canada where the tuition is very low for med/dent. Yearly tuition is around 15-20k for Dentistry and 10k for Med. So I could technically graduate by 30-31 with minimal debt. However, I do want to take my partner into the equation as well as it would mean delaying our plans by 5 years, and I’m unsure how that dynamic would play out in the relationship.\n\n**Dentistry**\n\nThis is my 1st option because I can graduate in 5 years and make 200-300k right after school while not having to deal with none of the cons I mentionned above. It also gives me the opportunity of becoming an owner/specialist and making even more money in my late 30s & 40s (Possibly 500k - 1M).\n\nHowever if I'm wrong please let me know redditors.\n\n**Medicine:**\n\n2nd option cuz at least 7 years and I heard family medicine wlb is pretty bad with all the paperwork and quota from the government. It is cheaper than dentistry and you get the \"prestige\" of being a real MD but I don't think money wise it's that different than a general dentist unless you specialize. But then again speciality will be another 5 years of residency and I think the opportunity cost is just not worth it at that point. Again, please let me know if i'm wrong on this.\n\nIf you made it this far, thank you for bearing through my complains and any feedback or advice would be really really appreciated!\n\nSide Note: Both fields also allow me to incorporate which can save a ton of taxes( \\~20%), something I can't do in Tech.",

      "text": "My mother has a heart condition (forgot what it is called) and she has always been quite a physically weak woman, since childhood. She also has some physical discomfort that I keep telling her to bring up with a doctor or visit a doctor for but she won't listen (back and shoulder pain). She's nearing 60.\n\n\nI want to accompany her to her doctor visits or ask her for that info so I can help her but she won't allow me. For reference, we are Chinese and it's a thing in our culture to just lie and not talk about medical info like that so as to not worry family. [Here's a film for reference](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Farewell_(2019_film)) if you want to see how it's like. I keep telling her to make a physical therapy appointment but she's too stubborn. \"It's a waste of money!\" even though I will pay for it. \"It's too far\" and it's only a 10 minute drive. Stuff like that. She's been to acupuncture and cupping but I don't believe in that traditional chinese medicine stuff and clearly it hasn't worked.\n\n\nI want to call her doctors she has had for a decade plus who are familiar with me and my name (I'm in some of her forms) to ask if she is able to do basic stretching and weightlifting (I'm talking like 2.5 or 5lb dumbbells, very basic and light) and if her condition would allow for it, and I can help her with it. And to push her to do physical therapy as well and keep her accountable with the exercises her therapist would give her. I'm moving away from living with them soon so I won't be able to help with lifting, and overall I want her to be more physically fit so she can be less dependent on me and my dad and so I can move away without having to worry about that stuff. She gets winded going up 2 flights of stairs, can can't even lift 10lb or so, and yeah her back and shoulder discomfort.\n\n\nSo I want to ask two things to her doctors:\n\n1. With my mother's current condition, is she physically capable of basic weightlifting, stretching, and cardio that I help oversee?\n\n2. Has my mother mentioned her back and shoulder discomfort? Can you help persuade my mother to visit a physical therapist for that?\n\nDo these questions violate HIPAA?",

      "title": "Master List of *Non Rigid* Telehealth & Virtual Direct Primary Care",
      "text": "So we all know that there are quite a few low cost telehealth solutions out there for minor items like Teladoc, Virtuwell, etc.\n\nA very well done (but now out of date) review of those providers:  \n[https://www.reddit.com/r/povertyfinance/comments/elryxp/ive\\_compiled\\_all\\_the\\_lowcost\\_medical\\_resources/](https://www.reddit.com/r/povertyfinance/comments/elryxp/ive_compiled_all_the_lowcost_medical_resources/) (maybe we can convince that poster or someone else to do an update)\n\nThose services have some drawbacks. Each doctor/provider is randomly assigned (so you could end up with good or not helpful person). They're prescribing guidelines are almost always extremely conservative (rigid). They meter out help/prescriptions so you need to create appointments more frequently (instead of getting prescriptions that last 3+, 6+, etc. scripts or having a free refill solution).\n\nSo I did a deep dive for Telehealth providers that have signs that they're more likely to be \"less rigid\" in their guidelines, allow you to pick/know who your provider is at booking, and who still have an option or effectively an option to pay on a per visit basis at a reasonable price (instead of the many Direct Primary Care providers that want a monthly payment to work with you). Typically a solution like this is for people with high deductibles that rarely hit them, primary priority is a good experience at a lower cost, don't want to constantly need appointments, and are okay with not submitting through insurance because they likely won't hit their deductible anyway.\n\nI can't personally attest to any of these providers as I've only used 1 of them, but at least they seem to have the hallmarks of hitting all of the above items. These types of providers are extremely difficult to find. I also invite others to post any other websites, apps, providers in the comments or even a provider themselves that believes they fit that criteria.\n\nTelehealth NP  \n\\-Pricing: $75 for main office visit if you look at their booking options though they do have specific types of appointments they charge more for: [https://www.telehealthnp.com/pricing](https://www.telehealthnp.com/pricing)  \n\\-Probably one of the bigger groups that can work with almost all of the states\n\nSesame Care:  \n\\-Pricing, I could be wrong, but it looks like you don't need a membership to book and each doctor lists their price: [https://sesamecare.com/service/telehealth-visit](https://sesamecare.com/service/telehealth-visit)  \n\\-A bigger player and there is a bit of negative reviews outside of the system. That said the website does have a rating system (but some of those ratings look fake?) so maybe if you focus on going to a better rated provider you get a good answer.\n\nTwin Ports Medicine:  \n\\-Pricing: Currently $50 a [Wayback Machine Pricing](https://web.archive.org/web/20240917155037/https://www.twinportstelemedicine.com/service/telehealth). Don't know why she removed the $50 per appointment from her website. Maybe because she started with a limited set of insurers who probably are more expensive than her cash price.  \n\\-https://www.twinportstelemedicine.com/  \n\\-Can prescribe in MN, WI, AZ, OR, VA. Lab orders and general info nationwide\n\nOn Demand DPC:  \n\\-Pricing: Currently $50. [https://ondemanddpc.com/pricing](https://ondemanddpc.com/pricing)  \n\\-Serving Texas with it looks like plans to add New Mexico and Colorado soon\n\nI left off Direct Primary Care providers using a monthly model. Theoretically you could turn on a monthly make an appointment at many of these and then turn it off, but honestly they're usually pretty small and I suspect they'll just refuse to take you as a client after. A good place to finding doctors in that space is this tool. Also many you could probably line up a telehealth relationship while not even living in the same city or maybe even same state:  \n[https://dpcalliance.org/member-directory-map/](https://dpcalliance.org/member-directory-map/)\n\nLast note: Please don't be an a\\*\\* to a small company (sometimes 1 person operations) that is doing a favor to high deductible people everywhere. It's one thing to ask for some extra antibiotics, get a few sleeping pills for an upcoming flight, maybe get a GLP-1 prescription at a lower cost than going to a clinic doc, etc. and its completely a different thing to call up these services trying to score heavy quantities of controlled substances and then getting mad at them if they don't want to do that for 1 $75 appointment.",

And for the first time in a while, it felt like we all understood each other. We all looked at each other and cheered through the hurt. Through the actions of one faceless man, it felt possible for private healthcare to look down and see us. \n\nSo do something. Don't let this moment pass. Don't let them take this moment away from you. That's what the news media will do. They'll bleed all the sensationalism from this and move on. It will be a collective fist raise subsumed into another fast paced narrative. Trump will do something or Biden or Musk will do something and we will have another story to chase. Another thing to fight over. But what has this bickering accomplished?\n\nNo, you smiled together. For once, in all the shit of a decade, you broke bread and smiled. Do not forget that. They have faces and roles and you are faceless. They have shareholder meetings and we have souls. Our hearts burn brighter than theirs. We do not turn away from suffering. We ARE suffering. We are faceless and they see that as our weakness.\n\nTo Private Healthcare, your mom is another number. Your child with cancer is a statistic. Your sister's denied surgery is a cost cutting measure. Your grandpa's medicine is a drop in stock and your cousin's disorder is out of network. They have never seen you smile, but they know to hurt you. It lines their wallets and they ignore you. \n\nFacelessness is our strength. When we come together, we are a crowd. We are a sea of faces, unidentified and ready to demand the end to this suffering. Do not take me wrong, this is no call for violence. This is a genuine call to action. A call for them to stop their violence toward us. A call for you to protest. No more can we allow people to die.\n\nThe man gave you a phrase. Use it. \n\nDENY. DELAY. DEPOSE.\n\nDeny them the right to let you suffer. Delay their profits. Depose them. Their thrones are built on your blood. Go to their offices and chant and yell and scream. Tear these monsters down. No more will they deny us the pursuit to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. \n\nI don't give a fuck who you voted for either. You stand by me, I'll stand by you. We stand united.\n\nTo those who cannot get out and protest, TELL YOUR STORIES. TELL US WHAT PRIVATE HEALTHCARE DENIED YOU. WE FIGHT FOR YOU. YOU DESERVED BETTER. \n\n\nOCCUPY YOUR RIGHT TO LIVE.",

      "text": "Hey everyone,\n\nI'm a Computer Engineering student with skills in Machine Learning and Computer Vision, currently brainstorming ideas for an impactful **Final Year Project (FYP)**. My goal is to work on something with genuine real-world potential.\n\nOne area that initially grabbed my attention was using **retinal fundus images to predict CVD/NCD risk**. The concept is fascinating – using CV for non-invasive health insights. However, as I dig deeper for an FYP, I have some standard concerns:\n\n* **Saturation & Feasibility:** Is this space already heavily researched? Are there achievable niches left for an undergraduate project, or are the main challenges (massive curated datasets, clinical validation) beyond FYP scope?\n* **Signal vs. Noise:** How robust is the predictive signal compared to established methods? Is it truly promising or more of a complex research challenge?\n\nWhile I'm still curious about retinal imaging (and any insights on viable FYP angles there are welcome!), these questions make me want to **cast a wider net**.\n\n**This leads me to my main request: What other high-impact domains or specific problems are well-suited for an undergrad FYP using ML/CV?**\n\nI'm particularly interested in areas where:\n\n* A CE perspective (systems thinking, optimization, efficiency, hardware/software interaction) could be valuable.\n* The field might be less crowded than, say, foundational LLM research or self-driving perception.\n* There's potential to make a tangible contribution, even at the FYP level (e.g., proof-of-concept, useful tool, novel analysis).\n* **Crucially for an FYP:** Reasonably accessible datasets and achievable scope within \\~6-9 months.\n\nSome areas that come to mind (but please suggest others!):\n\n* **Agriculture Tech:** Precision farming (e.g., weed/disease detection from drone/sensor data), yield estimation.\n* **Environmental Monitoring:** Analyzing satellite imagery for deforestation/pollution, predicting wildfires, analyzing sensor data for climate impact.\n* **Healthcare/Medicine (Beyond complex diagnostics):** Optimizing hospital logistics/scheduling, developing assistive tech tools, analyzing patterns in public health data (non-image based?).\n* **Scientific Discovery Support:** Using CV/ML to analyze experimental outputs (e.g., microscopy images in biology/materials science), pattern recognition in simulation data.\n\n**So, my questions boil down to:**\n\n1. Are there still unexplored, FYP-suitable niches within the retinal imaging for health prediction space?\n2. **More importantly: What other impactful, less-saturated ML/CV project areas/problems should I seriously consider for my Final Year Project?** Specific problems or dataset pointers would be amazing!\n\nAppreciate any brainstorming help, reality checks, or cool pointers you can share!\n\n**TLDR: CE student needs impactful, feasible ML/CV Final Year Project ideas. Considered retinal imaging but seeking broader input, especially on less-crowded but high-impact areas suitable for undergrad scope.**",

Schools, workplaces, and community centers provide regular health screenings, wellness programs, and education.\n\n    5.\tMental Health as a Priority:\n\nMental health is considered as important as physical health. Everyone has access to therapists, AI-guided mental health tools, and mindfulness spaces.\n\n    6.\tDecentralized, Community-Based Care:\n\nInstead of large hospitals, healthcare is decentralized into smaller, community-focused wellness hubs. These hubs provide a welcoming, accessible environment for routine care.\n\n    7.\tAI and Human Collaboration:\n\nWhile AI handles diagnostics, routine tasks, and data analysis, human healthcare providers focus on empathy, counseling, and complex decision-making.\n\n    8.\tOpen-Source Medical Research:\n\nAll medical research is open-source and globally shared. Breakthroughs are immediately available to everyone, accelerating innovation and equitable access to treatments.\n\n    9.\tFocus on Longevity and Quality of Life:\n\nHealthcare doesn’t just aim to treat illness but to optimize health. Anti-aging therapies, regenerative medicine, and advanced nutrition science ensure everyone thrives physically and mentally until age 120.\n\n    10.\tEnvironmental Health Integration:\n\nHealthcare integrates environmental factors. Air and water quality sensors, green spaces, and sustainable living practices are part of the health ecosystem.\n\n    11.\tEmpowered Self-Care:\n\nIndividuals are empowered with tools and knowledge to manage their health. AI assistants provide daily guidance, such as reminders to move, hydrate, or rest based on real-time needs.\n\n    12.\tCommunity-Driven Happiness Metrics:\n\nHealthcare isn’t just about physical health—it includes metrics for happiness and life satisfaction. Programs ensure people feel connected, purposeful, and supported in their communities.\n\nHow They Keep Everyone Happy\n\n    1.\tCollective Ownership of Health:\n\nEveryone understands their role in maintaining personal and community health. It’s a shared mission that creates a sense of purpose and pride.\n\n    2.\tReduced Stress:\n\nWith AI automating much of the healthcare process, people don’t worry about navigating complex systems, costs, or insurance. This reduces stress and increases happiness.\n\n    3.\tCommunity Bonds:\n\nDecentralized wellness hubs and regular health events foster a sense of belonging and shared responsibility, strengthening community ties.\n\n    4.\tTransparent Governance:\n\nDecisions about healthcare are transparent and inclusive, ensuring public trust and satisfaction with the system.\n\n    5.\tCelebration of Well-Being:\n\nHealth is celebrated on Planet Z. Milestones like reaching age 60, 90, or 120 are marked with festivals and community gatherings, creating a culture of gratitude and joy.\n\nBy focusing on prevention, embracing AI, and fostering a culture of shared care, Planet Z has created a healthcare system that’s both efficient and deeply human-centered. It’s a system Earth could aspire to emulate—one where everyone is healthy, happy, and thriving. 🌟",

In March 2021, the World Health Organization agreed.

I also have problems taking medicine for it(I’ve tried multiple and they all came with some of the worst side effects). The other day I had to go to one since I haven’t really been eating and now when I try I throw up. So I get to the hospital and it’s okay through the waiting room, but once I got in the room my anxiety started to pick up. It was manageable at first but once the doc came in and told me all the tests they were going to do, I hard panicked. I tried to go outside for a breather and calm myself down, but was stopped and not allowed out. So I got back to my room, my mom calmed me down a bit and the nurse came by to put an IV in. I tried to tell him that I need to go outside first and get some fresh air but he said he wasn’t allowed to let me. So IV goes in, and after about 5 minutes I started to truly freak and ended up taking it out myself and bolted outside. Security found me a few minutes later sitting on the sidewalk, and got me to go in to sign out ama.\nI left and never want to step foot in a hospital again.\n\nSo overall, I am close to genuinely hating hospitals. For a place that exists to help people get better, it feels like a prison and I don’t understand how people are expected to stay sane in such a desolate and stale environment.\n\nNow, I understand I have problems the majority of people don’t and most probably handle it with little issue, but is it not better for just about every patient to be able to get outside and not be stuck in the same room all day?",

      "text": "I understand the nursing care and other inpatient specific things have their cost but the labs, imaging, and procedures take the same amount of effort as if done outpatient. For example, say you have a patient with an isolated tibia fracture from trauma waiting for rehab placement and the primary care provider has already ordered things. Why not draw his IgE allergy test, or do the low dose CT for lung cancer, or screening colonoscopy while inpatient assuming the hospital has the bandwidth. It seems like it would be more efficient for the patient if insurance would cover it especially if the outpatient work was going to be done at the same hospital anyways.  I think this is one of the strengths of the Veterans Affairs hospitals where an admitted inpatient can still have outpatient things done.",

The Affordable Care Act made history by forcing companies to cover prescribed contraceptives, but millions of women are still being forced to foot the bill. This new rule will ensure women don't break the bank just because they need reproductive medicine.\n\n[The White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2024/10/21/fact-sheet-biden-harris-administration-proposes-rule-to-expand-coverage-of-affordable-contraception-under-the-affordable-care-act/)\n\n# Republican narrative\n\nGiven that the Affordable Care Act already subsidizes contraceptives for those who can least afford them, there's absolutely no need to expand this coverage further. Besides the negative economic consequences, there are moral concerns related to forcing companies to cover birth control. Liberal US bureaucrats have to stop forcing their anti-fertility agenda on the rest of America.",

They rely on us to keep them safe, if we did not do our jobs increadibly, kick-assedly well then all of us are gonna have a Real Bad Time. You think it can't happen, but look at history, look at the Ukrain.

Those poor kids who selflessly risk their lives to keep my son safe, my my family safe, your family safe, would come back in need of help from them.\n\nI would remind them that medical care for soldiers is hard. It is not like treeting pediactrics, or a nursing home, or common general practitioner's medicine. The mental, physical, and spiritual injuries we receive are not your gramma's bedsores. If you are going to be a Soldier Dr, not knowing how to treat Soldier wounds, or even recognize them, would be a guaranteed way to cause alot of pain and suffering in this world.\n\nI would remind them that if things went really, really bad, like in Ukrain, it would absolutely be THEM out there in the trenches.

      "title": "Fantastic maternity clinic",
      "text": "I have recently become a father in a level 1 (highest level) maternity hospital here in Germany and it was far(!) below my expectations.\n\nSo I would like to write down my personal idea of ​​an absolutely fantastic maternity clinic. Since everyone has different needs, this is really just my personal idea. I hope that somebody can take this as an opportunity to re-examine and question the current situation in obstetrics.\n\n# Location\n\nThe fantastic maternity clinic is located on the outskirts of a large city next to a shopping center. In the city center, the land would be too expensive to build adequately large rooms, and in the countryside there would be fewer customers, as many pregnant women do not want to risk a long journey.\n\nThe clinic building is in the middle of the site, and borders on three sides by large, ground-level, free parking spaces. Parking garages are impractical because customers do not necessarily want to climb stairs and elevators are too expensive. To prevent parking spaces from appearing dull, trees are planted between the parking spaces. On the fourth side, the clinic borders a public garden with trees, flower meadows, labyrinths, a lot of benches and a pond. At the other end of the garden is a public transport terminus and a shopping center.\n\n# Rooms\n\nThere is no division into a delivery room and a maternity ward. The first few days of the postpartum period are spent in the same room where the natural birth took place.\n\nThere are only single family rooms in the maternity clinic. The expectant mother must have another person move in with her who can look after her non-medically around the clock - usually the father, partner or another family member. If no one is available, a social worker paid for by the health insurance should move in with her.\n\nAll rooms therefore have two fixed, comfortable beds for adults, with space between them for a mobile child's bed. They also have enough space to accommodate another guest bed so that another family member can move in if necessary.\n\nThere is an operating room for every four family rooms, which can be reached directly from the family room via a single door. This room is used if urgent medical measures are required during the birth or if a planned caesarean section is performed. The team in the operating room not only operates on the expectant mothers, but also looks after them and the newborns later in the postpartum period and consists of midwives, nurses and doctors (gynecologist, pediatrician, anesthesiologist).\n\nEach family room has a mini kitchen with a kettle, refrigerator, sterilization machine and microwave. The bathroom has a shower and bathtub for water births and a washing machine.\n\nWhen registering, each customer is given a list of things for the baby that they must bring with them. This includes clothing, burp cloths, diapers, formula milk for possible supplementary feeding, etc. If the customer does not want to use their own things or does not have the money for them, they must state this when registering and the clinic will lend everything to them. The question here is whether the parents-to-be are well prepared for the child, as they would have to have all of these things ready for the time after the birth anyway.\n\nThe customer also has to organize the food themselves, which can be done by the obligatory second person in the family room. Many new mothers want to eat certain special meals after the birth to stimulate milk production and support recovery. For this, you can easily use the delivery services of the restaurants located in the nearby shopping center. Missing clothes, milk bottles, thermometers, diapers, etc. can also be bought in the drugstores there. Here, too, anyone who does not have any money for this or does not want to spend money on it must state this when registering and the typical hospital food will be delivered at the expense of the health insurance.\n\nWhen registering, each customer receives CTG sensors that connect to their cell phone and can be worn at all times. The measurement data is transmitted to the maternity clinic via the cell phone, so that the child can be monitored anywhere: at the customer's home, on the way to the clinic, in her family room, or when she is walking in the garden.\n\n# Care\n\nWhen registering, the customer chooses a treatment team (see above) and thus also one of the four assigned family rooms. The customer also chooses a replacement team in case the team she primarily wants is overbooked on the actual delivery date. Customers have the opportunity to get to know the treatment team personally and view their previous CVs, and statistics are also made available (births per year, complications, percentage of cesarean sections per team, percentage of induction, customer ratings).\n\nHere too, anyone who does not want to or cannot pay for this optional service is assigned a random treatment team free of charge.\n\nThe birth plan is then discussed in detail with the head of the treatment team, both the desired course of events and the desired deviations if something does not go as planned. The birth plan is then strictly adhered to.\n\nA birth is not an illness. Miscarriages, premature births and stillbirths are an exception (must be!). Therefore, the customer is not treated as a patient and obstetric care is not seen as primarily a medical service. Doctors are only in charge when something goes wrong. Otherwise, the customer's wish for a meaningful, shared, private, celebratory experience in the family circle is given priority.\n\nIn particular for a cesarean section it mean the following: the baby is placed skin-to-skin on the mother's breast for bonding with the umbilical cord still attached. The pediatrician watches and examines the child while he is still on the mother. Only if the child is not breathing or other urgent medical measures are required can the pediatrician take the child to their own table in the same room where the parents still can see the child. The health examinations that cannot be carried out during bonding are carried out later. The umbilical cord is only cut after the pulsation has stopped. Blood storage is of course an optional service. The mother can bond with the child throughout the rest of the operation. After that, she is moved with the father to her family room, where bonding continues.\n\nFrom the moment the child returns to the family room and for the next 24 hours, a midwife is permanently on hand. And when I say \"permanently\", I mean it: there is a midwife in the family room at all times (they take turns on every shift change, of course). The midwife regularly puts the child to the breast and shows the parents all the steps: changing diapers, putting on and taking off clothes, interpreting different cries, taking the temperature, keeping a feeding log. The mother is also observed, trained, psychologically cared for, medication is brought and administered. Breastfeeding consultation is also provided by the midwife. If the parents have brought a carrier or a sling with them, consulting on carrying is also provided or various carriers and slings are loaned out. If the mother does not want to breastfeed from the beginning, the midwife regularly brings the warmed bottles of milk. During these 24 hours, the new parents are trained so that they can then do all of these tasks themselves.\n\nOn the second day, the midwife also closely monitors what the parents are doing. For exaple to wake them up if they are sleeping too deeply.\n\nWhen the parents are discharged, they are given advice on how to correctly place the child in the baby car seat.\n\nThe basic idea is that all advice should be given without being asked and the parents shouldn't hesitate to ask more questions, because an expert always has enough time for them.\n\nHaving a permanent midwife on hand could possibly be an optional service.\n\n# Time after discharge\n\nParents should be encouraged to donate clothes that have become too small, unnecessary toys, Montessori mobiles, unnecessary children's furniture, diapers in their original packaging, etc. to the maternity clinic after discharge.\n\nThe easiest way to do this would be if the maternity clinic also had a pediatrician's office and a (preferably Montessori) nursery, so that a positive customer relationship could be maintained even after the birth.\n\n# Financing\n\nI assume that a key question has arisen while reading this: how is this financed and how do we find so many specialists?\n\nFor Germany, my personal answer would be: we should turn the hell away from the idea that our medicine is \"free\". We should start to pay a deductible for our treatment costs, even though we already pay 15% from our income for the health insurance. That way, more money comes into the system, more staff can be hired, and you have more money for technology and services.\n\nFor most people, pregnancy is a once-in-a-lifetime event, and the first child is often the last. In terms of its significance in your biography, this event is comparable to a wedding. In our society, it is common to spend €5,000 to €10,000 on a wedding. Yes, not every couple can afford it, but many can.\n\nI think many families could afford this as a supplementary payment for optional services at birth. That would mean foregoing vacation for three to five years. That would be cheaper than buying a new car. Or it would only be €100 a month if you financed it as a consumer loan for 10 years. And of course the state should make these costs tax deductible.",

Is kaiser that bad??? \n\nI feel like hospitals just want to make that $ rather than care for patients it's frustrating ugh unless doctors are just afraid to getting sued or saying wrong thing im just trying to figure out what is causing the issue.\n\nI have done multiple kind of tests and some tests were retaken multiple times and doctors and specialist still can't figure out what's wrong with me.\n\nRecent experience  \nLast month I had MRI done so they can get neurologist look at the report after that I have been just hearing non stop noises from ears this is just addon to my original issue. So I went to primary doctor and share my concern.\n\nI was just so shocked doctor had to look at symptoms  of Tinnitus it had breakdown on Google like seriously. \n \nI know we are humans end of day we do know know everything my rant is more towards not trying my their part trying to figure out whats going on with patients. Doctors only spends literally 2-5 mins to diagnose while waiting 45-2 hours to see them I feel like hospitals have restrictions on how much time I spent on each patient therefore the doctors doesn't have enough time to actually diagnose the issue.\n\nI work in IT as system administrator not trying to compare computers with human but with some experience I feel like doctors and specialist should know possibilities on what the problem can be. I know human body is more complex however as system administrator we do try to find some clues on computers/servers where we sometimes have to spends hours, days,night, weekends and even holidays to fix issues where things can be normal. \n\nI feel like it's just spending short period of time and having to start all over again causes delays on figuring out the root cause of the problem since there is no priorities setup and it's just time restrictions on seeing the patients therefore the patients doesn't get the care they need.\n\nI thought it was just me. I have friend in Canada who is also going through similar process where it's been 2 years for herself trying to get cure for her health conditions and now sadly the damage was already done for her since the process took so long and symptoms get worses over time without any resolution.\n\nOver the years it thought kaiser is one eco system of patient care therefore things would be easier to diagnose however it's not the case.\n\nI'm curious to get some insight on what's the really issue as far as patient care goes why Doctors can't do anything unless it's ER that's the only way to expedite the process since multiple specialist can work as team of doctors except for doctors living on their own islands \n\nFinal thoughts\n\nWhen covid started entire world worked as team to find cure and there are other diseases that has been there for years that doesn't have cure because of everyone is doing their own thing for sake of $ and big pharmas are to win\n\nI apologize if I find anyone offended just sharing my experience since recently I have gave up the modern medicines that is controlling by big corporations",

Cancer patients often deal with frequent hospital visits, multiple doctors, and a barrage of tests. Keeping track of it all—especially with the medical jargon—is overwhelming, even with a solid support system.\n\n\n\nTo help, I taught her how to drag and drop her latest test results into ChatGPT for better understanding. That led me to build MyChartHelper, a Chrome extension that simplifies this process. With just one click, you can chat with your latest health summary.\n\n\n\nHow it works:\n\n* The extension navigates to your medical document summary, requests it, and refreshes until the data is ready. \n* It then downloads the summary and injects the relevant parts into ChatGPT for easy conversation.\n\nRight now, the tool works with Penn Medicine, but it's easy to adapt for other hospitals by swapping the URL in \\`background.js\\`.\n\nI open-sourced this tool because I believe it could help others in similar situations. I created a GitHub organization called Healthcare Buddy to host this because I believe that there should be a suite of free, easy to use tools for people facing health challenges. The world would be a better place if this existed.\n\nIf anyone would like to contribute to MyChartHelper or start a new project within the org, feel free to reach out.\n\n\n\nAlso, if you know of any similar initiatives, I'd love to hear about them.

I sent a message to my doctor asking if I could get one last prescription sent in while I try to find another practice and they denied my request, saying that I need supervision of a care provider while on my medication and since I wouldn't be at their practice anymore, I wouldn't have that supervision.

Ive now been off my meds for a week to a week and a half and I know what happens when I am off my meds for longer, as it's happened a few times before, and it's not good. My question is what do I do in this situation? Without my meds I WILL become very depressed and suicidal but my old practice seems to be indifferent to this fact.

They called me one day to tell me that appeal was denied as if to blow me off, however, I immediately called UHC to fact check. UHC said no appeal was filed, asked what the case number was. Nada was provided by Practice. When i called them out, they start to become evasive with my calls. They refuse to xfer me over to the nurses that handle PAs and appeals. When I become persistent one of the nurse's admits that there was no denial but stated that they \"assumed there was one because a week had gone by and decision yet from UHC.\" This then makes me more skeptical about their integrity so then - i called UHC back and they agree to perform outreach on my behalf. They follow up with the provider and get hung up on then after trying again they reach one of the nurses, actually the other one is a pharmacy tech i found later, not even a Nurse. Anyhow UHC advocate speaks to her about the appeal & she admits she never filed one and the tech states that she did tell him that she would submit the appeal. Fast forward, two weeks later, no appeal has been filed. Nada. So I call the office to ask what's going on, get the run around and then the \"Chief Administrative Officer\" calls me today to basically tell me what I nuisance I am for calling their staff , making defamatory statements that I called them names, ( I never cursed at anyone, and while I was irritated in my voice, I was NOT out of character much less name calling). So she proceeds to gaslight me by saying that if I had had such a bad experience why not leave and find another PCP, \"Have I thought about that.\" She said furthermore, \"they had done all they could for me, and have documentation.\" Probably referring to the PAs that were denied. Then she says its between me and the insurance company. Anyhow how would you all respond to this. BTW, I need my GLP-1 due to pre-diabetes, I have metabolic syndrome, high cholesterol, obstructive sleep apnea, and obesity. I have tried metformin and it doesn't work. So that is why I am dead set on getting my Zepbound.",

I’ve tried lifestyle changes, kegels, bladder retraining, pelvic floor therapy, etc. When I had Kaiser (HMO all-in-one medical clinics/insurance/pharmacy), I saw a urologist who prescribed me a bladder medication that I couldn’t tolerate due to side effects. Fast forward, I changed to a PPO due to a job change. \n\nI got a new PCP who is really great. He gave me samples of a name brand bladder medication that literally changed my life. I told him they worked and he prescribed them to me. Insurance denied, so he sent a PA. Insurance denied again, saying I need to take a different name brand bladder medication (both are name brand/more expensive than generic medications so I don’t get it) before considering the one I’m on but that my doctor can appeal (I am unable to directly appeal).\n\nSo I call my doctor’s office and they said my doctor doesn’t do appeals in general and I’d have to take it up with my insurance. I told them my insurance said my doctor has to appeal. They reiterated that they won’t appeal. They said they can prescribe me the other medication and then submit paperwork showing that I tried the medication but it’s not an appeal? Will this be enough for my insurance? The medication is $600 out of pocket but $95 with a manufacturer’s coupon. It’s much better than the alternative, but I cannot afford it right now. Any advice would be greatly appreciated!\n\nTLDR; PCP won’t appeal denied auth, insurance says Dr must submit, office will submit paperwork but won’t appeal. Worried nothing will change",

      "title": "Unraveling my cousin’s medical bills feels like a second job—What am I missing?",
      "text": "I’ve spent the past few weeks helping my 36-year-old cousin (F) navigate her medical bills. Turns out, the deeper you dig into “machine-readable” files (which are anything but), obscure codes, and the difference between “in-network” and “out-of-network,” the more you realize this entire setup was never crafted for the patient.\n\nHere’s the gist of what I’ve pieced together so far:\n\n# 1. The Service Codes & Context\n\n* The final cost can swing wildly based on whether something’s listed as inpatient vs. outpatient, or whether the billing code is CPT, DRG, or ICD-10.\n* You’d think these labels would be consistent, but from what I’ve seen, they often aren’t.\n\n# 2. In-Network vs. Out-of-Network\n\n* My cousin has an HMO, meaning referrals are practically the key to life. No referral? No coverage—unless you enjoy surprise bills.\n* Even if a hospital is in-network, certain specialists (like anesthesiologists) can randomly be out-of-network, which is always a fun surprise.\n\n# 3. Negotiated Rates & MRFs\n\n* Insurers post these massive “machine-readable” files detailing negotiated rates, but good luck deciphering them without custom scripts or a background in data parsing.\n* Some providers also have private contract deals that don’t show up in these files, so the numbers aren’t always reliable.\n\n# 4. Deductibles, Co-pays, and Co-insurance\n\n* My cousin’s deductible resets each year. She had a procedure in December and then a follow-up in January—so we got to watch that lovely reset in real time.\n* Then there’s that legendary Out-of-Pocket Maximum which **theoretically** covers everything at 100% once you meet it—but we all know how “theoretically” can turn into “not quite” when claims get re-coded.\n\n# 5. Balance Billing & Surprise Billing\n\n* If you’re out-of-network, the provider might bill you for the difference between their charge and whatever the insurer decides to cover.\n* The No Surprises Act helps in certain emergency scenarios, but let’s just say the system still leaves plenty of room for, well, surprises.\n\n# 6. The Claims Process\n\n* Sometimes insurers “bundle” or recode your procedure differently from how the provider billed it. If you love phone calls and hold music, you’ll enjoy disputing that.\n* Missing a referral or prior authorization can lead to outright denial, which is just great when you’re already overwhelmed.\n\n# Why I’m Posting\n\nAfter untangling my cousin’s bills, I’m tempted to write a guide so other people can see where the potholes are. But I’m sure I’m missing pieces—maybe big ones.\n\nIf you’ve been through this circus, whether it was a $100 lab charge or a $10,000 hospital stay, I’d love to know:\n\n* How did you handle billing “errors” or questionable charges?\n* Did you deal with out-of-network issues that caught you off guard?\n* If you work on the provider or insurance side, what do you wish patients understood better?\n\nAny tips or stories help. I’ll fold whatever I learn into a more comprehensive rundown so maybe we can all spare someone else the headache. Thanks in advance!",

      "title": "AITAH For being furious after daughters RN stepmother repeatedly breached our medical records to influence court cases and still holds a license",
      "text": "Hi everyone! Posting here because I'm at my wits end with the injustice of this and need to know if anyone has experienced something similar.  Last year, my daughters father physically assaulted her during a visitation under the guise of \"parental discipline\" while his wife watched and did nothing. I reported the incident to authorities which prompted charges and opened a criminal court case. These actions made the couple file 7 motions in probate court riddled with false allegations to attempt to hide what occured. While the charges were going through criminal court, his wife testified on his behalf. During her testimony, something she said led me to believe she had been in my daughter's medical records, as she was a nurse at the same hospital. I also work there. I drove immediately to the hospital and requested an audit through patient advocacy. They confirmed my suspicions, that she had been in both of our charts MULTIPLE times in the past year ( that I know of). The hospital seemed to try to keep this on the hush so I contacted the DOJ, AG and the BON myself. Worth mentioning that a year prior, I had reported to the same hospital that she told my daughter her grandmother was admitted and that I was lying to her. She had seen my brother there visiting a friend's mother,  not her grandmother who was NOT in the hospital. This caused my daughter great distress and was clearly an attempt at violating hipaa. They did nothing.   After being a squeaky wheel to the health organization,  I was informed she was at least fired. The BON has at least opened an investigation and I have recieved no updates since, almost a year ago now.  Her nursing license is still active and it's my understanding that the investigation could take years. To say I feel violated would be a massive understatement.  I no longer feel safe to recieve care locally because I have no idea where she could be, aside from the organization I work for. I don't feel as though justice has been served here and that she should no longer be allowed to practice nursing due to her egregious behavior. Not only did she breach our records multiple times, but attempted to sway the court system with this stolen information. I am beside myself. Has anyone experienced something similar? Is there more I could be doing since it seems as though this is being swept under the rug? I'm honestly disgusted at the blatant disregard for our privacy, lack of repercussions or even information regarding the investigation. It seems as though these organizations are more interested in covering this up and ignoring it. Thanks for letting me vent if nothing else lol\n\nUPDATE\n\nI've just sent an email to as many local investigative journalists and news stations that I could find.  I appreciate everyone who has taken the time to follow this. Here is the email;\n\nTo Whom It May Concern,\n\nA registered nurse, ( Her name and license number) in Massachusetts, has repeatedly accessed and exploited private health information, using her professional credentials. These breaches were not accidental but deliberate, with apparent malicious intent—yet shockingly, she has faced no disciplinary action or legal consequences to date.\n\nThis is not only a violation of HIPAA but a deeply disturbing example of how medical authority can be misused with impunity. The public deserves to know how vulnerable their health data is—even from those they are meant to trust the most.\n\nI urge your agency to investigate and expose this case to ensure accountability and prevent future abuses.\n\nUnresolved and Ongoing Issues:\n\nShe used the illegally obtained health data in court to try and manipulate the outcome in her husband's favor.\n\nWe are unable to safely seek medical care locally, as I don’t know where she may be employed next.\n\nThe lack of consequences and transparency makes me feel utterly violated, powerless, and unsafe.\n\nThe Board of Nursing opened an investigation, but I have received no updates in nearly a year. Not only is her nursing license still active, but it was renewed. \n\nI am writing to request your attention and possible assistance in a deeply disturbing case involving HIPAA violations, medical privacy abuse, and the failure of legal and healthcare institutions to protect my daughter and me. Despite doing everything in my power to report, escalate, and provide documented proof, I have been met with silence, delay, and what appears to be a coordinated effort to avoid accountability.\n\nLast year, during a visitation, my daughter was physically assaulted by her father while his wife watched and did nothing. I reported the incident to authorities. Despite clear evidence, local police (relatives and comrades of the father) declined to press charges. I had to file directly with the court, which found sufficient grounds to issue criminal charges. \n\nIn retaliation, the father and his wife filed seven motions in probate court filled with false accusations seemingly designed to obscure what had occurred and discredit me. During court proceedings, his wife — who was employed as a nurse at the same hospital where I also work, testified in his defense. During her testimony, it became clear that she had accessed private medical information about my daughter and me.\n\nI immediately requested a hospital audit through patient advocacy. The audit confirmed multiple unauthorized accesses to both of our medical records over the course of a year. She had no clinical role or justification to access these charts. A year prior, she had also lied to my daughter about a supposed family hospitalization, causing significant distress — another incident based on unauthorized access.\n\nThe hospital initially appeared to minimize the severity of the breach. I had to contact the Department of Justice, the State Attorney General, and the Board of Nursing directly. Only after considerable pressure was I informed that she was terminated from her role.\n\n\nDespite the clear pattern of abuse, privacy violations, and misuse of protected information, it feels as though every system designed to protect patients and families is either unwilling or unable to act.\n\nI am seeking any support, legal guidance, or public exposure you can offer. This is not just a personal injustice — it is a warning about the gaps in our medical privacy protections, the abuse of institutional power, and the weaponization of confidential information in court.\n\nPlease let me know if you’re willing to speak further or connect me to someone who might help amplify this issue. I have full documentation of the audit, court filings, and complaint confirmations if needed.\n\nI greatly appreciate your time and consideration.\n\nSincerely,\n(My contact info)",

      "text": "I read a story of some MAGA people getting involved at a conference in Orlando that they had no business in the first place. It was bc there was a poster outside a conference room advertising “diversity in the cochlea”conference for hearing specialists.  Even though they were not participating in the conference they sure managed to disrupt it and make life hell for the speaker. \n\nSo I wondered if there was another word for diversity that can be used. And I found Heterogeneity. \n\nIf you need to write something that uses the word diversity, Please use the word “Heterogeneity” instead. It means the same thing essentially, but it looks more like hetero- as in heterosexual and therefore acceptable to the MAGA non-reading types. Heterogeneity, the new word to use. Spread it around!",

Their answer: \"We can't tell, it depends on how much the medical provider charges\".\n\nSo I'm at loss. I'm not a US national so not used to how the health system works out here. Isn't there a way to get an estimate? Am I asking the wrong questions?\n\n(Also: I have a high deductible plan and no expenses so far for this year. So whatever the procedure costs, I'll probably pay 100% of it.)\n\nEdit1: just the precision as I've seen this being asked in comments, the provider is in network.\n\nEdit2: thank you all for the responses, this helps a lot.\n\nEdit3: I went back to my insurance, asking again, and telling them they should know as my provider is in network and they have negociated rates with in-network providers. Here was their answer:\n\n>Due to contractual restrictions, we cannot disclose our providers’ rates until a claim has finalized. To know the estimated cost for these services, please contact the provider directly.\n\nSo I'll get back to the provider as most of you advised.",

      "text": "# If you're just starting to face unexpected health issues like I did late 30's — be cautious about relying on One Medical Group. Apparently One Medical's business model is not to support us when we need them the most.\n\nI want to share my experience to caution others who might unexpectedly find themselves needing disability support: **One Medical may not provide the necessary assistance during critical times**.\n\nInitially, I engaged with One Medical for routine care - not anticipating any long-term health issues, and certainly not long-term disability. At One Medical I had an established primary care provider who managed my care, including labs, and prescriptions.\n\nAs my condition rapidly deteriorated, leading to mobility challenges, I then received a diagnosis for a chronic condition, and my health is getting worse day by day, so my specialist recommended applying for **long-term disability**. He provided a comprehensive summary for the SSA and advised that my primary care provider complete the **Residual Functional Capacity (RFC) form**, given her proximity and our established patient-provider relationship.\n\nAt first my primary care agreed to assist, however she **abrutply** **withdrew support without explanation after the SSA deadline,** leaving me without the necessary documentation. I tried reaching out to her and making a video appointment - **she is ignoring my messages in the app and didn't show up for the video appointment.**\n\nI reached out to **One Medical's Medical Director,** but received no response. Follow-up calls only yielded vague assurances that the matter was \"under review,\" with no concrete action taken for weeks.\n\nConsequently:\n\n* I have **no income**, as my temporary disability benefits have ended.\n* My health continues to decline — I’m **bedridden**, rely on a **wheelchair for mobility**, and depend on  **a full-time caregiver**.\n* While I’m waiting for Medicaid to activate, I now have to **start over with a new primary care provider** — someone who doesn’t know my history, who I’ll need to re-explain everything to from scratch.\n* As an **unestablished patient**, I fear they **won’t be willing to complete critical SSA forms**, or that their documentation **won’t carry the same weight** as that of a provider who has treated me over time.\n\nIf you're living with chronic illness or navigating disability — or even if you're just ***starting*** **to face unexpected health issues** like I did **late 30's** — **be cautious about relying on One Medical**. Apparently One Medical's business model is not to support us when we need them the most.",

      "text": "Ok, so, I have a relative who relies on me for their medical expenses. They have health insurance. We're working on getting them disability. Until then I'm paying their copays and office visits which are frequent. Long story short, this person is....unreliable. They are not transparent with me. I cannot trust them.\n\nFor some reason they can't be billed or pay online. Payment has to be rendered at the time of service. We've been doing cash. I want to lock down their spending. I want to insure they spend the money I give them on their healthcare and not something else and I want to limit how much they have available at any given time. \n\nWhat I'm looking for is a prepaid card that can only be spent on healthcare. Something I can reload on a weekly basis and give to them to use for their medical expenses at a variety of locations(usually hospitals). \n\nDoes such a thing exist?\n\nFrom what I've been able to find online it seems like it doesn't but I'd like confirmation from someone more knowledgeable than I. \n\nWhat I don't want: prepaid credit cards that have no restrictions on what they can be used for, medical expense cards that are tied to HSA/FSA accounts, medical flex cards, or regular medical expense credit cards which seem to have no/high spending limits. I don't need them racking up bills like they're trying to get high score. \n\nAny help is much appreciated!",

She needs to be on intravenous antibiotics daily for the rest of her life. \n\nMy dad has healthcare for himself and her through his work. He is 77 and we’d all like for him to be able to retire but he has looked at health insurance options for individuals and has found that he wouldn’t be able to afford a plan that gives the same level of care as the one they have now. And Medicare would require my mom to come to a clinic every single day to get her antibiotic infusions, while their current insurance allows her to do it herself (she has a pick). That would be really hard for both of them because she also has a neurological disorder (similar to Parkinson’s) and isn’t very mobile. \n\nMedicare is meant for elderly people, so one would assume it covers a wide range of severe problems but, even if it could cover what she needs for her neurological issue, it isn’t going to work for her because of the antibiotic problem. \n\nIs there any mechanism for my dad to try negotiating with government Healthcare? Does anyone have experience with something similar?\n\nTL;DR The type of medical issue my mom has means Medicare won’t work for her because of their specific relevant policy. My dad is 77 and still working mostly for the health insurance. Is there any mechanism option to try to negotiate with Medicare?",

She wants to stay in the US so it would mean me moving here.\n\nIf I became a permanent resident of the United States and had an address here; from my understanding I would lose my rights to free NHS healthcare that we have in the UK. I googled this and it would seem the only way I’d be entitled to NHS healthcare would be if I permanently moved back to England. \n\nUnderstanding the US medical care system is all very new to me. Neither of us is high paid (in fact we are both currently unemployed and will be seeking work in our home countries after this month.) but have supportive families. Could someone give me a general idea of what I’d be in for in future with getting medical insurance as a foreign green card holder? If that was the route we decided to go down. \n\nThe other option of course would be for her to move to the UK with me if we married but would like to consider all possibilities as we do both like it here in California and she is close to her family. \n\nThanks",

Did you move to another industry, or stay in healthcare? If you stayed in healthcare, what department did you move to? Do you find it to be a better environment than you left, or about the same?

      "title": "Navigating Medical Claim Denials: How Denial Management Services Can Help",
      "text": "https://preview.redd.it/8hbvzzxdlnoe1.png?width=1200&format=png&auto=webp&s=c2d0c006d3e5c7784dd599d408af754daa04f60b\n\nNavigating the American healthcare system can feel like traversing a minefield, especially when you’re already vulnerable and seeking treatment. One of the most frustrating and disheartening experiences is dealing with medical claim denials. When a legitimate claim is denied by an insurance company, patients are often left feeling confused and financially burdened. Why does this happen, and what can be done about it?\n\nThe reality is that while insurance companies play a role in managing healthcare costs, the system is fraught with complexities, profit-driven decisions, and bureaucratic hurdles that lead to frequent denials. Medical billing services and medical coding solutions can help mitigate these challenges and ensure proper reimbursement. Let’s explore the key reasons behind medical claim denials and how a reliable medical billing company can help.\n\n# 1. Profit-Driven Decision Making\n\nInsurance companies are businesses aiming to maximize profits. Their stringent claim approval criteria often result in unnecessary denials, leaving patients and providers struggling to secure rightful reimbursements.\n\n* **Algorithms and Automated Systems:** Many insurers use automated review systems that may rigidly deny claims based on preset criteria, even when the treatment is medically necessary.\n* **Prior Authorization Hurdles:** Prior authorization requirements often create roadblocks when insurers impose guidelines that don’t align with updated medical evidence.\n* **Downcoding and Denials:** Insurance companies may downcode claims — assigning a lower-level code than what was performed — to minimize payouts, leading to financial losses for providers and patients.\n\n# 2. Complexity and Bureaucracy\n\nThe healthcare system is layered with regulations, codes, and documentation requirements that create opportunities for errors and claim denials.\n\n* **Coding Errors:** Medical coding solutions are essential in preventing human errors that can trigger claim rejections. Even minor discrepancies in coding can lead to denials.\n* **Documentation Issues:** Insurance companies demand comprehensive documentation to support claims. Missing or incomplete documentation can lead to claim denials, even when the treatment was medically necessary.\n* **Lack of Transparency:** Patients and providers often struggle to understand why claims are denied, making it difficult to appeal successfully.\n\n# 3. The Human Factor in Claim Denials\n\nDespite automation, human bias and operational inefficiencies also contribute to claim denials.\n\n* **Insufficient Staffing and Training:** Undertrained claims reviewers may rush through claims, increasing the chances of wrongful denials.\n* **Subjective Interpretations:** Different claims reviewers may interpret medical necessity guidelines differently, leading to inconsistencies in approvals.\n* **Bias and Discrimination:** Implicit biases can sometimes influence claim denials, disproportionately affecting marginalized communities.\n\n# 4. The Patient’s Role in Managing Claims\n\nWhile insurance companies bear responsibility for denials, patients can take proactive steps to improve claim outcomes.\n\n* **Understanding Insurance Coverage:** Many patients are unaware of their policy limitations, leading to unexpected denials.\n* **Appealing Denied Claims:** Patients often forgo appealing denials, assuming they have no recourse. Knowing the appeals process is essential.\n* **Effective Communication:** Clear communication between patients, healthcare providers, and insurers can prevent misunderstandings that lead to claim denials.\n\n# How Allzone Medical Billing Can Help\n\nIn this complex and frustrating landscape, Allzone Medical Billing offers expert denial management services to help medical practices secure rightful reimbursements. As a trusted medical billing company, we ensure accuracy, transparency, and advocacy in claim processing.\n\n**Human-Centric Precision**\n\nUnlike firms that rely solely on automated systems, Allzone Medical Billing prioritizes human expertise. Our team of certified specialists deeply understands medical billing services, coding guidelines, and insurance policies. This knowledge helps us rectify errors before they lead to denials.\n\n**Transparency and Advocacy**\n\nWe operate with complete transparency, providing clear explanations of claim statuses. Our team fights tirelessly to appeal denied claims and recover the reimbursements our clients deserve.\n\n**Proactive Prevention**\n\nRather than reacting to claim denials, Allzone focuses on prevention through accurate coding, thorough documentation, and meticulous claim preparation. Continuous education and training ensure our team stays ahead of industry changes.\n\nSpecialized Expertise\n\nWe offer medical coding solutions tailored to various specialties, ensuring increased claim acceptance rates. Our expertise spans multiple medical fields, helping providers navigate the complexities of billing and reimbursement.\n\n# What Can You Do?\n\nWhile the system has flaws, you can take steps to improve your chances of claim approval:\n\n* Review your insurance policy to understand coverage limitations.\n* Ensure that documentation and coding are accurate.\n* Appeal denied claims instead of accepting them as final.\n* Work with a professional medical billing company like Allzone to handle billing and denial management efficiently.\n\n# Conclusion\n\nThe fight for fair healthcare access is ongoing. By understanding the causes of medical claim denials and partnering with experts in denial management services, patients and providers can navigate the system more effectively. Allzone Medical Billing stands as a reliable partner in this journey, ensuring that legitimate claims are processed accurately and paid promptly.

      "text": "(Disclaimer, the following is not intended as a complaint against Kaiser and, in my experience, it is the same with all of the healthcare providers and their in-house medical insurance.)\n\nI live in California. I have Kaiser. I pay Kaiser a monthly premium for medical insurance. When I need medical care, I go to Kaiser to get it. \n\nI pay Kaiser a copay for each visit, I pay for the medication, I pay a copay for follow-ups and anything else that i might need such as x-ray, MRI, surgery, etc.\n\nIf I didn't pay Kaiser the monthly premium (and obviously accept their plan's deductible) then when it came time to seek medical care, all of these costs would be what?  Quadrupled?  worse?  \n\nA single visit to the ER for my wife while we were not insured a few years ago yielded a bill of over $15,000.  This did not include the cost of the ambulance which is another issue.  During that visit she was given an IV for hydration, and she had a pulse meter/oxygen meter clamped to her finger, and she occupied a bed for 9 hours. She never saw a doctor, but the bill paperwork shows charges from more than one doctor. Ultimately they prescribed something which we could not afford to purchase and they sent her home.   \n\nThis is what happens when you don't purchase \"medical insurance\".  It's brutal.  Pay us money every month or we will charge you silly, absurd, criminal amounts of money when you really need us.\n\nIf anyone has an explanation of how this happens and why it's not illegal for the healthcare provider to also be the insurance provider, I would really appreciate your help.  I'm sure I seem a bit upset but I am not unreasonable. I would like to understand.\n\nThank you in advance.",

He is unemployed at the moment because his medical conditions prevent him from doing so. He desperately needs medical care, and we have not been successful in getting him Colorado's Medicaid program (Health First Colorado). We have submitted all the necessary documents for his application and it has been left unprocessed for 6 months now. We've called numerous times and every call has been unproductive. They say that processing has been slow recently because they are still dealing with the consequences of the pandemic, but I feel that this long of a wait is ridiculous.\n\nFor reference I am 19 y/o and studying comp sci at my university. My family is lower middle class and certainly cannot pay any medical expenses out of pocket. I was considering starting a go fund me for my dad, but I'm not sure how effective that would be. I just don't know what to do, and I am looking for anything that can help my dad or his situation. Any resources would be greatly appreciated. Again I apologize if this isn't the right place to post this. I'm feeling very powerless and desperate at the moment.",

Based on that, they reclassified the visit, but at no point did the doctor or nurse inform me that this would change the billing type.\n\nI’ve contacted both Sharp and BlueShield, but neither is willing to make any adjustments. Sharp did offer a 20% discount, but I don’t think I should pay anything for something I wasn’t made aware of. What are my options at this point?",

While fasting, particularly Intermittent Fasting (IF) and Time-Restricted Feeding (TRF), has gained popularity, recent studies suggest that the benefits might be overhyped. For instance, skipping meals or eating within compressed windows might increase the risk of premature death and negatively impact our metabolism.\n\nThis has made me reconsider my approach to eating.

      "text": "The prevalence of misbranded and adulterated products in the US dietary supplements (DS) market poses significant health risks to consumers. This review article aims to assess the severity of this issue by analyzing recent data, highlighting the need for enhanced regulations to ensure patient safety. Studies (N=174, Mostly Purchased ONLINE) have shown that approximately 36.6% ± 26.1 (%Mean ± SD) of dietary supplements are adulterated, and 57.5% ± 21.4 (%Mean ± SD) are misbranded. Unwanted ingredients, such as active substances like sildenafil and steroids, have been identified in supplements despite existing monitoring efforts. These ingredients, often found in energy-boosting supplements, contribute to significant health risks. However, there have been positive developments in regulatory oversight by the US FDA, including actively monitoring and analyzing supplements in the market and issuing warning letters to manufacturers based on their findings. These actions reflect a proactive approach to addressing the issue, enhancing consumer safety and confidence in the supplement industry. The findings emphasize the importance of improving surveillance and enforcement measures to protect public health better and ensure only safe products reach the market. The review of misbranded and adulterated US data supplements highlights a significant gap in existing research, emphasizing the need for further large-scale investigation. Comprehensive studies are essential to understand the scope of the issue, enhance consumer safety, and ensure the integrity of data supplement products in the market. Customers of DS can also play a significant role in stopping the promotion of misbranded products by checking information and buying products manufactured in Current Good Manufacturing Practice (cGMP) facilities.

I’d like to share my knowledge with you and briefly explain the basic concepts behind GABA.\n\nI am involved in scientific research, and while writing my Master’s thesis, I spent a lot of time researching and reading scientific papers on this topic. \n\nGABA is an important neurotransmitter in your brain that helps calm your mind, reduce stress, and promote restful sleep. But here’s something you might not know: your gut health plays a significant role in how well GABA works.\n\nCertain gut bacteria, like Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium, help produce GABA, which can improve both mood and sleep quality. Eating probiotic rich foods like yogurt, kimchi, and kefir can support these bacteria, while too much caffeine, alcohol, or irregular sleep patterns can negatively impact GABA’s effectiveness.\n\nYour circadian rhythm—your body’s internal clock—also impacts GABA. Disruptions like inconsistent sleep schedules or exposure to blue light at night can reduce the production of GABA and interfere with relaxation and sleep.\n\nIf you want to optimize GABA, focus on a healthy diet, regular sleep patterns, and reducing stimulants like caffeine. It’s a practical way to support your mental health and overall wellbeing.",

But I’m curious—why do some people seem resistant to adopting healthier habits, even when others say they start to feel better pretty quickly after making those changes?\n\nIs there a deeper nutritional or physiological reason that makes it harder for some people to initiate or sustain change? Could things like nutrient deficiencies be affecting mood, motivation, or energy levels?\n\nI feel like there’s something I’m missing when it comes to why some people really do push through and make progress over time, while others seem to give up and attribute it mainly to genetics or external factors.\n\nWould love to hear thoughts—especially from people who know the science behind this.",

Analyzing data from a nationally representative health survey, researchers discovered that participants who consumed more omega-3 fats scored higher on cognitive tests. The findings suggest that incorporating omega-3-rich foods like fish and certain plant oils into the diet could support cognitive health as people age.",

      "text": "Hi folks,\n\nFor some years now, my parents have been really invested in their health. This is an objectively pretty good thing; they're in decent shape for mid-late-60s and part of that is because they're really interested in looking after themselves. They were ahead of the curve on avoiding Teflon etc so often can be right about stuff.\n\nHowever, in recent years, they've really started to go holistically 'anti-Western'. They read a lot of stuff by guys like Mercola and Gundry, and come up with really soundbitey, absolutist comments like 'don't eat legumes' and 'seed oils make sun give you cancer, not the sun'. Whilst relatively harmless in statement, they're starting to eat really dogmatically. Hardly anything but soup, cutting A-Z out of their diet - whilst still drinking a lot, spending a lot of time in the sun without sunscreen. In short, there's a lot of inconsistency and contradiction. \n\n  \nI don't want to tell them what to do. However, I would like them to be able to think and read more critically - even on a quick scan through one of Mercola's recent books, I see that there's no footnotes, no bibliography, rather a tonne of anecdotes (similarly with Gundry). They get a lot of information off of Facebook. Whilst I'm not an academic, I did learn to critique provenance during university, and would love them to work with the same skill - I think it's helped me a lot over the years. A quick Google of Mercola, for example, showed me an atmospheric net worth and a line of supplements which he coincidentally also recommends in his books. The organic supplement companies they espouse are owned by the same pharmaceutical executives they deplore e.g. dr. organic. \n\nThey're a bit anti-academic though (as lots of boomers are these days). Does anyone have any recommendations for books/podcats/documentaries on:\n\n1) Critiquing sources/weaponised information\n\n2) Diet, in particular, which sources academic material \n\n3) The value of academic research \n\nI know that's a broad net to cast. Any help would be really appreciated.\n\nThanks folks",

      "text": "Hey r/nutrition,\n\nI'm looking for some information related to dosages and multi vitamin, more specifically on a multivitamin called **Maxi Health Supreme**. I came across it while searching for a comprehensive multi, and the ingredient list is honestly unlike anything I've seen before. It seems to include *everything* (vitamins, minerals, trace minerals, plus extras like bioflavonoids, CoQ10, betaine, etc.).\n\nWhat's making me a bit hesitant (and also curious) is that I don't usually see multivitamins with such a long and \"complete\" list of ingredients. Most others seem much more streamlined. This makes me wonder a few things:\n\n* **Is Maxi Health Supreme actually a** ***good*** **product?** Never heard about the company...\n* **Why is the ingredient list so much more extensive than other multivitamins?** Is this a sign of a higher quality product, or could it be overkill and potentially unnecessary (or even less effective)?\n* **Is it safe to take a multivitamin with such high doses of certain nutrients?** Looking at the % Daily Values, some vitamins are way over 100%, even at the lower 2-tablet dose. (For example, Vitamin B1 is at 8333% DV at the 6-tablet dose!).\n\nI'm trying to understand if this \"kitchen sink\" approach to multivitamin formulation is beneficial, or if it's just marketing hype. Any insights, experiences, or knowledge about \"super-complete\" multivitamins would be greatly appreciated!\n\nThanks in advance for your help!",

      "text": "I've been researching nutritional psychiatry (i.e., the gut-brain connection) lately, basically trying to get a better understanding of the idea that what you eat has an impact on how you feel.\n\nBecause its a fairly new area of study, this concept is not applied in most  nutrition/food logging apps from what I can tell. I'm curious if anyone here has found good ways to monitor these connections? If so, did you find it beneficial?\n\nMost mainstream food tracking apps:\n\n* focus primarily on weight management/calories rather than mental wellbeing\n* don't connect food logs with mood/energy/focus tracking\n* rarely identify patterns between specific nutrients and mental states\n\nThe closest app I could find that incorporates the behavioral aspect was Noom. While Noom applies psychological principles to change eating behaviors primarily for weight loss, it differs from nutritional psychiatry which emphasizes specific nutrients that support brain function / neurotransmitter production, inflammation, and how the gut microbiome directly influences mood and cognition.\n\nFor those interested in nutritional psychiatry:\n\n* Have you found any good tools or methods for tracking the food-mood connection?\n* Which mental health metrics do you think would be most valuable to track alongside nutrition?\n\nHere's some more information regarding this topic:\n\n* [https://www.psychiatrictimes.com/view/nutritional-psychiatry-gut-brain-connection](https://www.psychiatrictimes.com/view/nutritional-psychiatry-gut-brain-connection)\n* [https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/nutritional-psychiatry-your-brain-on-food-201511168626](https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/nutritional-psychiatry-your-brain-on-food-201511168626)\n* [https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/nutrition/articles/10.3389/fnut.2024.1337889/full](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/nutrition/articles/10.3389/fnut.2024.1337889/full)",

      "text": "Beyond Isolate vanilla protein powder is one example of what I'm talking about. The manufacturer advertises advantages including being free from band substances, antibiotic free, and of course zero grams of sugar. \n\nLooking at the ingredient list it has whey protein isolate for 90% of the product. The non-medicinal ingredients includes stevia, sucralose and then natural and artificial flavors including maltodextrin, citric acid and sodium citrate. \n\nApparently, maltodextrin can Spike blood sugar and also irritate the gut, potentially impacting permeability. Some reports seems to suggest you should avoid it. However I've also read that the amount you would find in a couple of scoops of protein powder is negligible.\n\nDoes anyone have any insight?",

I haven’t been counting calories and just have been enjoying eating whatever my mum makes and having more snacks. I’ve also been moving less too, the thing is I didn’t really notice any weight gain and the scale was pretty much the same up until 3 days ago.\n\nI had a migraine and spent the last two days just sleeping and taking medicine like ibuprofen and cocodamol. When I woke up today it felt as if all the food I’ve been eating caught up to me and my face and body looked much softer and fatter, I was also about 2-3kg heavier than normal. I don’t know if I’m coping or what but how likely is it that I’ve genuinely just gained all this fat at once or Its mainly due to water retention?",

Now he’s suggesting I do monthly appointments for the next six months at $300 each (so $1,800 total), plus purchase various supplements from his office. (To be fair, I checked online and they’re basically the same price elsewhere.)\n\nHe’s also suggesting IV vitamins/supplements, saying I might need 10-20 treatments. I’m honestly a bit overwhelmed by the cost—I can only imagine how much more it’ll add up if I go for all the IV treatments.\n\nI’m torn because I appreciate the thoroughness of his assessment, and I do want to address any underlying issues my test results might be pointing to. But I can’t help feeling like this might be excessive. The monthly appointments alone are a big expense, and then there’s the pressure of deciding whether to do these IV infusions.\n\nHas anyone gone through a similar protocol or done the BodyBio fatty acid test? Is the recommended treatment plan (multiple appointments, supplements, and IVs) common, or does this feel like overkill? If you’ve had success with this kind of approach, I’d love to hear your story. And if you decided to skip it, I’d love to hear that too. Any advice or shared experiences would be really appreciated!",

Two people can eat exactly the same foods yet have completely different outcomes in terms of energy, digestion, or body composition.\n\nI started working with JM Nutrition, a group of registered nutritionists here in Canada, to understand why, in my case, certain meal plans didn't produce the same results I saw in others. It was eye-opening to discover that factors like digestive health, food combinations, stress levels, and even medical history can greatly influence how the body processes and utilizes nutrients.\n\nOne concrete example I experienced was with protein intake. After making a few diet adjustments recommended by them, my digestion and muscle recovery improved noticeably, even though the total amount of protein stayed the same. The difference came from how I combined the foods and the timing of when I consumed them.\n\nI think it's worth paying more attention not just to what we eat, but also to how and how well the body uses it.",

      "text": "So basically I came across the fact that human muscles are only 22% protein,rest is water, glucose and other stuff. \nThis got me curious 🤨.\n I intake 100gm of protein a day, assuming all of it is absorbed by my body and most of it is going in repairing and building muscles, I'd be putting on at least 500 gms of lean muscle every day which is clearly not the case. \nSo either of two things is the case: \n1) It actually takes much more protein than 100 gm to make 500 gm of muscle, i.e. the conversion isn't proportional to 1:5.\n2) Or, my body just doesn't need 100 gms of protein a day and isn't absorbing most of it.\n\nNow this might be a dumb question as I have no idea about the biology being this stuff, but the math isn't adding up.\nPls help.",

How beneficial is this in improving SPI protein quality for muscle synthesis. The product adds 3g of leucine and this supposedly improve the amino acid profile of SPI. The logic seems to add up but I am curious if this makes a good source compare to whey protein WPC/WPI.\n\n2. Whether in food industry it is acceptable to not call this as \"amino spiking\" that is synonymous with scamming protein amount per serving due to higher nitrogen content. \n\nIf the product is transparent of its purpose but uses protein content per serving without deducting the added leucine; is it considered amino spiking? Is all \"amino spiking\" bad? Should the company revise their labels, marketing and change the protein content advertised? \n\nI am more inclined to say it's okay but perhaps people from the nutrition field can describe it better or have specific opinions.\n\nThis is not a post seeking professional medical advice.",

      "text": "I know when the 2023 study about erythritol (and later xylitol) was released, many people were pointing out flaws in its methodology and conclusions, but if I recall correctly a follow up (by the same researcher?) still came to the conclusion that dietary erythritol makes platelets more prone to clotting, and I didn't find any newer study that refuted this claim so far.\n\nOf course they aren't outright blood-clotting poisons as many people have been consuming those for years without developing medical events, but if they indeed increase one's statistical chance for cardiovascular events two-fold or so, it is a serious concern.\n\nI heard about allulose a couple of years ago, and I found this recent study (on mice) that actually put it favorably against erythritol in the clotting and thrombosis aspect: https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11678832/\n\nIs it fundamentally different chemically and metabolically from erythritol and xylitol? Or are there other angles to study allulose from which in time could reveal similar health issues?",

Wrap your mind around that.\n\nVitamin B1 - also known as thiamine, is found in green, leafy plants. Synthetic Bl is made from hydrochloric acid, acetone, ammonia, and coal tar to form thiamine hydrochloride or thiamine mononitrate.\n\nVitamin B2 - is found in whole grains, almonds, eggs and green leafy veggies.

Is a major component in plant based diet like Olive oil, Peanut oil, Sesame oil etc. So the people who don't like SFAs and advocate to limit SFAs are ok with it.\n\nOn the other hand, it doesn't have the concern of contributing to inflammation, is more stable and less prone to oxidation than Linoleic Acid, doesn't cause imbalance of Omega 6:3 ratio like seed oils, and is a major component in animal based diets. So even this community is ok with Oleic acid.\n\nTherefore it seems to me that Oleic acid, from either perspective is safe and benefecial.\n\nMy question is, are there any downsides or concerns with using only Oleic acid in diet with near zero SFAs and minimal PUFAs like 4g of Linoelic Acid and 2.5g of ALA per day consumed in the form of whole food seeds(soaked and steamed Peanuts, Sesame seeds and Flax seeds)?\n\nIs this safe?

      "title": "Is \"free sugars\" a scientific concept?",
      "text": "Recently I keep wondering about the concept of \"free sugars\". The idea is that this is a more useful category than \"added sugars\" because it includes the sugar in honey, fruit juice, etc - but not the sugar in whole fruit.\n\nWhat I can't work out is whether this is an objective, measurable difference, or just a rule of thumb. Some websites say things like \"When fruit is turned into fruit juice, the sugars come out of their cells and become free sugars\" - but surely that happens anyway, when you chew.\n\nCan anyone tell me if there's some lab test which distinguishes the effect of the sugar when you drink orange juice from the sugar when you eat an orange? What do dates and raisins count as?",

I dont know when to have what. \n\nOther more general arguments are, \n\n-During the day, particularly days we are busy with tasks, we are in more of a sympathetic mode which is not a conducive state to be in to digest large amounts of food (big meals/harder to digest foods). So avoid large meals and eat/snack light until the evening where you can shift into more of a parasympathetic mode more conducive to ‘resting and digesting’ larger meals\n\nOR\n\n-large meals in the evening negatively affect sleep and so consume larger meals earlier in the day when our digestion ton is stronger and more efficient (ie. more gastic acid secretion, better nutrient partitioning) and our insulin sensitivity is higher. The whole ‘breakfast like a king, lunch like a prince and dinner like a pauper’ idea.\n\nAny thoughts?",

The issue? Every supplier I talk to offers only coated versions—apparently, uncoated is uncommon due to standard practices for scratch prevention and safety.\n\n\n\nI’m specifically looking for non-coated tins since they’ll be used to store supplements and medications. The coating isn't necessary for us, and the preference for plain, untreated stainless steel stands firm.\n\n\n\nIf anyone knows a source or supplier that could help, I’d be super grateful! Here are some keywords I’ve tried without much success: small round tin can, metal tin box, cosmetic cream container, etc.\n\n\n\nWould love to hear any recommendations, especially from anyone who’s sourced uncoated tins before!\n\n\n\nThanks so much in advance!

      "text": "I've been looking at information about food supplements and magnesium comes up frequently.  \n\nWhen I looked at the recommended daily amount (RDA) for an adult male it says 270 to 400 mg.  Then you look at the very best sources of magnesium like spinach at 157mg per cup of boiled spinach, pumpkin seeds at 168mg/oz, chia seeds at 96mg/oz, and black beans at 120mg/cup .  Most other good sources are providing far less magnesium per serving so you'd have to eat many servings to reach the RDA.\n\nAnd even if you do eat 2 cups of boiled spinach does it deliver over 300mg of magnesium to your body or does it depend on what else you're eating?  That is are those amounts maximums and realistically you get less?  Or do the RDA amounts we see already include some average absorption rate for average diets?\n\nEither way I feel like most people do not go out of their way to eat high magnesium containing foods and with most other foods containing not much magnesium per serving it seems like most people are not going to get anything like these RDA quantities on average. \n\nBut would we even know since as best I can tell normal blood panels doctors order don't include magnesium - mine never have.  Is there a reason for that or do doctors just assume it's not a problem in the general population?",

Primary goals are to decrease ingestion of unhealthy foods, sedentary lifestyle, and the presence of poor sleep habits.\n- Eventually set up a private practice targeting these areas: physical activity, healthy eating, and other healthy daily habits that allow individuals to live longer, healthier lives.\n- How ABA May Play a Role: Self-Monitoring and Reinforcement (as well as antecedent strategies to prevent problem eating and other unhealthy behaviors from occurring in the first place). Differential Reinforcement may be helpful in this case as well.\n- Future Actionable Items: Eventually, meet over Zoom to talk about plans to use behavioral principles to increase healthy eating and exercise (and other) behaviors. Goal to set up a Telehealth Practice in the future.\n- Question: Does anyone know about potential certifications or additional education that may be needed to specialize in this area (use behavioral principles to increase health behaviors: exercise, eating, sleeping, and self-care)?\n- \nPlease reach out (send a message) if this is something you may want to collaborate on in the future as a career path.\n\nDo not necessarily need to be in close physical proximity (can use Telehealth and Zoom) but must reside within the US.\n\nThank you!",

Fully read any response you receive from a mod, including automoderator, before messaging for an appeal.***\n\n**1) [reddiquette](https://www.reddithelp.com/hc/en-us/articles/205926439) is required** - Avoid flame wars and vote complaining. Trolling, insults, brigading, or antagonism towards the subreddit participants, the moderators, or even the community itself may also result in a ban. Instead of bashing, share sources, citations, and studies, as well as accept when your positions are going to differ. Walk away if something angers you.\n\n**2) No dietary activism for or against any diet** - Diet wars are NOT welcome here. Crusading is usually off topic and often intended to be inflammatory. Participants in this subreddit have a variety of dietary requirements, beliefs, body types, and goals. Being a diet fan is fine.  Being a jerk fan or jerk anti-fan of a diet is not okay and will result in a ban.  **DO NOT**;\n\n* **engage disrespectfully towards other diets/beliefs** - Be informative without being rude. Talk TO them, not ABOUT the other person / group,\n* **engage in diet or food shaming** \n* **downvote due to someone's diet preference**\n* **promote or argue ethics and morals** \n* **promote diet absolutism** - no diet is the *only* healthy one.  You CAN say \"this is best for me\" and explain why and what it emphasizes\n* **make specious cure claims** - chronic disease cure claims are not allowed.  Saying it \"can control the symptoms of\" is fine if that is the case\n* **engage in pitchforking or brigading** - avoid doing it to this or any other subreddit or the posts therein\n* **bias whine** - is not helpful. \"I'm downvoted because I eat (name diet)\" is just shit stirring and trying to play martyr\n* **excessively advertise a diet based subreddit** - talk about your favorite diet but only advertise the sub for it in no more than 1/10 of your activity\n\n**3) No all science rejection or 'all science is a conspiracy' claims** - whole science rejectionist type of engagement is not grounded in reality or facts and therefore is not allowed. Conspiracy, bias, and funding complaints need to provide sources addressing the *specifics* of a situation being discussed rather than barfing up all encompassing unsubstantiated generalizations, hyperbole, and 'everybody knows' kinds of statements, none of which are grounded in science. Refer to [the announcement post about this rule](https://redd.it/pcrwjw) for more info.\n\n**4) No requesting or providing medical concern advice** - these problem posts involve discussion of a disease, condition, pain, diagnosis, procedure, test, recovery, consultation with a health professional, or lab value.  You can ask how nutrition impacts humans in general but you may not ask for advice about treating or managing a medical conditions or how a nutritional choice would impact your specific medial condition (or a family member).  *All medical questions should be directed to a physician, dietitian, or other qualified and licensed health care provider who has access to your personal medical records.* It is dangerous to solicit medical advice on an internet forum. It is also illegal in most cases and against health care codes of ethics for users to provide it to you in this forum.\n\n**5) No personalized nutrition inquiry posts. Instead ask in the comments section of the** **[/r/Nutrition weekly Personal Nutrition Discussion sticky post](https://www.reddit.com/r/nutrition/about/sticky?num=2)** - If your post contains *ANY* personal context (it pertains to you, your diet, your family member(s) or anyone within your sphere) and/or a diet evaluation request (something you or someone in your life ate, are eating, or thinking about consuming), *it will be removed*, no exceptions. **Trying to end run this rule, pretending it is unclear, or making any kind of baseless, false, disingenuous, or entitlement based appeals will result in a ban.**\n\n**6) No blogspam and/or self-promotion** - Any form of linking, referencing, or mentioning of things you are affiliated with will be removed and likely result in a ban. This applies to your sites, videos, media channels, books, articles, surveys, etc.  The sub is here to talk about nutrition science, not what you've created. Do not try to use the sub to drive traffic to something you are involved with, even if it is free.  IRB approved surveys may be approved if a request is sent to the moderators.\n\n**7) All links must be direct links** - The reddit site filter removes uses of link shorteners.  Use a direct URL instead. Submissions of links using link tracking services will lead to an instant ban.\n\n**8) No posts from brand new accounts and negative karma accounts** - Brand new accounts may not make new posts in this subreddit.  However, you can comment on other posts while you get to know the site and subreddit. Negative karma accounts cannot post or comment here.\n\n\n# Suggestions\n\nThese suggestions are offered to improve your experience in the subreddit.\n\n* Refrain from a \"once-size-fits-all\" stance regarding nutrition.  Accept that there are other approaches which you may not agree with, other body types, and a variety of goals and circumstances.\n\n* Include proper, relevant, and useful information when asking or answering questions.  Provide links to studies, articles, research, papers, etc. when offering your viewpoint.  Need to find the evidence? Check out [**PubMed**](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/) or [**Google Scholar**](http://www.scholar.google.com).  \n\n* It may be FAQ. If you have a question, [**search**](http://www.reddit.com/help/search) before you post or take a look at this [**FAQ**](https://www.reddit.com/r/nutrition/wiki/faq#/c/purple/) wiki page\n\n* Report posts and comments which violate site or subreddit rules. Don’t report comments and posts over disagreement. It is a waste of your time since it achieves nothing and it puts your account at risk since report abuse is a site infraction.\n\n\n# User Flair\n\nYou can set your user flair to indicate your level of nutrition expertise/education. Do not select a user flair you are not qualified for. Anyone who is not able to verify their user flair status when asked to do so may be banned.\n\n---\n\n# Moderators Needed\n\nThis sub continues to rapidly grow, therefore so does our need to expand the moderation team. We are looking to add several experienced Reddit users who have a passion for nutrition and a desire to help curate [/r/nutrition](https://www.reddit.com/r/nutrition) as a collegial space for informative nutrition discussions.\n\nHere is what we are looking for from applicants. Please send applications to [modmail](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=/r/nutrition).\n\n1. Candidates should have a strong history of **positive** contributions to [/r/nutrition](https://www.reddit.com/r/nutrition). Please send us several direct links to comments from your account history to substantiate this.\n2. We are looking for mods of all backgrounds, but particularly for RDNs or others with formal academic training in nutrition. Please tell us about your educational background and your current field of work.\n3. Modding experience on Reddit is great, but not required. Ditto for having a little coding experience. Let us know whether you mod any other subs and if you have any relevant experience like moderating other forums/pages, using back-end web tools, etc.\n4. Mods need to be frequent Reddit users. The ideal mod is someone who pops into Reddit multiple times per day, can devote some time to addressing moderator issues when logging on, and foresees continuing to do so in the future.\n5. You should be a team player who is on board with following processes and procedures including using communications channels so that we stay on the same page and present a united and consistent front that prioritizes [r/nutrition](https://www.reddit.com/r/nutrition) and its core users.\n6. You should be someone who is comfortable enforcing rules and able to handle receiving harsh/critical feedback from strangers on the internet without breaking down, losing your temper, or giving in.\n\nIf you are interested in applying, please [message the moderators](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=/r/nutrition) with *a note which addresses all the points above (please use numbering)*. Do not leave your application as a comment here.\n\n---\n\nAs always, the moderation team is open to your thoughts and ideas on the subreddit.  To do so [**send a modmail message the moderators**](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Fnutrition).",

So i’m curious to hear about others too, what’s the food u were forced to eat as a kid and still refuse as an adult?",

      "text": "Has anyone here tried the food from this meal prep place? I just started eating their prepped meals, and holy moly their buffin muffins are just incredible. They market themselves as a place serving food with clean, whole ingredients. At first glance the macros all look pretty good. Almost too good.\n\nI got my hands on the latest flavor buffin muffin “darc sport.” It’s 380 calories but I thought it was strange how the ingredients list Oreo and chips ahoy crumbles, but 0g added sugar. I’ve since been looking more closely at their labeling, and it just seems really vague. Like sometimes it just says “heavy cream,” and many of the buffins contain “wafers” or a “proprietary brownie blend.” You can look more at the different flavors and ingredients here: https://myhummusfit.com/products/darc-vip?utm_source=Klaviyo&utm_medium=flow&utm_campaign=Back+in+Stock+%28SMS%29&_kx=rgNeYpPthig11Aud1DdE0HaQkWJZaS6yo5ssWM9m0u8oHaMOTfUWGokNrF2mWKLi.T2JSVx\n\nAlso they aren’t FDA certified. I don’t doubt they have high standards for cleanliness and taste but the macros truly seem too good to be true. And a personal anecdote, I feel like I’ve gained a few pounds since eating them even though I usually use them as a workout snack. Anyone know more about what they put in their food? I would hate to learn the food is more processed and junk-y than they advertise",

      "text": "Hi everyone, this may be an extremely stupid question but I can’t find the answer I’m looking for so I wanted to ask here in hopes one of you could clear up some of my misconceptions.\n\nEdit: TLDR: If you eat 800 calories of protein and 50% (random percent) are used for energy and 50% are used for building, then won’t you your body need an additional 400 calories to maintain its TDEE? (Because the building calories aren’t currently being used for energy but are stored)\n\nHere’s the scenario: You have a maintenance of 2000 calories, you ingest 800 calories of protein bringing your daily net total to -1200 instead of -2000. The amino acids in the protein will be used for various things that aren’t providing energy for the body. Just for the sake of the exercise let’s say 50% energy 50% building. That would mean 400 calories are stored as your body builds itself up, and aren’t being currently used as energy.\n\nNow here is my question: Am I right in thinking that your body needs to now find an “additional” 400 calories to fuel itself? I agree calories in calories out in terms of total weight, but if you were trying to keep muscle mass but cut fat (if my way of thinking is even true) wouldn’t it be important to look at things in terms of what calories are being used to build and what calories are being used for energy instead of just total energy from all sources?\n\nSorry if this post comes across as naive but I just want to learn if I am missing some key information in how the body uses its energy from fat and protein\n\nThank you!",

If they Roast a potato, uses spray and cook & not added oil, Shouldn't that keep the natural state more normal and lower the G.I vs Boiling? Its been rumored that boiling leads to a decrease in minerals. So theoretically, Dry Heat shouldn't mean an increase? Its also recommended to let a starch source, again using potatos, to be cooked, cool down and then reheated as cooling it results in Resistant Starch, that lowers its G.I\n\nPersonally it just doesn't make much sense to me",

So im asking if its the protein already in your system (day before), or the protein that's starting digestion (day of), or the protein while sore and in recovery (day after), that has the largest effect on muscle growth? \n\nAgain, im asking solely to understand how protein actually affects muscle growth, not looking to only eat protein once every 3 days or looking for diet advice, thanks!",

Examples I can think of off the top of my head are things like Greek yogurt, seitan, and even tomato paste all 3 of which either concentrate a beneficial component like protein by removing sugars or increase the bioavailability of a beneficial component like lycopene by cooking. Can anyone else think of other foods that are potentially more healthy after they have been processed?",

      "text": "My wife is from South America and she recently decided to make a beverage made from pineapple peels.  Apparently this beverage is common in South America.  To make this beverage she merely uses the peel from a pineapple and lets it soak in water for several days in a dark place at room temperature. After four or five days, she strains the liquid and puts it in the fridge. My concerns are plentiful. Obviously I'm worried about bacteria since while the skin is wash and scrubbed before being cut, there is no other attempt to eliminate bacteria. She says that the tea is supposed to have bacteria and is a probiotic. I refuse to drink the tea and believe this to be unsafe. \n\nIf one was to prepare a beverage for probiotic purposes using a pineapple peel, how would you go about it? Would it be worthwhile to add tablets that one would use to make water drinkable if one were out in the wilderness? Should we wash the peels in a little vodka? Any suggestions would be appreciated.",

As an example, I have Thrive Market dried red lentils, which have 100 calories, 9g protein, and 8g fiber per serving. That's 1g protein per every ~11 calories. But then a bag of Goya dried red lentils is 160 calories, 11g protein, 5g fiber. Lower fiber and 1g of protein per every ~14 calories. \n\nNot just lentils either. I have Iberia red kidney beans, which are 70 calories, 9g protein, 14g fiber per serving (1g protein per 8 calories). Goya's label for the same beans says 140 calories, 9g protein, 6g fiber (1g protein per 16 calories). Way less protein and fiber than Iberia. \n\nAnd this is across so many other brands too, different for every brand, different for canned vs. dried. What's the deal??\n\nI'd like to point out that I know the serving sizes vary across each product, but that doesn't explain why the calorie to protein and calorie to fiber ratio is so different.",

To keep it ad-free and prevent any undue sponsorship or marketing influence, to keep it free and accessible to all despite any site changes, to keep it organized, to ensure content and links to outside resources work regardless of app or browser, to enable proper search functionality, and to make sure it's available during site outages.\n\n# Resources - Check these for answers before posting a question!\n\n* [The r/Fitness Wiki and FAQ.](https://thefitness.wiki/)  Most questions that people come to r/Fitness with can be answered directly by the Wiki and FAQ or by applying the information found in it.  It will always be the best first place to look for answers.  Moderators or the community can help direct you to the right information if you have trouble finding it.\n* [Searching past threads.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/search?q=&restrict_sr=on&include_over_18=on&sort=relevance&t=all)  r/Fitness has over a decade of discussion threads that are very likely to have answers to your questions if our Wiki and FAQ does not.  Remember when searching that fitness and exercise are not fast moving topics, and even discussions that are several years old are going to be relevant today.\n* [Google.](https://www.google.com/)  Yes, really, or your preferred search engine.  Google excels at being a source of answers for common fitness and exercise questions including exercise alternatives or progressions, meal plan and food options, equipment or product reviews, and so on.\n* Yourself.  Many questions we see come down to a matter of personal preference or can be answered by \"it depends.\"  You should check in with yourself before asking the community to decide something for you.\n\n# The Rules\n\n[The rules for r/Fitness can be found here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/wiki/rules)\n\nr/Fitness is a high traffic community that is heavily moderated to maintain quality control and make good use of the resources provided.

Nevermind that it's the most inaccurate method available, (read: most likely way wrong - [see here](http://web.archive.org/web/20130301185720/https://paindatabase.com/body-fat/)) you're still just putting an arbitrary number to the body you have. Despite people's claim that they are shooting for a number, they're really shooting for look - like a six pack.\n\nSo let's stopping mucking around with trivialities and get to the heart of the matter. This thread shall serve two purposes:\n\n1. **Physique critiques.** Post some pics and ask about muscles or body parts you need to work on. Or specifically ask about a lagging body part and what exercises worked for others.\n2. An outlet for people that want to show off their efforts that would otherwise be removed due to [Rule 4](https://old.reddit.com/r/Fitness/wiki/rules#wiki_rule_.234), and\n\nLet's keep things civil, don't be a creep, and adhere to [Rule 1](http://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/wiki/rules#wiki_1._hate_speech_and_discriminatory_remarks_are_not_allowed.). This isn't a thread to announce what you find attractive in a mate.

They'll listen to you rant, show empathy and you'll just sense a decrease in respect or they'll just look at you with pity/disguss then proceed to gossip about you - on top of that throw it in your face once things don't go their way for X,Y,Z situations. Once you open up you can sense the listener feeling superior and will seek hearing more sad stories on your end. I encourage you all to speak to God honestly or a therapist outside of your hometown/maybe online. I might be tripping but that it just based on my experience so far. Seeing people pulling a whole front while everyone is dealing with their own lives/own mistakes and problems. Everyone has a valid reason to be sad all day as pain is real subjective - we only know the pain we endured - same tears different stories . I'm just thinking out loud . I encourage you all to love yourself, forgive yourself before forgiving the outside. I'm still open for any other opinions\n\n\n\n*Few hours later* take a look at the thread 😂😂😂",

      "text": "I did everything by the book.\n\nI filled out the FMLA paperwork. I got it approved. I took a short leave to focus on my mental health something I’d avoided for years, but finally couldn’t anymore. PTSD, BPD… real stuff I needed to deal with.\n\nI came back thinking things would go back to normal. Instead, the atmosphere shifted.\n\nNothing was said outright, but the coldness was obvious. I felt watched. Doubted. Then came the Performance Improvement Plan, something I’d never received before in my entire time there. It didn’t come from nowhere, but it didn’t make sense either. Suddenly, my work was being scrutinized in ways it never had been. The timing? Just a few weeks after my FMLA leave was approved.\n\nAt that point, I knew what was coming. The PIP wasn’t about support,  it was about setting up the next move.\n\nEventually, they fired me. And the official reasons?\n\nI ordered too much food for a client dinner\nI missed a showroom graphic\n\nThat was it. Not the PIP. Not my performance. Just those two incidents,  small things that would’ve been handled with a conversation in any normal situation. But by then, the decision had already been made. I wasn’t a safe employee anymore.\n\nThis is what retaliation looks like in 2025. Not a dramatic blow-up, just a slow, quiet push out the door, dressed up in HR language and concerns.\n\nAnd the worst part? It’s not rare.\n\nI’m not sharing this because I want sympathy. I’m sharing it because people need to understand that FMLA isn’t always the shield it’s supposed to be. Mental health awareness is one thing. But when you actually need support, it can cost you everything.\n\nIf any of this sounds familiar, if you’ve been punished for asking for help, you’re not alone. And you’re not crazy.",

It makes it harder for people like me to be taken seriously when we actually experience real trauma reactions.\n\nAnother one for me is **“gaslighting.”**  \nNot every disagreement or uncomfortable conversation is gaslighting. It’s a specific, insidious form of manipulation, and throwing the word around casually just confuses people and discredits real survivors of emotional abuse.\n\nI get that people are trying to describe their experiences, and language evolves, but sometimes it feels like everything is being labeled with a clinical term now.\n\nCurious what others think.  \nWhich mental health term do you feel has lost its meaning, or gets thrown around too loosely?",

The only way you could know if you have a \"chemical imbalance\" is if you measure the levels of chemicals in your brain. I think most people don't have their brain chemicals measured.\n\nMaybe it's bad to assume that your brain has a biological problem? Maybe a lot of us are capable of more than we think we are. Maybe we can get over bad mental health without meds, for example (although if someone wants to take meds then that's fair enough).\n\nEdit: Thank you for the replies to this thread, they're interesting.",

But then I feel guilty. \n\nDue to America’s current political climate - my anxiety has been through the roof the last few months.\nI’m going to have to double my medication and probably start seeing a therapist again.\n\nMy anxiety stems from bad things being outside of my control. Or seeing bad things happen to other people.\nI know one of my big triggers is staying up to date on all the government changes happening.\n\nPeople say we shouldn’t ignore what’s happening and we need to pay attention and stay up to date. But staying well informed causes me debilitating anxiety. So I’m very conflicted. I don’t want to not watch the news and for people to think I’m sticking my head in the sand. But even if I do watch the news there’s nothing I can personally do to change what’s happening.\n\nWhat do you guys think? Is there a way I can maybe stay informed without all the scary news titles?\n\nThank you, happy Sunday!",

I suffer from severe OCD and am a late diagnosed autistic. I am only now just trying to learn how to regulate and handle my emotions as I was ever taught this growing up. I'm on the phone a lot to my parents trying to explain to them how hurt and I am and then have outbursts when they don't understand and yell at me. \nAnyway I went and apologised again to the neighbours later on yesterday. The man was trying to sleep and told me I'm trying to sleep now its ok. He seemed really annoyed that I came to apologise.\nThis morning however I found a mental health help leaflet under my door. I think this a nice gesture on their part even though they were very angry before. I don't know what to do now. Do I go over and thank them or leave a note? Or do I just leave it and be quiet from now on? What would a 'normal' person prefer as I have no clue",

Getting daily sunlight (or blue light) has also helped. No change in meds.\n\n  \nI've read that various supplements (magnesium, fish oil, vit Bs), diets (Mediterranean, keto) and types of exercise (weightlifting?) can help... but tbh it's all pretty overwhelming to figure out.\n\n  \nI'm curious to know, besides therapy and meds, what has helped with your mental health recovery most?

Men's health is marginalized enough, by others AND themselves, which is incredibly tragic imo, so maybe we should reschedule the event. Preferably not to Black-or Women-centric months, out of respect for those, especially regarding ongoing events.\n\nWhat do you think? Is it a good idea or a flawed one?\n\nAlso, tell the men in your life that you love them ♥️",

      "text": "After a rough 3 years of failed pregnancy attempts, we finally gave birth to our beautiful baby girl this year.\n\nWe were so excited and didn’t mind staying in the NICU when she came early. We had already both received pre conception genetic testing, but our doctor recommended we get her tested with something more thorough after a few incidents in the NICU. The findings were devastating - she tested positive for a very rare condition with risks of low life expectancy, moderate to severe mental delay, and physical delays. It was a de novo mutation, son of something that was passed down from either of us. \n\nWe were understandably shattered. Fast forward 6 months. Our child is doing pretty well considering the diagnosis. She will have a couple of lifelong challenges, but no evidence yet of major impairments or anything life threatening. My wife has become progressively worse each month. She is seeing 2 therapists and has been prescribed medication, but nothing has presented any progress. I’m fine being supportive and patiently waiting for her current therapy to help her work through,  but the situation has become severe and I no longer see that as an option. \n\nShe is now saying the following things(all quotes from her perspective):\n- You two would be better off without me\n- My love for this baby is conditional, if she isn’t a normal baby I don’t think I can do it\n- Having a baby is the biggest mistake of my life\n- Our lives are over\n- it’s too much, I can’t take it\n- I think I just need to leave(won’t give detail on where, concerned she is referring to self harm)\n\nAll of these things are accompanied by excessive crying and wailing. I’ve called to try to get us into couples grief counseling. I’ve even offered to take her somewhere for a weekend for intensive therapy. I don’t know what else I can try. \n\nI love my wife and I’m so worried about her. This situation has obviously been traumatic for us, but our child has shown positive signs since the diagnosis and I worry that my wife has become completely blind that progress in her grief.",

That terrifies me. These are kids. What’s happening to us?\n\nIs it really just social media messing with our brains? Is it COVID and the long-term psychological or even physical effects? Is it the state of the world—economically, socially, environmentally? Or are we just becoming more aware of mental health issues that always existed?\n\nI know part of it is the overwhelming amount of technology in our lives—how it’s created this weird paradox where we’re constantly connected but feel more isolated than ever. It’s like we’re surrounded by people online but starved for real connection in real life.\n\nI mean, I’m sure if you were living 200 years ago, these things didn’t exist, right? Or at least not at this scale. People weren’t constantly anxious, mentally burnt out, or numb at 16. What the hell is going on?\n\nI don’t know. It just feels like something is off with this entire generation. Like we’re all slowly slipping. I’d love to hear your thoughts—do you feel the same? Do you think there’s a bigger reason behind this mental health crisis?",

I feel so physically sick. I have no hope left. Corruption and evil have taken over. I see no end in sight. What do I do? I feel so helpless. I cut out every supporter for my mental health which effects my social life. I feel an obligation to have these discussions with others because I’m a social worker but it just leaves me feeling depressed and defeated. I can’t take it anymore. I can’t. I work my whole career to help those in need. How can someone say they don’t care about others and that they should die?? What has the nation come to? Nothing helps. Talking doesnt help, protesting doesnt help, distractions don’t help. What do I do? Please I need advice I’m falling apart.",

      "text": "We’ve been dating for almost 2 years, everything was great but our honeymoon phase ended quite quickly at around our 4 month anniversary due to his problems with anger (punching walls, throwing things). He revealed to me after we started dating that he has autism and adhd, he is quite low on the spectrum but he still wanted to make me aware. I told him that was no problem at all and i’ll love him no matter what but around 5 months ago he started having these repetitive obsessive thoughts, he wouldn’t tell me what they were about but it was so bad to the point i could never even have a full conversation with him without him having to “fix his thought” and while he was doing this i couldn’t move otherwise he would get mad because he had to “restart”. I have no experience at all with any mental health issues and i have no clue how to help someone that’s going through that but i always tried and asked what i could do but i was never met with an answer. His new thing that he obsessively thinks about is whether he thinks im ugly or not he tries to tell me he’s just scared that he thinks that because he’s afraid to lose me but knowing he thinks about that dozens of times a day really messes with my confidence and i’ve always struggled in that aspect. He also gets very irritable when he’s having these thoughts (at least once every 30 minutes) and will snap at me, yell at me, hit himself in the head in front of me, throw his or my phone or hit things (the bed directly next to me once) it’s also gotten to the point where i cannot express my emotions, if i cry in front of him he becomes extremely stressed out and starts hitting himself which scares me and makes me cry more. i love him but he’s not at all the same person i fell in love with and i feel so guilty for feeling this way because i know it’s because of his illnesses. has anyone experienced this feeling or know how i can deal with it better?",

However when symptoms are actually on display, even for something as well known as depression or anxiety, you’re suddenly overreacting and it isn’t okay? \n\nFor example I’m not shy about the fact that I’m anxious and have an anxiety disorder, I let people know especially before when I first start jobs because I feel people deserve a heads up. When I tell people it’s always this supportive vibe, that it’s nothing to be ashamed of, that we’re here if you need anything, etc. but then when I’m having a random panic attack and need to step away for a moment to calm down I’m treated like I’m being irrational, that whatever I’m going through isn’t that big of a deal, or that I should just deal with it. \n\nIt feels like people with mental health issues are only allowed to show surface level, easy to digest symptoms(if even that) but when the very real and difficult symptoms rears its head people do a 180 and low key treat you like a freak or that you’re, well, crazy. \n\nIt’s like…yeah no shit, what did you expect?\n\nAnd it makes it even harder when I’m struggling with other issues as well, especially ones not as well known/as common like DPDR or C-PTSD.\n\nIdk, it just frustrates me a lot. Anyone else deal with stuff like this? What are your thoughts about it all? \n\n(Edit: typo)",

      "text": "I'm a 15 year old girl who wants to advocate for mental health, especially for teenagers. We have problems too but adults often just dismiss is as \"typical teenager behavior\" when in reality, we're really struggling. With all the bullying, cyberbullying and harassment in the world. It seems like it's not getting better. Whenever adults are brutally honest, they get praised and worshipped like Gods, but when it comes to us adolescents, we get discriminated and punished for speaking up about our experiences. \n\nAnd people always say \"It'll get better\", as if trying actually helps, because I've talked about mental health issues with my school counselor and she's like \"It won't last forever\", well.... actually, it does last forever for some people. I have PTSD, anxiety and depression from getting cheated on and having verbally abusive people in my life. Along with having trust issues and sometimes feeling bad about myself, with having a learning disability and ADHD, it feels like no one cares.\n\nMore people need to take mental health seriously, it's just as important as physical health (but some stupid people don't recognize that). \n\nSo, if anyone has similar problems and thoughts and tips on what to do, I'd glady appreciate it.",

For me, it’s been constant background stress the kind that keeps you up at night and makes it hard to focus during the day. Even when I’m doing okay financially, the thought of those balances never really leaves my head.\n\nA couple weeks ago, I decided I couldn’t keep living like that. I started looking into different options, and I ended up trying a restoradebt co. It was way less overwhelming than I expected they walked me through possible programs without pressuring me, and it actually made me feel like there’s a path forward instead of this endless uphill climb.\n\nI’m not completely out of the woods yet, but just having a plan has lifted a huge weight off my shoulders. My anxiety’s been lower, I’m sleeping better, and I don’t get that same pit in my stomach every time I think about my finances.\n\nIf anyone else feels like debt is eating away at your mental health, it might be worth looking into real solutions. Even just talking to someone about your options can make a world of difference.",

I feel awful about this and have been in therapy trying to change for the better. However, my girlfriend hasn’t given any indication for how long this break is going to last and the few times sex has been brought up, she seems to get uncomfortable and has recently said she doesn’t want to cry after sex anymore. \n\nI am consumed by feelings of guilt, regret, shame, and lust. I am also feeling undesirable and am constantly in my own head about this situation. We’ve been getting along great and still maintaining physical intimacy and flirting outside of sex, but it just feels off knowing that she intentionally does not want sex with me and that I am likely turning her off. Therapy is going well and I recently stated taking a slow acting medicine for my anxiety, but I don’t know how to stop overthinking in the meantime. She is the one for me, and she has continued to say that she wants to be with me forever, but it’s hard not to doubt what she is saying given the circumstances. I feel so lost in situation and don’t know what to do. I just want to go back to how our relationship was before the fights and be a better boyfriend. Open to any advice that you all can share.",

      "text": "I’m a guy from a small town who moved to the city to study medicine. I didn’t choose it out of passion, but more like a personal challenge. I liked biology, health, fitness, and I was also attracted by the prestige of being a doctor. My parents made sacrifices to pay for a year of prep school. I got in, ranking in the top 10 out of almost 400 applicants.\n\nThe first two years were during the pandemic. I lived alone in a terrible apartment with loud neighbors. I couldn’t sleep or study. Money was tight. My dad couldn’t help me much more. I started getting physically and mentally sick. I felt like a caged animal, isolated, with no friends.\n\nEvery year I had a breaking point. I felt I couldn’t go on. I talked to my father, but he never supported the idea of quitting. So I just kept going, obediently, hoping to make him proud.\n\nIn 2023, my mom passed away from cancer. It shattered me. I wanted to return to my town and live a quiet, boring life. Medicine had stolen my peace. People who haven't studied medicine don’t understand the constant stress, the mistreatment, the egos. It drains your soul.\n\nThat same year, I met a girl in my class. We studied together every day. She became my anchor. I even lived with her for six months. I fell in love, but I didn’t realize it at first. Out of fear of commitment, I told her I wasn’t ready for anything serious. That pushed her away. Later I realized how deeply I cared, but it was too late. She left for her hometown to do clinical rotations and ended things.\n\nNow I’m in my final year, and I hate everything about this path. I hate the pressure of having lives in my hands. I hate the idea of working in my hometown, afraid of harming someone I know. I hate being surrounded by illness and stress.\n\nI told my dad I wanted to quit. We argued. He said that if I didn’t finish, all these years would be wasted. I begged for a break, but he never took me seriously. I’m exhausted, depressed, heartbroken. I feel like I’ve let everyone down.\n\nI keep going just to get the degree. After that, I’ll see what to do. I considered switching to another field, like Agricultural Engineering, but I lost my father’s financial support and I’m not sure I can handle another 5-year degree.\n\nAll I want is a simple 9-to-5 job, maybe as an office clerk back in my town. A job where I can clock out and do the things I love: training, hobbies, having a dog. No more stress, no more fear of hurting people. I’ve developed a rejection to studying because of how much I suffered through it.\n\nI also thought about working in a healthcare company or doing occupational medicine—something more administrative—just to avoid throwing all these years away. But honestly, I feel lost.\n\nI’m in therapy, but it’s not enough. I feel like a 50-year-old divorced man stuck in the body of a 25-year-old.\n\nHas anyone felt this way? What did you do?",

      "text": "Hi,  \nI finished medical school, did a 1-year internship, and then worked as a family doctor for 6 months. After that, I decided not to do a specialization. I moved to another country with my husband . And now I don’t really know what to do next.\n\nLet me start from the beginning.  \nWhen I was 19, I had to choose between modeling and medicine. I chose medicine. At first, I was excited – I liked studying and learning new things. I hoped that with time I would find something in medicine that I’d really enjoy. But in my 3rd year (during COVID), I started feeling that medicine wasn’t right for me. Nothing made me feel excited or interested. I felt that working in a hospital wasn’t for me – and maybe even working with patients in general. I started thinking that maybe I should quit and go back to modeling. But I kept going year after year. In my 6th year, I had a big mental breakdown and started therapy. I still finished my studies, did my internship, and started dreaming about a longer break. When I saw what life in a hospital really looks like – night shifts, no time for yourself – I decided to try a postgraduate course in aesthetic medicine. Mostly because it seemed more creative and better paid. After my internship, I worked for 6 months as a GP - I did it great, but with no daily satisfaction. I was constantly thinking about my new dreams life without medicine. So (after 6 years studied, 1 year internship, 6 months working as GP) I decided to break the pattern and move to another continent.\n\nMy husband stays here for next 2 years.  I was really happy to finally  try something new. I tried modeling again, but it didn’t work out. My medical background doesn't count here. I tried to do voluntary work in aesthetic medicine - but with no feedback. I found work as a barista but at this moment it's really hard for me to accept the reality. Now I’ve been here for 2 months, without a job, and I honestly don’t know what to do next. When I am looking on the past... I feel like maybe I was living in a dream of modeling and changing my life and because that I didn't engage in any medical field? Or maybe medicine isn't really for me? Now I can't see myself anywhere. Please help me with finding any direction. I am on my therapy, but it's really hard for me to start this subject yet. I have a pressure about the time and money and creating stable life like my peers. I regret that I didn't involve deeper in anything - people were doing a lot of activities about medicine on my studies, but I didn't feel anything,.",

      "text": "Hi, I am having some weird issues regarding not being able to feel emotions and I need advice as to whether people think this is a psychological thing or a physical chemical thing. For context, I have quite a few mental disorders including bipolar (medicated) and anxiety; both of which cause me to feel very deeply about things and cause me to get triggered easily. I have a lot of issues with irritability like getting mad on the road and sadness that can be caused by a change in tone from someone i’m talking to. However, the past few days something has changed. I quite literally woke up one day and realized i was not feeling anything that intensely anymore, in fact, I wasn’t feeling anything but tired. I kind of just associated it with being tired that day and didn’t think much of it, but it’s been 4 days now and i’m starting to get confused. I still feel really tired but I feel no rage, no stress from driving, no sadness, no stress from things i’ve been obsessing over for months. this has never EVER happened to me, I’ve always felt worse about things but never had emotions just disappear in an instant. I don’t know if this is my mental health or maybe related to the higher dosage birth control i’m taking? I would like some opinions on if people think this is just something that will pass over or if it’s something i should look into. I’m stuck.",

I started sertraline on a low dose (25mg) last week for it and I was warned to stop if I had suicidal thoughts. Things were starting to improve as they usually do when I get over previous anxieties, but new anxieties have come along and today one was bad enough to put me back at rock bottom and into more of a depression. It's the first time I've thought about death being the better option in a while. It's passive and not something I'd seriously consider but definitely was hard having that thought again. How do you know if it's medication or just the normal mental struggles? The dose is low, and I just barely started it, but I don't want to make myself worse if this is a sign.",

I think maybe it’s been 2 to 3 weeks off of it completely and I’ve been having trouble keeping my emotions in check and it didn’t really hit me at first, but after reflection, I was thinking maybe this is due to the medication, but I also have major life changes going on at the same time. \n\nI’m in the middle of a divorce. I just got discussed with autism. Already diagnosed with everything else (MMD, ADHD, OCD, BPD, GAD, CPTSD). I’m processing trauma in therapy.  I’m moving in somewhere new with a roommate. I have severe chronic pain and illnesses.  My job doesn’t cover my bills so I’m financially reliant on my abusive parents.  I’m a cardiac transplant and cancer survivor. I only work because disability pays even less. I’m having a riff with my coworkers and we are in a small department and one of our coworkers just died. He beat a severe form of blood cancer that caused them to have a bone marrow transplant and that was last year and he came back to work this fall and then had a trouble with memory and next thing you know a virus took come out and just about five months probably less.  He had the biggest will to live where I am here suffering wanting to not live, but he’s the one that happens to.  Life is fucked up, but like where do you draw the line of these are just big events and so these are normal emotional reactions or maybe Lamictal is something I can’t live without it, which is fucking sad. And it’s the only mental health medication under the sun that I don’t have an adverse effect from. \n\nI’m ashamed that I can’t control my emotions in my emotional reactions at this age. It feels immature and embarrassing, and I hate that I have to rely on medicine. My body would not be living without medication, which is just a sad fact in and of itself as a Transplant patient. If I stop my meds, I’ll be dead relatively soon, probably within a year.",

Here’s what can happen:\n\n1. **Reduced Effectiveness:** Many mental health meds (like antidepressants, anti-anxiety meds, or mood stabilizers) lose potency after expiration. This can lead to a return or worsening of symptoms—like increased anxiety, depression, or mood swings.\n2. **Unpredictable Side Effects:** Although rare, some expired medications can chemically change and cause unexpected reactions or side effects that could mess with your mental state or physical health.\n3. **Disrupted Treatment:** Taking an ineffective or altered dose can throw off your mental health routine, making you feel confused, unstable, or even hopeless if symptoms return.\n4. **Increased Anxiety or Guilt:** Just *knowing* you took something expired might increase stress or anxiety—especially if you’re already feeling mentally vulnerable.\n\nIf you've taken expired meds, don’t panic—most aren’t dangerous, just less effective. But you should call your doctor or pharmacist, especially if you notice any new symptoms. And try to replace old meds regularly—it’s part of taking care of yourself 💊🧠✨",

All it did was put me on edge, I haven’t been sleeping, I’ve been having stress nightmares, and I finally told her what was going on after two weeks. She changed me back to what I was doing before.\n\nI feel SO dumb. I have a masters degree in psychology for fucks sake! My shame monster is screaming at me that I should suffer alone, hold this close to the chest and just endure. But hey after 25 years of treatment resistant depression and PTSD, I don’t think that’s right for me anymore.\n\nI know intellectually that I’m a human first, and my brain isn’t quite “in control” right now. But my fucking shame monster is really reasserting himself. I don’t have any plans or intent for self harm, I just want to be my old self.\n\nI think who I am is soft and kid, and how I’m behaving is mean and vindictive, I just want to pick a fight with anyone and everyone. It feels stupid, though my compassionate self would probably understand.\n\nThanks for reading (listening). I’m not sure what to do now except white knuckle my rage. I’ve taken tomorrow off work (yay guilt for being a therapist and abandoning my clients), so I hope I can find something. Thanks again",

      "text": "I get that people want to legalize marijuana, but it seems to me that the campaign to make marijuana a drug for mental health is misguided and very harmful. I mean how can our society believe that marijuana is a safe drug for mental health problems while we also believe that alcohol should be considered a maladaptive and dangerous behavior? The psychological effects are similar, and marijuana tends to have even more extreme effects, as it’s classified as a hallucinogen. I understand alcohol is more addictive, but marijuana is also addictive and marijuana use disorder is a diagnosable mental health disorder. I also understand that one can overdose from alcohol though not from marijuana, but potential for overdose has not stopped prescribers from using other drugs (hello opioids). My main worry is that on the fight to legalize a recreational drug, many people have created an inaccurate portrayal of its usefulness for mental health, and as a therapist, I’m concerned that our society had the wrong view about its function in mental health.",

He exhibits most BPD symptoms and has mood swings through out the day. He can snap out of them as fast as he goes into them. He also exhibits the BPD symptoms in relationships, has few friends, is very paranoid about others intentions, and is rather intolerant of a lot of things. He doesn’t fall under typical bipolar since he doesn’t have mania or get too carried away when he has a couple good days. However he does have bad depressive symptoms. Many people including himself say things like it’s as though he has different people/personalities in him. He will not take a medicine that affects him sexually. He currently takes viagra/cialis and will under no circumstance stay on a medicine that will mess up anything in that department. He’s tried lamictal and it made him quiet and irritable. He tried risperdal + Wellbutrin and that made him spaced out and angry. I don’t think antidepressants are a good idea since they will affect libido.",

I was terrified and nervous at first, but it was the best decision that I made! From the second you walk in, you’re are greeted and treated with so much kindness. All the staff genuinely cared about me as a person, not just as a patient. The partial area is beautiful and they have a therapy dog that comes daily. The staff taught us a lot but they made it super fun so it didn’t feel overwhelming at all. They fed us for free everyday and let me tell you, the food was amazing! I made so many friends that I still talk to regularly and I feel so much more confident about using coping in my daily life. I am so grateful I decided to do the program! It saved me at my lowest!",

My anxiety causes me to forget things because I have SO MUCH I am having to remember and also because, well, anxiety lol.

This new type of sleeping pill doesn't have any of those side effects tho, which makes it extremely easy to tolerate if prescribed.\n\nI'm also shocked at how easily i fall asleep on it, and in addition to that, it causes no rebound insomnia (aka it doesn't make my insomnia worse) when i choose not to take it. The last week I've had some of the most restful sleep in about a decade, and its so nice to be able to sleep. Only problem, its a little pricey if you can't get it covered (its only a brand-name at the moment), but in my opinion, the price is worth it for restful, good quality sleep.

Fear surrounding our full potential has lead to a Governmental/Medical/World deadening in and of itself, as it was said before, dying only results in living.

To make you feel like you're in need of rescuing when you're actually reaching \"higher\" ground. They want you to stay in the undertow of their leech invested gain pool. I am highly experienced in this system of being imprisoned and manipulated. I hope this clears things up, and helps connect the dots. \nFear. Is. A. Mind. Killer.",

It was a nightmare last year, I was struggling every second of the day just to stay alive.

They told me to just monitor for symptoms and that it’s not usually life-threatening at that dose for an adult, but I might get side effects like nausea, dizziness, sleepiness, fast heartbeat, etc.\n\nIt’s been a couple of hours and I feel mostly okay so far, just a bit jittery. But I’m wondering — has anyone here ever done something similar? Should I expect to feel weird later today?\n\nMoral of the story: don’t take pills while half asleep",

Like am I tired because of the condition or because of the med? Is the brain fog from my body or my treatment? It’s such a mess to untangle. Lately I’ve been doing everything I can think of like tracking symptoms every day, comparing notes with people who have similar issues, reading way too many Reddit threads, I even ran my med history through this online health tool EurekaHealth to see if anything would stand out and It actually flagged a few things I hadn’t thought about before but of course before giving me any medicine I need to consult with a doctor and that’s kind of the problem I haven’t found one who’ll really dig into it with me without just brushing me off.\n\nDo you guys go off gut instinct? Give it a strict timeline or keep trying stuff until something feels right? I feel like I’m just throwing darts and hoping one finally hits the target.

      "text": "The Issue\n\nOn July 4, 2025, I suffered a sudden and severe mental health crisis triggered by an adverse reaction to an over-the-counter cold medicine. I was hallucinating, panicked, and rushed to the ER with a blood pressure of 190/100. I was discharged after six hours — with no psychiatric consult, no safety net, and no follow-up.\n\nWhat came next nearly killed me.\nFor three days, I couldn’t eat or drink. I begged for help. I reached out to my provider. I saw a psychiatrist. I told them the medications they prescribed previously caused serious side effects. I asked for lithium, a drug that had worked before.\nThe response?\n“Your next appointment is in three weeks.”\nI was in full psychological collapse — and told to wait.\n\nI’m not alone. This is happening across North Carolina and the United States every day. People in active crisis are being told to survive on their own until the system can “get to them.” Some don’t survive.\n\nWe demand change — now.\n\nWe call on North Carolina legislators and the NC Department of Health and Human Services to:\nMandate emergency triage protocols for psychiatric care.\n\n- Patients in crisis must be prioritized within 24–72 hours — not weeks.\n- Fund and expand bridge-care programs.\nPatients should receive short-term prescriptions or crisis stabilization while awaiting follow-up.\n- Hold providers accountable for medication safety.\nWhen patients report severe side effects, they must be heard and alternative treatments offered.\nTrain employers on trauma-informed response.\nEmployees experiencing mental health emergencies need compassion, not productivity pressure.\n Support caregivers.\nPartners, family members, and friends who hold us up through crisis deserve resources and recognition.\nI’m not asking for sympathy.\nI’m demanding action.\nI survived the waitlist — but just barely. Let’s make sure no one else has to.\n\n[Update - 7/25/25] Mental Health Leave, Medication Changes, and Fighting for the Right Help\n\nI wanted to post an update for those who read and supported my story recently.\n\nSince I first shared, I’ve officially gone on medical leave from work to focus on stabilizing my mental health. I was struggling with severe depression, panic, and what I now believe are long-standing effects of trauma and grief. The tipping point came after a manic and dissociative episode that led me to finally ask for real help.\n\nI’ve since seen my primary doctor twice (due to waiting for psychiatrist appointment), and finally today a psychiatrist. I am now on new medications: divalproex (Depakote ER), propranolol, and clonazepam. I’m early in the process, but already facing the usual uphill battle—side effects, slow progress, conflicting advice, and the emotional weight of not knowing what comes next. What’s been hardest is advocating for myself when I feel at my weakest, especially when I know in my gut that certain medications (like lithium) may be a better fit for me—but I’m not being heard yet.\n\nMy fiancée has been a rock through this. Without her, I’m not sure I’d still be fighting.\n\nTo those dealing with the system, waiting for appointments, battling stigma (maybe even from coworkers), and just trying to survive each day—you’re not alone. It shouldn’t be this hard to get help, but I see you. I’m still in it with you.\n\nThank you for giving me a place to be honest.",

      "text": "Oh my lord so I was admitted into a psych ward once (well I actually admitted myself as a compulsion for my OCD) and the experience was HORRIBLE. They forgot to write my allergies and gave me a mint medicine and I immediately projectile vomited it and my mouth was burning. (I don’t go into anaphylactic shock btw, it just causes rashes, burns my mouth, and of course makes me vomit) I told them all of my allergies when I was admitted including mint, and the fact that they didn’t know that is really alarming. Also the fact that the only thing I could do for 9 days straight was make origami. I can never look at it the same. No phones allowed so I wasn’t able to talk to my family unless it was for 10 minutes on the weird phones they gave us and visitation which only lasted an hour. They wouldn’t tell my parents anything despite me telling them to, and the fact that I was 18 but I was still in highschool. They didn’t feed me a lot. Most of the food they had there I couldn’t eat due to my sensory issues (if the food isn’t perfect or a food I enjoy, I will vomit or get horrible indigestion) and I survived off of bread rolls and apples. Sweet delicious apples btw. Disgusting. They made fish every day for the pescatarian and had kosher meals for the Jewish people and those people even told me that if there are things my body won’t eat then I should be given food that I can eat. But the staff? Nah. They just said “well you gotta eat something” I know that, why do you think I’ve eaten 16 apples and 10 bread rolls today?\n\nAnd the WORST Part was the medication. They did not give me the right doses or even the right times to take said medicine. Oh and I brought my prescription of Ativan since my panic attacks get pretty bad and I was prescribed those for that reason. I felt a bad panic coming on so I asked for it. What did they say? “No, we don’t like Ativan here” w h a t. I thought “oh maybe it’s cuz they’re concerned about addiction” but then when my panic attack got even worse, they gave me a heavy antipsychotic without question. \nThey even prescribed me a daily one so I would stop having panics every two seconds because all my stimuli were taken away. The staff didn’t really care about me or the other patients there. It was awful \n\n\nI’ve read other people’s stories and they were also terrible, why the heck are psych wards so prison-like and terrible?\n\nHonestly going there made my anxiety and my OCD obsessions worse. \n\nDo not recommend",

      "text": "Hi, thank you for reading this, sorry, it might get a bit long         \nI'm 18m and gay but from Iran, it's very much punished and not accepted here. My plan was to get into a good uni and immigrate as a student, which is a common raot and since I'm already fluent in English I thought it wouldn't be that hard. I was never exactly normal or the happiest person in the room, I would get anxiety sometimes, and bad thoughts and failures, even small ones would be stuck in my head for a long time, like being bugged about a math test that I didn't ace for like a month, or when my parents had a really really big argument and even considered divorce I caught myself thinking about it randomly for like months even after they made up, which is weird because I always thought I didn't care. One year ago, things changed, I lost my focus on my studies, I lost all motivation and started getting mood swings, I'd get sad and hopeless and cried myself to sleep like at least once a week, I would obsessively daydream about leaving and starting a life somewhere else, I realized that I actually didn't want to major in medicine and only thought I liked it because everyone has been telling to do so since childhood, because of the very bad economy here and the fact that I was very bookish and got good grades. When my grades started to drop I was devastated, my parents were kinda disappointed, they would tell me \"it's just one more year, just one more year and life'll be a bliss\" or \"why are you so relaxed and uncaring about your future, think all the time you spent, all the money we spent(it was a normal decent amount, I appreciate them doing it, but it's the norm, and saying it this often is just uncomfortable, and plus, I passed the entrance exam and got into a highschool that was great yet charged less than any other school in the city)\" and the one I hate the most: \"if we had the opportunities we have provided for you when we were growing up we would have used them better and would be much more successful by now\" I just hate that SO MUCH, it's true but it stings, I didn't want my grades to drop, I tried to stay on task but it was like I couldn't, like my brain was just fried. I did pull myself a little bit together and made some progress, but not enough to get me into a uni in the capital which was my most direct way out. Now I'm learning German in the hopes of leaving, but I still get sad a lot,  I feel like a numb zombie, and interacting with friends and family feels weird because they would hate me if they knew I was gay, though I keep up appearances, I have been emotionally distancing myself from them for years now, but it's just so isolating, I can't talk to anyone and I feel unwell. I have no idea what major to choose or what I even like, let alone what I'll be able to choose, I want to choose something that'll help me leave faster but what if I end up hating it or regreting not even knowing what I want to do for a living and figure it out when it's too late. I know a lot of people are in my situation but do better, I just hate that I got so affected by it. I just want to leave, I just want to leave and start somewhere else that isn't so oppressive, to for once in my life forge a connection that I won't fear being torn apart because i'm gay. I am so scared of not being able to leave and just watch the years go by, it feels like my life is being wasted in front of my eyes. I don't know if I'll be able to go on if I'm still here at 25 or 30.",

I don’t want to help or stay connected. I just want distance—but even that feels impossible.\n\nI moved from my mom’s place to my aunt’s thinking I’d feel safer, but it’s starting to feel like the same hell in a different wrapping because eventually my sisters moved here too. I’m struggling with anxiety, panic attacks, traumatic flashbacks, and crippling insomnia. I was diagnosed with MDD (major depressive disorder) ,anxiety and PTSD. I tried therapy and medicines, but the therapist felt very dismissive—gave me shallow advice like “don’t think about it.”\n\nMy mental health has started affecting my physical health. My body hurts constantly. I'm always tired. I feel like a shell of a person trying to function.\n\nI graduated in 2022 with a Bachelor’s in IT, but I have no work experience. I’m trying to apply for jobs, to escape this situation, but how do I work when I can’t even sleep or function properly?\n\nPGs are an option, but my family is scared to let me go because of my breakdowns .I’ve cried loudly at night. There were times I felt like I couldn’t take it anymore. But the truth is—**being around them is what keeps reopening my wounds**. There’s no space to heal. And I have always handled my mental health,my breakdowns,my panic attacks all by myself. They never helped. Infact they hurt me even more when I'm already hurt\n\nI reached out to a guy on Instagram recently just because I felt so isolated and desperate for a human connection. He ended up being an absolute asshole and said horrible things—right when I was in the middle of a breakdown. I shouldn’t have done that, but I was just so lonely.\n\nLast night, things got really bad again. I reached out to my aunt. She hugged me, I hugged her back tightly crying loudly. But even then, she didn’t understand what I was going through. And bought some weird stuff from spiritual healers for me next day. No one does. Reaching out to humans has only left me feeling worse.\n\nLife feels so heavy. I’m numb now. Like a breathing, walking shell. Everything inside me feels dead. And I keep wondering—will I just shatter into pieces one day and disappear? Will the pain finally stop when I’m just… gone?\n\nI’m trying again to hold on. I want to stick to routines. Try praying again. Try surviving another day. But everything just hurts.\n\nI don’t even know what I’m asking here. Just… please talk to me. I feel like I’m disappearing. Or do you guys know any therapist who actually helps in healing traumas instead of just surface level advices?",

So I’m taking my pill around 1am and getting up around 7am. Is this too late to take the pill? I feel rotten in the morning, as if I haven’t slept in a week. My legs and arms feel so heavy I don’t want to do anything. I’m not taking the medicine for sleep issues although the doctor said I’d benefit from better sleep. He also said that it’s normal to feel tired during the day especially the first two weeks. Am I making the symptoms worse going to bed so late, has anyone found changing the time they take their pill better?  To be honest I’m a bit nervous about medication but it seems like the right step for right now and I want to try make it work. Thanks in advance hope your having a good day/night :)",

In the last couple of days i had a food from a place with a bad reputation about food poisoning and while i was eating i was receiving information that makes me kind of jealous and i was having a little stress in my stomach. Then i returned home and i couldn’t sleep well i was sweating and my mind wasn’t resting. So after all that i went to the hospital and came back turns out that i actually have intestinal flu that is probably from the food i ate and after they gave me IV and some medicine so after it i forced my self to puke and i felt way better. And now i sleep a lot and i wake up good but it’s really hard to maintain, 40 minutes after waking up i am panicking and feeling the worst and whenever i think of the stuff that makes me jealous it becomes worse. I think what happened is that my stomach has both issues at the same time, the flu and the severe panic attacks and so i am having my worst panic episodes that is been happening for the past couple of days. Also, eating food is really hard for me right now. And breathing exercises are not making that much help. If anyone can help me i would appreciate it",

I’m scared of the future, especially the possibility of a world war, and this has taken away all my motivation to build something for the long term. I’m studying medicine, which is my dream, but I wonder if it makes sense to continue if everything could collapse in a few years.\n\nBecause of this, I’m starting to question whether it makes sense to invest years of my life in something so demanding or if I should instead focus on more immediate goals. I feel like giving up everything and dedicating myself to “easier” and more attainable things, like getting a Mazda MX-5, going out, having fun, and living in the present without worrying too much about the future. Basically, I don’t know whether to keep pursuing long-term dreams or enjoy life while I can.\n\nThis dilemma is wearing me down every. single. day.\nThis confusion prevents me from making decisions and I feel predominantly sad and stuck. I can’t enjoy any moment, whether good or bad.\n\nOn a personal level, I’ve never had a girlfriend. I don’t consider myself ugly. However, I lack self-esteem, both physically and socially. I feel insecure and don’t know how to behave romantically with girls, which makes me feel somewhat inferior to others.\n\nI feel stuck between fear of the future, low self-confidence, and indecision about what the right thing to do is.\n\nDo you have any advice? I’m going crazy.\n\nThank you so much in advance!",

I am experiencing extreme brain fog and some memory loss. This is mainly having issues with short term and working memory. For instance, if my pill bottles are open and I get distracted and walk away, I wont remember if I took my medicine or not when I come back. I also forget typical words in mid conversation and have to apologize. I bring it up to my Dr and they just wave it off because of my age, I'm 34. My heart flutters all the time now along with cold toes and one finger, and I just typically feel weak and exhausted constantly. For my sanity, could this be because of the consistent episodes of depression? Or could this be a result of long COVID since i have had it twice? At this point, I want to see a holistic practitioner to examine my bloodwork. These Dr's are not listening to me.",

      "text": "Title: Munky’s Sick Day Snuggles\n\nThe morning light spilled softly through the curtains of the small, cluttered room where James “Munky” Shaffer lay curled up under a blanket, looking smaller than usual. His usually sharp eyes were glassy, and a little crease of discomfort furrowed his brow. He blinked slowly, trying to focus on the ceiling, but his tummy twisted uneasily.\n\n“Ugh… my tummy hurts,” he whispered, voice cracking with the kind of vulnerability fans never got to see. He turned over and a sudden wave of nausea hit him, making his cheeks flush. He whimpered softly and clutched the blanket tighter, trying not to cry.\n\nThe door creaked open and a familiar figure peeked in — Fieldy, his bandmate and longtime friend, with a worried frown and a small plastic cup of water.\n\n“Hey, man… you okay?” Fieldy asked quietly, stepping inside and setting the cup down on the bedside table.\n\nMunky managed a weak nod but then a tiny hiccup escaped him, and before either could react, a little spit-up spilled from the corner of his mouth, making him flush deeper with embarrassment.\n\n“Oh man, don’t worry about that,” Fieldy chuckled softly, grabbing a clean cloth and gently wiping Munky’s chin. “You’re just sick. It’s okay.”\n\nMunky’s lip trembled a little. He hated feeling so helpless, especially with the usual tough guy vibe he carried on stage. But here, under the soft blankets and Fieldy’s gentle care, he felt like a kid again. Maybe even younger.\n\n“Can you… stay?” Munky’s voice was barely audible.\n\n“Of course,” Fieldy smiled, pulling up a chair. “I’m not going anywhere.”\n\nHe settled beside the bed and took Munky’s hand, giving it a reassuring squeeze.\n\nFor the next hour, Munky dozed off and on, drifting in and out of feverish dreams, clutching the blanket like a security blanket. When he woke again, he was startled to find Fieldy still there, quietly humming an old lullaby Munky hadn’t heard since childhood.\n\nThat simple song, the soft voice, and the warmth beside him made something in Munky’s chest loosen. He reached out and tangled his fingers with Fieldy’s, whispering, “Thanks for not leaving.”\n\nFieldy’s grin was tender. “I’ve got your back, always.”\n\nLater, Munky tried to sit up but immediately doubled over, feeling that sick churn again. Fieldy was instantly there, steadying him, supporting his weight.\n\n“Easy, buddy. Don’t push it,” he said, his voice full of quiet concern.\n\nMunky gave a weak, embarrassed laugh, “Sorry… I’m a mess.”\n\n“You’re my mess,” Fieldy teased gently, making Munky smile despite the queasiness.\n\nEventually, Munky gave in and laid back, resting his head against Fieldy’s shoulder. The steady heartbeat and warmth were more healing than any medicine.\n\nAs the afternoon sun dipped low, Munky’s breathing slowed, and a tiny, tired smile ghosted across his lips.\n\n“Best sick day ever,” he murmured, eyes closing.\n\nFieldy kissed his forehead softly. “We’ll do this again anytime.”",

I didn't realize that when I first started seeing her. I'm worried that that's connected somehow with her apparent reluctance to let me try higher doses of antidepressants.\n\n  \nShould I push to give higher doses a shot, or look into seeing a different doctor?

      "text": "Hi. Im a minor. This is my first time on this app and i dont know where to even start. Well first of all my parents often fought but it wasnt that bad mostly, i never hated my parents i just was begging them to kiss and act like other couples which they never did. Anyways i was till this day one of those ‘ipad kids’ i had unlimited internet access since a very young age and that lead to me going deep into the internet’s corners, i was mostly in love with the horror side and especially gore. I dont know why but ever since i was born i had this huge indifference and…hunger for gore. I loved blood so much, i used to hurt myself on purpose to taste it and i even sometimes added sugar to it, one times i even told other kids i was a vampire and if they were bleeding i would tell them ill suck their blood so naturally a lot of kids werent so fond of me growing up. I was the ‘weird kid’ throughout all elementary school, not because i was bullied, on the contrary, i hated the other kids, i was diabolical and i didnt mind scaring them off, i loved it, i liked being alone then, i wasnt paying any attention to class at all, i would sit in the very back and play my own games, i had plenty of them and a LOT of imaginary stuff, safe to say a lot of teachers back then were concerned and reported to my mom that i might be autistic which was so obvious but my mom refused to believe it and instead had me tutored at home in addition to class. I was so evil as a kid, i hated everyone in an egoistic manner, i was the devil child, i laughed at my lil sis’s decapitated cat. I pushed my sis to kill our turtle pet then shamed her for it. I made my sis drink a strong medicine to test if it was safe to drink for me or not. It was only now that i realised how diabolical that was. By the end of elementary school my parents divorced, it was very messy and it lead to me having an existential crisis that changed me 180 degrees. I became this bubbly normal popular loved smart girl all of a sudden, ofc that was an act but it went too great. Its really tiring. Especially during summers, it gets so hot in here and with the routine of doing nothing all day it eventually got to me, i had insomnia for a while and it was hell, i was so tired yet i couldn’t sleep, at night i would literally feel bugs or insects crawling on my body but when i look there was literally nothing, it was driving me insane, i would take 4 showers in one night and scrub my body so hard but still have these hallucinations, not to mention i also heard very vivid sounds like someone calling my name even tho im alone, it once got to a point where i cant tell the difference between whats real and whats not, i literally got up one day and had a normal day and visited some relatives and stuff only to return home and settle down then when i ask mom about it she said that none of that ever happened. Nowadays im trying to know myself better and thats when i recognised something about myself, im not someone as in one person, i have 3 ppl inside with different personalities and lives and opinions and tendencies and thoughts, all different and apart from each other. 1 is venom, aka the evil gorey psychopathic one, she doesnt wanna be saved or fixed she just loves destroying ppl. 2 is crybaby, aka the inner child that never had the chance to be, the kind soft one that is suffering and begging for help and love. 3 is mirror, the one who is mostly in control, the masked austistic but normal to some extent one",

      "text": "I am a year 12 student(17yo) and I want to apply for medicine. I know that it is a very demanding course but I guess it’s something that I want to do (or maybe what I have been told my entire life). I am so lost.  \nI will have my UCAT soon, many other tests from college, but the problem is that I don’t care about any of that. I don’t know why I need to do it. Maybe I don’t want it bad enough to do anything about it. Maybe I am too lazy? I can feel the disappointment from my parents if I won’t do well. I need to revise but all I do is nothing. \n\nI cry, a lot.I also love sleeping. I haven’t really felt happy in a long time. When I see people I will smile, I will talk to them, I will laugh but inside I will always feel emptiness. I think I have lost interest in life. I don’t know why I live and I don’t really have a point of life. I stopped enjoying many things or if I didn’t, then the feeling when I do them have definitely changed. Most of the time I just want to disappear, but you can’t really do it, can you? Yes, I did think about dying but I dont want to do it. I just want my pain to disappear, not my entire life. I think I hate my life and myself too.   \nI live in a different country (UK) and I moved here for a reason. People in here are different and they judge me, all the time, for who I am. I feel like I am losing myself, forgetting who I really am and just become someone who I desperately don’t want to be. My friends are not really my friends, even if they love me, they were the ones to make me even more insecure and hurt me with their phrases without understanding it. I don’t blame them for that, because I see that pattern in a lot of British people I meet (and I don’t want to offend anyone, it was just my experience, and I still have met many amazing british people whom I consider my good friends). I feel very lonely. I live with my family but it’s a different story, however, I love them a lot.   \nI also overeat and binge eat quite often - I think it might be because of stress, boredom or whatever else it can be. I didn’t think about food that much before, but now I do. It even became harder to concentrate on tasks like hw or revision. When I am bored I would just go to kitchen and eat whatever is the first thing I see. \n\n I am trying to change. I am trying to exercise more, do plans for a day, trying to be nice to myself but it’s hard to be nice to someone you hate that much, I am really trying but I don’t think its enough. I am too lazy to actually change anything, even small changes are hard. I don’t want to just exist, I want to find something I like to do, I want to be happy, I want to have real friends who will not judge me for who I am, I just really want to be happy again and know what I want to do in future. To be successful. \n\nThank you for taking time to read all that :)",

And also if you guys have any tips on how to handle it can you share please?\n(Info you might not care about) \n School is starting soon and I've been anxious the past week waking up thinking about it and getting a stomach ache, mid day thinking about it and going to sleep with one while thinking about it. Ive thrown up and cried because of the anxiety while af school I've tried to drop out, i went virtual and ended up getting held back and now go to a charter school but it just comes back every day and now im unable to leave early.  I've cramped a whole 5 months of work in half because i hated school so i can continue more classes but at home but now im no longer able to do so and it feels even worse knowing that i cant leave 2 months early.",

It’s raw, personal, and at times difficult—but it’s also filled with moments of love, confusion, and growth.\n\nI wrote this for anyone who has lived with mental illness in their family, who’s ever felt alone in their childhood, or who’s still trying to make sense of their past.\n\nMy goal isn’t just to tell my story—it’s to start a conversation, raise awareness, and hopefully help someone else feel seen.\n\nIf this resonates with you, I’d love for you to check it out. I’m also happy to answer any questions or just talk about your own experiences.\n\n\n\n[Tears Of Glass](http://tearsofglass.org)\n\nThanks for reading—and for being part of a space where stories like this matter.",

It felt like it was the way reality actually is. Can other people really help me? People say they’ve tried helping me or that they want to help me. But I feel like it never works.\nI’m not understandable enough. So who else WILL understand me? Nobody. \n\nWhen I think back to “Nobody is going to save you”, i think back to when i was a kid. My mother helping me whenever i got injured.\nBut now, as I get older and older, you have to help yourself. It’s the way life is. You can’t always have help for something.\nI’ve cleaned my own cuts, bruises, illnesses. All I had to do was walk to the pharmacy, buy medicine, and then that’s it.\nProps to the people who made the medicine though.\n\nBut, after all these years of suffering with mental health issues like my depression, anxiety, relapses, i’ve realized that nobody will put up with me forever. I can only save myself. I can only help myself. Only I can do it.\nNobody else is me. Nobody else CAN understand me. \n\nAll I can do is take the lead for myself from now on, look past myself and start thinking new.\nBut would i really be myself then? \n\n\n\nI have more perspectives on this as well!

I'm 13 and she still wakes me up every morning, makes me breakfast, reminds me to brush my teeth and shower (for previous mental health reasons, i ended up having a habit where i would forget to perform basic hygiene), and she would spend time with me in my room when she could literally be doing anything else with her life.\n\nSo, this morning we were going to a football event bc she absolutely loves football, it's her favorite sport and she met my dad at a viewing party, so ig she likes it more bc of that. It was hot, and we were all thirsty, so i volunteered to go out to the car, mainly bc i dont rlly trust myself to look after 2 seperate children under the age of 5 while my mom is gone for however long it takes her. I have a really hard time with directions so it took me around 15 minutes to even find the car, and when i looked for the money we needed for drinks, i just couldn't find it. I spent probably 10 minutes trying to find this stupid 15 dollars for a few bottles of water, and i just could not find it.\n\nEventually she comes back and is really annoyed and pissed bc we had gotten good seats and had to leave early bc my little siblings were complaining abt being thirsty. She basically like yelled at me the entire ride home abt how im incompetent and that ill never amount to anything in life. She also called it disgusting that i forget to shower, and she said she was concerned. I'm sure she was but she just continued to yell at me abt how im a disappointment. She hasn't talked to me at all since then and that is really unusual for her bc she always wants to spend time with me, even if i dont want to spend time with her. And in that car i realized that everything she told me was true. I am disgusting, im a disappointment, i'll probably never amount to anything in my life because im so lazy. It made me think abt just wanting to say fuck it and steal some pills from our medicine cabinet to like idk die or smth.\n\nit sounds really childish and like im immature for being scared that at 13 years old my mom will stop making my breakfast and reminding me to be a decent human being but idk what to do and i js want support ig.",

I went on a date the other day and he said I was acting retarded over texts when we argued and how I’m more chill in person and he’s not the only person who called me retarded upon the first time meeting me. Other dates would joke and use the word even my ex boyfriend I’ve been with and when he was mad I wouldn’t cook breakfast one day he called me a retard.\n\nI’ve never been called this word in my life, retard, until I was in the mental institution when I didn’t need to be. I was in there a few times before when someone put something in my drink and they diagnosed me with schizophrenia and psychosis. The doctor told me to stay on my medicine since I kept getting off else it would be harder if I have another episode to come back from but I haven’t had an episode in years. Other psych doctors said I don’t show signs of schizophrenia or psychosis and I feel the meds I was forced messed me up when I was recently in there all because of my dad. Even family members would say it like my aunts and cuzzins using the word in front of everyone but making eye contact with me when saying retarded. When I was living with a friend she said when she first met me she thought I was retarded, she wouldn’t tell me why. My best friend told me that her boyfriend and his friend asked her if I was slow and if something was wrong with me when they first met me since I looked slow. Should I get back on medicine to see if they can reverse this look? I feel like I feel normal but I’m getting depressed thinking about how the meds probably messed me up since I’m getting called retarded even by coworkers and all when I never did in my life.",

I’m mostly good w lows every so often. \n\nMy friend and colleague switched to a new job and he has less to do so he calls me every few days. He’s in his 40s but been married for like 25 years. His wife frequently drinks too much, again job is very self propelled but it’s a slow start so the success and self worth he got from his last job is lacking. \n\nThis has been going on for a few months, and I’m just over it. I’ve suggested some medicinal type therapy, as he’s turned off by the traditional route. He won’t separate or divorce (even w grown kids). I just listen & don’t advise anymore. But is there a boundary I should make? Today I didn’t answer his call. He tells me I’m one of his only friends. Any advice on how to distance myself without being a dick? Am I one for asking this?",

I took sertraline for a year and a half, but I stopped because they wanted to prescribe me more medication, and I refuse to live on multiple pills at the same time.\n\nSince the beginning of the treatment, I've noticed significant changes in my behavior: I've become more agitated, lively, and full of energy, as if I could do a thousand things at once. Now, it's been a week since I stopped, and I feel like my mind is even more confused than before I started.\n\nSometimes I feel like I'm \"disconnected\" from reality, as if my consciousness and subconscious have switched places. It's as if I'm present, yet distant at the same time, and everything around me seems unreal. At times, I feel like I'm reliving old memories or fragments of the past. My vision also changes: sometimes everything seems in high definition, other times it seems in low resolution.\n\nFurthermore, I feel like something is wrong inside my brain, but I can't explain or prove it.  My behavior, which has been unstable since adolescence, seems to have worsened. It's also becoming increasingly difficult to leave the house: I feel confused, lost, aimless, as if I have a fog in my mind that prevents me from thinking or focusing. Other times, it's the opposite: I perceive everything around me too intensely.\n\nI know many will say it is because of the sudden withdrawal of the medication, but the problem is; I've had this feeling of not living in reality since my adolescence, so much so that because of this I don't remember anything from that time other than a few fragments of memory. When I started taking sertraline, it seemed like the medicine diverted my attention from these problems and left me in a world of my own.",

      "text": "I'm 16 and starting junior year in a couple days. Over the summer, I've been taking this Law studies course to make up for a class that I took my freshman year and didnt do to well in. By doing this course recovery, it is enabling me to raise my GPA and replace the poor grade I got in that last course. \n\nThe online class isn't exaclty difficult. Read a bunch of words, open a couple drop downs, answer a few questions and occassionally do an actual assignment that requires me to do some extra work. On the surface, they're pretty easy. But for me I feel like I can't find any motivation to do them. I end up procrastinating on them and pushing them to the back burner. Over time, they end up stacking up.\n\nI feel like I'm not deliberately not doing them just because I'm lazy, I just genuinely can't find it in me to do them because my mind needs more stimulation to be able to push forward. In that law class i took in person in freshman year, I ended with D's simply because I wasn't doing the easy assignments. They were constant 5 minute videos with 7 questions to answer. In my mind, I felt like I wasn't learning anything. I wanted more stimulation. I ended up doing the same thing, and procrastinating on them and not doing them as they continued to pile up. I didn't come to realize this until now, because it's happening again.\n\nI've come to notice that when I'm doing these online assignments, I open them up, begin working on them, then everything around me becomes more important, and I start fidgeting. Did I drink enough water today? When is it time to take my cough medicine again? What time will I finish this? And I'm even doing random things with my hands. Im taking nail clippers and clipping my nails, drawing doodles on random sticky notes, etc. Even when I'm like in segments of video games where nothing's going on I'm doing these things. Although, they only happen regarding stufff online. When I'm at school, I don't ever have these issues. I'm fully focused.\n\nFor this online class, when a student doesn't turn in work, their parents are notified of how long its been since the student had last turned in an assignment. For me, it was 2 weeks, and when my mom saw this she was angry with me. I tried to explain to her how I'm genuinely trying to get them done, but I'm having a difficult time. I understand that in life not everything I do is going to be mind stimulating or entertaining and that I need to get it done. I've explained this to her and she seemed to have some kind of understanding, but she keeps on trying to push me to get more assignments in to hurry and finish the course. \n\nShe mentioned bringing my dad into it. She wants to show him how many assignments I havent done. My dad doesnt really take into account how i'm feeling on the inside and normally only sees things from the outer perspective. When i try to explain how I'm feeling at all I feel like my feelings are just disregarded. I know he's going to give me some kind of discipline. My mom also wants to show my grandparents that I haven't turned in these assignments, but I know they also won't understand. They're older and they'll just tell me \"just get the assignments in\" \"stop making excuses\" when in reality it isn't that simple and I feel like no one believes me and that I have a problem or something that no one believes it's a genuine thing that I have.\n\nNo one understands me, and it's stressing me out. Am I just too in my head about this whole stimulation thing? Please help!",

From what she's told me she's starting off the clonazepam very small and they'll work her up to higher doses. She speaks to the doctor again in a month.\n Are all these okay to take together?

I will wake up and I genuinely don’t feel in control of my brain. I can still have the thoughts like “I, me, mine” with the idea of first person and overship over my own thoughts, but it doesn’t feel like I’m in control of it. Like I’m in control of these thoughts but at the same time that they aren’t my thoughts or that I’m getting lost in them or the thoughts just feel like they aren’t “clicking” together in my brain. Almost like my brain is unable to form a connection to these thoughts fully being from myself. \n\nMy med list is Vyvanse, Propranolol, Caplyta, Magnesium, Fiber, and Zinc. I would like to point out that I was only on Caplyta, Propranolol, Fiber, and Magnesium when this first started and that it was right after I started taking the Magnesium. I just don’t feel the connection with my medicine with it because it happens so rarely (once a month) and I take my medicine every night besides the Vyvanse which I take during the day.\n\nI will say that it usually happens around 10am-4pm because I’m usually on a midnight schedule but just started nursing school so I’m on a daylight schedule now and it just happened at 12:30 am which is the earliest it’s ever happened. \n\nI’ve also taken my medicine at 8 am no matter what, the only medicine I’ve changed what time I take it is my Vyvanse which I will take at 6 pm whenever I work my 7 pm - 7 am midnights. I take it at 8 am with the rest of my medication whenever I have class from 9 am - 3:30 pm. \n\nI’m not necessarily looking for solid medical advice, just kinda to see if anyone else has experienced this.",

I’m scared people think I’m nothing but miserable and never see the nice sides while also being scared that people don’t see how much I struggle. I struggle with chronic mental illnesses and I try my best and sometimes it just isn’t enough. In those moments I feel like I’m failing. I feel so unpleasant. I feel like it’s what no one wants. I think “how many times can I talk about my feelings until it gets to be too much?”. Sometimes it’s exactly that for people. \n\nI just got out of a relationship where when I’d talk about my feelings and the responses were “just let it all go/nothing matters/try harder/just stop being miserable/just stop caring about everything/you’re nothing but negative.” And it was understandable sometimes but unfair at others. I’d have normal conversations and they’d slip in that I’m nothing but negative. We talked about our experiences in school and mine happened to be negative and I addressed it as such and that made me “too negative.” Its a low point in my life, my self esteem is crushed, nothing is going on, I have no social life, I never leave this house, I’m unmedicated rn and the medicine I’ve took in the past can’t change my brain, I’m a little behind in life and none of it is by choice and I try my best to be alright. \n\n\nIt’s like no matter what I say it’s not the right words. That they’re all wrong. That I don’t get it right. That I can’t say anything. I don’t know what to do and how to express myself. Even when I feel okay I feel like that. I can’t change all of the things that are wrong with me. I live with it but it shows up. There’s nothing I can permanently take or do that will fix me. There’s frustrating responses I get. No matter how I talk about what’s in my head they either get the wrong idea or they see what I mean and it’s all bad. People have admired me most before they got to know me. I don’t wanna be that person. I see other people like me and I don’t wanna be like them. I see how people talk about people like me and I don’t want to be that. I write so many mental health tips I can practice so I’m alright. There’s only so much I can do but all I can do to be alright comes from myself. I wish I was ideal.",

      "text": "I've been with this same mental health clinic for almost 10 years. And for most of those years, I've seen a therapist and a psychiatrist/nurse practitioner to prescribe/monitor medication. For the last year or so, I've felt like I have reached a point where I no longer need therapy. I have been taking the same meds for years and my issues I feel like are now in a good place as long as I at least have my meds. They regularly drug test me and I have never failed, nor have I had any substance abuse issues in the past.\n\nThey require you to be active in therapy in order to receive medication. Since I have not been active for awhile in therapy (but continued my medication appointments), today they threatened to close my case entirely and cut me off if I do not make a therapist appointment tomorrow. Should I try to reason with them (look, I've been with you guys for almost 10 years, I feel like im in a good place now and do not need therapy at this time. But cutting off my meds would cause a considerable issue, is there any way you can make an exception for me?)\n\n Is this policy common across most mental health clinics? Because I would just switch to another, but if I'm going to have a really hard time finding one that will just provide me with medication management and I might have to bite the bullet and waste my time talking to a therapist?\n\nAny advice would be appreciated",

I've completely stopped the zoloft and have started lowering the lithium slightly. I don't want to be in five medications for the rest of my life. What if I need medications for my physical body and I have to add even more? I don't know what this amount of medication will do to me in the long run.

I miss feeling better because I did for a while there. Why is it *so much* and why is there nothing else I can do. Why does my brain have to be so bad at functioning that without medication I'd be so anxious I couldn't walk, too depressed to move, and delusional and psychotic. \n\nI'm probably going to have the doctor put me back on zoloft and/or put the lithium back at its old dose. Maybe this will affect my body in the long run but at least I won't be like this anymore. We'll see what he thinks is best ig\n\nWhat kind of life is this?\n\nIs this common?

It was the most insane experience, and that says a lot lol.\nBut, Good news, even though I’m still working on my footing, I’m so much flipping happier.

I had spent a year trying to find the right medication but the side effects were always too overwhelming for me. He shared how one of his friends judged him for dating someone who “goes to therapy”. I thought it was strange that he would share that. I told him a vulnerability of mine was that I feel like people treat folks with mental health issues like they are incapable of being stable. \n\nFast forward, I am 8 months in a relationship with 31M. One night I went with my friends to his place because I suspected cheating. I heard bed squeaking and noises. This wasn’t the healthiest response to go to his house or to continue a relationship where I couldn’t trust someone. He told me if I thought something was going on why didn’t I “bang on the door”. After just feeling exhausted by this relationship, I decided to block him and heal alone.\n\nHe’s been texting and calling me from another number claiming to be afraid of me but concerned about my wellbeing and hopes I get medicated. I haven’t seen or called him. I only went immediately after my breakup to leave his belongings.\n\nI just feel like I can see through this and know his intentions were to hurt me. I have been unemployed, uninsured and struggling to find a job amidst no longer being able to afford therapy. He knows this so this whole thing feels malicious, toxic and manipulative. I am not mentally unstable despite my challenges and I find people who pathologize people with mental health challenges disgusting. This whole thing just reaffirms that I will be okay alone.",

It's just day TWO. \n\nWhat happened:\n\nLong story short, I'm in a relationship that the problem is the other person's parents. We are both uni students but the other person's parents aren't okay with our relationship. This situation created a lot of problems.\n\nToday I decided to tell my gf that I want some space until she decides what she will do. This thing happened to me with my previous relationship too. I can't stand it twice...\n\nI didn't want to tell my gf that I need distance because I can't without her, and I love her, but the situation was only making me worse. \n\nFrom yesterday I don't take my medication to punish myself for something I don't even think I had another option. Now without my meds I feel worse and worse. I have depressive, psychotic episodes and panic attacks.\n\nThe worst part is that I know cutting my meds is the worst thing I could do, but I can't persuade myself to do else. \n\nThis is not an asking help post, I just wanted to write and get it out.\n\nThanks for reading till the end.",

I'm unable to hold a job anymore and feels like I hit my limit months ago, I don't know how I'm still alive. I have extreme brain fog and can't focus or remember anything anymore, I'm so anxious constantly that my hands shake and my chest feels like its been hit with a hammer and its often difficult to breathe. I've been seeing a therapist I really trust for years, and I've jumped from a couple different psychiatrists and LOTS of different medications in the past year. some of the medications have brought me temporary relief but then I go back to feeling awful. my therapist has taught me a lot about myself recently and has tried teaching me methods to improve my wellbeing but none have worked. I genuinely hate my life and hate myself and I wish I was dead every second of every day. I have many friends and family that love and care about me. it seems like I just need to find the proper medication but I've tried so many and don't feel any better. any advice is appreciated, thank you",

What experiences have you guys had taking those medications? Additionally, if any psychiatrists or GPs see this, I'd appreciate your input. Thank you so much!",

Felt amazing at first and my sex drive came back. Now it’s been weeks of a lot of anxiety returning. I don’t *want* to go back on Prozac because the sexual side effects kind of suck. But I’m also fairly uninterested in sex now anyways since the anxiety has returned. \n\nMy main issue is the physical symptoms (feelings of adrenaline and loss of appetite/weight loss). It’s so frustrating and makes me spiral. I’m going to ask about a beta blocker and/or Buspar to try. My hope is that if I can get the physical sensations under control the rest will follow.

Now im about to take my meds and realized I only have one 75mg capsule left, and 2 150mg's do NOT add up to 225mg! \n\nI dont know what to do other than call my pharmacist or Dr tomorrow to find out what I *can* do. I dont want to take an extra 75mgs if im not supposed to but now im worried about what happens when I take 75mg less after being at 225 for so long!",

I can barely move and am mainly knocked out in bed all day. \n\nIf you don't have side effects from the medications, please let me know this and please let me know what medications these are that are so easy to handle. I met 2 people at the psych-ward that didn't have side effects and we were all on Abilify! Makes me wonder if I'm under a spell from the Devil that is written about in the Bible and Muslim Quran.

The reason I am reaching out to this forum, is because I am hoping to see whether I can find people to relate to my experience, or even just some friendly advice. So, I was offcially diagnosed with GAD last July of 2024 and I was given Cipralex 10mg but I never took it since I wanted to attempt to heal naturally (I am not against medication but I wanted to use it as a last resort). The anxiety symptoms did persist and I did experience a mild breakup over the course of the year but overall I was handling it pretty well (most likely bc I was in my head a lot). However, I was faced with a new issue of not sleeping. It began on the nights where I wouldn't be working a lot or I wasn't very busy, and then it gradually kept getting worse until I found myself in the ER. I recently made a DR appointment about a month ago and I was told to actually start taking the cipralex so I can treat the anxiety (since it was suspected that my nightly panic attacks were bc of my anxiety even though I was fine during the day). I've been on it for about a month now and I would say it's going okay, my sleep has improved a little and I don't notice my anxiety symptoms as much but I did notice that last Wednesday I started experiencing depressing thoughts ( but I didn't know if it was because I was in my luteal phase/ was close to getting my period). I got my period yesterday and I noticed that the thoughts are still somewhat there even tho they weren't ever an issue before. I did have a follow up appt with my DR yesterday and she suggested to increase my dose to 20 mg and then she'll reasses me in a month. She does also suspect I might have innattentive adhd, and idk if that's much help. I apologize for the long post, but Im just so baffled on what to do bc I don't know if these thoughts are bc of the medication or just a coincidence because of my hormones and I'm so confused on whether the cipralex is actually doing anything.",

But here's the truth, some of us genuinely need them, just like others require insulin or beta blockers for conditions like high blood pressure.\n\nIf you're like me and have tried everything, therapy, supplements, lifestyle adjustments, for years and are still trapped in your room by debilitating anxiety, stop waiting. Seek out medication and start living your life right now, today!\n\nYour time is now! You deserve to live in the moment.\n\nWould you rather spend the next 20, 40, or more years bedridden just because most people are against medication?\n\nIt's strange, people accept smoking weed or drinking alcohol in excess, but the moment you take a benzo, it's considered wrong. That's unfair!\n\nLike benzos, weed and alcohol have long-term effects. Everything does! Even the water you drink and the air you breathe contain harmful substances.\n\nIf you're constantly worrying about what will happen in 20 or 40 years, you may never truly enjoy your life.\n\nIn my family, my mom and several others have been on benzos and SSRIs for 40+ years, and they’re in their 60s, 70s, 80s, and 90s now, completely healthy because they've never abused them.\n\nIf you need benzos every day to live a fulfilling life, go for it! Just be mindful not to misuse them.\n\nIf SSRIs are what you need, take them. Life is unpredictable, you might have a few years or several decades left, so why waste time feeling nauseous, overwhelmed by intrusive thoughts, and depressed, stuck at home?\n\nYou can live a normal life, get a job, or pursue an education. Do whatever it takes to feel better, without worrying about what others think, and focus solely on the present.\n\nI hope everyone reading this feels better soon, just like I have since accepting that I need medication. I’m not concerned about side effects that may or may not show up in 30 or 40 years. I'll cross that bridge when I get there.\n\nFor now, I'm choosing to live my life fully, happy and functional, rather than spend decades in isolation, suffering, just because society stigmatizes medication.",

      "text": "Hi everyone,\n\nI’m reaching out to get some advice on a frustrating and concerning situation I’ve been dealing with. A few months ago, I fractured my pinky finger, and the surgeon prescribed a specific splint to keep my finger in the proper position while it healed. Unfortunately, the nurse who handled my treatment ignored the surgeon’s instructions and put a standard finger sprain splint on instead, which ended up causing significant nerve damage to my finger.\n\nAfter advocating for myself and seeking second opinions, I visited two different doctors who basically told me that surgery to repair the nerve damage is too risky and could lead to more complications. They’ve recommended physiotherapy and exercises to try and manage the nerve pain, but the damage is apparently irreversible at this point. It’s extremely frustrating because this situation feels like it was entirely avoidable had the medical team followed proper procedures.\n\nThe doctors mentioned that I’ll likely experience nerve pain for the rest of my life, which has been really hard to process. I’m also struggling with a lot of trust issues now when it comes to doctors, especially given my past experiences with failed surgeries.\n\nHas anyone here gone through something similar? What treatments or therapies have you found helpful for nerve damage or injuries like this? I’d love to hear about any alternative treatments, exercises, or even holistic approaches that helped manage the pain or improved recovery. I’m feeling a bit lost on what steps I can take next.\n\nAlso, I’m wondering if anyone has dealt with medical malpractice in a case like this. Is there anything I can do legally about the negligence that occurred, or am I just stuck with these consequences?\n\nAny advice or personal stories would be greatly appreciated. Thanks for taking the time to read.",

Friends/family can’t help me out regularly. I feel stuck.\n\nHas anyone figured out anything that works when you’re in this position?\n\nAre there any free ride programs for medical stuff? How do you even ask for help when you don’t have money to offer? Or did you just have to go without? This is really affecting my mental health. It's demoralizing that my insurance covers the cost of the help but I can't afford to get there. Any tips would be appreciated.",

Initially, my therapist recommended just depression, but I feel like its my anxiety that causes my depressed states. \n\nI don't think I experience anxiety in the typical way where I have a lot of panic attacks and cry often. I still do experience them but not a lot. In high stress times, I normally dissociate really hard and go numb. This normally leads to being depressed. I think I've had a hard time coming to terms with my depression because I normally stay quite functional and can still complete the tasks I need to complete, I just feel like a robot doing it though. \n\nI'm going to talk to my doctor today about starting medication and what would work best for me. My mental health has been pretty bad lately, and I've heard some medications can periodically make things worse because it throws off your hormones, which scares me a bit. \n\nIf you have some advice, encouragement or success stories with starting medication I'd love to hear about it :) thank you",

      "text": "During a 6 day hospital stay recovering from a spinal fusion (L3,L4,L5) 3 of my psych meds were naglected for 4 consecutive days, while under the influence of heavy narcotics, so it took me 4 days to know that that was what I was experiencing. I called them out and asked for a print out of everything that was given to me (when who and what med). They sent me home after only being on the correct regimen for only a day and a half, when skilled nursing was originally planned. Surgery was 45ish days early (rushed in) due to out of uncontrol pain for over a month (mentally debilitating). I made sure, provided lists and brought my home meds, because I knew the importance and the likelihood of the hospital not having certain medications stocked. I can keep going, but the constant traumatic experiences, worse than what led me to my relapse, most of 7 years of inpatient, 84 ECT treatments, throughout which I did gain 5 years of sobriety. But ive been my only cheerleader outside of my treatment team and thats why this is so hard. I've been working with my surgery team since 2019 when my treatments started. So they knew the fragility of my psychiatric needs and I was still naglected, and still am. Im homeless now, on disability, trying to learn how to be independent, and its impossible.  Compensation would help, but really what needs to happen is change. WE NEED to raise the success rate for survival throughout this broken world/system. I am why I made this far, but I need help. The hospital completed 3 investigations and still find themselves not at fault. I SH after being in remission for over 2 years (has been my go to 3× since, was tortured when inpatient psych without any pain meds 2 1/2 wks post-op(with absolutely zero orthopedic support,  what so ever), lived 3 days on a mountain before finding my way, but became stranded in a small town in an abusive, neglectful, transitional housing program claiming to help with mental health recovery along side of 97% of the \"centers\" population are recovering straight out of prison, fresh out of their addiction, dealing with CPS. All of which my trauma stemmed from which led me to my instatutionization, my gruesome, almost 10 year long recovery, all my personal growth in the last 2 years just trying (I NEVER STOP TRYING) to relearn my 90% memory loss due to all of the treatments in just a 2 yr period. I couldn't even process what I was looking at for months if not years (i dont remember, 😆) All of this work i have done, with my own amazing advocation skills, by myself, surviving the system, i will never add up enough in my mothers eyes to get my, now 13 yo daughter back. Who suffers dearly from mental health. I was adopted and an only child, so my mother and the rest of my huge adopted family, unfortunately extremely judgemental, who gossip, who will always see themselves above me and my 3 girls who struggle with mental health and addiction, simply due to the fact of misunderstanding and the stigma. I PROMISE YOU THIS!! I WILL NEVER STOP TRYING!! \nI need help because all the system wants to do is protect itself. \nI NEED HELP!",

But then, by the second day, the effects drop off completely. It feels like I haven’t taken anything at all. I’ve tried taking breaks of several days (or even longer), but even then, when I take it again, the Day 1 effect doesn’t return. It’s like my brain adapts instantly and just shuts it down after the first exposure.\n\nI also deal with anhedonia (lack of motivation/pleasure), which is why I tried TMS (transcranial magnetic stimulation) — but unfortunately I didn’t respond to it either. I’m now considering deep TMS (dTMS), but I’m wondering:\n\t•\tCould this extreme sensitivity or tolerance to meds be causing my anhedonia?\n\t•\tOr is the anhedonia blunting my ability to feel the effects of meds?\n\t•\tHas anyone else experienced this across multiple med types?\n\nThis has been really frustrating and disheartening, and I’d really appreciate any insight, similar experiences, or ideas to bring to my psychiatrist.\n\nThank you so much in advance.",

      "text": "I’m a mom of three, working fulltime in cybersecurity, trying to survive one of the hardest years of my life. I manage everything: finances, insurance, school forms, emotional regulation. My husband is autistic and kind at heart. He does most of the housework (cooking, laundry, dishes), which I only asked for while finishing my degree, (10 years on and off, finally completed this spring). But when he’s overwhelmed, he either shuts down or lashes out,mostly at my 7yearold son. I try to shield my son and respond calmly, but it’s retraumatizing, especially when I’m already running on fumes.\n\nIn June, my mom died after a year of caretaking and medical trauma. I was her primary caregiver and had to plan everything while staying strong for everyone else. I took two weeks of bereavement/FMLA, and during that time, everything spiraled: our mortgage bounced, daycare fell behind. I rushed back to work so we wouldn’t collapse further.\n\nSince then, I’ve been working 10–12 hour days, sometimes 16 when a crisis hits. I’m constantly on edge, waiting for the next disaster. It’s not paranoia, it just keeps happening.\n\n* I’ve lost 20+ pounds without trying.\n* Most days I barely eat more than a protein shake or bar.\n* I often cry while eating standing up, just grabbing whatever’s closest.\n* When I’m not working, I’m in bed, numb or overwhelmed. Then I drag myself through tasks like a ghost.\n* I’m failing at a work ticket I’ve spent months on. I have 3 days left before code review & I’m still not there.\n* I don’t feel like a parent, just a house manager trying to prevent another collapse.\n\nI’m on meds (Vyvanse, Lamictal, restarted 7/3, Hydroxyzine, Ambien as needed). I see both a psychiatrist & therapist. I stopped Clonazepam in June due to family judgment. I tried two other mood stabilizers Oct–Jan & an antidepressant in Feb that caused severe panic attacks. It scared me off Lamictal until May. I missed a dose (mom passed), paused, and restarted recently. I’m trying, but nothing has brought real stability.\n\nI suspect PMDD, my worst crashes hit the week before my period. I had a pregnancy loss & emergency surgery in May, days before my mom’s final emergency surgery. She died three weeks later.\n\nMy youngest needs open heart surgery in October & will be on antibiotics for six months. I’ve used 8 FMLA days already. There’s no one else managing the bills, school deadlines, or medical forms. There is no safety net.\n\nMeanwhile, my husband overdrafted twice last month & didn’t tell me. I found out through our finance app and had to cover it. He says he’s ashamed to ask for help, he’s said that for years, even though I make more & I’ve never held it against him. I keep telling him: communicate. I’ve owned my mistakes (including overspending last year). But I track due dates, request extensions, & have kept my pmt history up. He avoids it until it’s too late. I’ve begged him to ask before it becomes a crisis. He doesn’t.\n\nI’m posting here not for emergency help, but because I need to know: has anyone survived this kind of burnout and grief? How do you keep going when you’re the only thing holding it all up?\n\nWhat helped you come back from it, mentally, physically, emotionally, when surviving felt like your only job?\n\nPlease don’t tell me to “just get help” if that means inpatient or quitting my job. I wish I could. But I can’t, not with three kids, a mortgage, medical bills, and major surgery ahead.\n\nI want to believe healing is still possible, even from here.",

I’m not even on medication. Does it mean I’m not really depressed and just gluttonous? I feel so ashamed. I’m trying my hardest to drop this habit, but I can help but gorge myself into a trance everytime I feel like spiraling down. Even that feels funny to say. As of now, I couldn’t sleep and got up at 3am to down a fat piece of cake. I wasn’t even hungry. It just felt good and spontaneous. I’d never admit it to anyone in real life as to not make myself a mockery. Not that I even have anyone. I cry from what I’m doing to my body. Can’t even fit into clothes and I’m isolating out of shame. \n\nHopefully this was my last time and I’ll learn my lesson. Can’t even sleep from all the sugar, so I guess today I’ll pledge to never do it again, which I’ll inevitably fail, since I’m too lazy to ever do something proactive for myself.",

      "text": "Hi everyone,\n\nI’m sharing this anonymously because I’ve been going through something layered and hard to explain.\n\nLast year, I was diagnosed by a psychiatrist with dysthymia (persistent depressive disorder) and prescribed Escitalopram and Clonazepam. I took them regularly for a few months, but I didn’t feel much relief. Instead, I began experiencing noticeable side effects—my monthly cycle became irregular, I gained weight, and eventually found myself unable to sleep without the medication. I felt emotionally flat, disconnected, and started depending on the meds just to function. So, I gradually tapered off and stopped taking them completely on my own.\n\nFor about six months after, I avoided psychiatric care. But things worsened—I now experience intense fear when around people, and that fear sometimes leads to extreme physical symptoms, especially diarrhea up to 12 times a day. It’s not triggered by food, and even anti-diarrhea meds don’t work during those episodes. It’s exhausting.\n\nRecently, I started seeing a psychologist, and she diagnosed me with PTSD and complex PTSD (CPTSD). I’ve been reading about CPTSD and honestly, it feels like my current symptoms map onto it much more than dysthymia ever did—especially the chronic fear, emotional overwhelm, dissociation, physical gut reactions, and long-standing trauma from relationships and early life stress.\n\nNow I’m confused. Was the previous diagnosis of dysthymia wrong? Were the medications unnecessary, or mismatched to my real condition? I don’t want to discredit the psychiatrist—but I feel frustrated that no one explained these possibilities earlier. I’m just trying to understand the disconnect and how to move forward.\n\nHas anyone experienced something similar? A shift from a mood diagnosis to trauma-based diagnosis? Or felt more harmed than helped by medication before understanding the root cause?\n\nI’d love to hear your experiences, especially around CPTSD, medication, misdiagnosis, or healing. Kindly help me on this!",

No emotion of any kind at it's deth. \n\n20y old male and never had a crush in my life. Never wanted to be loved or love. Never had feelings, never had interest. \n\nI don't attach to any people really. I never really feel sad or happy, and if someone insults me I truthfully have no mental reaction at all negatively or positively.\n\nNo clue when the last time I was angry, happy, depressed.

      "text": "I have a question: My now ex-boyfriend has a history of mental illness… namely, drug-induced psychosis / psychotic behavior / schizophrenia (or something like that; I am not 100% sure the diagnosis.) He had a year long episode like a break from reality when he was younger, but has been back to “normal” the past few years and off of any medication. When we were together he appeared 100% normal to me and there was never one behavior or thought I felt was off. We were intensely in love, and in May he sent me a long text basically telling me I was the love of his life; that he loved me with his whole mind, body and soul; that I was his person, his “soulmate” and he would never leave me. \n\nShortly thereafter he went on a trip, did some drugs (not exactly sure what but I know at least cannabis edibles) and then started acting / behaving strangely. His family started him back on his old medication. Within a month’s time I caught him cheating which resulted in a default breakup. He started to send me nasty text messages basically telling me he didn’t care about me anymore and many accusations about my character and all the things he disliked about me. \n\nI was wondering if having a psychotic episode and/or starting heavy psychiatric medication can literally change one’s romantic connection / feelings towards someone and/or bring out behaviors like cheating. Seems like a long stretch to me but I am just looking for answers.",

There are like times when I get sudden anxiety attacks or like have an episode of being miserable. I don't know what to do. I am tired of explaining the same stuffs and same issues again and again, same symptoms, same problems, same pain multiple times that now I feel like I better just keep it to myself, however that is also not helping much either. I don't know what should I even say when I am myself not clear about what is all happening with me. Nowadays though I have people around me, I feel like I am alone. I'm thankful for my supportive people around me however I feel bad for them as well since they would get worried when something happens with me.",

I have recently been feeling down again, talked to my doctor and we increased my medicine. \n\nI love my medication, they help me without a doubt. But when I'm through a depressive state it takes a couple weeks for the adjustment to take effect. I generally just try to hang in, but waiting is hard. \n\nI'm looking for advices that will help me cope better until they kick in. What do you guys do when you can basically do nothing? What do you watch, listen, eat and so on?\n\nAlso, I'm scared to rely heavily on medicine, so I want to go lower on the dose some day. Find a way to treat this thing as good as I can. I am okay with being on medicine for the rest of my life but I at least want lower doses. Any advice from you guys that helped to get a hang of this? I'm basically looking for anything from exercise, eating habits, supplements, blood tests... \n\nI appreciate your support. I hope everyone has a good day.",

      "text": "I'm 26(m) and have been taking a combination of medications for years: Adderall XR (20mg) and IR (10mg) to get through the day, Xanax (1mg three times daily) and clonidine (0.1mg twice daily) to calm me down, and Lunesta (2mg) to help me sleep. I also use Wellbutrin (300mg) and memantine (21mg) to manage my major depression and overexcitability. Each day feels like a constant balancing act of chemicals to get by.\n\nI realize this isn't sustainable. I can feel it physically; my nervous system feels drained. The concerning part is that, despite all the medications, I can barely get through the day or sleep, for that matter. Removing even one of these causes everything to collapse. I spiral into chaos. I can't sleep or work. I lose control. And it seems like no provider is willing to handle my case anymore because they consider me \"too complicated.\" They never truly understand how pharmacologically dependent my body has become.\n\nI'm not here for sleep hygiene tips or \"try magnesium.\" I'm looking for others who are in this same place:\n\n* Dependent on a delicate balance of stimulants and sedatives\n\n* Afraid of tapering because life already feels unbearable.\n\n* Struggling between the pain of withdrawal and relying on medication.\n\nI've also tried all the supplements that should help with this, such as magnesium glycinate, taurine, and L-theanine. None of which helps since I'm so deep in polypharmacy and have been for so long. I miss having a baseline. I'm trying not to fall apart. If you've been here or are still here, what helped? How did you start untangling this without losing your job, your sanity, or your ability to function entirely?",

She has a history of psychotic episodes, including delusions, and has been prescribed both antipsychotics and antidepressants. However, she stopped taking her medication months ago, and since then her condition has worsened significantly.\n\nShe’s very withdrawn, confused, and disoriented. She’s also become quite neglected in terms of personal hygiene and living conditions, almost completely alone and isolated.\n\nI recently confronted her gently about it, and although she admits not taking her meds because “they make her feel bad,” she denies needing more help. I’ve offered to accompany her to the psychiatrist and even proposed that she take her meds at my place so I can help monitor, but it's being difficult and she basically refuses.\n\nShe also experienced a previous forced hospitalization at a public center, which traumatized her, so she is very resistant to any kind of institutional care.\n\nRight now, I’m deeply worried about her health and safety. I want to convince her to start medication again and possibly consider voluntary inpatient care, but I’m not sure how to do it without pushing her away.\n\nHas anyone been through this or helped someone in a similar situation? What strategies worked for you to encourage compliance with treatment? Any advice on how to approach this delicate issue?\n\nThanks a lot in advance.",
