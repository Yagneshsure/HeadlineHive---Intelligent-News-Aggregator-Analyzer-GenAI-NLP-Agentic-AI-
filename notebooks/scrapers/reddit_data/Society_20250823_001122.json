      "text": "I saw a post about how some celebrities didn’t really announce to the people they were working with that they had covid. The comments alluded to the fact that the older generation doesn’t take things like covid so seriously so it was just equated to a sickness or illness. In terms of our society, we moved to working online during covid times. Displaying how a lot of the work we do can be done remotely. However 5 years later, do you think that the pandemic had any long term changes within our society or do you think society has kind of forgotten about the hardships of the pandemic and gone back to how we used to be prior to it?",

      "text": "Sorry if this question is a bit complex (I honestly dont know), but I've been taking an interest in sociology and I really came to wonder about this.\n\nOf course, I know there are physiological differences between biological men, women, and intersex (apologies if this isnt the correct term) people, and those directly affect what is capable of being done (for example, only women and maybe [?] some intersex people can properly breastfeed infants. [Side tangent, apparently men have the physical foundational capability, just a lack of hormones for there to be much of any milk produced, who knew?]). But, in general, why are there consistently rules across societies for how a specific gender should act, when it has nothing to do with the undeniable physical differences and capabilities, especially in the modern day? And why are there some things that are tied to a gender for no apparent reason, while being socially enforced (such as pink being a color only for girls, blue being a color only for boys)?\n\nFor example, research has shown that, while there are differences in the size, shape, and density of the brains of both genders, said differences have little to no affect on the actual psychology of the person in question. So, with that in mind, why is it that modern women seem to be taught to be withdrawn/passive/subtle in communication and conduct and men outwardly spoken and/or aggresive in the same? And why is it fairly common to be shamed if you don't want to do either or even want to be the opposite? Its not as if these are the natural mental states and personalities for each gender, nor is there any good physical reason I can think of for this to be the case (women can be just as strong, if not stronger, than the strongest of men, given they have some lucky genetics and lots of hard work. The opposite is also true).\n\nI'm sure much of this stuff is a carry-over from the early days of human society, where it was much more cutthroat and needed more clear divisions in some places (like men *needing* to be strong enough and aggresive enough to help protect and hunt), but it seems really weird to me that it is not only carred over into the modern day, but has no signs of really disappearing despite being seemingly needless and in many ways just causing conflicts (albeit mostly minor conflicts between only a few individuals at a time). \n\nI'd really like some input from people more learned on the subject because, while I did take a sociology class, it was a few years ago and the knowledge didn't really stick with me all that well. I've done my best to communicate the idea, but I can and will elaborate if anything is difficult to understand.",

But considering that America/the world has always had a large antisemitism problem, shouldn't it be in reverse? Ie. Antisemitism seems to have been around longer then the modern concept of Islamophobia, so why do antisemites not mind allying with certain jews but not muslims (considering fringe muslims also hold antisemetic views)?",

      "text": "Hello, I've been reading about the relationship between liberal movements turning into fascism rather than marxism. For example, I learned that the Nazis weaponized the economic discontent during the later Weimar Republic and blamed it on the jewish population. From my perspective, fascism is often associated with palingenetic ultranationalism, supression of dissent, populism, and monopolies. I will define socially liberal as being supportive of  LGBTQ+ rights, racial justice, gender equality, and freedom of expression (essentially, egalitarianism). If it is racially diverse and facing economic hardships, fascism has more opportunities to blame the problems on, creating a nationalistic narrative. If the country is more monolithic and conservative, the economic dynamics stick out more, creating a rich vs poor dynamic. I imagine this would lead to a more marxist society. \n\nCan someone give me an answer from a sociological perspective? Are there any theories or historical examples that explain why a movement on social progress could evolve toward authoritarianism? I'd appreciate any insights or examples that show this. Thank you!",

      "title": "That bit of resentment towards society that you need to be a sociologist.",
      "text": "Maybe I'm projecting, but even if that's true, I still think that a little bit of resentment is needed in order to participate in the (pretended) distance sociology has towards society.\n\nThink of the art critic. What is he a product of? Well, art critique is the reflexive discussion of aesthetics. It is about aesthetics, but not aesthetics itself. In other words, it's the talk about art that artists do when they are not acting as such, when they are not making art. An art critic doesn't need to participate in art to talk about it; he may be incapable of participating in art as other artists do, so he dedicates himself to the equally important task of talking about it. And even if he is an artist himself, in order to talk about it, he has to reject the immediate feeling he may have towards art, therefore departing from art itself (aesthetics comes from aisthetike, which means sensation, necessarily not mediated by concepts).\n\nA sociologist is a result of the same type of relation, but with people in general. To be a sociologist, you have to participate in that same distance—that is, to talk about it without, even if it's impossible, being in it. A sociological explanation always requires, unintentionally, an imposition of the functioning of a theory upon the world: the limitation of some possibilities and the boosting of others. And this needs to happen in spite of the real state of the social world.\n\nTo spend so much time doing that means that the sociologist needs at least some degree of resentment towards the spontaneous development of the people he is a part of. I don't think this is a bad thing, though—I think recognizing this bit of resentment is fundamental to control it and to use it when necessary.\n\nEdit: after reading many responses i think im going to write two more post before returning to the Matter of resentment. One will explain what i mean by distance, the  next one will explain what i mean with description as imposition, then i think It will be easier to understand the place of resentment in all of this.",

      "text": "So I'm just learning about fission-fusiom societies from learning how hyaena and chimpanzee social structure works.\n\nI understand that these social structures come together when they need to and split apart for a variety of reasons.\n\nI feel like a lot of the time all I hear about is collectivism or individualism when it comes to human society but from my personal experience and some of the sources that I've read fission-fusion social structures seem to be more accurate descriptions. Although I may be wrong about this.\n\nEdit: some experts regard fission-fusion dynamics to be more on a scale in animal social systems rather than they being strictly a \"fission-fusion society\". So a person who wakes up to their family, then goes to a different group for work then goes out on their own after work then coming home to their family at the end of the day is considered high fission low fusion, while someone who just stays with their family all day (subsistence farming) is considered high fusion low fission. Importantly neither of these propose that people or either completely collectivistic or individualistic. Or even puts them on such a spectrum.\n\nWhat are you all's thoughts?",

      "text": "When non-sociologists and even sociology students (and probably even some real sociologists) think about social constructs, they often tend to think that social constructs are not real. People think when you say that something is a social construct, it means that thing is fake, it's just an arbitrary invention of society (that you could simply opt out of, for example). This couldn't be further from what Berger and Luckmann argued in their seminal \"The Social Construction of Reality\". \n\nGender/sex is a good example for the problems with this line of thinking. People tend to say: gender is socially constructed, sex is biological. However, if you take constructivism seriously, in fact both, gender *and* sex are social constructs. *Biology* is a social construct. *Science* is a social construct. *Truth* is a social construct. If that doesn't mean that truth is arbitrary, what *does* it mean?\n\nNow, most people would readily accept that gender identity is something that is shaped by culture: How the genders clothe, what kind of occupations, leisure activities, tastes are considered typical for a gender, is obviously changing throughout history. It's trivial to show that gender norms are not universal or fixed, but socially contingent.\n\nHowever, *sex* is where essentialism is reintroduced through the back door. Judith Butler has made the argument that sex is presented as a biological neutral scientific fact. What people have to understand about social constructs is that *this* is what a social construct is: Socially produced categories becoming *objective reality*. It is just as trivial to show that the objective reality of the *sexes* is changing throughout history and different in various cultures around the globe. \n\nThat doesn't mean that sex is completely arbitrary or fake though. Social constructs are not illusions. They are real, but their reality is the result of a social process: they are real because we make them real, through collective recognition and institutional enforcement. Berger and Luckmann call this process objectivation. \n\nSocial constructivism doesn't deny that objective reality exists. Obviously there are bodies, there are observable differences between bodies. You can observe that in a vast majority of cases people wouldn't have a hard time dividing humans into two categories, male and female, by looking at the appendages between their legs. It would be stupid of constructivists to deny this. And they don't. What you have to understand about social constructivism is that it’s not about denying that observable patterns exist in the world, it’s about questioning how we interpret, categorize, and give meaning to those patterns. Social constructivism asks: Why do we draw the line there and not elsewhere? What assumptions underlie those categories? And, more importantly: What do those categories *do* in society, how do they shape institutions, expectations, identities, and access to rights and power? These things are not natural facts. These things evolve over time. They are socially constructed. \n\nPeople mock gender studies for asserting \"gender is a social construct\" and start arguing against a straw man that has nothing to do with actual constructivist thinking. I wish more people actually understood constructivist arguments.",

However, in the framework of the 2024 European Sociological Association’s Conference, held from the 27th to the 30th of August in Porto, the same question was posed, and the results show a significant shift. Today, four of the ten most influential books in analyzing society are written by female sociologists, reflecting a broader recognition of their contributions to the field.\n\nThis transformation is especially relevant, as it highlights the growing recognition of female sociologists as pivotal intellectuals in shaping contemporary thought and driving societal progress. For the first time, their contributions are not only seen as important but also as essential to the development of sociological theory and practice. This acknowledgment of their work reflects a broader societal shift towards inclusivity and equity, emphasizing that women’s perspectives are indispensable to understanding and addressing complex social issues.\n\nThe following is the list of the ten most voted books in 2024, presented in alphabetical order by authors’ surnames:\n\n*Twenty Years at Hull House*, Jane Addams\n\n*Women and Social Transformation*, Elisabeth Beck-Gernsheim, Judith Butler, Lidia Puigvert.\n\n*Distinction: A Social Critique of the Judgement of Taste*, Pierre Bourdieu\n\n*The Second Sex*, Simone de Beauvoir\n\n*Gender Trouble: Feminism and the Subversion of Identity*, Judith Butler\n\n*The Dialogic Society. The sociology scientists and citizens like and use*, Ramon Flecha\n\n*Capital: A Critique of Political Economy*, Karl Marx\n\n*The Sociological Imagination*,\tCharles Wright Mills\n\n*Economy and Society*, Max Weber\n\n*The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism*, Max Weber\n\nThis shift in recognition reflects the evolving understanding of sociology and the increasing influence of women scholars in shaping contemporary sociological thought. Their ideas and research are now recognized as integral to understanding societal transformations, gender dynamics, and social justice, affirming their place as intellectual leaders driving the progress of our societies.\n\nMore information:\n\n[https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/selection-best-sociological-books-without-sexist-bias-ana-wctwf](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/selection-best-sociological-books-without-sexist-bias-ana-wctwf)",

      "text": "Hello! I'm actually an arts student who is considering going for a sociology second degree after I get my BFA. I've been reading a lot about the Asian-American experience and role in US society/politics, as an Asian-American myself. I've been vaguely regretting not trying for it sooner, lol.\n\nLearning about sociology and understanding race as a social construct has always left me wondering how this is dealt with in homogenous societies as whole. There are obviously sociologists who exist in say, Asia, but how is this tackled in terms of research? Do they bother to examine beyond ethnic minorities and other marginalized groups or do they cover/learn about heterogenous societies such as the west? Obviously, one can conduct research in Asia and totally meet non-Asian people there, but obviously Asia consists of a country and its ethnic groups more. I was wondering if this makes sociology education different in the west than Asia.\n\nF",

      "text": "A while ago I read about Shulamith Firestone’s Dialectics of Sex in a sociology class. I was intrigued by the idea that women’s oppression is due to the biological capacity to reproduce. It made me ponder why men are never oppressed for their biology. Men are for instance often likely to have higher testosterone and be physically stronger than women. They are also statistically significantly more likely to exhibit violent behaviour, yet no one ever suggests that we should repress and restrain them until they prove that they can be functional members of society. It’s almost like patriarchal society has collectively decided that biological differences would benefit men and perpetuate women’s oppression. \n\nThe idea that women have historically been-and continue to be- subjugated by men because of their biological functioning seems to reinforce the view that women themselves are responsible for their oppression; that it is not the fault of the larger patriarchal system and men per se and somehow has historically been a predetermined notion that women have to fight to avoid being relegated to a subhuman category. \n\nI know this is not what Firestone’s theory actually proposes. I understand that she does not endorse biological determinism but explains how biological factors are exploited by society to oppress women. I am also well aware that it is solely a woman’s choice whether to give birth and how to follow through with the process. Which is also why I really appreciate Firestone’s works since it encouraged the development of artificial reproductive technologies. Childbirth is also in no way a defining feature of a woman’s identity. However I continue to feel like the way society and men choose to interpret and exploit women’s biology should not be a reason to alter it and no feature inherent to women should be used as an excuse for oppression.",

      "text": "Looking for discussion on applying the sociological imagination to understanding climate anxiety. I find Beck’s risk society framework useful \n\nFor me, eco-anxiety manifests as the pit in my stomach when I watch footage of yet another \"once-in-a-lifetime\" storm or the creeping dread accompanying each new report on accelerating climate change—all while fossil fuel companies continue to post record profits. The weight of this knowledge is crushing, yet paradoxically, I often feel guilty for not knowing more, for not doing more.\n\nDespite decades of environmental involvement, from trekking across remote and wild regions of the Americas to crafting climate change mitigation strategies for the US health care sector, I find myself overwhelmed by the relentless accumulation of anxiety-inducing headlines and events. If I'm struggling, it's no wonder that 27% of Americans report feeling \"very worried\" about climate change - a number that is steadily increasing.\n\nThis widespread anxiety isn't just a personal mental health issue—it's a rational response to a manufactured crisis. The same industries driving climate change also fuel our distress, individualizing a collective problem while sowing doubt about potential solutions. They've mastered a cruel irony: making us simultaneously more dependent on expert knowledge and more distrustful of it. By framing climate anxiety as a private struggle, they obscure their role in creating it. To truly understand and address our shared anguish, we need to recognize it as a deliberate byproduct of a system that profits from both our planet's destruction and our psychological turmoil.\n\nWe need a new way to understand our relationship with climate change and the anxiety it provokes. Neither burning out nor tuning out is viable, especially when the stakes are so high and the impacts so unevenly distributed.",

      "text": "Hello There,\n\nI am currently in my third year of sociology and have noticed, as many have, that the foundations of sociology are quite Eurocentric, given the fact that most \"big\" theoretical paradigms were developed specifically for modernizing/modern western, capitalist countries. \n\nAs someone of Egyptian descent, I am very interested in sociological literature on Egypt and the Arab world as a whole, specifically from an Egyptian/Arab perspective. I have no issue with literature written by non-Arab authors about the region, but I find that it lacks a certain level of analytical authenticity, since it is always written from an outsider's perspective.\n\nFurthermore, the conditions which brought about sociology in the first place (modernity, capitalist division of labor, individualization) have been and still are experienced far differently in the Arab world compared to the west, since in the former these processes were more or less externally imposed rather than internally developed, as is the case with the latter.\n\nSo I am looking for Literature which has such aspects in mind and offers a broad theoretical/analytical framework. Unfortunately, I have not been able to find such literature thus far, which is why I am seeking help. Literature and Author recommendations would be a great start. Also, books about the development of sociology itself in the Arab world would also be great. \n\nThanks!",

Though I understand the concept of our society moving left then right then left, etc., it feels more conservative and widespread than it has in the past.\n\nI’m really curious as to why men have become so red pilled, racism seems to be more blatant, homophobia/transphobia is increasing ten-fold, etc.\n\nAre there any theories that you find helpful to explain where we’re at and where we’re going?\n\nI’m thinking conflict theory might be where I should start re-emerging myself in sociology to understand this, but would love some input.",

      "text": "Despite modern evidence that women are cognitively on par with men, nearly every major ancient civilization systematically restricted women’s access to education, scholarly positions, and scientific careers. While factors like high child mortality and early reproduction pressures undoubtedly played a role, these pragmatic constraints seem to have uniformly reinforced a system where women were confined largely to domestic and reproductive roles.\n\nWhy did survival strategies in early societies consistently prioritize women’s roles in childbearing and household labor over intellectual development—even in elite circles where one might expect a trickle-down effect of education? Are there deeper socio-cultural mechanisms or institutional biases that transcended practical concerns and cemented male dominance in knowledge production?",

Ever since Covid caused us to go remote and be isolated, I’ve noticed this hatred towards women, people of color and queer people rise. And I think it’s because people are being antisocial and not choosing to interact with anyone. This is even evident in rural areas where rates of domestic violence, rape, bigotry and alcoholics are way higher. And with how rural areas are set up due to way less dense population areas, rural Americans are way more susceptible to being isolated from society, therefore developing hateful mindsets.",

      "title": "Gender, Race, and Social Constructs",
      "text": "I’ve been lurking on the Truths subreddit, and one topic keeps coming up again and again. It’s made me realize, once more, how the heavy focus on STEM and the general lack of humanities education is doing a real disservice to society.\n\nThe topic? Gender as a social construct. One of the dumbest takes I’ve read was: *“Gender used to be a fact, now it’s a social construct based on weird personality types.”*  \nThere’s so much wrong with that statement, I don’t even know where to begin.\n\nI’m aware I might be preaching to the choir here, but I want to open up this discussion, not only to refine my own definitions, but also to ask: how do we get people to actually understand the differences?\n\nFirst of all, that person clearly didn’t understand what a social construct is. Plenty of things are social constructs: race, gender, money, borders, and even the law.\n\nMoney is usually the easiest example for people to grasp, so let’s go with that. We’d all agree that a one-cent coin is “money,” right?  \nWell, the Eurozone’s 1-cent coins are made of copper with a steel core. It costs about 1.65 cents to produce a 1-euro-cent coin. That means the production cost is higher than the actual value of the coin.\n\nIf the cent inherently had the value we assign to it—1 cent—it wouldn’t cost *more* to make it. The only reason this little copper-and-steel disc has any value is because *we*, as a society, have agreed that it does.  \nThat’s made even clearer every time you pay with a credit card. Money is exchanged, even though no one touches a physical coin or bill.\n\nThat doesn’t mean money isn’t real, it absolutely is. But it’s real *because* we all agree it is. That’s what makes it a social construct: something society collectively created and gave meaning to.\n\nNow I’m not going to break down every example I listed earlier, but let’s do one more: race.  \nI read someone on the Truths subreddit say, *“If race isn’t real, why do Black people have higher rates of sickle cell?”*  \nWell first of all, sickle cell isn’t linked to race, it’s linked to genetics and ancestral geography.\n\nAnd here’s where the difference lies: sickle cell traits appear in people with tropical origins. A lesser-known fact? Many Southeast Asians also carry this trait, it’s not exclusive to people of African descent.\n\nSo, would you lump Southeast Asians into the “Black” category? Are Indians “Black” to you? No?  \nAnd do you know why? Because the concept of “Black” is a social construct. It’s not defined strictly by skin color. This is perfectly illustrated by the “one-drop rule,” which defined *anyone* with African ancestry as Black, regardless of their actual appearance. That’s how we even ended up with terms like “white-passing.”\n\nThe fact that “Black people” can appear white doesn’t make any sense if being Black were some innate biological truth.\n\nThis doesn’t mean dark skin doesn’t exist. Of course it does. But the *category* of “Black people” as used in, say, the U.S. isn’t some universal, inherent truth.  \nThere are “Black” people with lighter skin than many South Asians. I once even saw a debate about whether Aboriginal Australians are considered Black or not.\n\nAll these arguments show a fundamental misunderstanding of what social constructs actually are and how they function.\n\nAnd since social constructs have real-life consequences, I believe this is a very important conversation to have.",

      "text": "Making this painfully clear, this is NOT a post to diminish or disregard the abuse women face and domestic abuse against women is one of the most important conversations we need to have in our current society. However, I've just looked at the stats and it's far more level than I realised.\n\n  \nMen can obviously be victims of abuse. It's not something which is widely discussed as Violence Against Women and Girls, but it is very real and should always be acknowledged as such. What I'm curious about is if we know the statistics are closer than presumed, why has this not been spoken about?\n\n  \nThe Domestic Violence Center puts the figures at roughly 23% for women and 19% for men. In 2020, the National Coalition Against Domestic Violence put the figure at 45% for Black women and 40% for Black men. (Rates would be higher when factoring race as this is a very common theme when it comes to violence and homicide regardless of the gender of the victim).\n\n  \nThe obvious answer would be patriarchal norms and even though we're seeing the rise of \"incel\" culture, this has never been a \"gotcha\" to rebut the conversation regarding VAWG. When we see these stats, are they taking into account reactive abuse? Are they also taking into account sexual orientation and gender identity? All of these things will vastly inflate the stats amongst men as these are incredibly vulnerable groups. \n\n  \nThere's also the discrepancy when it comes to sexual abuse and homicide. Women are far more likely to be murdered by their partner and to be the victim of sexual abuse. Is there a reason why there is a significant gap when it comes to this and not domestic abuse in general?\n\n  \nI'm also not trying to explain away male abuse or to take away any accountability from female abusers. I'm only interested in why the stats are the way they are as, perhaps due to ignorance, I was never aware of this.",

Wright Mills - One of the main texts always referenced and highly recommended within my course. It gives a way of thinking and analysing as a social scientists. So I would say that's a good introductory text!\n* Karl Marx's *Communist Manifesto* \\- Communism is a prominent topic within Sociology so this should be a good introductory text to Communism. However, just a disclaimer, the English used within it is very old so it may be hard to understand.\n* Emile Durkheim's *Suicide*\n* Stephen Jay Gould's *The Mismeasuremnt of Man* and *The Flamingo's Smile* \\- Two works I have particularly enjoyed reading this year! Both these texts dive into how colonialism, and cultural and racial bias impacts the way we interpret what we study. I used both texts on an assignment about whether Social Science Research was inherently racist. Very good texts to consider in sociological and social science research.\n* Pierre Bourdieu's *Distinction*.\n* W.E.B Du Bois's *The Soul of Black Folk* \\- A very prominent work and highly recommended. Good reading into Sociology and African American studies.\n* Bell Hook's *Ain't I a Black Woman?* \\- Offers a more intersectional look into racism and sexism concerning African American women.\n* Edward Said's *Orientalism*\n* Michel Foucalt's *Discipline and Punishment*, *The History of Sexuality*, and *Madness and Civilisation.*\n* Anthony Giddens' *Modernity and Self Identity.*\n* Goffman's *The Presentation of Self in Everyday Life*.\n* Goffman's *Stigma, Notes on the Management of a Spoiled Identity*.\n* Durkheim's *The Elementary forms of Religious Life*, *The Division of Labor in Society*\n* Weber*'s The Protestant Ethic* and Th*e Spirit of Capitalism*",

      "text": "Because I feel as though AI is only as powerful as it is because of the capitalistic society that we live in. I see it often being used as a way to either make money, save money, or as a shortcut to acquire money. For example, a concerning amount of college students are no longer doing their own assignments, they just get AI programs to do the assignments for them, since for a lot of people, college isn’t about gaining knowledge, but rather earning a degree to make money and be as “successful” as possible. Or, instead of paying humans fair wages, businesses in a lot of different fields/industries are simply allowing these positions to be filled by AI. And even though this isn’t exactly related to money, AI is also influencing the way we socialize (which is still sort of related since capitalism is kinda affecting the way we interact with each other). Why make friends when you can talk to a chatbot, why go to a therapist when you can just vent to ChatGPT (and it’s way cheaper)? I’m just curious if there are any studies/research coming out! Or, is this more of a question for economists?\n\nEdit: I know that capitalism isn’t the same thing as “money” and is in fact a set of economic principles related to ownership of capital. I just think it’s interesting to see the relationship between AI and this economic system, since a lot of western countries (Especially the United States), have in one way or another, adopted capitalistic systems/policies.",

I was drawn to sociology (and anarchism in general), by my first sociology professor who taught from a conflict theory POV. While studying sociology I found that for the most part, anti-capitalism is fairly accepted in sociology. Obviously, the field studies society beyond anti-capitalism but that is the topic today.\n\nI'm really just curious on thoughts on anarchism as a political belief. I find criticism of it to be mostly based on beliefs of total lawlessness and a breakdown of institutions. The most prominent social scientists from modern times I've found with sound critiques seem limited to mostly Murray Bookchin or post-leftist thought. If you have any academic sources to share on opposing or supporting beliefs that is appreciated.\n\nEdit: I am a social anarchist with a foundation on anarchist theory, I'm really just asking for the thoughts on anarchism from individual perspectives from those w a sociology education, if not right place to post then apologies!",

Gender roles are one of the things used to maintain power, and those who deviate from the norm and transgender individuals are targeted because their existence directly defies those roles. Thus, trans people are used as a scapegoat by the ruling class for all of societies ills rather than the system itself that is the cause of class inequality. Of course religion plays a huge role in this, but religion too is used for social control. \n\nThis was just a brief kinda overview, but do you think this association has any merit?",

      "title": "How long could social change take when religious like politics is involved?",
      "text": "I am speaking about the US, but also in light of the rapidly spreading right wing ideology in the US. Before, it would be that during political turns in the US (conservative then democrat, vice versa) people seemed to swing or switch between both sides depending on how they viewed the last government (good or bad). I wouldn't say people were switching sides that often but the percentage of voters on either side would change or shift significantly between elections showing that people were more willing to change. \n\nHowever, after 2016, it seems that the GOP maintained their main voter base and it required more people who maybe normally didn't vote to come out to switch the tide back to democrat. The new movement behind the GOP seemed to be much more cemented this time and in the 4 years that Biden was president, seemed to become more cemented in people's indentities and ideologies, seemingly permanently internalising it's ideas and norms. Some people have even equuated this behavior to that of religious movements or cults. \n\nIt's quite evident that it would take a lot to get the members for such a movement to even consdier dropping their ideals even when it is obvious that they should. I mean if for whatever reason, their government does something exceedingly terrible that should normally push even the most passionate voters/believers away. \n\nTherefore to me it seems like the amount of time needed for social change to occur after such a movement (to return to a more neutral point or even a positive point between both parties) would be much longer than usual. It's been a very long time since I last did sociology, but when I did do it, I vaguely remember that social change is a very long process and with such serious issues involving race/racism, politics, etc it should take a very long time, something like 20 years for more permanent and tangible social change to be implemented even when a lot people agree that it should occur. With a majority people being against a form of social change on serious issues like the ones stated above (GOP movement), doesn't it imply that the period required for social change would be much more significant in magnitude? Is there a breaking point where social change has reached a point where it can't occur naturally/organically (at least not fast enough) but rather requires a push or use of some sort of force by those who require it? Yes, I mean like war or something similar. \n\nTo make it clear, I am not advocating for war or saying that people should be forced to be on one side or another, just using all of this because it a rather convinient example of when it feels like social change would require a lot more than just support. \n\nIf not force, what sort of actions or occurances in society, could speed up a reversal of the uptake of such strong values? Are there any examples of this being successful in the past (whether be it religion or other similar political movements). It kind of reminds me of the n_zi and soviet movements which didn't fall without the usage of force. The people didn't quite change their minds for a very long time even when things went very wrong for the supporters. Some people weren't dettered even after ww2 and chose stood by institutions like east Germany and the USSR after the wars. Of course, I recognize that many did not have a choice in being in either but some people seemed fine with it. \n\nI would like to make it clear that I am not claiming that the gop is the same as the n_zis or the ussr, just drawing a relative comparison. It does just seem like even after several blunders and even if things went very bad, many people would still stand by their values leading to a lengthy cycle before change can occur. \n\nWhat would sociology dictate about such a situation? \n\nThanks in advance. Forgive me for any logical mistakes or typos.",

What they mean by that is - If capitalism survives Marxism or Marxists would give its explanation and adjust that within their ideology and if capitalism does not survive, then of course Karl Marx stands corrected.\n\nThere is, in my opinion a fundamental flaw in this critique, and I would demonstrate it with an example. Imagine that climate and weather experts publish a report that predicts the amount of rainfall that will happen in the coming year, now let's say they were wrong. Does that mean climate science is pointless? Or that we just need better methods to improve our accuracy. Secondly, predicting the future is quite difficult, even simply from the perspective of science, it takes years and years of endless research to get some idea as to what is going to happen. And the scope of difficulty is magnified in society and politics where reason and rationale rarely work in predictions.\n\nTo really test the falsifiability of Marxism, one can look at its ability to study systems and what they produce. Like you can run the experiment of capitalism and free market (as many times as one pleases) and get the same result over and over again. Which is increased inequalities, cycles of crisis and breakdowns and exploitation, that in my opinion makes the Marxist analysis of economic systems particularly valuable rather than its ability to predict the future, so to speak.\n\nLet me know what you guys think about this.",

This reveals imo an interesting aspect of our lives: living our lives and reflecting on it are two very different things.

The word has of course many meanings, and I'm interested in hearing about any and all. If you want to give a definition then that's fine too, but I'm more interested in things like what would you contrast it to, what is something else than social (eg. private, and what does it mean)?

      "text": "Hello there,\n\nI'm currently working on my Bachelor's thesis (specifically trying to find a Topic to write about) and have found myself focussing on Max Weber's Theory on Rationalization. \n\nMy Basic argument is as follows: \n\nContemporary reactionary political movements, using the AfD in Germany as an Example, advocate a form of Politics which aims to counteract the process of Rationalization. This can be seen in the spheres of Religion, Bureaucracy, Immigration Policy, Euroskepticism, Anti scientific and anti-Intellectual stances, Anti globalization politics etc.\n\nIn all of these spheres, the AfD (and movements like it) advocate for the abolition or opposition of rationalized, rules-based systems and institutions and instead prioritize favoritism and an ad-hoc implementation of the Law. Their justifications for their Policies also tend to be incoherent and, for lack of a better term, \"vibes-based\". For instance, their opposition to immigration is often justified as a defense of a vaguely defined \"German Culture\" or \"Traditional Christianity\". However, these stances do not have much of an affirmative character. As in, their narratives contain no substantive, systemic or rational proposals. \n\nThese developments can also be connected to the rise of the internet and the \"Post-Truth\" Paradigm, wherein there is a breakdown in shared reality and narratives are spread and adopted with no empirical Basis. \n\nI would also argue that the process of Rationalization has accelerated immensely in the past 30 years with rapidly expanding Neoliberalism as well as the development of Technology.\n\nThis accelerated Rationalization, leading to ever stronger breakdown of social structures as well as \"disenchantment\" and higher wealth inequality has, in turn, fostered a strong opposition to itself, which I call \"Derationalization\". \n\nI would describe Derationalization as both a process, as well as, mainly, an aspiration to reverse the effects of Rationalization. \n\nKey to this work would be to differentiate \"Derationalization\" from Preexisting concepts and explain its necessity. Elements of what I call \"Derationalization\" have already been widely discussed. Conspiracism, Anti-Intellectioalism, Irrationalism, Traditionalism etc. are already existing terms that have seen wide use. \n\nThrough \"Derationalization\", I aim to combine all of these ideas and argue that in the modern reactionary Paradigm, they are all connected as part of one social agenda. Additionally, I aim to argue that the \"Post-Truth\" Paradigm that is distinct to the modern internet Age binds these Ideas together. \n\nAnother caveat would also be that Derationalization is not a complete reversal of Rationalization, in that Far Right Parties, including the AfD, propose economic policies that can easily be described as Neoliberal. Thus, Derationalization is distinctly ideologically incoherent, as it seems to oppose Rationalization in all spheres of life except the economic sphere. \n\nThis is also why I would argue very strongly that Derationalization does NOT mean a complete and total reversal of Rationalization as a historical Process. In other words, Derationalization, both as a process and as an aspiration, would not and could not return any society to its precapitalist, non-rationalized form. It would rather be considered a Post-modern/Anti-modern Ideology.\n\nIn any case, what do you Think? is it a viable Theoretical Concept? Does it already Exist? Would it be appropriate to make this the subject of a Bachelor's Thesis?",

When I took social psych as a PhD student, we read Mead’s “Mind, self, and society,” Goffman’s “presentation of self,” and some simmel that I’m blanking on. This would be too dense and heavy for an intro class. I have a Goffman excerpt but was hoping for something more contemporary and interesting. \n\nThank you in advance!",

What piques the most interest on me during these 2 years was the area of Religion (p.s I am not still taking Sociology of Religion since it is very much going to be taken during my 3rd year). I have a concept paper or perhaps a research idea that come up to my mind in relation to this discipline and your thoughts about it.\n\nFor context, this thought stems to our 1st year's subject called Cultural Anthropology wherein, we tackled development essentially ( Biological Perspective, the\n Franz Boas' Historical Particularism view, and more). But enough of that, what makes me so interested to that subject was religion and stratification.\n\nIt made me wonder the role of religion in stratification. It is not essentially to challenge religion as an institution but rather, I just want to know more that the all-knowing all-powerful religion can be a reason for social inequality.\n\nThis comes to me thinking? How can I study religion and stratification? and more of that, sociologically?\n\nMy initial thought was first to link religious practices and how it manifest existing power dynamics between the priest which is so called the messenger of god and us, the one being showered with god's grace through these priests.\n\nI want to go into the interactions happening inside the religion as an institution. Specifically, how the mass perception of their own position in the society is being shaped by the priests words through religious practices like mass or even confession. Because maybe with this we could understand even from the past, why religion became so dominant even up until secularization happened and ultimately, understand the role of religion in stratification or social inequality.\n\nBut one challenges I see is that Religion is vast, we have diverse religion systems. Although my objective is to determine the role of religion in stratification it makes me look like generalizing religion as a whole. Maybe other religious systems does not manifest any power dynamics between the individuals and those people considered near to god. \n\nWhat is your thought for this kind of research? What kind of theorist should I look up into? Is it ambitious?",

It is now an \"urban revitalization\" sort of place. There is a lot of history of how it got from there to here and I'd like to know it.\n\nMy trouble is this: I am not a professional scholar, I am a factory worker. I have never properly researched anything in the real world, I have only read books by scholars.\n\nI have ideas of where I can go for information. \n\nThe Onondaga Historical Society has got to be my first stop right? Their whole deal is keeping historical records. I'm not sure what to ask for besides \"information on Franklin Square\"\n\nI'm sure the local paper has stories about the big changes that took place.\n\nThe city would have records of who owned it and when it changed hands right? Like they keep property records and such?\n\nThen for like who lived around the factory and how demographics moved with it, that's something I'd go to the Census for right?\n\nIf I want to know how many people worked where and when... Who keeps those sorts of records? \n\nTo anyone who studies urban development or geography or what have you: \n\nWhat other questions could I ask to get a more complete understanding? \n\nWhat other sources of information should I be looking to? \n\nThank you for your time!",

I think its to do more with lack of opportunity on one hand. Workers are increasingly busy and so are students. Personal time and relationships have taken a back seat to \"PrOdUcTiViTy\". If you don't have a side hustle going on then you're an asshole. I think another is that some cultures just don't know how to have pleasant, \"light\" rapports. Think co-workers, fellow students, casual friends. Do you know their life story? No. But you like them enough to hang out and invite them to events. Instead some cultures have a very \"members only\" mentality. So if you don't mesh with the group to perfection and don't share all the things they do, then you can't really join.

Feel free to drop titles/writers, any pdf’s you could send over to save me the grief of finding the right databases. I’ll keep digging through databases, but thought this might be a fun opportunity to build some connections and discuss research with others who are interested in this topic.",

This means that it requires an uncountable minds to works on it, and even if we put Durkheim, Weber and Marx as the classical thinkers of this science, they were insert in camps of strougles that shape the sociological theory but invisibilizes the work of many other thinkers of their time.\n\nThis idea is for the debate and it comes with two question: What line of sociological theory are you following?

(idk how it's called in english lmao)\n\nvery briefly i've covered Durkheim and symbolic interactionism (Mead n Cooley, esp reflexivity), then Goffman with role theory and group identity, connecting it back to Durkheim's collective conscience etc\n\nnow i'd like to make the 3rd chapter about Bourdieu (habitus and like \"implicit culture\" yk, and also the political dimension of identity and interaction), but my supervisor said it could be problematic, so i'm looking for papers that link all these authors bc to me it seems they can be very much akin:\n- symbolic interactionism w Bourdieu's symbolic oppression, power etc\n- found a paper about the implicit dimension of power in Goffman to relate him to Bourdieu\n- i see many authors n professors putting Goffman under symbolic interactionism, but my supervisor said he isn't a symbolic interactionist so idk but i've found many links between them too\n- and then it would also make sense to have talked about Durkheim, since he's a structuralist like Bourdieu so i thought i'd say that like Bourdieu reinterprets Durkheim in a critical sense or smtng like that it's just to give an idea\n\nany suggestions would be helpful, even advice of other lines or authors (possibly keeping these themes/orientation), or good papers you've found about these comparisons/analogies, and please tell me if i understood anything wrong :/\nthx in advance if anyone will read this🙏🏻",

It was explained in a lecture that I missed because I was sick and only got an audio recording of it, but the lecturer explained the model by pointing at it, so I don't know where he was pointing when he said things. Btw this specific version of the model is Westheuser, 2020.\n\nOn the Y axis we have total capital volume. Great, I get that.  \nOn the X axis we have capital composition. Sure, I'm on board. On the left it's high cultural capital and low economic capital. On the right it's low cultural capital and high economic capital. I am now no longer getting it.\n\nIt only makes sense to me if the Y axis is the cultural capital (increasing vertically) and the X axis is economic capital (increasing horizontally), and the composition increase indicates a volume increase. Is this basically what this is, or am I going mad? Otherwise, nothing can be composed of both very low or very high economic and cultural capital at the same time. Indicating something has the lowest economic capital composition necessarily places it as having the highest cultural composition even when the volume is lowest and vice versa.\n\nPlease can someone explain this to me?\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/hpli47jxbpme1.jpg?width=1116&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=7e98246a25190c022988ff0f6e2ef87c3d27b5c9",

I’ve done some basics through a few DataCamp courses (trial version, so not much), and I had a course back in undergrad. Since then, I’ve mostly used Stata, which I’m fine with, but I’d like to move away from relying on a license since I can’t afford the SE version, and I don’t want to be limited to using it only through my university.\n\nSo now I’m trying to learn R alongside Stata, just so I have both options. I’m mainly looking for good resources, ideally from people working in social sciences, focused not just on stuff like data wrangling, but also on doing statistical methods properly in R, like cross-sectional and longitudinal analysis.\n\nTextbooks would be super helpful (especially ones that use R), but I’m also open to online ressources. What I’d really love is a go-to reference for when I get stuck or to check how things are typically done in R vs. Stata. I still find myself translating concepts awkwardly between the two.\n\nAny recommendations would be hugely appreciated!",

My family is Haitian and so we know that the word Kob is used to refer to money as well! It’s not as hidden as it was before that many Québécois words utilize Haitian Creole loanwords along with Arabic ones too. Yet what pique my curiosity was when other Québécois commentators repeatedly highlighted that the word “Kob” was considered slang. \n\n\n I guess those words sort of hit a nerve as Slang bears such a negative connotation oddly enough and angered me as I couldn’t believe people would think of my language as a slang instead of properly recognizing it as its own language. \n\nThen it hit me: I find it very interesting how immigrant languages are often denigrated by reducing them to be dubbed as \"slang\" in the main country (I.e. Arabic loanwords in France, Haitian Creole loanwords in Québec, AAVE in the United States). Kinda also connects with how certain dialects and accents are valued in society (i.e. Posh English accents vs.\nGlaswegian/Irish accents, Québecois vs French from France, overall countryside regions vs municipal areas). Sounds obvious enough I'm sure, but still wanted to share some thoughts.\n\n\nNow, I currently deep dive on sociolinguistics and social stratification until later tonight 😀😭",

When I tell them that I don’t give a damn about what the society thinks, they always seem to get upset with me.\n\nIn fact, these were my mother’s exact words: “Well, you should be concerned about what the society thinks because you are a SOCIAL BEING and people will need each other.”\n\nTo be honest, I totally believe that we all are social beings and should care about other people’s feelings.\n\nWe should care about how other people would feel when we say or do something. We should take their feelings and perspective into account. I feel that we all should take a moment to think from their perspective, because we have no idea what they have been through, what they are going through and what their concerns are about the future.\n\nWe should all try to be nice to each other, because, every person is fighting a battle among themselves, which we know nothing about. I think, these are the circumstances when we should be thinking about others and not while choosing to wear something or deciding to go out with whoever or whenever.\n\nNothing should stand in the way of doing what we love….especially society.",

While I reached a final definition of social norms and practices, I can't manage to differentiate them from cultural norms. \n\nThis is how I define social norms:\n\n\n\"Social norms are the shared expectations that govern behaviour within a reference group. They are not explicitly designed but emerge from repeated interactions, and are typically applicable across different social contexts. Social norms can shape behaviour in various settings and often regulate actions like politeness, dress codes or etiquette. These norms are maintained by social influence, and can be resistant to change due to the interdependence of people's expectations ans behaviours.\"\n\n\n\"Cultural norms refer to the broader shared expectations, values, beliefs that are considered acceptable and typical within a specific culture and community. Cultural norms guide how people within that culture act and interact, and they are often rooted in traditions and customs.\"\n\n\nHowever I read and write it, to me at the end they feel like they are the same thing.

I have worked in Single Site and Family Shelters, Health Clinics, Hospitals, Mental Health Facilities, Prisons, Non Profits and I’m currently working in a Long Term Care Facility (Nursing Home) as a Social Services Director. I went from $40,000 starting out to $80,000 now. Sociology is a great field and you can work in so many different places don’t ever let anyone tell you the degree is useless. It changed my life and exposed me to a lot. \n\nPSA: \nPlenty of the people I graduated with are not in Social Services such as myself. Many are in marketing, public relations, government contracts, civil service and FBI, Law/Paralegals, Human Resources, City Council and Urban Planners. They are all around the country and many made 6 figures after graduation. The degree is lucrative and I said what I said!",

I am rather overwhelmed with the sheer volume of literature that contest the conceptual, theoretical, and methodological matters of 'social capital'.\n\nI guess at this stage I am looking for any (minimum 2) journal articles that utilize measurements that capture individual-level of social capital (i'm not going into too much depth to discuss bonding/bridging/linking or other types of social capital yet at this stage). \n\nI recall skimming an article that has about 8-to-10 questions (e.g., 'Can you ask for help from someone to transport you to somewhere urgently?'; \"How frequent do you speak to your friends/neighbors?\") that return a summed score (higher score indicates higher degree of social capital). However, I cannot for the life of myself remember the title of such article.\n\n  \nI'd appreciate if someone can help me identify an article using some forms of survey/questionnaire that capture individual-level of social capital.

      "title": "How Common Is Social Ascription Within Branches Of An Extended Family?",
      "text": "For years, I (24M) have assumed my maternal family (who are Vietnamese) does practice ascription, where your socioeconomics are determined when you are born, and I could substantiate this fully.\n\nFortunately, my paternal side of the family doesn’t practice ascription, so it is easy to go up the social ladder. I would like to point out that my father (75M) and his siblings/cousins were all born in Hanoi (which is regarded as more conservative than HCMC), but most of my paternal relatives are in the 1% both in Vietnam as well as abroad (US, Canada, UK, France, Germany, Czech Republic, and Russia). My father and his older siblings were born to middle class Vietnamese peasants at the time (115M, 113F), and his parents and villagers pooled money to ensure my father and his siblings were educated. It helped, because he graduated at the top of his class, and was awarded a scholarship to study at the Lomonosov Moscow State University in 1968. He later studied at Charles University in Prague between 1974-6 for a public health degree before returning to Vietnam.\n\nI have a second cousin (34F) who was born to working class Vietnamese labourers, and my father’s siblings and cousins all pooled money for her to study after finding out she has talent and ambition, and she really thanked us for that. She immigrated to the US as an international student in 2010, studied at MIT (SB) and UCLA (PhD), and started a formidable career in biotech/bioinformatics, with her climbing up the ranks to become director of engineering.\n\nLegend:\n\nCau = mother's brother or male cousin\n\nDi = mother's sister or female cousin\n\nDuong = mother's sister's husband\n\nMy maternal family however, practices casteism (to some degree), as your future socioeconomic status and occupation is determined when you are born. My maternal grandparents (103M, 102F) never received an education past 5th grade, and my mother has 9 siblings (only 6 survived to adulthood as Di Nam, Di Bay, and Cau Chin died in childhood). Only my mother (64F) and her younger sister (62F) received an education past high school, and only my mother’s younger sister and her oldest sister’s families live in the US. Out of those who still reside in Vietnam, only my parents visited Europe and the US.\n\nUnfortunately, my maternal side of the family is ultra conservative (think of 18/19th century Vietnam), especially for Di Hai’s husband (88M) and his family. Anti-abortion, pro-corporal punishment, and ultra-traditional. Duong/Di Hai and their progeny all live in the US. Duong Hai (88M) even openly admires Adolf Hitler, calling him a hero of the German people, and claimed that Hitler's actions benefited Europe, despite consensus that he plunged Europe into WWII and caused suffering to many.\n\nIronically, he fought in the Army of the Republic of Vietnam and was regarded as Thong tuong. He has met top officials including Nguyen Cao Ky and Nguyen Van Thieu. He was thrown in a re-education camp between 1975-81, and immigrated to the US in 1996, where he lived a middle class life, despite being born to Cong Tu Bac Lieu (as my family stated). He was born in 1937 (age disputed) to a man named Nguyen Ba Cung (a martial artist who lived between 1895 and 1940) and a woman who purportedly lived between 1898 and 1940. Both of his parents and relatives were said to have sided with the colonial government.\n\nMy mother’s oldest sister, Di Hai (83F) only had a 5th grade education, whilst her husband has a college education. She was forced to work from a young age. All of her 3 children (ranging from 41 to 57) received a college education and make 100-150k USD a year in the US. The oldest grandchild (19F) wanted to be a pop star and YouTube gaming streamer, but her dreams were steered away from that and she currently majors in finance/accounting at a state flagship. She tried dyeing her hair during college an hour away from home, but was castigated by her mother (57F).\n\nDi Ba (81F), Cau Sau (74M), and Cau Tam (70M) all had high school diplomas, and all their children were raised to have a college education. Cau Sau’s granddaughter (20F) was a top student at a Vietnamese middle school. Since middle school, she has wanted to move to New York City as an international student for high school and college and become a surgeon doctor. But her dreams were shot. Despite the fact her parents make a decent amount by Vietnamese standards (at least 50k USD a year), she was forced to attend a high school of her parents choosing in Binh Duong, despite her demands to allow her to move to HCMC. She was not even allowed to visit HCMC on her own until she was 18, and even then, her parents refused to allow her to attend university in HCMC, instead insisting on sending her to a university in Binh Duong and major in finance as that was her parents’ major. Cau Tam’s granddaughter (16F) wanted to attend high school in Boston but that idea was sacked by her father (43M) who owns a factory in Binh Duong. Her high school was chosen by her parents, and she attended a local public high school in Binh Duong.\n\nDi Tu (79F) was considered the black sheep of the family. Due to superstition from her parents and grandparents that she was the unlucky child, she was not allowed to be educated past the 3rd grade level. She was a promising student, but she was pulled out of school, forced to work in agriculture and marry at 14. Her 5 children (ranging from 50 to 59) received the same punishment, with none of them receiving any education above 5th grade. One of her grandchildren (27M) was infatuated with computers and wanted to partner with me on my tech startup. He has been a top student at his school through his entire school career. However, his career trajectory was ripped apart by his parents, grandparents, and great-grandparents and he was only allowed to finish 12th grade. He was thinking of applying for a US F-1 visa, but his parents never gave him the funds to apply and he wasn’t allowed to live on his own even if he made money. They also only gave him 30 minutes of computer use during much of his teenage years and didn’t allow him to bring his computer to his bedroom, but he did eventually learn through edX and OpenCourseWare on his own. One other grandchild (24F) was also a promising and ambitious student who wanted to be a dentist in France, but her dreams were shot down, and she was also only allowed to finish 12th grade. She borrowed medical books from the library but they were confiscated by her parents.\n\nAnd finally, let’s talk about Di Ut (62F). She had a dental degree from Vietnam, but she was married to an alcoholic who was a South Vietnamese vet (74M) and came to the US in 1994. Her dental degree was invalidated, and she was not able to continue school. She became a dentist at a community health center with salaries in the high 5-figures. Her daughter (26F) has shown strong ambition since elementary school and wanted to become an oral surgeon. She graduated as salutatorian, attended a T50 university in the US, and majored in biology. After she graduated, she was planning on doing some clinical work before taking the DAT and applying for dental school. However, her parents decided to push her away and instead, she received a job in the human resources sector, earning her 40 an hour. She is still infuriated to this day, but due to the fact she is living on her own, she has decided to spend time studying to become an oral surgeon and break the caste system.\n\nMy mother (64F) is called Di Muoi, and at the hospital, she is deputy to my father (75M), who was “giám đốc một bệnh viện lớn của việt nam”. Both my sisters (24F, 35F) have pursued healthcare trajectories as per my parents wishes and were very decent students during high school and college. My mother wished that I would inherit her clinic in Binh Duong and become the next “giám đốc” of the hospital my father presided in, but my father was liberal and allowed me to take my own path. He sent my sister (24F) and I (24M) to Russia when we were 5 and there, we were raised by my uncle (89M) and aunt (87F).\n\nI was then ostracized by my maternal family for deviating from their plans. Relations have been ambivalent since then. There, I became obsessed with computers and have dreamed of starting a tech unicorn and attending HYPSM universities since I was 7. Due to the fact my uncle and aunt actively allowed me to pursue my passions, I became proficient at programming by the time I was 10/11. I also aced school and self studied academic material at a few grade levels ahead of my grade level. I was able to attend MIT, graduating in 2022, to the disdain of everybody in my maternal family, as they accused me of being similar to my best friend (who I recently found out was my second cousin), who had autism and who is considered the black sheep of the family.\n\nMy family has attempted to siphon my educational funds to my golden child sister (24F) so that she could have her Porsche 911 and luxury condo in Brookline back in 2019 as my oldest sister (35F) still had control of my bank account until I turned 18 in September of 2019, but it failed. I lost $5000 from all of this, and this is when the altercation with my sister started. Luckily, I funnelled in the 100k I had at the time to Tesla stock after believing that Elon will become the richest man in the world. I earnt a lot of money after Tesla shares skyrocketed from 20 in October 2019 to 400 in November 2021.\n\nEven though I have a whole story related to him and it will be way too long to discuss in this story, I wanted to introduce my friend (25M, who is my second cousin via my maternal grandmother). His parents were doctors in Vietnam and moved to the US in 2003. In 2004 (when he was 4), he was diagnosed with autism. His parents had considered institutionalizing him due to the autism, but due to pressure from doctors and teachers, he attended school. Similar to me, he was extremely talented, having self-studied material at 1-3 grades above his grade level during his spare time and having won a school math competition, a city-wide engineering fair, and a middle school National Geographic Bee where all 1000 students participated. He received consistent A’s in math, science, social studies, and foreign language, and similar to me, he has dreamed of attending Harvard since his dreams. However, his achievements and talents were completely overlooked by his parents and teachers. Even though my friend thought the IEP was stifling his education and social development and wanted to leave the IEP, he was still kept there despite excelling academically and behaviorally. Unfortunately, his parents are ableist and have manuscripts to psychologically manipulate him.\n\nDespite all of this, I understood his potential and both he and I wanted to start a tech company together. His parents and school tried to suppress his precocious passion for computers, but it was unsuccessful, as he started learning programming at the age of 10. I really advocated for him to attend the same private school as me to fulfil his ambitions, but it was overridden by his parents, who want a tight grip on power over him (which was detrimental), and my sisters, who don’t want him being around them. His parents have tried to stall his ambitions on starting a company, saying that he is delusional, but in reality, I will definitely hire him as a CTO of my planned startup and if my company succeeds and I cash out to build another company, I will hand over the CEO title over to him.\n\nHe was coerced into special ed by his ableist parents and protested against it everyday knowing it was detrimental towards his academic, social, and mental well being. Despite the fact he has dreamed of attending a HYPSM university (similar to me), his ambitions are not realized, and he attended a less selective university which was recently promoted to R1. He had a terrible home life, and escaped home at the age of 17 and started working full time whilst studying full time and investing all of his hard earned money onto Tesla stock where he later became rich. Similar to me, prior to 2021, he was a strong believer of Elon Musk’s lies.\n\nBut that didn’t stop his determination in any way. He and I have worked with each other on rebuilding his life, and 3 years after graduation from college in December 2021, he has finally gained many certificates, scored highly on the GRE test, had several dozen research hours, got a independent contracting web developer job which pays 90k, and is applying to OMSCS. He has been unlucky to be raised by people who wanted to sabotage his education, but I have worked relentlessly on rebuilding his life and fulfilling his lofty ambitions, and luckily, it has worked.\n\nWhat’s peculiar is that despite the fact my best friend (second cousin)’s parents earn a lot, they refused to send him to his dream school. Instead, my friend has seen financial documents which stated that his parents (both 65) have fully subsidized for his older cousin (27F) to study at his dream school in Boston. She had no ambitions of attending an Ivy League whatsoever and she doesn’t even care what city she lives. She eventually went to a less selective college in Boston (2016-2020), and later joined a less selective medical school in 2024. An interesting note, her parents (77M, 70F) run one of the largest banks in Southern Vietnam.\n\nThe last note is that family gatherings in my mother’s family tend to be segregated by “generation” (I have never seen youngsters mingling well with adults).\n\nTL;DR: How common is abscription within extended families? My maternal family seemed to be very rigid in deciding the fate of their child’s future from when they were born. My maternal family favours those born to elite branches of the family (in fact, many members of the family married wealthy husbands) and gives them opportunities irrespective of ambition, drive, merit, skills, or talent, whilst people born to less elite branches and who are considered the \"black sheep\" or are diagnosed with autism are denied opportunities, even if they show ambition, drive, merit, skills, and talent.",

I've already heard about Piketty and his work (and also ordered his book where he also summarizes his two long books), but I'd love suggestions for more general introductory books, ideally at the graduate level, that offer a solid foundation before i dive deeper into specific topics.\n\nMy program places a strong emphasis on inequality research, quantitative methods, and even some computational social science, so books that align with those areas would be especially helpful.\n\nIn addition, if anyone here works in this field or has recommendations, it would mean a lot to me as a first-gen student trying to navigate this path, so it'd be nice to connect with someone, so you're free to DM me aswell.

Understanding how local community initiatives and social bonds influence societal structures and dynamics (exploring concepts like third spaces etc). As well as population movements, cultural traditions, concepts of identity and belonging, languages..  \n\\- I know I am behind when it comes to actual qualifications in the social science department: is there any way that I could avoid doing a bachelors by reading / following online courses on my own?  \n\\- I am open to using data analysis tools and diving into statistics and such but I don't want to find myself programming all day again, it would be more of a support to the social science part - I love analysing results, interpreting data in order to create a more digestible narrative, trying to understand social phenomena...  \n\\- I feel intrigued by a future in research but I'm not quite sure if a phD or a career in research is actually for me\n\nIf you've read so far, thank you so much ahah\n\n\\- What would the name of some degrees in this field be called? I'm struggling to even find the proper name under which this would all fall  \n\\- Are there any schools you could recommend in Europe?  \n\\- Could you maybe share what you studied and what job you have now?\n\nTL;DR: trying to figure out what I can study so that I can work in a field covering both data analysis and social sciences (but mainly the latter) in Europe",

I've been looking for a specific text and I figured it might be a good idea to ask and find if someone can give me a hand.\n\nA few years ago I stumbled upon some text commenting on the trickiness of words/vocabulary/concepts in Social Science; namely, that Social Sciences have to deal with using technical vocabulary that is commonly used outside of scientific talk with a different, broader, etc. meaning - which can induce confusion, etc.\n\nNow, I didn't have the time nor the mental focus to read through it thoroughly back then and I wanted to reread it now... but, of course, I cannot find it. I was reading Weber's work at the time and I *think* it was either something of his or in a book about him, but I haven't been lucky yet.\n\nIf this would ring familiar to anyone who could point me where to look at, I would be quite grateful.

      "text": "There was a time where 'blatant' racism was abundant in United States history. The straight to your face, unambiguous kind no one today could deny (think of the Jim Crow Museum). Now it seems it takes a college education or at least dedicated online research to notice it. To become aware of it in government regulations, speeches, a persons behavior and mass media.\n\nI guess covert racism is the term I'm looking for in regards to modern racism. I watched a clip of the president talking and at first what he says seems fair and relatively innocent. Then I watch a political commenter point out all the lies and methods of manipulations used to fuel hatred towards other groups of people.\n\nDoes anyone have predictions of what racism may look like another 50 years? Will it become even more hidden in language and policy? Maybe a reversal to where it is just as blatant and socially acceptable as in the early 20th century. I worry it may be possible as everyday people become more fatigued with academic elites admonishing seemingly innocuous pandering from right wing advocates. \"everything is racist\" may be hyperbolic but the more you look...\n\n  \nEdit: sorry i've been silent. I've got a problem making posts at 3am then forgetting. I do feel strongly about this, but don't always remember which words I used to express myself. I'll try to respond to a few comments.\n\nEdit: I want to make clear that I know blatant racism is blatant = obvious. By evolve, I mean become not-so-obvious. I don't believe all racism is obvious to all people. No you don't need a college degree to understand any particular subject if you are dedicated enough. I just meant that if we all had that experience, we'd have a more sophisticated understanding of racism (particularly the systemic and unintentional kind).

      "text": "In the past 20 years, especially the last 5, Bosnia and Herzegovina has witnessed significant changes driven by social media. These platforms shape social norms, values, and behaviors, often promoting unrealistic lifestyles inspired by TV series, pornography, and influencers. The portrayal of luxury, power, and idealized success on these platforms creates unrealistic expectations among the youth. This contributes to a sense of disconnection from reality, leading to feelings of insecurity and alienation. Experts argue that these pressures can negatively impact cultural identity and social cohesion in the country. There is a need for social media to promote more authentic and positive values to counteract these harmful influences.\n\n  \nWhat will be result of this in future?",

But I also think back to how the second wave immigrants were criticized compared to the first wave immigrants in the 1800s and 1900s in the US. Is there something at the root that creates this rhetoric against the lower class and are these same patterns experienced in more homogenous cultures?",

For people who don't engage in that lifestyle (possibly for \"religious\" or \"moral reasons\"), those avenues aren't really accessible.\n\nSo here's my question: \n\nDo churches, particularly in \"conservative lifestyle\"/\"traditionalist Christian\" communities, serve a similar sociological function?\n\nI'm not saying churches are literally nightclubs. But functionally, are they:\n\nA. A main space for social interaction and belonging?\n\nB. A place to meet potential romantic partners (especially in youth groups or singles ministries)?\n\nC. A venue for emotionally immersive communal experiences (e.g., worship music, collective prayer)?\n\nD. A setting where identity is affirmed through dress, ritual, and shared values?\n\nQ: If that is the case, then are they \"sociologically\" the same or similar to nightclubs from your perspective?\n\nI would love to hear your thoughts on the matter.",

Is it simply something to be studied case by case with intersectionality in mind?\n\nDISCLAIMER: Below is just an example -- not some sort of attempt at ragebait whatsoever, and is actually the reason why I even thought about this question in the first place. This has nothing to do with generalizations about either group, and is just a demonstration of the phenomenon in action.\n\nTo give a \"real life\" example, I have lately seen a lot of discourse surrounding, for example, the prejudice people within the LGBTQIA+ community sometimes have against those in the polyamorous community. This, interestingly, can lead to an overlap -- where people within the LGBTQIA+ community itself are discriminated against ALONG with the polyamorous person/people. How? There was an online post somewhere by someone who identified as gay that critiqued \"those 'they/them' poly people who \\[...\\],\" which then indirectly harms nonbinary people/drags them into the conversation. \n\nIs there some kind of natural tendency for humans who have suffered under oppression of any kind to try and approximate themselves to whatever model of \"normality\" or convention is most relevant to them when given the chance, to appeal to the majority group/the oppressor?",

Here’s my proposal: r/coprophiles is a subreddit for people like me to discuss their… kinks, we’ll say, and engaging with that community has me wondering how I could conduct an ethnographic study of coprophiles. Let’s talk about the porn market for a second: very niche fetish, very niche consumer base, yet many videos have hundreds of thousands of views, it seems to be a *much* larger market and much more common fetish than it appears. But somehow, it seems to be neglected by sexologists; there’s very few studies I can find on the topic, especially using an ethnographic method. Go to that subreddit, read the posts, you’ll be disgusted yes but you’ll detect patterns: exposure to scat at a young age, higher prevalence of mental illnesses, overwhelmingly male, generally skews older, and a surprising amount of religiosity. Why? I don’t know, I want to find out. How can I conduct an ethnographic study in that sub keeping myself anonymous and keeping the interviewees anonymous? How can I do this ethically? How can I make this interesting? Thanks",

      "text": "Sharing an article that explores how grief in collectivist cultures unfolds differently, especially in online spaces. \n\nGrief theory has long centered Western, individualistic models — often framing mourning as an internal, psychological journey that moves toward \"letting go.\" \n\nBut in collectivist cultures, grief can look very different. \n\nRooted in digital mourning within a collectivist context, a recent qualitative study explores how such cultures grieve online. It challenges dominant grief paradigms by showing how mourning becomes a relational-spiritual praxis, shaped not in isolation, but through shared rituals, community memory, and sustained emotional presence. \n\nThis shift reframes grief: \n\nfrom internal experience → to co-created connection \n\nfrom linear closure → to cyclical, sacred continuity \n\nfrom personal loss → to collective meaning-making\n\n\nIn spaces like Facebook, mourning extends beyond the funeral — into comment threads, digital prayer rituals, memory posts, and communal co-presence with the dead. It becomes a form of relational labor as much as emotional expression. \n\nThis lens invites a more global, culturally grounded understanding of grief — one that decenters the Western psyche and makes room for voices from the margins.\n\n\nSources / Further Reading (for anyone interested): \n\n📘 Study (Theoretical Lens)\n“Virtual Mourning in a Collectivist Culture” – published in OMEGA: Journal of Death and Dying: \nhttps://doi.org/10.1177/00302228251363017 \n\nOpen Access links: \n\n1.

It seems like they delve right into the subject matter without really stopping to explain their sociological reasoning, without reference to any school of thought like symbolic interactionism, functionalism, praxis theory, you name it. From the perspective of someone used to the \"continental\" approach to sociology they seem so \"un-theoretical\" as to barely qualify as sociology at all. \n\nWhen we sociologists in continental Europe look at social problems like loneliness, poverty and racism, we usually do so by having a discussion of classic sociological literature first and try to link our preconceptions, the data, the problems to classical sociological concepts.\n\nFor example: When I read that Robert Putnam writes in \"Bowling Alone\" about \"the decline of social capital in the United States and its consequences for democracy, community, and individual well-being\", I expect at least a lengthy chapter of the book will deal with Bourdieu's theory of capital. But there's no such thing in \"Bowling Alone\".\n\nIs this characteristic of \"anglo-saxon\" sociology? I know you read the classics, too.\n\nI hope I'm making sense here...",

      "text": "Hi, I am doing a bachelors in sociology, and I just got done with my first year. This year, while a lot of theoretical confusions got cleared, I am highly confused about a lot of things. \n\nOver the year, we have read a number of ethnographies; we keep moving back and forth between theories and ethnographies, which seems to be a nice balance. But all I have been wondering for the past few days is: how do we, as sociologists or young sociologists, actually bring about change? We are reading ethnographies now; after a few years, we will conduct ethnographic research and submit our thesis. We will get a master's degree and then a phd. Maybe we'll do a lot of ethnographies by then. We will write about different communities' lifestyles, their pain and grief, exploitation, social realities, and what not. \n\nBut how do we move forward from here? It's like a viscious circle where we keep going back and forth with the same theories. I don't even care about jobs, but how does, my research, change anything in their lives?",

      "text": "Trans sociology enthousiast here, I've been grappling with some confusing thoughts about transidentity from a sociological perspective. I'm hoping you experts could help provide some clarity... \n\nSo, sociology and gender studies often emphasize that gender is a social construct. From this viewpoint, gender isn’t something inherent within us but rather something we \"perform\" according to societal expectations.\n\nHowever, my personal experience from a young age was a deep disconnect between the gender I was assigned at birth and my internal sense of self. In trans communities, this is often framed through essentialist narratives, suggesting that we are \"born in the wrong body\" or have always been the gender we identify with. I embraced this narrative for a long time to make sense of my own trans experience, but my exploration of sociology has challenged that.\n\nFrom a sociological perspective, the idea that we \"are\" our gender doesn’t seem to hold up. We \"do\" gender, but what explains the strong resistance to assigned gender roles from such a young age (as I experienced personally)? \nI’d really appreciate hearing your thoughts on this, whether from your own interpretation or from a more scientific standpoint. Also, are there any studies that explore this apparent contradiction?",

      "text": "Hey everyone!\nLove the community here and hope I could get a hand? I am a medical sociologist focusing on the sociology of food food for my MA Thesis. In final revisions I have been evaluating a claim I made in the earlier lit review - \"One study reports that Americans eat 20% of their meals in a car (Washington Post, 2002)\". This has been an utter nightmare and transformed into a whole dive into this claim, and I'm struggling to verify it.\n\nThis claim is commonly accepted (see various news sources, law firms, lawyers, etc. quoting this statistic on forums and websites *without a cite). First, the Washington Post article I linked actually talked about the American diet broadly and did not provide a source, I don't even think it was right.\n\nDiving into the claim has lead me here. Googling it will bring up DoSomething.org that cites a Stanford study. I cannot find this Stanford article to save my life. I did find a review of it stating that they state a certain researcher [see later], but that's a tenuous connection. Next, I found that Michael Pollan (In Defense of Food and The Omnivores Dilemma) has been the main propogator of this claim. It starts in a 2006 Grist interview promoting The Omnivores Dilemma. Reviewing that book, he cites Jon Mooallem (2005 Harper's Magazine Article about food soup cans). John Mooallem cites this author - John Nihoff from the Culinary Institute of America. Michael Pollan updates his quote and citation later stating \"roughly a fifth of all eating now takes place in the car\" [In Defense of Food, p. 189] where he now cites John Nihoff, in a study commissioned by industry and unpublished...\n\nIt all boils down to the work of this John Nihoff. Supposedly an alumni scholar of Gastronomy and other things at the Culinary Institute of America. Reportedly, he was a judge on Iron Chef (IMDb page) and may be the head of food and beverage at some golf club. I'm certain he exists. However, I cannot find anything about this mans professional work. No CV. Just round about citations, mainly about this claim and Korean food. Not even any citations or mentions. Sure, industry is different and prohibitive in a lot of ways, but these studies are seemingly over 20 years old - Id imagine they should be able to be found. It really seems that Michael Pollan read this claim in a magazine and used it to sell his books and that this Jon Mooallem likewise heard the claim in some way and stated it in this article.\n\nThis is problematic in many ways, but I'll stop here. Just hoping to get a hand verifying this colloquial claim, which seems to be (in my opinion) false, or at least unverifiable. Any article from this John Nihoff or some sort of resume/CV is what I'm looking for. It's almost like this dude never existed or has been scrubbed from the internet. It's genuinely perplexing me. Thanks y'all!",

      "text": "Hey guys, I'm not sure if this is the right sub to turn to but I hope someone here can help me out or direct me to where I can ask this.\n\nSo I'm in grad school for Sociology, and recently I revisited a research project I had done during undergrad that a couple of my Sociology professors were interested in. They both encouraged me to go back to it and explore new theoretical frameworks to strengthen the argument. The first thing I did was send it to a stats professor, who pointed out a number of methodological issues, which has me wondering if the project is still salvageable or if I should just let it go.\n\nFor context, the paper explored how social dynamics influence ecological knowledge acquisition within a community-based conservation initiative. It focused on a marine protection organization and used a mixed-methods design, with an emphasis on quantitative analysis. We surveyed 54 community members using structured questionnaires, collecting data on variables like frequency of meeting attendance, trust in officers and peers, participation in environmental activities, and recent training.\n\nThe core analysis used binary logistic regression to model the relationship between these predictors and ecological knowledge level (categorized as low vs. high based on open-ended test responses). The statistical procedure had three stages:\n\n1. A general model with backward likelihood ratio stepwise regression to identify significant predictors across the full sample.\n2. A subgroup analysis looking at patterns among participants with low ecological knowledge.\n3. A nested logistic regression to test for interaction effects between traditional conservation interventions and social variables.\n\nThe main finding was that trust in officers was the most consistent and robust predictor of ecological knowledge. In contrast, more conventional predictors like training or hands-on participation lost significance once social variables were accounted for.\n\nThat said, here are the issues the stats professor flagged:\n\n* The small sample size limited statistical power, especially for detecting interaction effects or subtle group differences.\n* Using backward stepwise logistic regression, while common in exploratory work, can lead to overfitting.\n* The binary simplification of ecological knowledge, though useful for analysis, may have reduced nuance.\n* No significant interaction effects were found, possibly due to low power or truly independent variables.\n* The subgroup analysis for low-knowledge participants had weak explanatory value, suggesting more complex underlying factors not captured by the model.\n\nSo now I'm kind of stuck. Part of me still sees value in the findings and the initial encouragement makes me think there's something here, but I’m also not sure if the paper can be meaningfully revised, or if it’s better to just move on to something new. It's not for anything serious like a publication, but I would be interested in revising this for use in one of my classes.",

      "text": "Maybe it’s just me finishing up a masters degree and during my undergrad and graduate studies I took an interest in educational inequalities. Just for background the Univeristy I went to I entered as a freshman with a criminal justice major but the way they did it the sociology and criminal justice departments were combined and we had more of a sociological lense on criminal behaviors (Learning about community role, societal roles, familial role etc. ) and I started to get drawn to sociology. I went to gradhate school and did a Justice and Equity concentration. As I learned more about everything I realized one of the main sectors is education. I also worked as a teacher for high school students who were labeled with “behavioral” issues but I just realized they didn’t trust people who don’t look like them much, and they can fish out bs. \n\nTo clarify I worked for one of those third parties that had a classroom in a school district but I had clashes with admin from the school district and admin from the program I was working with. I felt like they both were trying to dumb down the boys (classroom of all boys) from their levels. They had them on computer programs that were at 2nd grade levels, tried to give them books and handouts way under their grade levels and even when I joined in the middle of the school year (in November) they didn’t have many resources in the classroom. Deadass I had to beg my supervisor for classroom books, a curriculum, supplies, even new books to make the kids read at a grade level closer to their age. When I tell you I was in raged most the time. I mean even things like how they tried to tell me to approach the students saying you have to go in like your an authority figure or they won’t respect you. \n\nI know me personally 23 year old black female if someone comes into a room saying I’m your boss you do what I say I shut down and look at them funny especially if they look nothing like me. I’m sorry to make it a race thing but I think that was some of the disconnection too. There was no diversity on the admin team no one who looked like me or my students so no one to really understand us. \n\nCase managers, school psyc same thing and I have much respect for them but there needs to be a lot more representation In the school system for African American students, students with rough upbrings, students who are labeled as trouble etc. I feel like sociology gave me an insight onto issues within the school system and I didnt last all but six months there. But back to teaching once I settled into a routine I noticed my students were warming up to me, they enjoyed the ice breakers I was doing, they got along better with their peers learning about differences, the lessons, keeping constant communications with their parents about the good things as well as the places of improvement with the parents, the books we were reading and their behaviors started to turn around. After I left I got texts from my TA’s on how the students behaviors are worse than ever the new teachers they have (the behavior techs from the program I worked for) were triggering them, making them walk out of class etc. I don’t know maybe its all me I’m not saying go into teaching but maybe we need to have sociologist in the schools to train admin, teachers, and work with students to understand some of the societal issues and stop certain things. Do you guys agree? Should sociologist also be in the schools to fish out issues like this?\n\nPS- I didnt leave voluntarily I had no choice but to leave when I had emergency surgery and admin was playing in my face during recovery. So I was forced to leave 2 weeks before school started, I did text all my kids parents to let them know I would be leaving. The texts from my TA was the first week of school when I was recovering.",

Or maybe my question is naive, I’m not sure. \n\nI’ve come across a lot of research on how society feels about queer communities, sexual health issues, and issues around community in general but not about contemporary queer attitudes toward sex in general. In my experience, queer people are much more open about their sexuality (in America) and have a very different relationship to sex and shame than heterosexual peers. \n\nAny recommendations on reading? Is my assumption wrong on its face and there’s not really a demonstrable difference?",

I wanted to create a space where people applying to Sociology PhD programs for the 2025 cycle could chat, share updates, and any news we have as the deadlines close and we play the waiting game. I think having community during this time will be really helpful. :)\n\nSo, to get it started, I was thinking we could share the schools we applied to, our areas of interests, and some advice you may have for people in future application cycles who may find this thread, as I know lurking on this subreddit has been really reassuring and helpful for me throughout this process, and made it all a bit less isolating.\n\n* I applied to 15 schools (shoutout McNair fee waivers): Brown, Columbia, Georgia State, Michigan State, Northwestern, Princeton, Berkeley, Santa Barbara, Chicago, UIC, Michigan, Minnesota, Pennsylvania, Texas, and Wisconsin.\n* My general areas are family, aging, and gender. I'm more qual oriented.\n* My primary advice for future applicants is to dedicate the most time to your Statement of Purpose. I spent *so* much time writing and rewriting it, and I ended up feeling really confident about my application because of the time I dedicated to that process. Get organized quickly in the application cycle, especially if you are applying to a lot of schools. Know your formatting for each school and make note of it in your spreadsheets so you don't have to go to the program websites every time you start working on a statement. If you are trying to get fee waivers, make sure you do the request early, it took schools quite a bit of time to approve mine.\n\nI am excited to hear from everyone!",

      "text": "Hello there,\n\nI have recently been thinking about this problem a lot. Namely, that \"modern\" western societies are, in my opinion as a foreigner, highly atomized, individualized societies. The sociological literature I have thus far seen seems to support this, since the field has been focussing more and more on the process of individualization, particularly during the second half of the 20th century, while moving away from older, more collectively oriented paradigms like structural functionalism.\n\nMy interpretation of this phenomenon is that it is the product of ever increasing specialization/division of Labour, rationalization and the increasing influence of capitalism (more specifically neoliberalism) in culture as well as our collective psyche. It sounds a bit abstract and non-scientific, but I think that this process of individualization, which started as a way to promote individual autonomy, has rotted away people's sense of community/communitarian purpose. This is made worse by the development of the internet, which has promoted the growth of millions of micro-cultures, which are, in a way, not real, since they mostly only exist online and do not require actual social interaction.\n\nMy question is, is there a way for a society to truly modernize, rationalize its institutions and ensure individual freedoms, while avoiding this fate? Are Atomization and Loneliness the price we have to pay for economic prosperity?",

Before diving in, I wanted to reach out to this amazing community to get your thoughts and feedback!\n\n# The Vision:\n\nImagine a platform where sociologists and researchers can:\n\n* **Share Datasets Seamlessly:** Upload, search, and combine datasets from different fields (e.g., sociology, economics, climate science) without technical barriers.\n* **Collaborate in Real Time:** Work on shared projects with features like virtual labs, live editing, and interactive modeling.\n* **Develop and Test Models**: Build and validate theoretical and statistical models directly on the platform, enabling scenario simulations and hypothesis testing.\n* **Access AI Tools for Analysis:** Use built-in AI tools for qualitative coding, data visualization, and predictive modeling.\n* **Open Peer Review and Feedback:** Publish preprints, invite peer review, and track contributions transparently.\n* **Global Inclusivity:** Support multilingual access, citizen science participation, and equitable opportunities for researchers in developing regions.\n\n# Why Now?\n\nWhile platforms like Harvard Dataverse, ICPSR, and ResearchGate exist, they’re often fragmented, costly, or focused on static data sharing. This project aims to **integrate existing tools** and create a dynamic environment for sociological research and interdisciplinary collaboration.\n\n# My Questions for You:\n\n1. Would you find a platform like this useful for your research or teaching?\n2. What specific features would make it most valuable to you?\n3. Are there pain points in existing platforms you’d like solved?\n4. Would you support a system that emphasizes **open science ethics** and **global equity**?\n\nI’m committed to keeping this **free** and building it as an **open-source project** with input from the research community. If enough interest exists, I’d love to share updates and even invite beta testers as we move forward.\n\nLooking forward to hearing your thoughts, critiques, and ideas!\n\nThanks!",

      "text": "Hey all. \n\nI'm faced with a bit of a(n exciting) dilemma. I (f36) am finally going back to university next year, after years of working with diverse communities in music and culture and as a qualitative brand researcher. \n\nI know that I'm extremely interested in sociology and that it could provide the perfect umbrella for my research interests. They are: sociology of emotions and mental health, social policy, sociological theory, feminism, politics, elderly people, futurism. My main interest lies with mental health and mental health justice. \n\nI'm currently trying to choose between an MA in sociology, an MSc in sociology (like MA but with added, mandatory quant methods) and a programme called MSc Equality. The latter combines feminist sociology and research methods, social justice, critical political economy and politics / policy. If I could, I'd do them both and classic sociology is very interesting to me and all the areas covered in the MSc Equality would be equally exciting. \n\nI've heard different things about progressing towards a PhD with a classic subject like sociology and an interdisciplinary master's like the MSc Equality Studies. I'm planning to:\n- Progress towards a funded PhD\n- Obtain a teaching position at some point\n- Continue academic research\n- Also engage in policy advisory roles and activism\n- Ideally resulting in a hybrid career that is split between academia and on the ground work\n\nPlease give me your insights on the reality of pursuing a PhD with an interdisciplinary master's compared to a classic subject. Do I need quant methods for a PhD / would this increase my chances of obtaining funding? Should I go for the course that speaks more to me right now (Equality Studies) or the one I think might make more sense in the long term (Sociology)?\n\nThanks!",

      "text": "The shift from sacred-profane cycles of traditional societies to “algorithmic time” in the digital era redefines how we structure and value our days. Historically, societies organized time through sacred rituals, festivals, or communal observances that punctuated profane, everyday life (as Durkheim noted). These cycles created cohesion and meaning.\n\nToday, algorithms curate a new kind of rhythm. For example:\n\n1.\tStreaming Services and “Binge Releases”: Platforms like Netflix create pseudo-sacred events when they drop entire seasons at once. The collective anticipation mirrors traditional rituals, but instead of gathering in a physical space, viewers synchronize globally online. The bingeing itself becomes a shared “sacred” experience.\n\n2.\tSocial Media Trends: Viral challenges or meme cycles on platforms like TikTok and Instagram define temporal rituals. People “participate” in the trend while it’s relevant (the sacred moment) before it fades into everyday noise (profane time). For example, short-lived hashtag holidays (e.g., #NationalPizzaDay) shape modern time-bound rituals.\n\n3.\tE-commerce Cycles: Black Friday and Cyber Monday have become algorithm-driven global rituals. Amazon’s “Prime Day” introduces artificial scarcity to create a sense of urgency and collective participation.\n\nIn these examples, algorithms replicate traditional cycles by shaping human behavior and creating new rhythms of “togetherness.” Yet, unlike sacred rituals that were grounded in meaning, these algorithmic rituals often prioritize engagement, consumption, or profit. This raises questions about whether they offer genuine community or exploit our need for connection and structure.",

      "text": "I'm kind of a socially awkward guy, so making friends and/or partners is kind of difficult. I don't have a very natural smile, so I rarely show it and when I do I look like a psychopath. I'm also kind of an odd person in general. I tend to be both blunt and passive, which is an upsetting combination for some people. I think many assume I'm a threat, but I'm completely harmless-I wouldn't fight back if someone stabbed me. Due to all of this, I rarely am anything but quiet in most social settings, unless I'm with the three or so friends I do have. I sometimes have somewhat better luck at bars than parties, but I eventually get insecure and worry I'm acting drunk and stupid, which always leads to failure.\n\nI know how I come off. I'm not expressive and I can seen kind of emotionless. I am usually reserved on the approach, but direct whenever my interest overrides my awkwardness. I don't even particularly enjoy crowds of people, as I'm on the spectrum and kind of have a social toleration limit that maxes out at about six or so people. My family often finds me disappearing at gatherings. It's hard for me to hide how much of an outsider I am, and I can come off as rude because I'm just so socially worn out. Also, despite being on the spectrum, I don't particularly like talking to most people who are autistic. Not to say that I have anything against them, I just find it kind of tedious and I generally don't hold a lot of the same interests.\n\nWhile I enjoy Reddit and other internet forums, I am not interested in finding solely internet friends. Although I enjoy niche discussions, there does come a time where I get tired of talking about tv shows, music, and politics and want to have a human conversation. I have a few friends that fill this need, but they're all going through things and have far more of a life than I do, so I don't want to overburden them. Is there something I can practice that can make me both able to tolerate being in social settings and coming off well in them?",

I’m bad at talking in person, she’s great at talking in person. She basically talks, and all I say back is either “yeah” or I repeat what she said. For example, she’ll say “my friends and I went to an abandoned house, and we kept hearing things move and doors close, and they wanted to keep going, but I wanted to leave.” and I’ll respond with something like “they still wanted to stay??” Or she’ll say “there was only one person at work all day today” and I’ll reply “only one person??” \n\nIt’s so annoying, I can’t have interesting conversations for my LIFE with her (or most other people, actually).

      "text": "I have been reading this book about 7 habits of highly effective people. And from the beginning the arguments of the author are to archieve interdependence after achieving independence. But I cant wrap my mind about why independence is better than dependence. I still believe that some dependence is needed in a healthy lifestyle and in certain situation. I do agree that dependence is in some case holding you back from things but as long as you benefit from being dependent isn't that nice ? \nI believe being for instance emotionally dependent is needed in a relationship for example. in my opinion else it wouldn't be a relationship, I agree that both partners have to have some sense of independence but not fully being independent.. But in this book they say: \" If I were emotionally dependent, my sense of worth and security would come from your opinion of me. If you didn’t like me, it could be devastating\" im not saying being dependent is good, but I dont see the benefits of being 100% independent. \nEspecially I feel women are generall more dependent on their partner than the other way around.. why is that ? \nAns I still dont see the main arguments of why one would want to archieve independence. Do I misunderstand the terms ?",

Why am I feeling this way? There's no reason for me to feel like this right now and yet it still just sticks like a parasite in my system that won't stop eating away at my ability to feel calm with social interaction, and I know it's normal to feel nervous, but I don't think it's normal to not be able to respond without feeling like I did something wrong before I even fucking said anything, look I've gone on for awhile, but I truly need some advice, is there anything I can do to maybe help? I've been on VR chat and I'm enjoying talking to people on there and I feel like that's actually kinda helping me realize that the world isn't against me and not everyone are just bad people who will shit on you just for speaking",

But do you guys think she keeeeeeeeps putting me down because she is insecure of herself? It hurts me so much when someone outrightly says stuff like that to my face and i take it to heart even though im learning not to.\n\nif all these comments are coming from a place of insecurity or jealousy, this is really pushing me harder to work on my appearance (like i feel motivated lol)\n\nI think she likes me personality because we used to get on quite well until she started putting me down for my looks.\n\nthanks!",

      "title": "Topic: Women and the power of Choice",
      "text": "How can we say that everyone has a choice when there are those who wish to infringe on another's rights? No, this is not a comment about the pandemic. Yet, a remark about the abortion laws that Abbott and his colleagues are trying to pass. We live in a country that is praised as the \"land of the free and home of the brave.\" In contrast, trying to control a woman's body does not embellish a land where people have freedom. Likewise, a man's attempt to dominate a woman is an act of cowardice. \n\nFor centuries, women have been deemed the \"inferior\" sex. Misogyny has created infamous social struggles throughout the years. Women had to fight for their freedom to vote in politics, strive to become a part of the working class and fight for the respect that they deserved. Anyone in favor of laws that result in the oppression of a marginalized group- in this case women- then they should be exposed as oppressors. Further, those in legislation do not deserve their seat in office if they have are unable to render laws that reflect the good of all. As evident, Abbott is lead by a hatred of women- hence bringing the presence of a law that would be detrimental to every female body. \n\nThe additional social harm of the abortion law rests in the fact that the mandate would indirectly protect rapists. If a man forces himself on a woman and impregnate her, then she should have a choice whether or not to keep the babe of her attacker. Sexual crimes are the most heinous because the offender has no regard for his victim. Who tends to be victims of rape? Women and children. Statistically, victims of sexual assault and rape tend to not receive the proper level of justice. People are too eager to blame the victim. Yet, the victim had no choice in the matter of their traumatic assault. Additionally, money tends to save sexual criminals from proper punishment. No one should be excused from their crimes simply because of their bank account. Evidently, as a modern society, we need to readjust how we handle sexual predators and rapists. \n\nWhy defend someone who clearly cannot keep his penis inside of his pants? Sexual criminals are not human since they lack a sense of humanity for their victims. Sexual predators look at women and children as a beast lunges towards a rabbit. Look into the psychological aspects of a sexual predator's brain and you will find proof that they do not think like the rest of us law abiding citizens. There exists, in the diction of psychology, a reptilian brain. The primitive form of the human brain controls natural drives such as: thirst, hunger, reproduction, territory, and habits. There can be validity in the concept that sexual predators function from their reptilian drives rather than the more conscientious and emotional mammal brain. What does that suggest? Sexual predators are less than human since they lack empathy and remorse to the humans that they hurt. Therefore, actions to protect or deny just punishment for such individuals suggests a direct attack on humanity. \n\nHow can one not empathize with victims of sexual crimes? The answer is simply that such people lack respect for the victim. For instance, since most sexual assault and rape victims are female, then those who do not punish their attacker exhibit misogyny. There are many cases when victims are berated and blamed for their attack. Additionally, should a woman be a prostitute, then her social status is the lowest of her sex. When people study the serial killings of prostitutes, then they usually find a lackadaisical investigation approach on the behalf of police. Should that be allowed? Absolutely not. Here's the matter of choice- the prostitute may freely exploit her body but she never chooses to be beaten or killed. \n\nThe freedom of choice applies to those who do not seek harm on another person. Yet, what happens when the freedom of choice is inapplicable? With the case of children, choice is not an option. They are too young to comprehend the evils of sex while being taken advantage of by a sexual predator. We live in a modern society in which teenage girls are no longer sold to the highest bidder. In previous centuries, since humans lived shorter lifespans, they were eager to maintain the population at an early age. At least, the matter would be more understandable if it wasn't for the egregious age differences between husband and wife. Men as old as forty would marry young girls around the age of fifteen. In the older days of Rome, the ages of consent were as low as twelve for female and fourteen for males. Even if the age difference was five years, with the case of a twenty year old male and fifteen year old female, the psychological growth between the two differs starkly. The older male is more cognitive about sexual matters than his betrothed. Additionally, the issue with marrying and child bearing at a young age can lead to adverse health effects. The younger the mother, then the greater odds of birth defects and labor complications. \n\nIn modern times, there is an increase in sexuality amongst teenagers. As long as consent exists between a couple, then there is not an issue. However, when teenage pregnancy occurs, then the option for abortion should be available. The young couple may have consented to sex, but neither of them may have planned for a baby. True, there is an option to set up one's child for adoption. However, with a young body- as mentioned before- comes with the risks for birth defects and child birthing complications. Additionally, is it fair for a teenage girl to have a baby when she is not mentally or financially prepared to care for said forth child? Having sex is easy, but providing proper care for an infant- another human life- is not. Especially, for young couples. Further, there are many cases when the teenage boy responsible for impregnation runs away from responsibility. The responsibility of child rearing is not solely the mother's role. In fact, the father has an equal duty to help provide for his child. It takes two people to create life. Therefore, the responsibility should be split. \n\nWhat about the cases where an abusive father is present? To note, rape and sexual assault were hardly considered in earlier societies. People figured that if a man and woman were married, then it is the right of the latter to provide sexual pleasure to the other. Women were thought of as nothing more than baby crafting machines whose sole duty rests as a homemaker. As time progresses, there is more understanding about the dark side of marriage. Yes, there are abusive men who try to take advantage of their spouse. They will take out their aggression and sexual impulses on their wives. Additionally, there are many cases where that aggression transfers from wife to child. Social injustice exists when women are unable to properly remove themselves from abusive their negative home environment. With separation in mind, a woman still needs finances in order to properly file a divorce claim. When children are involved, the mother needs more evidence and funding to get the court on her side. At times, there are cases when children are given to their abusive parent. Lawyers working on defense for a father may try to forge evidence to suggest that his wife is mentally instable. Such family court cases are painful to watch and even more damaging to a loving mother trying to protect her children. Ultimately, how does this thought relate to the abortion law? Well, it suggests that there are cases where women seeking justice, but are brought into a disadvantageous situation. \n\nPeople have a bad habit of giving into stereotypes and social stigmas. Such is the reason why innocent women do not receive the same quality of justice as men. The solution is to bring more women and empathetic men into leadership positions. In order to have a prosperous community, we must have a stronger sense of balance. There must exist, not just equality, but equity for all despite race, sex, age, and creed. We must understand that in order to be free, means having the freedom to choose who we are and what values we stand by. I stand by the women who want to have a choice whether or not to have an abortion. Abortion is not a case of murder when there is no fully developed child. A human soul cannot live in an incomplete vessel. Therefore, abortion is not murder. Further, abortion can help prevent: adverse health issues on the part of the mother; the growth of a birth defected baby; the psychological disturbances from having a child out of rape; and other issues contingent on an individual case. \n\nOverall, if you truly believe that America is a free country, then you cannot play the role of God in determining what is morally wrong. Abortion needs to be and remain a matter of choice. Let's not allow misogyny to create a state of oppression. Women have been mistreated enough throughout history. Additionally, it is time to prevent sexual criminals from paying their way out of their punishment. For the sakes of women, both young and old, there's a need to maintain a social balance.",

      "text": "Full disclosure, I am a pro-choice Democrat from Texas living in Florida. I am staunchly against this law. However, my family is in Texas and republican. I have learned to argue politics with them from their point of view. So I proposed these arguments to show them how this law could effect them negatively. \n\nA point that I brought up really got them thinking. Warning I do generalize in this argument. I understand that not all abortion situations follow this model. \n\nStatistically, people that seek abortions are in poverty. In Texas, because of discrimination and unequal opportunities most of these people are black and brown. Usually, people of color vote democratic again not all but most. In the 2020 election we saw that the state is barely red with almost a 50/50 split. \n\nWith this new law Republicans are basically legislating themselves out of power in about 18 years. By forcing people against their will to carry to term they are allowing an increase in the Democratic voting base in the state of Texas. Think before you legislate other people’s choices you might face unwanted consequences. \n\nNot to mention the increase of potential homelessness, crime, increase in occupants of an already huge prison population, child hunger, strain on the foster system and more children needing free school lunch and infiltrating your “rich white schools”. This is due to the financial strain of trying to provide for unwanted children. We already have the research that poverty leads to all of these things. Guess who will pay for all of this, the middle class and upper class people of Texas who typically don’t need an abortion in the first place.",

There are fully grown-ups everywhere, having a dark view on the world. In their eyes, certain groups of people shouldn't exist in their world, not talk to them. Patting the sad person in the back really doesn't make sense, it is consided the normal thing to do but it is not enough to help the offensive one...",

T This method allows the questioner to ask others to help them find the answer to solve the problem on their own . However, the problem is the middle managers have started to get in the habit of asking too many questions. They even start the conversation by asking each other questions and of course they ask the staff a lot. Sometimes I feel like the question is really stupid or they clearly know the answer. I feel very uncomfortable. I think we don't seem to like being questioned a lot. \n\nI want to ask everyone, is there a limit or rule in how to behave politely?",

      "text": "\"Is this still part of the experiment?\"\n-Troy Barnes\n\n\n\n\n\"Social Psychology\" picks up with Jeff (Joel McHale) avoiding walking to his next class with Shirley (Yvette Nicole Brown).  He tells Britta (Gillian Jacobs) that it's because they don't have anything in common to talk about and that Shirley's overly positive attitude can be too much for him.  The next day, when Jeff gets stuck walking with Shirley, it's very awkward until they bond over talking crap about other people.  This works until they see Britta making out with Vaughn (Eric Christian Olsen), a hippie student she had recently started hanging out with, which upsets Jeff.\n\nBritta finds Jeff later and says she didn't tell Jeff about Vaughn because she was worried Jeff would make fun of him for his hippie attitude.  Jeff decides not to talk crap about Vaughn with Shirley anymore and when Shirley brings up Vaughn's tiny nipples, Jeff runs away.   Later, Britta tries to talk to Jeff about her worries that Vaughn is moving their relationship too fast.  She shows him a poem Vaughn wrote for her.  Jeff can't resist and takes a picture of it.  He shows it to Shirley and they gleefully mock Vaughn.  Pierce (Chevy Chase) overhears part of their conversation with his latest purchase, the Ear-Noculars.  He believes they are talking crap about him, so he confronts them in the study room.  They reveal they were talking about Vaughn and Shirley shows the rest of the group, minus Britta, the poem.  When Britta and Vaughn walk in, they quickly realize what's going on and leave.\n\nShirley admits to Jeff that she has a gossiping problem and they both agree it needs to stop.  Shirley gives Jeff one last piece of info; that Britta had a sex dream about him, but refuses to give any more detail.  Britta tells Jeff that Vaughn dumped her and Jeff apologizes and says he doesn't want to be on the friend-level where he has to hear about the guys Britta dates.  Later, Jeff sees Shirley and Britta gossiping and tries to borrow Pierce's Ear-Noculars, but he got rid of them.  Pierce tells Jeff that man was not meant to hear from a distance, but only from those who are close to them.  \n\nMeanwhile, Vaughn's existence has become much less carefree due to his experience with the study group.\n\nAnnie (Alison Brie) asks to join Professor Duncan's (John Oliver) psych lab.  He agrees and tells her to bring two human subjects for the experiment.  She convinces Troy (Donald Glover) and Abed (Danny Pudi) to go.  Señor Chang (Ken Jeong) is also one of the subjects.  The experiment involves forcing the participants to wait for the experiment to start in the waiting room and seeing how long it takes for them to meltdown as the experiment never starts.  The researchers all watch from the next room as the participants blow their tops one by one.  Chang explodes instantly and Troy manages to make it several hours.  Eventually only Abed is left.  He sits patiently for 26 hours, which causes Professor Duncan to explode and take out his frustration on Annie, which ends the study.  Annie tells Abed to leave.\n\nThe next day, Annie reveals the true nature of the experiment to Troy and Abed.  Abed reveals he was actually livid with how long it was taking, but waited because of his friendship with Annie.  She feels bad and buys Abed the first three Indiana Jones movies to make up for it.\n\nThe episode ends with Troy and Abed in the study room making fun of people passing by and thinking no one can hear them.  When they make fun of Jeff, he reveals that everyone can hear everything they've been saying.  Troy and Abed pretend to be asleep.\n\n\nWhat Works:\n\nThe psych lab storyline is the much stronger story in this episode.  We get some great physical comedy from the study, even from the background extras.  I love the various meltdowns we get to watch.  Chang is great, but the random screaming student is hilarious and we also get one student chasing another around the room.  \n\nThe best of the bunch is Troy's meltdown.  It includes the Soul Train Awards and butt stuff before he literally drags himself out of the room, which has since become an excellent GIF.  That's how you exit a scene, right there!\n\nEric Christian Olson gives a good performance as Vaughn.  He seems like he'd be a fun dude to hang out with and you can't help but feel bad for him when he realizes the study group is making fun of his poem.  He brings a fun and chill energy to the role and I think about his delivery of \"Some worries\" all the time.\n\nFinally, Pierce gets a rare profound moment with Jeff when he talks about why he got rid of the Ear-Noculers.  Sure, he may be full of crap and actually got rid of them because he overheard people making fun of him, but it's still a genuinely nice Pierce scene and we don't get too many of those.\n\n\nWhat Sucks:\n\nThe problem with this episode is that it's mean.  The main focus of this episode is Jeff and Shirley making fun of people behind their back.  That doesn't exactly make for likable characters.  It's one thing to do that to Pierce, but Vaughn didn't do anything to deserve that sort of treatment.  Making this the main storyline of the episode feels poorly thought out.\n\nIn all honesty, none of the study group except for Britta come off as very likable in the episode.  Pierce, Annie, Troy, and Abed all join in on making fun of Vaughn's poem and even in the end tag we get Troy and Abed just mocking random people passing by.  Aren't we supposed to like these people?  This episode mostly comes off as mean-spirited.  It doesn't help that none of them really face any sort of comeuppance for their actions.  Maybe if Vaughn or Britta got back at the others in some capacity, it would have worked better.\n\nFinally, the jokes about Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull are hackneyed and uninspired.  By all means, make fun of the movie, but the jokes actually need to be funny instead of just saying the movie blows.\n\n\nFunniest Moment:\n\nThe funniest moment of the episode is Troy dragging himself out of the waiting room.  The physicality Donald Glover gives to that scene is simply wonderful.  And it's an excellent GIF.\n\n\nHeavenly Human Being:\n\nThe Heavenly Human Being goes to the MVP of the episode.  For \"Social Psychology,\" this Award goes to Abed Nadir for being willing to wait for 26 hours to help Annie with her psych experiment.  This is Abed's 2nd time winning this Award, which puts him in 1st place overall.\n\n\nVerdict:\n\n\"Social Psychology\" is probably my least favorite episode of the series so far.  The psych experiment storyline is fun with some entertaining meltdowns.  Plus Pierce has a really nice scene and Eric Christian Olson does a good job, but he majority of the cast come off as incredibly unlikable in this episode and it's not in a fun way like on It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia.  I just don't think the main storyline of the episode works and the resolution falls flat.\n\n 6/10: Okay",

      "text": "Warning: it's a long one, i'm very passionate about this.\n\nFirst I want to say that of course Abed is not representative of all autistic people, and he's never even explicitly stated to be autistic. Still you you'd have to be an idiot not to notice the similarities between Abed's character and real autism. On top of that Dan Harmon has stated that he discovered  he was autistic while writing Abed. That makes me pretty confident that he is supposed to represent ASD in some way. \n\nI'm pretty sure that fellow autistic people can attest that it is rare to see a good representation of autistic traits in movies and tv shows. A lot of them are inacurate, harmful or represent it as some horrible dissease or something to be laughed at. It is often a flaw of the character and rarely a strength. This is nog the case in community. Abed is arguebly the best character in community, and especially in the first seasons he is one of the least flawed people. It's so nice to finally see an autistic person so universally beloved. \n\nWhat communty does, that most shows don't is also focus on the strenghts and beautiful parts of autism. They also delve into the struggles but i'll talk about that later. It's so important and meaningful to me to see a piece of media where my disorder is treated with respect instead of just sympathy. Think of the episode with white abed where they try to teach Abed to change to be more likeable for the girl. At the end of the episode Abed talks about how it was easy to change for other people because it's not a big deal if you really know and accept yourself. A lot of autistic people would be able to relate to this since a lot of us are a lot less sensitive to societal pressure and social rules. It's nice to see that strenght appreciated. \n\nIn the very first episode, autistic people's tendency to info dump and ask a lot of questions to show interest is also depicted as a strength in the 'I see your value now' scene.\n\nBesides that they also accuratly depict the struggles with autism without being overly infantelizing in the way that happens a lot in media or the conversation about autism. There are a couple moments that genuinly made me cry because they were so relatable  to me. Like when Abed says that some people try to help him and when they realise they can't they get frustrated and give up. I'm sure a lot of autistic people can relate to this as well, or at least I do. People think you need to be changed even though you are the way that you are because of a disorder. And when they realise you won't change they reveal that they weren't that accepting of you in the first place even though they were trying to be nice and they get tired of you. It's such a subtle part of autism that i've never seen represented before.\n\nBesides that there's another moment in the chicken fingers episode wher abed says he used to need tv shows and movies to make sense of the real world. This is another thing that's  so relatable to me.  I do the same thing. often feel like these pop culture obsessions that a lot of people have are regared with a bit of ridicule in a lot of media (think big bang theory). But it's so necessary to me and i'm sure to other autistic people. Community never ridicules abed for his habit. \n\nThen there's the moment in one of the earliest episodes, the one where he takes a film class, that shows how much people can struggle with their neurotypical family and that that doesn't necessarily need to be because of malice from either side, but just because you communicate differently. In the end no one is the villain in this episode. \n\nThere's many other little moments like this, but the point is that abed's depiction is so refreshing and satisfying, deeply relatable, sometimes in such a way that it makes me cry, but also finally an acknowledgement of our strengths. On top of that it touches on parts of the disorder that are so rarely talked about that most other shows with autistic characters don't even mention them. Partly, probably because of the fact that he was written by and actual autistic person. \n\nThey also never give into the trope of the autistic person being crazy talented at one thing. A lazy way for neurotypicals to appreciate autistic people. But this whole trope makes it seem that autism's strengths lay outside of the disorder, like you need a redeeming quality to make up for the fact that you're autistic. While Dan Harmon realises that there are strenghts within the disorder. \n\nAbed has his flaws and so do real autistic people, but in this show people are patient with him and show true acceptance. while many people in real life try to change you or are only accepting as long as your autism doesn't become annoying.\n\nSo thank you to Dan Harmon for seeing the beauty in autism without dismising the struggle and writing this incredible character and thank you to Danny Pudi for depicting him so respectfully.",

      "text": "People always talk about how abed is great representation but they also always talk about how he became more sociopathic near the end, and how it kind of ruined his character but I feel like that adds another layer autism representation nobody talks about.\n\nAt the end of the episode with all the celebrity impersonators Troy and Abed have a fight and Abed compares Troy wanting to help Abed the same as Abed wanting to hire impersonators, when there's clear differences but it's supposed to represent how his inability to read social cues comes off a selfish. Troy couldn't articulate it so he just said \"you're going to have to trust me\" and Abed knew he messed up somehow with his evil abed schtick. Troy was the only one there helping him cope as most people police abed on his negative attributes while Troy tried his best to walk the tightrope of defending/teaching abed about his self indulgence. (Calling him out on catfishing while letting him do it, telling abed to calm down during lava world while letting him abandon Britta)\n\nOnce he left the only people who cared enough was Britta and Frankie (Annie when the plot requires it), but for season 5 nobody listened to Britta, there was nobody to check on his self indulgence which meant he consistently went too far to the point where Buzz Hickey handcuffed Abed for his self indulgence resulting in destroying his art.\n\nI looked up people's opinions about this punishment and people said it was completely fine because there was no other way to make sure he doesn't go to the movies, and Hickey doesn't have the same precedent set with Abed as the rest of the group. Someone called Abed just absurdly selfish, and especially in season 5-6 just being generally more of a bad person. When really what happened is the person who actively helped him learn, left, and the only other person who tried is ignored constantly. Which resulted in convenient mix of being a punching bag and infantilization whenever they feel like it, regardless or not if he's out of line, but rather if they personally hated what he did more than usual. Ie Buzz Hickey's punishment vs Implied Infantilization of Abed's Bluntness in Meow Meow Beanz even though he called Shirley a monster, to her face, when Shirley would not stand being insulted in any other context.\n\nIt really shows a realistic \"Pet Autistic Friend\" stereotype where the first season starts with everyone actively trying to fight for Abed from his own father, police his bad actions ONLY when it affects them, and by the sixth season Jeff is physically harming Abed for daydreaming, and I feel like not enough people talk about that kind of relationship enough being presented.",

      "text": "Listen, I love Abed. He was my favorite character on first watch and I still love him. And because I do, I feel I can comment on this.\n\nI feel that Abed's alluded to autism has been used as an excuse for him to act like a bad person at times. Or that his bad behavior is always written off as a little adorable and quirky rather than just bad. He started tracking the girls' periods because it helped him socialize with them, he let Troy and Britta continue to fake their sex life because he liked getting donuts. The main example I’m gonna talk about here is something only briefly mentioned in the series.\n\nIn season 5, episode 4, Cooperatively Polygraphy, it's revealed that Abed created a fake online dating profile to lure Annie into a fake relationship. She claims that she \"bore her soul\" to him and was very vulnerable with him. He then says that he did it because he liked how Annie acted when she was in a relationship, like making him breakfast.\n\nUhm... what the actual fuck? This is never mentioned again and only mentioned as a joke. He catfished his *roommate and best friend* because he liked breakfast. That is horrible.\n\nThen, in season 5, episode 6, Analysis of Cork-Based Networking, Abed begins talking to and becoming interested in a deaf girl. He grew feelings for her and learned sign language for her, then it's revealed that she was hired by Britta to spoil the plot of a show he was watching. He then says that he's devastated and Britta says that she feels bad. It's the same situation that he did to Annie. Feels like karma.\n\nI just find it odd that multiple times throughout the show, it's casually mentioned that Abed has done some pretty bad things but it's always written off as a joke or a quirk. Yes, he's held accountable by the study group, but it doesn't actually change his narrative arc or impact how his character is written. He has no in universe consequences.\n\nThis is why I *love* scenes between Hickey and Abed in season 5 because Hickey calls him out and challenges him. He's the first person to do that.\n\nAgain, I love Abed. But I hate this pattern with his character.",

Maybe it’s just easier to write a sitcom when characters are trope-y?So in how I Met your mother, Ted goes from a normal young guy looking for love to a whiny, lovelorn, mush. In scrubs JD goes from a young doctor doing his best to an overly emotional goofball, always shouting “eagle!” And in 30 rock Jenna goes from Liz’s mostly normal best friend to a paranoid sociopath hell-bent on doing anything to get attention. I’m not complaining, I love all of those character characters, but it’s just something that happens in modern sitcoms.\n\nObviously, community likes to play with tropes in a very blatant and meta way. But the show still has its share of natural development. And for some folks, their progression and growth feels natural. But then I look at the Dean and Britta and it’s like wow time was not very kind to you, was it?\n\nI mean I love  the Dean so so much but by season six we have a literal (admittedly hilarious) rant from Frankie about how he’s actually unintelligent and useless. Ouch. It almost feels like he had to become 10 times more inept just to allow Frankie’s character to exist. \n\nand don’t get me started on Britta: how is it that she goes from a confident, intelligent, social advocate, to someone who quite *literally* craps her pants for no reason. \n\nWhy do you think that is? Is it just that it’s funny and somebody has to be the comic relief? Are we supposed to think these traits were always there from the beginning and we just never saw it until the later seasons? Or is there more to it?",

      "text": "I love Community, I can't help but rewatch it every couple weeks. Community is insanely inventive. it's filled with well-written episodes that bring fresh humor and genre-defying twists to television. From paintball wars to documentary-style parodies, the show constantly reinvents itself, creating episodes that feel like mini-movies. The creativity in these episodes made me fall in love with it and I've been loving it since then.\n\nHowever, when it comes to character development, the show sometimes falls short. Characters like Britta, Chang, and Shirley start with promising foundations but end up with uneven arcs. Britta, introduced as a sharp, socially aware individual, is gradually portrayed as naive and ineffective—a running gag that undermines her initial depth. Rather than evolve, she becomes the butt of the group’s jokes, often written as \"the worst\" despite her potential. And it always bums me out how a very interesting character with relatable flaws was sort of abandoned by the writing room.\n\nChang, too, begins as a quirky Spanish teacher but is quickly transformed into a chaotic caricature. His character loses consistency, going from unstable authority figure to a full-on wildcard, making it hard to root for or understand him in the same way as the rest of the cast. I'm ok with Chang as a wholw tho, all versions of him are pretty funny and entertaining. It's just weird how he changes so much throughout the show.\n\nThen there's Shirley Bennett, who starts as a complex character balancing her Christian values with a fierce personality. While Shirley’s role as the “mom” of the group offers unique perspectives, her character often gets sidelined or reduced to stereotypes about faith and motherhood. Her ambitions and complexities, especially her interest in business and independence, are sometimes touched upon but rarely given the same weight or follow-through as other characters' arcs. By the end, Shirley feels more like a background presence rather than a fully developed member of the ensemble. She's not interesting anymore, and often placed in scenarios that her only remaining traits make her insufferable.\n\nI was just wondering if anyone else agrees with my views on how character progression is super lackluster on Community sometimes, and if there's a reason for it. I've heard that Britta was supposed to be the love interest of the protagonist, and when that was abandoned, Dan Harmon wasn't sure what to do with her anymore. It makes sense when you watch how her character turned into a walking joke. but I was wondering what happened to Shirley, or if Chang was supposed to be this from the beginning or not.\n\nthoughts?",

      "title": "The Community Movie probably won’t happen at this point and I’m strangely at peace with it.",
      "text": "**TL; DR: The movie is now trapped in limbo and will probably quietly be cancelled in 2-3 years. But it’s okay: We have a great show to always watch and remember and maybe the movie was never going to be able to recapture the magic anyway.**\n\nLike all of you, September 30, 2022 was a very exciting day. The Community movie finally felt tangible for the first time: Peacock officially announced that they had acquired the rights to the movie with most of the cast and Harmon signing on. With the show picking up new fans during the pandemic in 2020-2021, including the successful table read, it felt like the stars had finally aligned to make the movie real.\n\nIn the same way the pandemic aligned the stars, the Hollywood strikes arrived to derail the momentum. The planned 2023 shoot was not able to happen. Since the end of the strikes in the Fall of 2023, it does not feel like the initial momentum for the movie has been regained. \n\nAnd sadly to me, it feels that maybe the opportunity to make the movie has passed. The cast are all crazy busy with successful careers. Although they are all grateful for their time on the show, I can’t imagine that clearing their schedules for the Community movie is the top priority for any of them. \n\nThe other sad fact is that Community’s pop cultural relevance has died down a bit again. The loyal fanbase that will always be there remains, but that rabid energy from new fans that found the show in the pandemic and early post-pandemic days has faded. Meaning that even though they gave it a green light, Peacock isn’t going to be pushing Harmon aggressively to finish the script and get this done. Peacock is probably in a “if it happens, great, but if it doesn’t happen, that’s fine too” mindset. \n\nMy hunch is that this movie will probably never happen. 2023 was the perfect time to capitalize on Community’s resurgence and the lull in the cast’s schedules. Since that window was missed due to the strikes, the movie is now in a limbo. They’ll try to match the cast’s schedules for the next few years, but will fail to do so. In late 2026 or 2027, I imagine we will finally get some acknowledgment from Harmon or a member of the cast that it’s not happening.\n\nAnd while it’s a huge bummer, I’m strangely at peace with it. We still have a spectacular show to rewatch and bond over. We’ll still have something great that we can introduce to our future friends and family. The cast and crew will still be with us through the other great work they are currently doing in Hollywood. The memories and joy of Community will not be diminished from the movie not getting made.\n\nPlus, maybe Community’s magic was never going to be recaptured. It is a product of a specific era of television and the cast at a specific age. In a streaming age and with the cast getting older, it is possible that this movie would have always felt like a pale imitation of what came before. I still would love to see it if it ever gets made, but it would be an uphill battle if it does get made. Maybe the promise of a Community movie would always be better than the final product. \n\nNow maybe I’m being too pessimistic. Maybe they will find a way to line up everyone’s schedules, film this thing, and make this post look hilarious in hindsight. However, I’m choosing to embrace and come to peace with this likely worst case scenario, so I can be pleasantly surprised if it doesn’t come to pass. Whether or not that is streets ahead of me remains to be seen.",

I've watched about 48% of the 394 movies so far. Idk if anyone else has tried to do this but it's pretty fun!\n\nEdit: Here's the link to my Letterboxd account if you want to follow along with my watching :) [https://boxd.it/7mkX1](https://boxd.it/7mkX1)\n\n...and here is the spreadsheet link for anyone who wants to see cool data :) [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1s17UfYqsY3MXlM5Iv8lShfKPqi1zwd30lqEWwk9djpw/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1s17UfYqsY3MXlM5Iv8lShfKPqi1zwd30lqEWwk9djpw/edit?usp=sharing)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/8d4qi1cpknie1.png?width=1840&format=png&auto=webp&s=7b3d6d96a0a0049d615eff0087f8926a31343753\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/h6hho9ppknie1.png?width=1840&format=png&auto=webp&s=c4232273d39522760f9da9a9b5f80af6c1045d9f",

      "text": "I'm not talking about Abed delivering a baby in the background or callbacks like the Beetlejuice gag, but things that were clearly stated and/or shown in one scene, but you only later realized what they meant.\n\nFor me, one was \"We don't celebrate birthdays or Christmas, and we can't drink, but it helps.\"  That made no sense to me; how can it help if you can't do it?  Later, I realized he meant, \"We're *not allowed* to drink, but I do it anyway, and it helps.\"\n\nAnother one was the Subway episode.  When the new Subway identity meets Britta, the joke is that the sandwich shop just hired someone new to be Subway, but he acted like it was he who participated in \"the deviant sex act you initiated without my consent.\"  But, at the time, I thought the joke was that now that the taboo was removed from Britta's relationship, she saw him as just an uptight, dorky, scrawny guy, not the hunk she couldn't help but \"deviate\" with in the pillow fort.  In other words, I thought we were seeing things from her perspective; she saw him as a different guy, when really he was the same guy.  After all, why would the sandwich shop have to tell the new guy to refuse Britta if they knew he wasn't even the same person from *her* perspective?  But now I see that the other interpretation is the intended one.\n\nWhat are some jokes that took you a while to \"get\"?\n\n  \nETA: Two weeks after the fact, I just thought of a third one: Chang's catchphrase, \"Ham, girl!\" is so catchy because it sounds like \"Damn, girl!\"  That one took me almost a decade to get....",

You’ve got subverted expectations, quick humor, visual gags, hell, it’s even got its own stack of homage episodes and crazy elements that rival the likes of the air conditioner repair school. It’s equal parts comedy and heart warming. It’s also not just dumb comedy, there are plenty of moments that make you think without feeling preachy. \n\nI highly recommend, and if you have watched it, I’m curious what your thoughts are as well. It’s on Hulu.",

Wanted to share my top 3 takeaways, In hopes that it inspires this community (“I see what I did there”):\n\n1. “No body is that bad”. Pierce is no worse than us and we’re no better than him. I love how the show brings human kind to equal footing. We’ve all made mistakes, but we’re all human beings. We deserve love from each other. \n\n2. Improve your mastery of holding on, and letting go. Pretty self explanatory I think. \n\n3. Family isn’t who you’re related to. It’s who you stick by. You can have family that you didn’t choose and choose family that you’re not related to. What defines family is loyalty, love and forgiveness. \n\nWould love to hear other lessons people have learnt. \n\nI’ll play myself out.",

But after recently going through the series again, I believe that if used as a stand alone episode it is one of the best. Not just of the series, but of any 30 minute comedy show out there. \n\n\nThe way it tells the story in a mythical D&D or LOTR style keeps it funny while dealing with very serious things like bullying, depression, and suicide. The episode has tons of heart, and very much is a roller-coaster of bittersweet. Hilarity in the same sentence as sadness is hard to nail, but I think it is a perfect episode.",

      "text": "Wow. I guess I have skipped over this episode in almost every rewatch, because almost all of it seemed new to me - I'd maybe only seen it once since it originally aired? \n\nOn one hand, it was very cool to re-experience what seemed like a \"new\" episode. On the other hand, I think I have finally gotten an answer to \"What is your least favorite episode?\" I'll take a season of Schmitty's over this. When people crap on season 4, they forget how off the rails the end of season 3 got.  \n  \nThis episode reinforces why I've never been a fan of the second half of season 3's Leader Chang plot. It's incredibly plot-driven, existing to set the whole endgame of season 3 in motion. (That said, the episodes toward the end of 3 that aren't part of this arc I find to be really good.)   \n  \nSo, since I have a few more of these episodes to go in this arc - for those of you who like this subplot - what do you like about it? I'm not asking in order to argue with you - I'm looking for points of view that will help me attempt to appreciate it better! Maybe I'm missing something.",

I was talking to a friend today about jokes that are sometimes missed in shows because they're so niche, *or* jokes that are sort of designed for only certain people or communities to get. Then I remembered there's kind of a fun one (at least for me, a former christian) in Messianic Myths and Ancient Peoples (aka the one with Abed Jesus.) \n\nIt's in the scene where Shirley is recording Troy and Britta doing the little biblical rap she wrote. Troy says something to the effect of \"check out these beatitudes\" and then starts rapping the sermon on the mount (blessed are the meek for they shall inherit etc etc.) The joke is that those lines from the Bible are collectively called The Beatitudes (pronounced be-attitudes), so it seems like it's something ridiculous and cheesy that Shirely made up to be cool and funky for a child audience when actually it's biblically accurate and Troy just doesn't know how to pronounce it correctly. \n\nAnyway... the point of the post is, are there are any other niche or missed jokes that you can think of in Community? I'd love to hear 'em!",

      "text": "Hello all.\n\nEvery single time we get a post on either of those topics, it ends up being a minefield that takes out countless people. I've counted at least a dozen temporary or permanent sitewide bans in relation to comments made regarding the UHC CEO assassination.  \n\nThe moratorium has worked for the Israel/Palestine conflict, so we are putting one in place for the UHC assassination as well. As before, this isn't because  we want to limit conversation, but because it's impossible to keep up with the flood of rulebreaking commentary.  There are plenty of other places on reddit you can play with fire, this just won't be one of them.\n\nIn addition, I have updated some of the automated filters for spammy sites and subreddits and an automated enforcement of the submission statement rule.  If something appears broken, reach out via modmail.\n\nThanks everyone.",
