      "text": "I think one of the most unexpected things about traveling is how certain habits from other countries quietly follow you home. For me for example after spending a few weeks in Spain I started building in small pauses throughout my day like actual breaks where I step away from all the work. It wasn’t really about copying siestas exactly but more about embracing that slower and intentional rhythm of life and that has stuck with me ever since!! I'm planning to go there again on September since I've set aside some money from grizzly's quest. I’d love to hear from others like have you brought home any mindset, habit or lifestyle tweak from a place you visited or lived in?",

I’m walking in the streets of Lisbon on a Tuesday night and it’s all filled with street artists, people, families eating, everyone walking around, shopping, and living a vibrant lifestyle. I’m very jealous of it. It’s so people oriented, chill, relaxing, and easy going. I get that a lot of people are in town for holiday but it just feels like the focus is on happiness and fun. \n\nIn America, it feels like priority is wealth and work which is fine. But I think that results in isolation and loneliness. Europe, you got people drinking in streets, enjoying their time. I don’t think there’s any city that has that type of feeling where streets are filled to the T, eating outside, and having that vibrant lifestyle other than maybeeee NYC. What are your guys thoughts. Was I just in vacation mode and seeing the bunnies and rainbows of Europe? Is living there not as great? Sometimes it just feels like in America it’s not that fun as Europe culture and more isolating. Now I blame this on how the city is built as well as Europe has everything close and dense, unlike America.",

Clothes, bags, and essentials suggestions would be a great help, and how should I expect Barcelona to be Different from NYC? I also speak Latin American Spanish, so how should I expect the language to be different and also the culture, and finally what things should I go look for and try out like food spots or other fun places to go and explore or even some Formula 1 or racing related stuff as I am a big fan of the sport.",

      "text": "EDIT: Thank you all sooo much for all the responses, especially the dissenting opinions that added some texture. I started trying to respond to everyone and that’s a little out of reach now, but it’s encouraging when you have a question and the internet shows up for you.\n\nAnd yes, “Mid-life” was definitely not the right word. Should have just said “Early 30s”.\n\nORIGINAL POST:\n\nMy wife(30F) and I(33M) are debating putting our life on hold to spend a year abroad, but only want to do it if we think it could fundamentally change us for the better. Otherwise we’ll work, retire, and then travel.\n\nQUESTION: Has anyone else ever left behind a perfectly good (if not great) lifestyle to travel for a long period? Was it worth the opportunity cost? Did long-term travel cause any greater degree of growth, self-reflection, or paradigm shift that you couldn’t get from using a couple weeks of PTO every year? Did you return to an equal quality of life, better, or worse? \n\nDETAILS IF YOU WANT THEM: I am one of those guys that found a job that I was good at and not many others wanted to do. So, I ate shit for a few years and have in turn been given big opportunities to climb the ladder and make a pile of money. My wife and I recently realized that we are now in a position to take an entire year off and travel the world if we wanted. We’ve saved up a huge safety net, have been able to rent out our home and move into an inexpensive apartment, and believe that we would be able to come back and find work (though this could potentially stall our careers). We are very happy with our present quality of life. We  live in a beautiful town near the beach and work life has recently gotten way better.\n\n**Please don’t judge my lack of post history. I have lurked on Reddit for like five years without creating an account until today.",

      "text": "I’m a Tanzanian, born and raised. I’ve know about our national parks like Serengeti, Ngorongoro, Tarangire.  I’ve also visited Kruger National Park in South Africa, which was an amazing experience in its own. So here’s my very biased and honest take\n\n\nKruger is impressive. The infrastructure is topnotch, the roads are well maintained, the lodges and camps are next level and South Africa’s economy and lifestyle is adaptable if you coming in developed country. It’s tourist friendly, curated, and predictable in the best way for people wanting a smooth safari experience.\n\nBut nothing beats the raw wilderness of the Serengeti. The Serengeti is not as polished...it’s chaotic, expensive, unpredictable, and sometimes rough especially in rainy season. But that’s exactly why I love it. It’s the kind of place where you can go hours without seeing another car, where a sudden downpour can change your entire day, where you feel like you’re inside a David Attenborough documentary.\n\nThe fees, the logistics, the flights and accomodations is expensive . But if you ask me? Every cent is worth it for the wild factor alone. You see nature in its purest form. Nothing feels staged.\n\nKruger is a great starter safari.Serengeti is the epitome of Safari. Brutal, unpredictable, and unforgettable.\n\n I’m biased. But if you’re torn between the two, I’d say... do both. But come to East Africa for the real, messy Africa that doesn’t apologize for its wildness.\n\nCurious to hear if others have felt the same? Especially folks who’ve done both safaris.",

Furthermore, most of the information is available online—for free!\n\nI've seen these books across many profiles and I'm wondering if people are actually buying these books? Like is it that easy that once you have a following you can just make an expensive e-book and people will buy it because they like you as a content creator?",

      "text": "Hey y'all! Finally pulling the trigger on a Vegas trip this July and I'm pretty excited. Been wanting to do this for years but never had the budget lined up right. Got a nice bonus at work (shoutout to my workplace for a half year bonus) plus my tax return was bigger than expected so I figured now's the time.  \nFlying out of dfw and planning to stay 5 nights probably mid week to keep costs reasonable. I'm not a huge gambler but definitely want to try my hand at some real life blackjack and maybe poker cuz I play on rollingriches, but I can't wait to do them in real life. More interested in the shows, food, and just experiencing the whole Vegas lifestyle.  \nFew questions for anyone who's been:\n\n\\- What's the deal with the strip vs downtown? Worth checking out both or should I just stick to one area?  \n\\- Any restaurants that I must try? I keep hearing about buffets but not sure if they're actually worth it or just tourist traps.  \n\\- For shows, I'm thinking about seeing a Cirque du Soleil show, anyone have recommendations on which one? Or are there better entertainment options I should consider?  \n\\- Transportation wise, is it easy to walk the strip or should I budget for Ubers/taxis between hotels?\n\nAny other general advice for a first timer? Things to avoid, hidden gems whatever. I'm pretty laid back and just want to have a good time without making any major mistakes. Thanks in advance!",

We booked a week în Tirana, first week so we can be close to the Airport, then 1 week to Vlore, 1 to Berat and the last one again în Tirana. We obviously thought that this would be a good idea due to the cheap lifestyle there and at that time we also thought it is safe for us. În the meantime we heard a lot of people saying around us that it would be dangerous and I wanted to ask if you can share your thouths about those places, maybe you encounter a similar situation and you can share with us some tips on how to avoid dangerous places or so.\nPlease suggest any local places to eat and buy groceries if you know some tips about this too.\nThanksss💗",

      "title": "Peru daytrip",
      "text": "[TLDR] Can a 1-2 trip to Peru including Machu Picchu work? I could fly there from NYC in the morning or the night before, go to Machu Picchu for most of the day, then fly back the evening or morning after. Our current plan is to take the train there and do hikes 1B+2A. My travel partner might stay longer. Any issues with this? To avoid extreme UV we would be going in early October, when it should still be the dry season.\n\nOptional context:\n\n1-2 days is what would work if I brought my own food and water. I don't want to eat or drink anything in Peru, because H Pylori has been found in the water there which is suspected to contribute to the very high prevalence of H Pylori infection and gastric cancer in the country. Boiling water doesn't necessarily kill it; studies suggest it would have to be 170°C of dry heat for 1 hour or 121°C of moist heat for 15 minutes. There's no guarantee the food we eat there will be cooked in this fashion. People have gotten sick from fine dining food. Unboiled water or less-than-fully cooked food can easily make its way in (e.g. redditors have warned about getting ice in drinks, something most people would overlook). Not to mention I'd have to be mindful even when showering or washing my hands to not accidentally ingest it. Yes, I've accidentally drank small amounts of shower water before. Easy to do.\n\nI previously had H pylori damaging my stomach for years, causing multiple ulcers and gastritis, iron deficiency anemia enough to make it hard to stand sometimes, and maybe wrecked my body further with the antibiotics, PPIs and high-dose iron I used for treatment. Since then I've adapted a healthier lifestyle to make up for the inflammation it had caused for years. So I don't need to re-expose myself unnecessarily.\n\nAnd that's just H Pylori, which can takes months to years to show symptoms. Many people have gotten acutely sick from other things in the water and food there, as evidenced by countless posts/comments on reddit alone; e.g.:\n\n(comments at)\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/solotravel/comments/co63tl/heading_to_south_america_peru_for_the_first_time/\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1fawqwr/anyone_who_went_to_southamerica_and_was/\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/TravelHacks/s/QJdkAGXT0X\n\n(etc)\n\nIt's the same reason I don't plan to visit India and most/all developing countries and/or countries with notoriously bad water. I never had a desire to visit Peru even before I knew of its water status and the only real reasons I'd be going are because my travel partner wants me to, and to check \"visited South America\" off my list (which was never a high-priority item). She already bought tickets for the hike. I told her she can ask someone else but she's insisting. So in case a backup traveler doesn't show up.",

I have a Mexican passport and a Green card (which both don't expire for the next 10 or so years) and will be travelling to Japan in a week. \n\nFor my flight, I have a short layover in Montreal on the way there and on the way back, I have one in Ontario. My mom (who lives in Mexico) went to Canada not too long ago and needed to get an ETA since she doesn't have a green card. \n\nLast time I travelled to Japan, I remember Japan Airlines asked me to get an ETA the day I left Tokyo, but I don't remember getting one to get there in the first place. \n\nI guess the TL;DR part is: If I have a mexican passport and an american green card, and I'm travelling from US -> Canada  -> Tokyo -> Canada -> US.... Do i need any kind of paperwork done before I head out. \n\nThank you! \n\nPS. Would appreciate any tips/local restaurants/attractions and things to do in Tokyo for about 2 weeks-time.

      "text": "Hey!\n\nBack in 2022 I visited Lisbon for the first time and fell in love with the city. From the moment I left I knew I want to come back. In April I'm gonna stsrt taking portugese classes as well.\nNow I want to visit Lisbon again for 2-3 weeks and working remote from there. It was always my dream to work abroad and I want to test it out for a short amount to test out if it is a lifestyle for me.\nI already searched for places to stay but I was a bit shocked about the prices. For context, I am still in university and want to visit during the break between two semesters. So, money is tight.\n\nI preferably live somewhere where I can cook for myself to save money. I think I have max 500€ as  budget. I don't need to live in the city itself, I am totally fine to travel ~60-70mins to get into the city by public transport. But the prices for the public transport shouldn't cost a fortune (like it would be the same price to live in the city itself).\n\nMaybe you have some tips for cheap places to stay, no matter if a whole flat for yourself, a hotel, a room. I just don't feel comfortable in a shared bedroom. Right now I feel a bit delusional finding something for that tight budget and I hope you have some positive news for me. :)",

      "text": "Man i am so spontanius lol. I just had a thought about what i should do and it was to travel the world for a year! A little bit me, every since i graduated high school all i  could think of was travelling the world.\n\n Unfortunetly life had different plans for me and i was never able too do it. Now after investing in Bitcoin i finally have the funds to do it. Here the thing though i ve been on disability for a large portion of my life because of a serious illness so i ve never really had any money but like i said i invested in Bitcoin a few years ago.\n\n But now my illness has improved so much that i could return to work or i do what i really want to do and travel. So i am kind of at a crossroads right now.\n\n The catch is Bitcoin is set to maybe go on a huge bull run so i am wondering if i should wait a year to see how that pans out. But like with any investment it could go to zero for all we know. I am thinking F- it i am already 42 so i might as well go for it or wait at least another year in this mundane city, boring lifestyle kind of living.\n\nLiving on disability for many years and because of my \"unique\" illness was like a financial and mental prison in itself. I feel like treating myself for once and to live a little and experience a bit of life too.\n\nTo me money isnt everything thats my attitude, i never really had it so i know how to live without it so if i was to lose it all it wouldnt change me one bit. Ultimately its up to me and my decision but what do you think guys? I could put 30k canadian towards my dream trip of travelling Europe and Australia for a year. \n\nAlso i have no responsibilities or obligation in my current situation. I could drop my place like that and hit the road. Or i could return to work and wait to see how bitcoin plays out for a bit. I am single so no spouse or kids to deal with either. \n\nHmm the tempation is gnawing at me to go for it lol.",

      "text": "Hello! I (24 F) am traveling with my boyfriend (23 M) from Vancouver, and it's our first time traveling to Portugal. I have done some research for our trip and need some help in planning it.\n\n**Some Key Things About Our Trip & Preferences:**\n\n* **Travel Month:** August\n* **Duration:** 12 \\~ 15 days\n* **Preferences:** Historical sites, beaches, good food. We want to avoid tourist traps and experience the local lifestyle.\n\nBelow is the list of cities I would love to visit based on reading through other Reddit posts and articles:\n\n1. **Lisbon:** The capital of Portugal.\n2. **Sintra and Cascais:** Close to Lisbon and can be visited on a day trip by train.\n   * **Sintra:** A UNESCO Heritage site. People recommend doing a day trip from Lisbon (1.5 hours by train or 30 minutes by car).\n   * **Cascais:** Known for its beaches; many royal families stay here. It can be visited on a day trip or for a 1-night, 2-day trip from Lisbon (2 hours by train or 30 minutes by car).\n3. **Porto:** The second-largest city after Lisbon; the birthplace of Port wine, its historic Ribeira district (a UNESCO World Heritage site), and its iconic Dom Luís I bridge. I\n   * f traveling from Lisbon to Porto, take the train.\n4. **Madeira:** Known for Madeira wine, flora, and fauna, with its prehistoric laurel forest, classified as a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Known for beaches and good hikes. Wine tour also well known. \n   * 1 hour 50 minutes flight from Lisbon. \n5. **Lagos:** A town in southern Portugal's Algarve region. It’s known for its walled old town, cliffs, and Atlantic beaches, as well as hikes.\n6. **Sagres:** Famous for its stunning beaches, breathtaking views, and relaxed atmosphere.\n7. **Évora:** The capital of Portugal's south-central Alentejo region. Its historic center features the ancient Roman Temple of Évora (also called the Temple of Diana).\n\nI know these are a lot of cities, and realistically, we can visit 4 to 5 cities during this trip. I brainstormed the order into the following two options. Any insights and recommendations on how to plan this trip would be greatly appreciated (e.g., best mode of transportation, days in each city, etc).\n\n**Option 1:**\n\n* 3 days in Lisbon\n* 3 days in Porto\n* 3 days in Lagos\n* 2 days in Sintra\n* 4 days in Madeira\n\n**Option 2:**\n\n* 4 days in Lisbon\n* 3 days in Lagos (with a day trip or 1 day in Sagres)\n* 2 days in Porto\n* 2 days in Sintra\n* 2 days in Madeira\n\nThank you in advance!",

We plan to stay in Manila 3 days, then around Puerto Princessa for 6-7 days (incl wedding)\n\nNow one idea was to fly back to Koh Chang in Thailand to spend another 7-10 days there. \n\nOr, staying on Palawan or flying to Boracay for 7-10 days. Now I am used to backpacking and I don't mind long travel distances and I've been to Thailand a lot and I love it there. \nMy girlfriend on the other hand hasn't been to Asia and is not used to the let's call it \"easier\" lifestyle of traveling around Asia. She'd rather stay in one place than traveling a lot around. \n\nNow I haven't read too many amazing things about palawan or PH islands as it's lot of resorts (Boracay) and also long travel distances otherwise you'd stuck with same activities. \n\nCan you help me make a decision? Is it worth to stay in PH and give it a chance (knowing that food might not be as amazing as in Thailand, traveling distances are further and it's mainly resorts) or could it make sense to fly back into Bangkok (she also would love to see Bangkok, and I love Bangkok anyway, used to to an internship there) and then continue to Koh Chang by bus (yeah the 6h trip scares her again, she's not super easy I know) and then enjoy Koh Chang? (Yes there's also a flight to trat but In the end you won't save much time) \n\nAlso my GF wants to go to Phuket and Ko PhiPhi. I have been there 10 years ago and found it super touristic already and I heard this year is even more crowded. Can you help me convince here that is a bad idea to go there compared to Koh Chang ?",

It's about 9 hours it seems, which I don't mind, but I am a little hesitant as I need to make the train early from Bled that morning in order to not miss the direct train in Ljubljana. I was thinking of going from Salzburg to Bled, but it is a 7-8 hour train ride as opposed to the 4 hour FlixBus bus ride to Ljubljana (there is a FlixBus direct to Bled, but it arrives at 10pm). \n\nFor the record, I have explored most of Western Europe already and really want to delve into some of Central Europe and get some \"sun\" towards the end of my trip. I'm not looking so much for advice on things to do, but whether or not this route makes any sense? Should I cut anything out or restructure my itinerary in any way?",

I would have liked to do a working holiday in some warmer and culturally rich countries of Europe (Portugal, Greece, maybe Southern France, Italy,) but I believe that the ability to find work on a working holiday in these places would be much more difficult. I have also though about Japan but it seems there are a lot of restrictions on where you can work. \n\n  \nI wanted to ask for advice from anyone who has done a working holiday visa in either places, to see which one would be the least stressful and easiest to find accomodations and a job. My sense is that Australia would be the best option, however I am a bit off put by how isolated it is. I would really like to do a working holiday in Glasgow or Edinburugh since it has proxmity of course to other European countries, but I am worried it would be difficult to find year long work here in a entry level position. I have a B.A degree and experience in customer service, hospitality and some dishwasher/light kitchen prep work experience.\n\nAny advice on what would be the best for my situation is appreciated, just really looking to explore outside of my hometown and live a different lifestyle for a bit!\n\n  \nThank you.",

      "text": "Hey all.\n\nI am strongly considering spending around 2/3 months in South America, from around Mid-February till early-mid May.\n\nRight now I am gradually getting more and more into 'wellness' type stuff - meditation, yoga, somatic work, martial arts, fitness, and all that.\n\nWould be really keen to maintain this lifestyle and its benefits when travelling, so I'm curious what countries in South America are best for this? I'm looking for stuff like yoga and mindfulness centres and retreats, martial arts, or anything slightly different from this.\n\nI put Brazil/Colombia/Peru in the title as these are the Countries I plan to visit, so any insights on these specific locations would be great.\n\nSouth-East Asia is probably the best place for wellness activities without a language barrier, but I have already done 3 trips to SE Asia in the past.\n\nLooking for any tips or personal insight/experience, and also curious about English speaking options (since I don't speak Spanish).",

      "title": "Singapore Itinerary: 2-3 Days - Includes Apps + Food Centers",
      "text": "I visited Singapore from Oct 29th to 31st and would love to share my itinerary for anyone planning a short trip. Here’s what I did, along with some helpful tips and app recommendations.\n\n**Day 1:**\n\nMorning: Arrived early, took a cab via Grab to Holiday Inn Little India, and got some rest.  \n  \n11:30 AM - Explored China Town and had lunch at the Hong Lim Complex.  \n  \n12:30 PM - Strolled around Fort Canning Park.  \n  \n2:00 PM - Shopped for essentials at Daiso Japan in Bugis Junction.  \n  \n4:00 PM - Walked around the vibrant Kampong Glam neighborhood.  \n  \n•Evening Break at Hotel  \n  \n6:15 PM - Enjoyed a stunning view from the SkyPark Observation Deck.  \n  \n7:45 PM - Strolled through The Shoppes at Marina Bay Sands to watch the Spectra light & water show (free, lasts about 15 minutes).  \n  \n9:00 PM - Dinner at Newton Food Centre (a must-try!).\n\n**Day 2:**\n\nDaytime:Attended an event until 5:30 PM.  \n  \n8:15 PM - Picked up Thai sauces, condiments, and Japanese stock powders at Sheng Siong Supermarket.  \n  \n10:45 PM - Dinner at Newton Food Centre. (had to go back for more of that amazing food!)\n\n**Day 3:**\n\n8:15 AM - Breakfast at Whampoa Food Centre.  \n  \n9:30 AM - Rented a cycle and rode around Singapore Boulevard Avenue, Merlion, Helix Bridge, and ArtScience Museum.  \n  \nReturn to Hotel: Sorted out some billing issues at Sheng Siong.  \n  \n1:45 PM - Lunch at Newton Food Centre.  \n  \n3:00 PM - Explored Gardens by the Bay and cycled around the area.  \n  \nAfternoon: Grabbed a taxi back to the airport.  \n  \n5:00 PM - Explored Jewel Changi Airport and picked up a Pokémon plushie.\n\n**Apps I Used:**\n\n1. **Grab** \\- Reliable for taxis. The app is user-friendly, and I could book rides anytime without pre-booking.\n2. **Singapore Metro** \\- Essential for navigating metro rides and finding the right routes. I used the 3-day tourist pass (SGD 29, available for cash only at MRT ticket offices), allowing unlimited bus and train rides—no need to keep loading a card.\n3. **HelloRide** \\- Great for cycling. The *HelloPass* (SGD 3.99) offers 5 rides, each with the first 60 minutes free. Just scan the QR code on a parked bike to start, and end your ride by scanning at a parking spot.\n\n**Tips & Suggestions:**\n\n1. **Cash is Handy:** Many hawker stalls and small food centers don’t accept cards, so keep cash for the 3-day tourist pass and dining at hawker centers.\n2. **Daiso Japan at Bugis:** Perfect for affordable shopping! Most items range from SGD 1.50 to 6.\n3. **Food Recommendations:** Locals highly recommended Newton Food Centre, and I wasn’t disappointed. Satay, however, felt a bit overpriced at SGD 10. I found other unique and filling dishes for under SGD 10.\n4. **Sheng Siong Supermarket:** A student in Singapore suggested it over 7-Eleven for affordable international food items, especially for Korean, Thai, and Japanese staples. Just a tip—double-check your bill for accuracy.\n5. **SkyPark Observation Deck:** I signed up for a free Sands Lifestyle membership, which gave a discount on the deck ticket. I also learned you might access it free by showing both a passport and Sands Lifestyle membership, so it’s worth a try.\n6. **Duty-Free Shopping:** Planning to buy liquor? Pre-order from iShopChangi (Changi Airport’s website) at least 24 hours before your flight. First-time purchases get SGD 20 off, saving you both money and time.\n7. **Keep yourself hydrated:** It can get hot in Singapore and I carried a water bottle with me. I also had orange juice twice from the IJooz kiosk for SGD 2 which was great. \n\n**Food Items I loved:**\n\n* Minced Meat Pork Noodles with Fish Balls\n* Noodles with Fried Wanton\n* Braised Duck Kway Teow",

      "text": "The self-proclaimed open-minded, free-spirit world travelers that like to dive into different cultures should start realizing that these places don't exist for them to explore but first of all are homes to actual people like you and me. And these people are not landmarks to just take pictures randomly of and post them on instagram like they are a famous building or something. If you get PROPER consent from these people, and maybe even give them contact information to revoke their consent, fine. But I doubt most travelers do when they show these portraits of people, and even worse, KIDS on their instagram or post them on reddit. People deserve privacy, otherwise cases like Sharbat Galat (the afghan girl) or what her name was begin, where this woman openly says she never wanted that picture to be taken and she wishes it never had.\nTravelers that post people just like that, especially kids, like landmarks, just show that they are not willing to actually get to know the culture and the people and respect them, because if they did, they would not put their personal gain of getting likes over their privacy! \n\nTDLR: It shows you are not as respecting and interested in other cultures as you say, if you put likes over other peoples privacy and consider them as landmarks that you can just freely post as portraits on the internet. Especially kids, but everyones privacy needs to be protected. \n\nEDIT: I am talking about photos that specifically wanted to capture people, basically portraits, like 3 laughing children or one working man doing his job. Not about a photo of for example a landscape with people happening to be in it.",

      "text": "I come from the USA where when it gets to 80 degrees, we turn the AC on 24/7. Most houses here are set way below 80. While traveling, in hostels especially when we have a shared remote, im astonished at what people set it to. I was dying of heat in the bed that’s farthest from the AC and on a top bunk. Asked my hostel roommates if i could turn it down 1 degree, and when i went to see what it was set to i saw it was 85 degrees Fahrenheit which is just INSANE to me. Like unfathomable that someone would choose that in hot and humid weather. And everyone is just collectively okay with it and not sweating to death like i am. I also feel like it ruins my hair as well, I only have good hair days when I’m in hotels or bungalows and choose the temperature. \n\nAnyway, don’t mean to complain. I was just shocked when I saw it, and surprised when i looked it up and saw that China, USA, and Japan are really the only countries that use it like we do. I still only turned it down 1 degree even though i was tempted to turn it down at least 4 degrees. \n\nBut genuinely, how do the European girlies do it? My hair never looks nice and I always wake up feeling like i was having a fever all night. Is it just something you have to get used to?",

It doesn't matter if we are checking bags or have carry on's, my wife has always insisted we arrive 2 hours early for domestic flights.  We even have TSA Precheck and sale through TSA. I have always compromised knowing that it really helps her anxiety because she can relax once we are at our gate.  She knows we will not miss our plane. \n\nHowever, I dread the more than an hour to wait to board the plane.  It's crowded because there are less than half the seats to handle everyone.  And the food and drinks in the terminals are overpriced. \n\nI posted on a different thread how we used an airport lounge for the first time on Thursday. It was a total game changer! I didn't mind getting there a full two hours early because the lounge was quiet, not too crowded and offered good food and drinks for free.  We also had a nice view of the tarmac.  (I recognize that we were lucky because our credit card allowed us to make a reservation so there was not a wait.)\n\nI was roasted on the other thread by joking it may have saved our marriage.

You can tell from my face that I’m large, but you may not understand how large I am without physically meeting me. \n\nI mentioned to him a few weeks ago that I was anticipating needing a second seat or a larger (first class) seat that I would be fully comfortable paying for myself. He said that he just tries to get an aisle seat. “It’ll be uncomfortable but that’s flying. They don’t let me fly first class so that’s not happening”\n\nWhat do I do?

Rio a little rough at times but certain areas and street smarts make up for it. Sao Paolo felt a lot safer.\n\n- Switzerland: I went skiing in Samnaun recently and I’m obsessed. So safe, so much snow, and no worries whatsoever. If I had a young family I’d definitely take them on a winter trip to one of these little ski towns.\n\n- Scottish Highlands: absolutely breathtaking views everywhere. Glencoe and Skye big favourites. People are incredible as well.\n\n- South Africa (Cape Town especially): all the downsides of Brazil but on steroids. Rampant poverty, massive street smarts needed… but the climate is incredible. Places like Camp’s Bay and the V&A are paradise. And your money travels so far.",

She venmoed me half for the hotel and event tickets. \n\nNow she is asking for the money back for her half of the trip, due to circumstances \"out of her control.\" I'm confused because obviously I booked this trip with the agreement that we are both going and splitting the costs of the hotel room.\n\nDo I owe her her money back? I literally can't afford the room on my own, so then would be out for the money from the hotel, flights, and tickets...\n\nEdit to add: \n\nShe wants back $847+$561 for the event tickets and hotel, and if I have to cancel due to lack of hotel, I'm also out an additional $778 for my flights. \n\nAnd I've asked my friends and it's too late to get the $ together and time off work for most of them, and I wouldn't be comfortable sharing a room with someone I don't know.

      "text": "**You want to go to South East Asia but want a place that's not too chaotic and that feels easy to navigate ?** Taiwan has the climate of South East Asia with an orderliness that would remind you more of Japan, and is super kid friendly even with lots of attention to kids in all the touristic attractions and public areas.\n\n**You like to have access to both beautiful nature and big cities ?** Taiwan has the gorges, forests, national parks, hills covered in tea plants, but also modern neighbourhoods like Ximending, towers like Taipei 101, art center like in Kaohsiung, hotels on tops of malls like in Taichung.\n\n**You like cloudy mountain hikes ?** Taiwan has the whole Alishan region.\n\n**You like being by the sea ?** Taiwan is an island with smaller islands and while going to the beach is not the number 1 activity, you can definitely have a good swim in some cities or in places like Orchid Island.\n\n**You like cheap food but prefer if the hygiene is also good ?** Taiwan has an amazing foodie culture for all budgets, with lots of street food \"night markets\" but extremely low risk for food poisoning due to excellent hygiene and fresh produce. And they have all the convenience stores.\n\n**You want a place that's not super touristy but where locals still speak enough English that you can get by ?** Taiwan has many touristic attractions but very few draw big crowds (the Japanese and Koreans go to Jiufen in mass because of the Ghibli vibes but that's it), yet almost everyone I met spoke at least a few words of English, the younger generation generally spoke decently and many people are happy to chat with you using Google translate. I speak Mandarin Chinese which did help, but my mom who speaks no Chinese could still get by.\n\n**You like to drive and be free ?** It's super easy to rent a scooter and generally safe to drive around if you can drive in the occasional rain.\n\n**You prefer to use public transportation?** Taiwan has an excellent and modern network of metros, buses and trains, that all have AC and usually WiFi, for a very cheap price (3-5€ for trains between cities) and you can use the same transportation card all over the country for everything except trains (plus you can use it to pay in convenience stores).\n\n**You want to feel safe as a solo traveler or as a woman, you don't want to deal with potential scams ?** Taiwan is extremely safe at day and night and outside of barely overcharging you for a trinket, you never have to be scared of anyone trying to just take your money.\n\n**You want to see unique temples with their own traditions ?** Just the city of Tainan has over 12,000 temples, and the island of Taiwan overall embraces syncretism with a mix of Buddhism, Taoism and local folk religion, with the worship of the sea goddess Mazu especially but also of many martial gods. Religious diversity is so normal that you will find Muslim prayer rooms in most train stations, big museums, and big tourists attractions.\n\n**You're really sensitive to heat + humidity and are scared of any earthquake?** Okay maybe Taiwan isn't for you haha\n\nAnyway, just saying, our trip to Taiwan was phenomenal ! We spend a good 2 weeks and it was great, my first time was 3 weeks, and I think I'd recommend spending 10 days to a 4 weeks if you want to explore the whole country and 5 days if you're focusing on the capital Taipei with day trips from there.",

Seems every culture has their own unique dance! \n\nIn my journeys I’ve learned to do some flamenco from Spaniards, Cailidh from Scotland, a bit of Schuhplatter from Germans. I’m in the Barranquilla carnival right now and yesterday a bunch of kids in the street taught me some Champeta. \n\nI’m not particularly good at any of these dances and I’m sure I look kind of silly. But I’ve found no better way to meet and show my appreciation for locals and their cultures than to throw myself into learning about their dance styles. Locals *love* when you can do some of their moves and I end up getting invited to all sorts of cool cultural events as a result.\n\nAlso, dances usually have cool history behind them that can teach you a lot about a culture. \n\n\nIt’s sooo hard to get over the awkwardness of dancing, and I still feel very self conscious. But for those of you reading this who just say “I can’t dance” I really encourage you to throw yourself at it when traveling. I’ll spend the rest of my life awkwardly shaking what I got, wherever I go.",

      "text": "We're two couples on a six-day trip, and everything's going smoothly - no bad vibes. But I'd love some input from people who typically don't eat out while traveling.\n\nWhen planning this trip, our friends mentioned they'd be fine with \"going to a restaurant\" (in the native language it could be understood both ways). I took that to mean eating out once a day so we don't miss out on sight-seeing, but I misinterpreted - they actually meant one to two restaurant meals for the entire trip 😅\n\nThere aren't any dietary restrictions or financial concerns here (I know I don't get a say how other people spend their money, but they are not stingy in general). They just seem happy with carb-heavy food and supermarket meals. I'm no food snob, but I tend to prefer healthier choices and my cooking is mostly plain, but nutritionally dense. So since I cook at home and this a holiday, I really do not want to even prepare a sandwich in the morning. On top of that, to me, traveling is partly about discovering a city's culinary scene, whether that's a rundown local diner, a cool cafe or an upscale restaurant.\n\nOur routine so far has been for my partner and me to grab a specialty coffee and breakfast, meet them for sightseeing, then head off for a lunch by ourselves and then we come back and after some time go take a walk and have a dinner, The other couple isn't upset or passive-aggressive about this, but I do feel a little bad going off without them.\n\nSo, for those who don't eat out much while traveling, how do you usually handle meals on trips? Do you want to stick with the routine from hom? And if you've traveled with friends who enjoy eating out, how did you balance things so that everyone could enjoy their preferred style of travel?",

      "text": "If you go to Rome or the main Italian cities, pay close attention to these things:\n\n- Never accept bracelets or necklaces from those who tell you that they are gifts, they are never gifts and will probably ask you for money back. Sometimes they throw you the bracelet so that you instinctively take it and then, as above, they try to convince you to take something out to send them away. The only advice in these cases is to completely ignore these people and not stop to talk to them at all, even at the risk of being considered rude.\n\n- In Florence, some guys put fake paintings on the ground in the middle of the crowd, where one can easily step on them and then ask for money for compensation, they are not usually aggressive, but only slightly insistent.\nEven in that case, it is better to completely ignore the people and go away pretending not to hear them.\n\n- In Naples, as stated in the initial point, there are people dressed as Pulcinella or Neapolitan horn sellers, the former offer you a photo with them and then expect to be paid, a bit like those who are dressed as Gladiators at the Colosseum. For the latter, sellers of bracelets, horns, handkerchiefs or various knick-knacks, the approach is sometimes simply like \"Hey guys, can I ask you a favor?\" Never answer, ignore them and carry on, their goal is only to make you buy something and extort money.\n\n- Finally, always be careful around tourist sites of those who offer to give you directions to take a photo or give you suggestions on how to do it, it is never free and always paid.\n\nFor taxis: always make sure the taximeter is on, never negotiate the price first and find out about the official rates on the websites of the municipal administrations of the cities where you are, so you can point out to taxi drivers, in the event that they propose a certain price, that theirs is too high. If you intend to pay by card, always point this out to the taxi driver first, since some use the excuse of having a broken POS to evade taxes.\nFurthermore, official taxis throughout Italy are white, the others are abusive and illegal.\n\nTo eat, avoid restaurants or bars in the most central tourist streets, they are usually only crowded with tourists, especially those with waiters outside inviting you to come in, you eat badly and spend a lot.\nTry to go to eat outside the tourist areas, where Italians usually go.\nIf you really have to go to a tourist area, even for a coffee, always ask for the menu first, at least you know how much you will spend.\n\nTo visit operas, parks, museums and monuments, always book on the official websites of the opera or museum and never buy fake tickets or tours there from those who want to extort money from you to offer you a tour at the last minute by skipping the line, they are ripping you off on the price by probably making you pay double. \n\nFor now this is all that comes to mind, for any other questions or doubts I remain at your disposal",

      "text": "If you were able to travel in your 20s, that’s amazing! But I feel like there’s this huge expectation that you have to travel in your 20s or you’ve missed your chance. The way people talk about it online makes it seem like if you don’t see the world before 30, you’ll never experience it the “right way.”\n\nI’m 28, and I dream of traveling, but I couldn’t do much of it earlier. Most of my 20s were spent working, and I honestly wasted a lot of money. I won’t go into details, but certain things in my past left me feeling stuck and frozen for years. Only recently, I’ve started feeling better and realized that the one thing I truly want to do is explore the world.\n\nI’m from Poland, and I’ve traveled to a few European countries and the U.S., but never extensively and never alone. Just when I finally felt ready, I started looking through Reddit for advice… and instead, I found so many discouraging posts:\n\t•\t“Traveling is the best when you’re in your 20s.”\n\t•\t“You should do all your big trips before 30.”\n\t•\t“It’s just not the same after 30.”\n\nI get that traveling at different life stages might feel different, but why is there this idea that if you start later, it’s somehow less meaningful? Reading those posts made me feel like I already missed my chance, when in reality, I finally feel like I’m just getting started.\n\nI already regret wasting my 20s, and I also have health concerns that make me scared of the future and whether I’ll have enough time to see the places I dream of. But I don’t want to let fear stop me. I just wish there was more encouragement for those of us starting a bit later.\n\nSo, I’d love to hear from people who:\n💬 Started traveling later (late 20s, 30s, 40s) and still had amazing experiences\n💬 Felt like they “missed their chance” but then proved themselves wrong\n\nIf you’ve been in a similar situation, what helped you move forward? Would love to hear your thoughts!",

      "text": "When I was younger, I focused on international travel and always crammed as much sightseeing in as I could.  I've been to several countries in Europe and Asia.  I'm around 40 years old, and traveling abroad doesn't excite me as much.  I've seen so many temples in Asia that I'm not really wowed when I see another one.  Experiencing big, bustling cities, taking trains to get around, and eating street food isn't as much fun anymore.  I guess it's because I've done so much of it that it's no longer exciting.  Even air travel itself is an annoyance whereas I enjoyed it when I younger.\n\nNowadays, I mainly take long road trips in the U.S.  Enjoying a nice, leisurely drive for several hours and stopping somewhere to camp or stay in a motel is fine.  I've taken long driving trips from Texas to Oklahoma, Missouri, Arkansas, Illinois, Michigan, Florida, and New Mexico over the past few years and I haven't burned out on that yet.  It's kind of nice to get out in nature, do some hiking, and visit places where there are fewer people, everyone speaks English, and I don't have to deal with airports.\n\nI still travel abroad but not nearly as often.  Also, I'm willing to spend a little bit more for more comfortable accomodations.  I don't simply pick the cheapest place like I did when I was younger.\n\nI also don't feel the need to see everything when I travel, and I'm okay waking up at 8 am and enjoying a leisurely breakfast rather than waking up at 6 am and packing as much into a day as possible like I did when I was younger.\n\nI guess all of that's a part of getting older.  Thoughts?",

I also get the impression that (while still an expensive and difficult place to travel) Angola is much safer than it was a decade ago, though I'd love to hear from anyone who has been recently.\n\nWhat other places are currently trending safer?\n\n(PS: If one starts comparing to the 90s or whatever then there are a ton of examples like the Balkans, Rwanda, etc., but that's not what I'm asking about here – those places have been fine for a while already, and I'm specifically wondering where there's a more recent/current turnaround trend.  Like places that were still very risky destinations within the last 5-10 years, but are now less risky than even just a few years ago.)",

While packing for our last trips, we started talking about the advantages we had when packing, we both are smaller people, so we are able to pack more clothes in a smaller space, we called it a superpower.  It got me thinking, what are your travel superpowers and/or weaknesses?\n\n\nMe:  \n\nSuperpower: \n\n\n-Smaller Frame - Can pack more clothes in smaller space or carry better with the same amount of stuff.  Can fit in most places, like smaller airplane seats, cram in to backseats, etc.  \n\n-Sweat resistance - I rarely sweat, if I do, it's usually just my forehead.  I don't use/carry anti-perspirant.  I don't sweat through my clothes, they stay fresher longer.  I do get heat rash though where I should be sweating.  \n\n-Heat tolerance - I am comfortable with higher heat, I can easily wear pants up to 80 degrees Fahrenheit, rarely wear shorts.  \n\n\nWeaknesses: \n\n-Cold intolerance - I get cold very easily, once it gets in to the sixties, I'd like at least a hoodie.  \n\n-Constant Hunger - I'm always hungry.  At home, I'm near food and snacks, so that's not a big deal, but traveling, I seem to never pack enough snacks.  Thank goodness for my metabolism.  \n\n-Constant bathroom breaks - I guess having to pee all the time is the crux of good hydration, but it's inconvenient.  \n\n\nI'm interested to hear what your powers are!",

And I’m not sure why I forgot to mention that, but I’m Not putting my foot on one ever again. They feel claustrophobic and you’ll often get intimately introduced to various stomach bugs. And when they dock somewhere you often just end up seeing a crowded, very touristy version of a destination. \nAgain, I can understand the appeal people might have with them, and I mean no disrespect against people who enjoy it.",

It reminded me how good it feels to just exist outside of work.\n\nDestinations I’m looking at:\n\nThailand\n\nVietnam\n\nSri Lanka\n\n\nI'd be traveling solo, staying in private accommodations (not hostels), keeping safety in mind, and aiming to keep the trip under $7,000. That would still leave me with a solid cushion when I return.\n\nI’m trying to figure out how to approach this:\n\nShould I just ask my employer for a month off (even unpaid) and hope they say yes?\n\nI could probably get FMLA for burnout, anxiety, and depression, with support from my doctor — but I don’t want to misuse that option.\n\nPart of me even wonders: should I quit, go travel, then try to return later or find a new job?\n\n\nI guess I’m just asking:\nIs this reckless or reasonable?

So I am doing the work plus using my data… and yep, I guess I can be clear about my own boundaries when it comes to this and I guess if it is a dealbreaker, I will let my travel partners know upfront :-)\n\nFurther edit.:  I am Canadian and roaming costs C$16 per day, which is about US$10 per day. For a week vacation that adds up a lot. I suppose once we are the 51st state I’ll have access to some amazing cell phone plans :-) 🤮",

So I was basically going around saying \"thank you, I guess?\" or \"thanks… or not?\" to everyone from restaurant staff to taxi drivers. Thought I was being super polite, but I was just confusing the hell out of everyone with my weird passive-aggressive thank yous.\n\nNobody said anything, of course. They just smiled politely. Probably assumed I was just a lost foreigner trying my best..which… accurate.\n\nAnyway, learn from my mistake, it's just xie xie. No ma needed unless you're actually asking a question.\n\nJapan was much smoother. Arigatou gozaimasu all day.",

Unlike any coffee I’d ever had. Bright, tea-like, and so complex it felt like it changed with every sip. No bitterness, no harshness—just this smooth, almost otherworldly experience. It was the kind of coffee that made me stop and think, oh… so THIS is what coffee can be.\n\nSo now I’m curious—what’s the best coffee you’ve ever had?

I just got to a fancy hotel for a work conference, and as soon as the shuttle bus from the airport arrived, the porters immediately swarmed and began stacking the luggage, then asked us to tag our rooms to them.\n\nTo me, it’s the definition of an anti-service. Rather than just taking my luggage to my room and having immediate access to the contents, I now have to wait for up to a half-hour or more for it to be delivered. Not to mention I grudgingly tip them a buck or two since it’s considered customary. So I end up literally paying for worse service.\n\nPractically every high-end hotel has them - feels like an anachronism. There may be edge-cases where it makes sense (for example, if you have a physical disability or are carrying so much luggage that it’s physically difficult to move it around). But for the average physically able person with only a single roller bag, it’s the dumbest shit. And yes, you can decline, but I’ve had scenarios where they literally start giving attitude or arguing that they MUST deliver it. \n\nAm I out to lunch on the value of this service, or do others feel the same way?",

      "text": "This is something that I have noticed in different comments, posts, and such on social media—that a travel destination has become more americanized/westernized.\n\nNow, touristic cities (places that are catered and/or meant for tourists) are a thing. Like Cancun, as an example.\n\nBut, from what I've seen online, the places that people are describing as americanized/westernized are not really the tourism hot spots, but more so, places where either locals once were, or not a lot of tourism was in that area. As time went on, it gets to where there's less locals in said area, tourism increases, and the destination is basically not the same like before.\n\nNow, there are a bunch of travel destinations I've seen described as being americanized/westernized. Places like Bali, Phuket, beach spots in Mexico (Tulum, Sayulita, Isla Mujeres, etc), the Amalfi Coast (for some reason), parts of Costa Rica, etc. I saw a comment state that The Bahamas feels like an extension of Florida, and people have stated how Aruba now feels more like the US.\n\nAnother thing I've noticed is that when people describe a travel destination as being more americanized/westernized, it seems to also be places where digital nomads, influencers, expats, entrepreneurs from other countries, etc, all thrive in.\n\nOr even different nationalities. Bali, of course, having a lot of Australians. I even saw a comment where someone said they went to one area of Mexico and saw nothing but Canadians and Canadians flags in the there.\n\nAll that being said, what exactly do people mean when they say a travel destination has become americanized/westernized?\n\nIs it:\n\n-Overdevelopment (adding in a lot of hotels and resorts)\n\n-Pricing (going from affordable to expensive)\n\n-People moving in and causing gentrification\n\n-Adding a fast food restaurant or place to the area (ex: someone going for a walk in the mountains and coming across a random Starbucks on the side)\n\n-Having too many crowds\n\nOr maybe even all of the above? Honestly, I'm curious to know the answers to this. And, for any one who has experienced a travel destination that later on became americanized/westernized, what were the signs that made you notice?",

Theyre beautiful and full of charm.\n\nI would add these small towns to the hidden gems if you're into unique places to travel to.",

While putting my stuff through the security scanner, my backpack was placed in one tray, which got slid into the queue, and my work computer and other personal electronics got placed in another tray, which was separated from the first tray by a bunch of other trays of other people’s stuff. To make matters worse, I had to run my poster tube through a different scanner in a different line. When I got through the metal detector, I found my backpack and poster tube easy enough, but couldn’t find any of my electronics. When I went to one of the TSA agents, they couldn’t find it anywhere so they checked security footage and saw someone snag my stuff and get moving. By the time they had figured out where they went, the man had apparently boarded his plane and the gate had closed. I’ve filed reports with my airline, TSA, and Chicago PD, but the police officer and TSA agents pretty much all told me to wait and hope it was an accident and that it shows up in lost and found.\n\nAnyways, this is mostly a vent, but is there anything else that can be done to help track down my stuff?

      "text": "I’m a 29-year-old guy from Vietnam and have solo traveled to Turkey, Southeast Asia, and India. My trip to India in 2017 lasted five weeks, during which I journeyed from the South to the North, including Ladakh, and visited nearly all the major attractions. As a student on a very tight budget, I relied heavily on Couchsurfing, public transportation, and trains between cities. I had countless interactions with locals—sometimes they even invited me into their homes. On several occasions when I got lost, people were kind enough to drive me to my destination.\n\nOf course, it wasn’t all smooth; I dealt with almost daily bouts of diarrhea, fell victim to scams a few times, and was even hit by a street vendor in Delhi. In my experience, solo travel in India isn’t very safe, especially for women, so I have huge respect for the female backpackers I met along the way.\n\nWhen I planned my trip to Egypt last month, I felt confident—I thought, “If I handled India, Egypt shouldn’t be a problem.” I also believed some people on Reddit might have exaggerated their experiences due to culture shock, especially those from more developed countries. To be cautious, I booked daily tours in each city since I’m no longer a student and had a short trip (only one week), so I wanted to maximize my time.\n\nHowever, I was wrong. In Egypt, it felt like everyone saw me as an ATM. Harassment was constant—from street vendors and taxi drivers to even children and teenagers. They would follow me persistently and aggressively, and I couldn’t escape it. Some even remembered me, so each time I left my hotel, I’d be harassed by the same people. Everywhere I went, tips were expected, even for poor service that drove me crazy. I once booked a bus to Alexandria, and the luggage handler refused to load my backpack until I paid him half the price of the ticket.\n\nThe harassment got so overwhelming that I became anxious every time I had to step outside or talk to someone. Some days, I just wanted to retreat to my hotel room to avoid dealing with anyone. Despite these challenges, I must admit the temples, pyramids, and museums are absolutely stunning. Ancient Egypt’s history is mesmerizing, and the artifacts in the museums are enough to keep you captivated for an entire day. There’s so much to see, and even after traveling between cities, you’ll always discover something new. It’s truly a 10 out of 10 experience, no doubt.\n\nIn conclusion, I highly recommend booking a full end-to-end tour, preferably on a Nile cruise. Egypt is worth every penny and moment, but don’t let the constant harassment spoil your trip like it did for me.",

We travel a lot and figured we could handle whatever came our way. No guides, no pre-booked tickets—just winging it and seeing where the trip took us. We’re a Caucasian and Asian couple in our 30s for reference. Here’s how it went:\n\nFirst Impressions:\n\nEgypt is stunning—like, genuinely jaw-dropping. It’s wild to think this is where human civilization started. Trying to imagine what it must have looked like thousands of years ago is tough, but what’s left is still beyond impressive. Walking around the temples and ruins, you can’t help but think, “Wow, this place must’ve been insane back then.”\n\nThe People:\n\nThe people were mostly super friendly and helpful. Sure, there are scams, but they’re pretty easy to spot. One guy tried the classic “I work at your hotel” scam, claiming he saw us at breakfast (spoiler: he didn’t). We didn’t get ripped off, but we did end up buying some sea salt from his buddy’s shop—200 Egyptian pounds for a little bag (about 2 pounds per gram, which isn’t terrible). He asked for a tip, and I told him I’d give it to him the next morning at breakfast… needless to say, he vanished. The scams are mostly harmless and if you have your guard up and just not interact with people that are straight up looking for your money (street shops, market hagglers, people on the street offering you stuff) you will be totally fine. If someone helps you out or did something for you and you give him ‘baksheesh’ for his ‘service’ - Congrats you just helped someone through the day. \n\nThe Hustle:\n\nYou can tell the economy is rough and people are hustling. At one point, a kid tried to snatch some cash from my wallet, but the locals around us actually stepped in and chased him off. One person even apologized to us on Instagram, which was a nice touch. Everyone’s just trying to get by, but most are cool about it.\n\nCommunication Vibes:\n\nEgyptians love to talk and interact. It’s fun because they’re super chatty, and even if they seem loud, it’s all in good spirits. We got a lot of “Welcome to Egypt!” and “You look like an Egyptian!” comments (Mind you I’m Caucasian and my girlfriend Asian) plus they’d always ask where we’re from and tell us it’s the best country. It’s kinda charming, gets old after a while but it felt at least as an interaction that could lead into something more meaningful. \n\nCairo: The Good and the Wild\n\nCairo is a mixed bag. Downtown was awesome—beautiful old architecture, no one bothering you, and you get to soak up the local vibe. My favorite part was the Islamic area—tons of life, activity, and friendly people. You don’t feel like a tourist here, just another person enjoying the chaos.\n\nNew Cairo is another world. It’s super modern and clean, almost like a different country compared to the old city. It was cool to see that contrast.\n\nThe Food:\n\nFood was really good, but be prepared for slow service. It’s not the place for quick bites. The wait can be a bit frustrating, but the food is worth it—just don’t expect things to move fast.\n\nGetting Around:\n\nTransport is cheap and easy, but the traffic? Absolute chaos. Picture donkeys, buses, cars, and people all crammed together. It’s a mess, but that’s part of the charm.\n\nAirport Drama:\n\nEgyptian airports are kind of a nightmare. Tons of checks, long waits, and people constantly rechecking your stuff. It’s slow and a little frustrating, but nothing you can’t handle with some patience.\n\nFinal Thoughts:\n\nThis isn’t your typical easygoing city trip where you just stroll around, enjoy some sights, and chill. Egypt is chaotic, intense, and full of surprises—but that’s what makes it so special. It’s an adventure, and you’ll leave with some crazy stories and memories. Would 100% recommend if you’re up for something different.",

      "text": "On July 2, 2025, I had a flight from Spain to Portugal scheduled for 22:15. It ended up being delayed until 8am the next morning. I was left in the airport all night with no food, water, or accommodation. The staff originally told us they would arrange hotels and transport, but after making us wait 4 hours, they came back and said they weren’t going to do it. The only thing available was a vending machine, so I had to buy water myself. They also promised that any expenses (hotel, food, etc.) would be refunded.\n\nI submitted a claim afterwards, but Ryanair rejected it. Their explanation was that the delay was due to a strike in France on July 3rd at 9am, which supposedly affected French flights. But this makes no sense because my flight was on July 2nd at 22:15, and the actual reason we couldn’t leave was that we waited over an hour with no staff, then got boarded only to be told the airport had closed.\n\nI contacted them a month ago, but still no proper reply,  just the standard ‘your request has been forwarded to the team’ response.\n\nHas anyone dealt with something like this before? What’s the best way to push back and actually get compensation/refund?",

I am currently in Poland, I have Polish coworkers that after moving to the US have refused to eat meat or chicken stating that it “tastes fake”. Now that I’m here in Poland and I can try their version… it tastes the same to me. Similarly with Spain, I have a friend that is Spaniard and she was so excited when I visited because she said the food was going to be amazing, that the individual ingredients taste so much better. I’ll admit, the food was fantastic, but I don’t think it was because the actual food tasted differently, I think it was just well seasoned and cooked. The individual food itself tasted the same to me. \n\nI also have the food palate of a child so it could just be me. Just wondering if anyone else feels the same way.",

      "text": "After putting it off for years, I finally visited Mexico City and it was probably the best vacation of my life. It's hard to explain what makes CDMX so special because the city is by no means perfect. Maybe it's the eccentricity and edginess of the place. One night I was awakened at 1am by someone singing outside, accompanied by someone playing the trumpet. It all sounded so beautiful I wasn't even upset they'd woken me up. Another time I was heading back to my apartment when I spotted a group of furries walking down the street as if it was the most normal thing in the world. No one seemed fazed by anything in CDMX and even people who might not typically fit there seemed to fit there.\n\nAs far as safety goes, I felt perfectly safe in the city (unlike in Bogota). Now maybe it was because I was in touristy areas doing touristy things, but I also got lost quite a bit and just wandered around. Not once did I feel threatened or as if I was in danger. I wasn't brave enough to try the street food, but I did have the best cheese danish of my life there. Traffic? Probably the worst I've experienced, and the altitude and air pollution dried out my eyes and mouth to the point where I had to drink water constantly, but even those things weren't huge negatives for me. The people were friendly, cool and down-to-earth (except for maybe in Polanco). And the city was affordable compared to European and American cities.\n\nNow could I live in Mexico City? No. But did Mexico City live up to the hype? Yeah, it did. And if you're thinking about visiting but aren't sure, just go already.",

Very historic and beautiful pictures with historic structures next to palm trees and mangroves.\n\nTurin - A very affordable Italian city with a classy vibe, some incredible museums (Egyptian Museum, National Museum of Cinema, National Museum of the Automobile)\n\nWroclaw - Very cheap, with a historic center, beautiful monumental structures (Wroclaw Town Hall, Centennial Hall) and some stunning churches.\n\nAny others I’m missing?

      "text": "I'll be heading out from Lisbon early January and I have 4/5 free days before I fly back to Australia. \n\nI had a random though of 'where could I go in Europe that people go out of their way to pick up souveniers, trinkets, or food items'? Just a random thought that I would genuinely consider. \n\nIdeally things that are hard to get outside their home regions (or much cheaper) but are still allowed back into Australia (sealed/packaged), which cuts out a lot of food. For example, someone once told me they flew to Bordeux just to pick up a nice bottle of wine, or someone went to Paris to take back butter, etc. \n\nGenerally towns with airports would make it eaiser - random, I know, but curious as to what others have in mind!",

      "text": "So what’s something you do on your trips that you think you’re the only one that does that. We really like Mexican food. When we travel the world we go to that city’s interpretation of what Mexican food is. Sometimes it is a good Mexican restaurant and sometimes you wonder do they have any idea what Mexican food is. Oddly enough we found our favorite Mexican restaurant in Riga, Latvia. It had an amazing creamy green sauce. Unfortunately it’s no longer open (we had it 11 years ago) or else I would share it here.\n\nOk that’s our quirky thing we do, what about you?",

      "text": "I’ve been planning this trip to Switzerland for months. It was my first big trip out of North America. I’ve been up to Montreal for work and down to Cancun for a couple of days, but that’s it.  This 9 day trip to Switzerland was supposed to be magical. \n\nI was super excited to see another part of the world, experience a new culture, try new foods, and see the Swiss alps.\n\nEven better, my 11 year old son was coming on the trip and my sister (in Ireland) was going to meet us there!\n\nI budgeted the shit out of this trip and budgeted/planned so well that I actually ended the trip $975 under budget.\n\nWell, the trip comes and it wasn’t what I expected.  My son was as grumpy most of the trip from being jet lagged. He didn’t want to walk anywhere and hated how busy our days were. I was trying to keep him happy and keep up with my sister’s energy (she’s used to traveling around Europe). But it was hard and I couldn’t enjoy all the magical views and places I imagined.\n\nDay 6 comes and we’ve done almost everything on the itinerary. I walk into my son’s room that evening and he’s just crying in bed. Turns out he was really homesick and tired of being away from his mom and friends. He didn’t like the food, his allergies had been killing him, and he was just exhausted.\n\nOf course, as a dad, this breaks my heart, but then sends me into panic/anxiety mode and I’m trying to figure out how to fix it. My idea? Cut the trip short by two days.\n\nI propose the idea to my sister and she hates it. She goes to talk to my son to try to encourage him to push through but he wasn’t having it. He was done. So I cancel out last hotel (full refund) and change our flights at no cost.  My sister gets all her stuff figured out as well. (I paid for almost everything we did on the trip. Lodging, tours, transit, most food, etc). So I didn’t feel bad cutting the trip short. I even paid for the fee it cost to change her flight.\n\nThe morning we are to travel back to the US, I wake up sick with fatigue, sore throat, and a fever. We travel by train from interlaken to Zurich for two hours, wait 3 hrs for our flight, fly to Amsterdam after a 30 min delayed flight. Then we rush halfway across the airport to get on our flight to Atlanta and it’s delayed over and hour because of mechanical issues.  Then I sit on a plane for 9 hrs with an exhausted son and being sick myself. (I wore a mask, constantly used hand sanitizer, and informed the FAs who sat me and my son in an isolated part of the plane since it was mostly empty).\n\nAll-in-all, this magical trip I had been planning for months just wasn’t that great to be honest.  My son says he really liked the trip and so did my sister, but I just felt anxious and stressed the entire time.\n\n\nAlthough my budget was great, we did most of the items on the itinerary, and saw beautiful views, I couldn’t enjoy it.\n\nIt really bummed me out and now I have no desire to travel anymore.  My son actually had been begging me to go to Japan this summer and I was going to take him, but in the flight home he asked me to cancel it. He doesn’t want to travel anymore this year.\n\nMaybe I’ll want to travel one more time this year, but I think it’ll be by myself and for a shorter period of time and close to home. I love my son but I just don’t know if he is ready for such big trips.\n\n\nAnyways, rants/thoughts over.\n\n\n\nEdit: the main point of this story is that I put too much hope in this trip and idealized it.  My son did nothing wrong, we just didn’t know this trip would take such a toll on us.  For what it’s worth, I was super homesick as well and felt panicked about the fact I was so far from home and felt trapped.\n\nEdit 2: the biggest issue for my son was his allergies. The Airbnb was dusty and the owner lived next door and had two dogs. On top of that, my sister has a cat back in Ireland and my son is very allergic to cats.  He stayed loaded up on all allergy meds and they made him tired. We did have a lot of down time and slept in, but his allergies really bothered him. I think it was mostly a mismatch between him and my sister unfortunately. Her cat dander on her clothes and such were really beating his allergies up.\n\n\nLast edit: my son wanted to go on this trip just as much as me.  He looked up items he wanted to do, food he wanted to try and we planned it together.  We planned for jet lag (lazy day the first day) and we did one or two things a day once we realized how busy we’d be. We skipped a lot on the itinerary.  If I were to do things differently, I would have done all the mountain activities first and then stay in the city for the last two days.  I would have done a hotel or an Airbnb with no pets and I would have asked my sister to wash all her stuff thoroughly.  Overall, my son tells me he really liked the trip, he just had a hard time after a few days and such.  He loved the plane ride, train rides, playing in the park in Grindelwald, doing the chocolate making class, and getting to see his aunt for a few days.",

      "text": "Context: I've lived in Germany for over a decade. My cousin and uncle are doing a trip to Europe for her 16th birthday, and I want to meet up with them along their journey for a couple of days since it's close by (which they are totally cool with). Two of their destinations are Paris and Rome, neither of which I've been to before. My husband will be staying home with our kid, so I'm travelling solo, which I actually really enjoy.\n\nMy uncle and cousin are pretty much booked up during their days with tours and day trips, so I'll mostly just see them for breakfast and/or dinner each day. Either way, it's a weekend in July.\n\nTravel and hotel costs from where I live are pretty comparable. I'm wondering which city will be more worth it to explore on foot, and to eat my way through. I could do either a Fri-Sun in Paris, or a Sat-Tues in Rome. Mostly I'm interested in the food and architecture, but might hit an art museum, or do a cheesy hop-on-hop-off bus thing (they're kind of silly, but I really enjoyed the one I did in Madrid years ago).\n\nI probably won't be able to afford hotels super close to where my family is staying - it's last minute, and they have a bigger budget for sure - so I also want to stay somewhere where I'll feel safe walking alone at night.\n\nWeigh in! What city would you choose, and why? Bonus points for good tips on your chosen city, especially cheap/free cultural experiences!\n\nedited to correct dates and spelling errors",

      "text": "I’ve been fortunate enough to travel quite a bit but haven’t exactly visited everywhere around the world. \n\nBut recently my desire to see the entire world has subsided and I’d much rather revisit the countries that I have enjoyed the most. For me that’s Japan, Switzerland, Iceland. And maybe also France and Italy. \n\nI just think that returning feels like I can slow down and really enjoy the parts of the country that I missed the first time. And I’ll be guaranteed to enjoy the trip since I know what’s in store and I already love the culture, food and scenery. Planning is more fun and less stressful than trying to figure out a brand new country. \n\nIs anyone else the same way?",

We are doing a mix of sightseeing and relaxation before heading to a wedding in Suez (the groom is a friend we met while studying abroad). \n\nI’ve already done loads of research and compiled tips I've found online (Uber, tipping, hotels, scams, etc.), but I still have a few specific questions:\n\n1. **What should women wear in Cairo, especially in summer?** Are shorts or strapless tops ever acceptable, even in resorts or touristic areas?\n2. One of my friends arrives alone in Cairo around **7-8PM**. Is it safe for her to **take an Uber to Cairo downtown by herself**?\n3. While I visit museums and old buildings, my friends want to relax at **pool clubs/resorts**. Are these **safe and welcoming for foreign women**? any recommendation for nice clubs/resorts with pools for a day?\n4. **Do we need to tip in general?** What are the expectations for:\n   * Restaurants\n   * Uber rides\n   * Hotel staff\n   * Tour guides (local vs foreign)\n5. Any **restaurant recommendations for good Egyptian food with a view to the pyramids**, or must-try places in d**owntown or Islamic Cairo**?\n6. Just confirming, is it generally better to withdraw cash directly anywhere in the city than bringing GBP or EUR and exchange in the airport?\n\nThanks in advance! all your past posts have helped loads. Just tying up the last loose ends now!",

I had this in my head since then thus created this account to gain bit of insight. It was dissapointing nonetheless... It is hilarious for me to compare it to the cuisine of Italy, Vietnam, India, Turkey etc.. Even compared to Spanish. Tapas, of it's varies type in Sevilla were far more delicious than any Portuguese dish I tried. \n\nI had Bacalau Abras, Bacalau de Natas, Arroz de Pato, Polvo a Lagareiro, Pastel de Nata, Francesina (sorry for any misspells). The flavour is bland, the fish is often slightly burned, sometimes not even well cooked at all (the octopus or squid were always rubbery i.e), salt and lemon are the only ingredients I saw most to enhance any flavor. The pastry was decent though.\n\nAsking it because of the hype really. I expect a good cuisine to be exciting, creative on it's design/making. Portuguese food was personally just a boring experience. \n\nWhy people rave it so much today? Also any dish I missed?",

I’ve got the “big historic sights” covered but realized I don’t have much that’s just soaking up the culture.

We’re planning a night in Orvieto on the way up to Florence (the cathedral + St. Patrick’s Well.) Has anyone done Orvieto or other Umbrian towns by train? Is it worth staying longer than one night? Any day trips from there that are easy without a car?\n\nHere’s the rough plan, nothing is set in stone.\n\nOct 29: Arrive Rome → Piazza Navona, Pantheon, Trevi, Spanish Steps\n\nOct 30: Colosseum, Arch of Constantine, Forum, Palatine Hill, Via dei Fori Imperiali (sunset)\n\nOct 31: Vatican + Museums\n\nNov 1: Appian Way\n\nNov 2: Ostia Antica\n\nNov 3: Day trip: Pompeii, Herculaneum, maybe Naples Archaeological Museum\n\nNov 4: Orvieto (Cathedral, St. Patrick’s Well)\n\nNov 5–10: Florence (staying with friends, maybe day trips to Milan/Venice)\n\nNov 11: Back to Rome\n\nNov 12: Fly out\n\nSo, The history boxes are checked, but I’d love to balance it out with more “everyday Italy.”\n\nAny must-hit cafés, restaurants, or piazzas for people watching? And is Orvieto worth more time, or just an overnight?\n\nThanks in advance",

It was smelly and kinda dirty, and I felt some weird hostile vibes as a tourist as well. The food was just decent, and none of the attractions really blew me away, other than Sagrada Familia. The public transit and walkability is *fine* but again, nothing amazing. \n\nI usually like to judge a place based on its own merits but while in Barcelona I couldn’t help but compare it to other major European cities I’ve been and loved, like Rome, Paris, Lisbon, London, Prague, Istanbul (kinda counts I guess) etc. and finding it a bit lacking.",

      "text": "Just curious to see if anyone’s been successful with this. I lived in Texas for the past decade, but the last year and a half I’ve been backpacking around the world, and have tried Mexican restaurants in quite a few different countries when I wanted a break from the local cuisine. Tried it in Chile, Brazil, Indonesia, Thailand, etc. and across the board it has been either downright terrible or mediocre at best. The spices and sauces are just all wrong, the corn tortillas suck. Even the meat doesn’t taste right.\n\nIt’s really the only cuisine where I haven’t had success finding a good version of overseas. \n\nWhat makes Mexican food so difficult to replicate overseas?",

I just generally don't bring anything that would need it, though I occasionally bring back a small amount of snacks, and have never had any issues.  Mayne I've just been lucky.\n\nI live in the EU now, and am traveling back to the US to visit family for the first time in 3 years.  We went a bit overboard with bringing gifts, including Easter chocolate, and some packaged salami snacks.\n\nI've never travelled with this much food before, or with meat products.  How exactly does this work?  Declare it all and then they decide if they want to inspect it or not?  Or if it's within the allowed guidelines don't declare it?  I'm admittedly a bit clueless about the whole thing.  We also each have 1 liter of alcohol, which I know is the allowed limit - declare it or not?\n\nThanks!\n\nEDIT for anyone interested -\n\nI had actually written the post when we were already at the airport, so a bit too late, lol.  I declared all of my food and alcohol, and sure enough they confiscated the meat.  They were very nice and polite, and surprisingly enough let me keep the cat food/treats I had.  Now I know for next time.",

We love dishes with a lot of flavor and spice; I know spice is not common in either country, but to give a sense of the kind of dishes we usually go for.

Something like a 6-10 day get-away for the 15th anniversary, and looking for ideas.\n\nMust have:\n\n\\- Lodging + Food (no airfare) must be $5k-$9k for 2 people\n\n\\- Length out from 6-10 nights\n\n\\- Lots of water/beach and outdoor activities\n\n\\- Ideally ability to rent a boat or hike to or somehow access *private* beaches for at least 1-2 days of the trip. Totally good if it requires renting a boat to get there.\n\n\\- Tropical feel, preferably lodging on a beach/oceanfront\n\n\\- Options for hikes, fishing, adventures, boat rentals, surfing, etc. Doesn't need to be everything— but we're not the \"let's saddle up to the all-you-can-eat-buffet for the next 6 days\" kinda people.\n\n\\- Not overly crowded. Probably not desolate, but not looking for something loaded with insta-gram posts about it\n\nWe don't need crazy luxury. Fine with older accommodations and cities that aren't overly \"tourtisty\". Not looking for Maldives-level photo-worthiness.\n\nAnyone have any ideas? Looked at a couple places in Nicaragua— The balance between amenities and price in a lot of those areas seems good, but the travel advisories have the wife a little concerned. Up for someone in mexico— but not looking for the usual \"Playa del Carmen/Cancun\" type spring-break atmosphere, something a little more laid back is fine (its a 15th anniversary trip and all).\n\nBonus points for anything that has any kind of pirate history or historical sites. I've got a big interest in golden age of piracy historical elements, and can appreciate any kind of things that are tied to history.\n\nAlso good having a trip that does a few days in one location and a few days in another.\n\nBesides a few places in Mexico— I'm relatively unfamiliar with Caribbean so hoping experts in this area may be able to suggest something.\n\nThanks so much for all your help! Planning on traveling shoulder season in 2026 somewhere (either spring 2026 or fall 2026).",

Just go to Carrefour or Intermarché and have cheese for dinner. Basque food, seafood, some weird stuff with ducks and other birds. Cognac. Armagnac. Chaource. Pavé. Tomme de this, tomme de that. Cider. Mustard.\n\nThe Musée d'Orsay is arguably the best art museum in the world.\n\nRidiculously friendly people. Always end up having a chat with the adjacent table in my shit French, or in English, which they actually do speak to some extent.\n\nLes Misérables is probably the best book ever written.\n\nAnd on top of that, they're politically quite sound. With all the crap going on in some eastern European states like Hungary, Poland (though I guess PiS isn't in charge anymore?), Slovakia not to even speak of whatever the US is doing, France is keeping a steady course and I wouldn't mind them being on the helm.\n\nOkay sure it's not all perfect. They still have colonies. They've had a few dark pages in history. Leave that in the past. At least their colonial history gave us bahn mi. And thanks I guess for giving us a Lingua Franca in western Africa.\n\nSo f* off with your Colombia, Mexico or Japan, and go to France instead.\n\n(take this with a grain of salt)",

Last fall I had the wonderful opportunity to travel to Japan to write about the [72 microseasons](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/22/t-magazine/japan-microseasons.html?unlocked_article_code=1.OU8.hnqI.I_9H0I0NxYCL&smid=re-nytimes) and their importance not only in cooking but in how we see the world.\n\nAll of these links are available to read for free, even without a New York Times subscription. \n\n–\n\nIn our new roles, we’ll be looking for restaurants all over the country that tell stories about their place, the people they serve and the cultural moment that we're in. In other words, reviews that are fun and illuminating to read, even if you’ll never make it to that spot for dinner. Ask us anything about food and cooking, our new jobs and our approaches to reviewing.\n\n>Thanks so much for all your questions, and so sorry we couldn’t get to all of them! Please send tips and let us know your favorite restaurants — you’ll find us on Instagram at @tejalxrao and @ligayamishan. Happy eating!",

      "text": "**Hi everyone!**\n\nI’m **Marianna Dushar**, a food anthropologist, writer, and researcher focusing on the intersection of food, memory, and identity. My work explores how Ukrainian cuisine—both in Ukraine and in the diaspora—preserves cultural heritage, strengthens communities, and adapts to new environments. **Let’s talk about how food shapes identity and a sense of belonging! Ask Me Anything!**\n\n[I’m Marianna Dushar, a Food Anthropologist Exploring Ukrainian Diaspora Cuisine & Galician Food Traditions—Ask Me Anything! Let’s talk about how food shapes identity and a sense of belonging! \\[AMA\\]](https://preview.redd.it/lna9tx42uhie1.jpg?width=2252&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=4e3db803a09431847c47870eb3cff5cf48659d1f)\n\nUkrainian cuisine has traveled far beyond its homeland, evolving in the diaspora as communities carried their culinary traditions across borders. I explore how recipes were preserved, adapted, or reinvented in new environments—from wartime refugee kitchens to immigrant neighborhoods in North America. For many, Ukrainian food abroad is more than just sustenance; it is a deep emotional and cultural anchor, a way to maintain identity and pass down traditions across generations.\n\nI also study **Galician food traditions**, shaped by centuries of cultural exchange at the crossroads of empires. Galicia, a historical region straddling modern-day Ukraine and Poland, was a meeting point of Ukrainian, Polish, Jewish, Austro-Hungarian, and many other influences, creating a culinary landscape rich in unexpected connections and flavors. This unique blend of cultures gave rise to dishes that are both familiar and surprising—like **almond borshch**, a festive Lenten soup with noble roots, or Habsburg-inspired pastries that found a second life in local kitchens.\n\n🍲 **How does food help people maintain a sense of belonging, even when they are far from home?**  \n🍞 **What happens to traditional recipes as they cross borders—do they stay the same, evolve, or take on entirely new meanings?**  \n🥟 **Why do some dishes become powerful symbols of identity, while others fade into obscurity?**\n\nThese are some of the questions I explore in my work, and I’d love to dive into them with you! Let’s talk about forgotten recipes, the role of women in preserving culinary traditions, Ukrainian food in exile, and how food serves as an anchor of identity in times of migration and war.\n\n🗓️ **I’ll be answering your questions live on February 13th from 9:00 PM to 10:00 PM Kyiv time.** That’s:  \n🕖 **7:00 PM – 8:00 PM London time**  \n🕑 **2:00 PM – 3:00 PM US Eastern time**  \n🕚 **11:00 AM – 12:00 PM US Pacific time**\n\nFeel free to drop your questions in advance!

Styling food can be painstaking, but also beautifully rewarding.\n\n**My Background:** I’ve spent my career testing, developing, and styling recipes sometimes with turnarounds of less than two weeks(!).  Working in the recipe development world means I get some unique opportunities like traveling to Gruyères, Switzerland and learning how gruyère is made or working with Lance Bass and the chefs from Downton Abbey. Styling requires a lot of hand shopping, going to every grocery store possible to find specific items or the prettiest loaf of bread or cut of meat. It also requires patience and a keen eye on what is needed to make a photo go from good to great. \n\nBefore Delish, I worked at Food52 as an intern and freelancer. I received my Culinary arts degree from Institute of Culinary Education and BA in Human Behavior from University of Oklahoma. When I’m not testing and developing at the Delish Test Kitchen, I’m in Brooklyn, [taking long runs that often](https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/protect.checkpoint.com/v2/r01/___https:/*www.instagram.com/makinze/___.YzJ1OnJlZGRpdDpjOmc6OWQ4NjZlYWJiMDA0MzM4MDA0ZGIyNTMyN2MxNDI3Zjk6Nzo3NGU0OmY0NjgyYjM3YjMzMjRiZTRhOTRjNjQzZjA0MmNkOGE1N2FkNzM0Y2IxYzMxNGJjNTUwZjQ1MmIyMjI1YTc1OTk6aDpUOk4__;Lw!!Ivohdkk!lGBlWrCsftqCUeXH_Ekz5zB_-FQEAthYAap5s9r2iwxLlNjnPuWjxFMxnxIR_NhfgpHNqn28ZP9uXzVAUg$) end at great bakeries or a new pizza spot. \n\n**Proof:**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/99iakt464jxd1.jpg?width=3024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=0dd6bf683a09ab06c31e363502cc977517b01307",

      "text": "About eight years ago while travelling Indonesia, I came across an interesting food from a street vendor in Jakarta. I never saw it before and never found it again, and I couldn’t find out what it was when I had it due to language barriers. Of course I forgot to take a photo. I have since then tried asking people, googling it, and more recently even AI - but no success.\n\nDescription:\n\nI literally do not even know if it was plant- or animal based.\n\nIt was sort of like a wobbly sheet, about 3-4mm thick, ca. 4-5cm wide and a bit longer (maybe 10-15cm). It was covered in a red spicy sauce, but I believe the original color of the piece was white. It was possible to see the light through it (I remember holding it against the sunlight).\n\nIt didn’t have much of its own taste, I just remember the spicy sauce. But the consistency/biting texture was a bit like squid and the mouthfeel of the surface was kind of uneven.\n\nI can’t even say if I liked it, but it was so unique and unlike any other food I ever had.",

Street interviews asking people their favourite restaurants, dishes at those restaurants, any funny stories at the restaurants with friends / family, eventually it could scale to interviewing people in popular tourist cities so people looking to travel can see what are good spots, and people who have already tried can compare with what other people say compared to their opinion.\n\nA different channel idea concept, instead of the food reviewer vlogs, we interview people instead. \n\nInterested to know what you guys have to say....",

Ask me anything!\n\n**When & Where**\n\nI’ll be answering your questions live on **February 11th from 15:00–16:00 Kyiv time**. That’s:\n\n·        **13:00–14:00 London time**\n\n·        **08:00–09:00 US Eastern time**\n\n·        **05:00–06:00 US Pacific time**\n\n>Thank you for your fantastic questions.

      "title": "My secrets to eating homemade food most meals ",
      "text": "Some of the things I do to make meal time easier on me:\n\n- buy onions, leeks, carrots, celery, beets, garlic, corn cobs, peppers, jalapeños, tomatoes, when they’re in season. I can get celery for $.97, corn cob $.25, 10 lbs onions $2, 10 lbs beets $3, 10 lbs carrots $2\n\nI spend a day or two chopping, blanching (when needed), freezing all of the above. I freeze them in layers on cookie sheets separated by parchment paper. Then my family helps me vacuum seal in quantities that make sense for 2-4 uses.\n\nI save most of the veg peelings and make stock packages too. I include fresh herbs from the garden and everything. When I have enough chicken bones to make broth I throw a stock package in with the bones and water and I have stock going in 2 minutes. I then freeze the stock by the litre. \n\nThis means I’m rarely prepping for basic meals. If I want to make leek and potato soup, I throw in a bag of frozen chopped leeks, bag of mini potatoes, celery, carrot, stock, seasonings and walk away. \n\nI know this isn’t for everyone lol. I just love to be able to cook from scratch what I’m craving and not have to bust my butt prepping everyday. \n\n6 large bunches of celery take me less than 30 minutes to wash and dice. Once they are frozen & vacuum sealed, that’s chopped celery for a year for $6. \n\nI also do gourmet frozen tv dinners. I only make meals that freeze and reheat perfectly.\n\nMac n cheese freezes beautifully, single portion frozen with a slice of meatloaf, frozen peas.\n\nHomemade potstickers\n\nButter chicken w/rice.\n\nSoups and chili.\n\nLasagna\n\nMeatballs\n\nJumbo shells filled with cheese and spinach. I freeze them individually without the sauce and cook only what I need with a jar of sauce.\n\nBeef or lamb kefte w/seasoned rice can be served with raw tomatoes and cucumbers quickly. \n\nBolognese sauce\n\nTaco meat\n\nTeriyaki chicken breast (shredded) over white rice with carrots. This one is a fave.\n\nSometimes I’m prepping whole meals, and sometimes the protein only. I can always boil pasta, make rice, etc. Raw, frozen meatballs can be used with different sauces.\n\nI spend in total 2 days (16 hrs) a year prepping and packaging a ton of stuff. After that, I have components of so many meals at hand. We spend a lot of time at the cottage and it has added a lot of relaxation time for me there. It was starting to feel like we would finish breakfast and i’d need to start prepping for lunch…then the same for dinner. That’s not how I picture a relaxing weekend for me…maybe for everyone else…but not for me. \n\nI’ve turned this into a lifestyle decision for me. I’m a mom, sure, but I like time to chill out with my family too. \n\nPlease note that I find chopping veggies, when I’m not in a time crunch, very relaxing. I look forward to my chopping sessions lol. And people get so excited when they open my freezers and see so many bags and containers of prepped stuff! I know that I need to feed everydamnbody 3x a day.  I struggled with anxiety over it for years. This mitigates the stress for me. YMMV.",

      "text": "I have just read a post where someone mentioned one of my favs, and that gave me an idea! My current   inspiration is [Brian Lagerstrom](https://www.youtube.com/@BrianLagerstrom) because he is funny, explains well why he does what he does. Offers alternatives to rare or expensive ingredients and provides grams and Celsius :)\n\nI used to be a big fan of [Adam Ragusea](https://www.youtube.com/@aragusea), and many of his recipes are still in my roster. I admired his channel because he had a knack to simplify very time-consuming of fancy ingredients to something much simpler (and or cheaper). His coq au vin or lamb shanks with celeriac pure AND easy au gratin, are mostly cheap, easy to make and are perfect for entertaining. For the last year or so, he talks much more than he cooks, and things that he cooks do not really align with my preferences.\n\nBasic with Babish was an early \"baby\" of [Babish Culinary Universe](https://www.youtube.com/@babishculinaryuniverse) and while I am a seasoned and passionate home cook I have learned A LOT. Last few years are more reviews, theatrics, collabs and lifestyle content, so stopped watching and subscribing.\n\n[Alex](https://www.youtube.com/@FrenchGuyCooking) do not post that very often, but he can dedicate series of videos to one dish, and the depth of his research is uplifting!\n\n[Italia Squisita](https://www.youtube.com/@italiasquisita) is a relatively obscure Italian channel, but they do have English subs and they show how professional chefs prepare very interesting and tasty recipes.\n\nFinely honourable mentions to Pasta Grannies, Kenji Lopez-alt, Ethan Chlebowski, Joshua Weissman (especially since he harnessed his showboaty personality), Food Wishes with ever cheerful chief John and last but not least, Mrs Crocombe from English Heritage channel.\n\nWhat are your favourite cooking channels (and by that I mean channel when there is at lest one recipe explained from the beginning to an end) and also WHY they are favourite?",

      "text": "Hi there,\n\nMy partner recently had some health issues and the doctor said she will basically need to lie down for the next 10 weeks outside of necessities like using the bathroom. Given that she can't move for the next few months, I, as the cook of the household, want to make sure her body is nourished properly.\n\nI typically cook on the heavier/richer side, which I suspect is not great for someone who basically cannot move their body, so I want to take this as an opportunity to learn how to prepare food that is fresh and healthy. I'm looking for advice in the form of recipes or cookbooks to help me achieve this goal - as we have a rowdy toddler at home who always wants us to get up and play (not possible for my partner now), speed is of utmost importance so I can focus on childcare. Bonus points for recipes amenable to the German pantry as I live in Germany and do not have access to many typical North American ingredients (oh how I miss fresh Mexican produce 🥲)\n\nThanks to whoever reads this and I hope you have a nice day!\n\nEdit: Forgot to mention that she is pregnant so certain ingredients are a no-go.",

I love to cook, and I will religiously compile recipes I'd like to make and pick up the ingredients at the beginning of the week. This past year though (few years really) have kicked my butt and I would usually end up getting takeout rather than cooking a significant portion of my planned meals each week. So much food waste and unhealthy takeout.\n\n  \nI recently treated myself to a new slow cooker and it's honestly helped me make a huge lifestyle change. I work from home, and I've gotten into a routine where I essentially cook once per day. At lunchtime, I put dinner in the slow cooker first, then fix lunch for myself and my husband (usually the previous day's slow cooker leftovers). I haven't had food waste once since I started cooking this way. It also has helped me keep on top of the dishes and keep my kitchen a better workspace too, as the bulk of cooking all gets done at lunchtime I'm able to run the dishwasher in the afternoon put away the already clean dishes at dinner time. Nothing like going to bed with a clean kitchen.\n\n  \nI just wanted to share because it's coming up to soup season, and I know people are going to be pulling their slow cookers out. I've lost 12lbs since reconnecting with my slow cooker, and to keep things interesting I've been experimenting with different cuisines since eating this way. Hungarian goulash and Ethiopian lentil stew are both on the meal plan this week. Long live slow cooking!",

Paired with a lifestyle change that's meant I have less time for my lunches I need to make this quick and easy for myself. With a tight budget the solution I came to is home made meal replacement shakes. Only problem, I've never thought about nutrients in my cooking, I just figure homemade meals i'm probably fine.  \nSo let's tackle this together, I'll start us off with the basics cos that's the extent of my nutritional knowledge.\n\nBase recipe:  \nOats  \nLiquid (your choice of milks, maybe juices could also work here?)  \nProtein source (protein powder/raw eggs if safe in your country/peanut butter/nuts/surely there's other stuff that could be included?)  \nMaybe some fruit or veggies?\n\nDo we need to add more stuff to make sure it has all the nutrition a human needs. Also I'm aiming to have high fat rn. As weird as it sounds I'm trying to develop some fat mass, i'm trans so I need that boob fuel. How would I add that in a non gross way? Suggestions other than dairy would be good but we can still include that in case someone else stumbles upon this post needing a meal replacement  \n  \nCheapest meal replacement I found online was about $1 per portion, calories were pretty low on it tho so probably wouldn't work long term. Still let's see if we can beat or get close to $1 per portion, bulk buying ingredients is allowed assuming it's realistic",

The problem is  thinking of things to make that he’ll eat at home. I used to be able to whip things up in the past out of whatever ingredients I had at home but we have a 9 month old baby now so I don’t have the time to be creative. Looking for recipes for dinner that are primarily meat-based, not a lot of seafood (I’m allergic to fish), have interesting/complex flavors, and are well-balanced meals (so much of what I find is various forms of pasta and we are both trying to eat healthier). \n\nThe closest inspiration I have found so far is some IG accounts of private chefs who meal prep for high profile clients - but a lot of the content is more lifestyle focused vs. recipes. \n\nTIA!!\n\nEDIT: wow there are a lot of judgey comments here. First of all, husband can cook. He’s been doing a lot of the cooking since baby arrived, but much of it tends to be higher on calories (pasta, rice, potatoes, steak, etc). Like I said, we want to start eating healthy and chicken and vegetables gets boring quick. I am also a much more experienced cook and am able to execute on new and complicated recipes much more easily than he is. Neither of us has time to deal with him experimenting. I added in the note about fine dining so you’d understand the types of recipes/flavors I was looking for.",

      "text": "Hi! I'm trying to streamline my kitchen/diet especially being disabled, and needing more convenient options recently, and I hunted for a more general answer than 'whatever you like' or more specific herbs and spices recipes, but I couldn't find one for a very bog standard 'mixed herbs' you'd find in a store. I hate buying such a small jar for such a high price, and I no longer live near the refillery I could fill a bigger jar with it. Is there a specific radio/amount of the herbs involved so that I could just create my own and have a big ol jar of it? It's one of my most used convenience ingredients. \n\nOr is this very truly just a 'mess around and find out' sort of process? \n\nThank you for what is likely one of many more posts relating to my journey of maintaining a better lifestyle for my conditions! I love cooking, and love having home cooked meals, but it is a very tiring and potentially dangerous activity, and finding disability aids, herb/spice mixes, and meal prep/frozen prep that don't suck after being reheated are super important to me. \n\nPS: if you're disabled/have carpal tunnel/or just particularly hate grinding pepper- electric pepper mill genuinely changed my life! one of the best gifts ive ever gotten even if some people make fun of how 'lazy' it is",

However, it’s always easier for me to prepare one vegetarian meal instead of cooking both a meat dish and a vegetarian dish. \n\nI am looking for creative ways to easily create both a meat and vegetarian dish with the same base. For example, if I want to eat fish/red meat over a bed of rice, I’d grill some tofu for her with the same sauce/seasoning over rice. If I’m making pasta with meatballs, I’ll find vegan meat alternatives to add separately into the pasta. Having to cook a separate vegetarian protein source becomes time consuming. \n\nAny suggestions on meat/non-meat protein pairings or meal prepping tips would greatly be appreciated!",

      "text": "A little context about two years ago I was working out six days a week, and cooking breakfast, lunch dinner, and snack. I was up at 4 o’clock every morning and in bed at 7 PM, my day consisted of waking up, going to the gym, coming home, making breakfast and lunch, going to work coming home cooking dinner, then going to sleep. I did this for almost a year.\n\nAs you can tell that it’s quite a drain draining lifestyle. So essentially I crashed. Pretty much one day just woke up and stopped. In the last two years, I say I have cooked maybe 25 25 times. Apart from maybe a bowl of cereal in the morning and some snacks, I’ve been purchasing breakfast, lunch and dinner every single day. Obviously this has been quite expensive. It’s been  breakfast sandwiches from McDonald’s Starbucks, and Tim Hortons every day, mostly fast food for lunch, I try to make healthier options, but obviously it’s fast food so you can only get so healthy. And then most nights were the same thing, with going out to an actual restaurant, probably three times a week.\n\nThe last week I have pretty much went decided that I’m not eating out anymore. Stocked up on all the greens I needed plan my meals and have been cooking. However, I don’t seem to have any motivation to make “ healthy“ food. I’ve made a few different chicken and pork dishes, usually with rice or noodles. Usually with higher calorie sources. Or higher calorie pastas. \n\nI feel the choices I was making eating out are better than the choices. I’m making cooking at home. However. When I eat in a restaurant, I have no control over the amount of salt, sugar or fat they use. At least at home I can try and make healthier decisions.  I’m trying to figure if eating “healthier“ fast food for every meal of every day I was actually healthier. Or if my “unhealthy” food I’m making at home is healthier. Just so clear I’m still making smart decisions where I can. But instead of making egg white omelet, I’m making regular omelet with cheese. I know that the omelet with cheese and make it home and more calories every morning than the omelet bites. I would get at Starbucks, what calories and everything and I feel like cooking at home must be healthier. \n\nI know there are a lot of unknowns here  as my exact diet is really going to decide how healthy it was. But I feel no matter how unhealthy the food I make it home is, there is no way it could be as unhealthy of eating out every meal of every day",

I have a question hopefully someone has an answer to or can point me in a direction if this concern was already addressed \n\nMy husband is a vegetarian (eats eggs) and I enjoy poultry and seafood (1x/week). Both of us try to balance healthy eating with occasional indulgence as we love trying new cuisines. We cook pretty regularly but kinda plateaued with the recipes we already know and would like to venture into cookbooks and learning basic techniques. One of the challenge we face is making a recipe work for both of us whilst having different proteins. We would like to learn recipes that become part of our cooking lifestyle so looking for a cookbook that is more on the healthier side (but sustainable) and cater to both our meat preferences. Tried to google but it’s been hard to find cookbooks that are mostly vegetarian with some guidance on meat. Usually everything is either exclusively vegetarian or meat heavy.

My only caveats are that I cannot eat seafood (fish, shellfish, etc), and I can be a little bit of a picky eater. I tend to only like chicken, beef, and most veggies/fruits. I'm not that adventurous.

If any of the recipe collectors among you would like to download and or share the [offline browsable copy](https://www.bupkis.org/wp-content/uploads/bupkis.dotorg.zip), I'd appreciate it..  there's a link in the right sidebar. at  https://bupkis.org\n\nNo ads, no cookies no tracking, no nothing it's just my favorite recipe\n** edit: there are cookies st\n these are spectacular**https://www.bupkis.org/index.php/recipes-2/dessert/chocolate-chunk-cookies\nSorry to bother you all. It seems like everybody has years and years and years left, right up until they don't.\n\n**Edit**\n\nIt turns out that at the end of the road, the things that really mattered were good times with friends and family, And these were almost all in the kitchen. \n\nI've gotten to be relatively old, and finding out what I have certainly was not a happy thing, but given the number of my friends over the years that died with no notice from a heart attack or vehicle accident or whatever, this weirdly seems like a bit of a gift that I know what's coming and have *some* idea of a timeline. Although not a really good idea. \n\nGo home make yummy food and have your friends and family over. Actual happy memories are all that matters, money, power, status, everything else is mostly all nonsense.\n\n**Edit**\nThis outpouring support and sympathy is more than I could ever have imagined! Thank you all I really appreciate it; However in the [immortal words of Monty Python \"I'm not dead yet\"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EfOW9QrLs0o) 8-)\n\nRight now I only have major annoyances but no show stoppers. \n\nI plan to continue enjoying family and friends and cooking as much as I can, it's just harder and slower now because the surgery kind of wrecked my left side. On the other hand[terrible pun intended] I'm right handed,  so I can still do a lot of stuff, it just takes longer. \n\n**PS if any of you are cooking for anybody that has cancer and has no appetite, I can tell you from first-hand experience that [the banana bread](https://www.bupkis.org/index.php/recipes-2/favorites/banana-bread) goes down really easily and sits really well.**\n\nThe weird part about all this was that I initially found it and made it for someone else who had cancer about 25 years ago, And now we make it for me.\n\nI also can't express enough gratitude that due to the efforts of friends I've never met all over the world the things that made me happy during my life will continue to make others happy for decades or maybe even hundreds of years in the future. The internet which is the very definition of \"not permanent stuff\" is now the eternal keeper of the things in life which mean the most to me which were food and friends and family.\n\nPlease note that I have read and appreciate each and every one of your replies. I have not answered them all because doing things online while missing large chunks of my brain is quite a bit more difficult than it used to be. But know that I read them all and you're all appreciated and I thank you all.\n\n**This is a [downloadable browsable offline copy  of the entire website](https://www.bupkis.org/wp-content/uploads/bupkis.dotorg.zip).

I freeze the meals before packing them, but depending on the heat in the car, food ranges from still slightly frozen to barely cool by the time I get to the hotel. \n\nFor this reason I try not to bring meat or dairy based meals (besides cheese) in the summer. I prefer to make a single one pot meal for the week as it is easier to pack and transport. They need to freeze and then reheat in the hotel microwave well. I do physical work outside in the heat so they do need some sort of protein and be nutritious. I am also gluten free and GF pasta doesn’t reheat well which eliminates a lot of options. \n\nI am making so much fried rice this summer that I need other suggestions. In the winter I do  lasagnas, cottage pie, and soups. Most of my coworkers go out to eat every night but that feels like a waste of money and so unhealthy. Any suggestions?",

      "text": "Hey! As the title asks, I’m wondering the best way to store candied fruit for about an hour travel. I’m doing the fruit for a baby shower for my manager at work and I don’t want to risk it melting/sweating on the way from the heat. This is my first time doing any type of catering.\n\nI’m also curious what I should charge for it. The manager is buying all of the fruit so I’m just doing the labor. It’s for around 50 people. I’m not sure what a reasonable price would be for it and I want to stay on for terms with the manager.\n\nThank you!",

First of all, I am not sure if this is the appropriate sub for my question/problem but hopefully, someone here has a solution. \n\n*Is there a cheap way to better preserve food for long distance travel?*\n\nFor context, I sell homemade food that’s ready to cook (Homemade Dim Sum, Dumplings, Siumai). Currently, most of my customers are from around my area so spoilage during travel isn’t really a problem. \n\nI am looking to expand my market beyond my area. So that first problem that is really hindering this expansion is the spoilage of food. \n\nMy theoretical solution for now is to let the food sit for 1 day in the freezer and hopefully can “survive” the travel time. Another thing is by incorporating a little bit of vinegar in the mixture, in my mind, adding vinegar can improve the shelf life of the food (Correct me if I’m wrong). \n\nThat’s the solution that I’m thinking, is there a better, preferably cheap, solution to my problem?\n\nThanks!",

Most times, I have a kitchen available, but often do only small, easy to make stuff, e.g. only sandwiches or a bit of meat with tortellini and a veggie, etc.\n\n\nToday I want to change things up. I have a kitchen available (only a stove, no oven) and brought some spices (cayenne pepper, salt, MSG, curry powder, soy sauce,honey), which I used yesterday for my always-on-monday dish: mie noodles with ground beef\n\n\nThis dish is 500g of ground beef, a paprika, bunch of spring onion, a carrot, mie noodles and a sauce consisting of said spices, soy sauce and honey. I'm inclined to make it again, but as I said, I want to change things up.\n\n\nI'd prefer to buy ingredients that I'll use completely, so I don't have to take too much back home (that's why I'm hesitant to buy e.g. rice, which comes at 1kg packages, and we have enough at home). \n\n\nCalorie-wise I still have about 2500 calories open, so anything goes. The more protein, the better. No allergies or intolerances (aside from cilantro/coriander, screw that stuff)\n\n\nI'd greatly appreciate your input\n\nThank you",

Outside is a nice fridge-like chill, and coolers exist, so hopefully, I'll be able to keep everything moderately cold during transport. Kitchen space and oven time on location are probably limited.\n\nAny ideas what I can bring? Pretty please, and thank you!\n\nEdits:\n\n* I'm German, so American grocery store staples only work for me if there are copycat recipes around.\n* No crock pot, but sous vide is an option.\n* The buffet is geared towards snacks and dips and suchlike. The host provides a bigger dish. And there's cake beforehand, so it's supposed to be savory.",

So what's the best way to ensure that it's hot and still crispy as it was once made once opened. I've been doing some research and apparently an insulating lunch box is the best option with ventilating capacities. Any ideas on what could work and the cheapest but most effective tools and methods.",

I tossed sliced mushrooms with a little melted butter and olive oil, salt and pepper, and had had them in the oven at 375 for about 20 minutes when my dad started complaining. \n\nI am pretty adventurous with food, and I don’t cook with mushrooms often, so I’m open to the possibility that it did smell terrible to the average person. Was the butter a bad idea? \n\nEdit: thanks everyone for the advice and support. Talked to my mom and my dad has apparently always been sensitive to a few smells: liver, stewed tomatoes, and mushrooms. Won’t cook them in the house again lol",

Not too long ago, I stopped at a convenience store while traveling that had Godfathers pizza and all they had was a Hot Stuff pizza which it had jalapeños on it.   I never thoughf jalapeños would make a good pizza topping.   It surprised me as to how good it was.   Now, most of the time, I will order pizzas with jalapeños on it in addition to what I normally order.\n\nwhat about you, have you ever been surprise by a topping that you thought would never work on a pizza?",

The confused comments, compounded with the fact there were no recipes online, left me very suspicious lmao\n\nI send my husband to ask for the ingredients to make sure they’re “allergy safe.” Please imagine my surprise when he sends me a photo of a tub of premade, store bought macaroni salad.

What are other items I can make and bring to him? He’s not a picky eater, and I also like trying new recipes. So far I’ve done oatmeal chocolate chip cookies, cinnamon rolls, and those god dam blueberry muffins the mentioned ten times in the post LOL. He travels a lot for work (his job requires extensive driving throughout the day if he’s not at his desk), so items that would be easy to eat on the go are a plus. Thank you!",

I've had great chorizo when travelling and in restaurants, so wanted to have a go myself. I used a recipe from [daring gourmet .com] (not sponsored!)\n\nThe taste was actually pretty good! But rather than an oily meaty mess (in the best way possible) it was chorizo tasting dry/crumbly minced meat\n\nPossible things to consider\n- I didn't let the meat rest, I was hungry\n\n- I have no idea of the fat percentage was (it was just a \"minced pork\" pack) that I mixed the spices with\n\n- I cooked it in bacon grease (because it was there)\n\n- the texture of the meat was actually pretty good - not a chewing cardboard dry, just not a swimming in oil moistness I had hoped for\n\nAny tips for future attempts would be appreciated :)",

We have most of the spices weve seen in recipes online, except for pul biber.

Your favorites, the easiest, the most surprising, I'm interested in them all! I love eggplants and zucchini so will be doing lots of recipes with them, open to recipes from all cuisines too, no preferences at all there.\n\nWhat tools should I get to help make better/easier/more fun recipes? The place I bought has quite literally a single metal spatula and that's it so I'm starting from scratch here, happy to pick up whatever will work along the way. Do I get a cast iron griddle? Are grill baskets a gimmick or worth it? I'm pretty sure I will benefit from a carry system since my kitchen space is small, any brand or recommendations?\n\nAny grilling tips you are willing to share with me? I'm not a complete newbie to grilling but it's not really how I usually cook so I'm definitely low level here. \n\nI'm looking to settle here for a bit and possibly semi permanently, so I'm very willing to invest in improving my ability to cook and enjoy life here. \n\nThanks in advance!!  \n\nEdit - also please humor how basic this question is, I just spent my last three months in a place with nothing but a microwave so I'm extremely excited for literally anything that isn't rotisserie chicken and uncle bens",

I think she currently lives in Canada but her family still lives in Bangkok and she often travels back -to give a tour of her family garden, tour her family kitchen, attend a food convention, tour restaurants, etc..\n2. Even though she is steeped in Thai culture, she has lived in the west for a long time, so she is as fluent in English as I am and she knows what is available in western grocery stores. \n3. She graduated from culinary School in the west, so she is knowledgeable and can talk about the science of cooking. She discusses things like fat emulsification. She knows how western kitchens work, has worked in them for a long time and will either have workarounds for unavailable Thai ingredients & techniques or she will warn you off items that are better left untried until you can get to Thailand. \n\nFor me, these three things really make it easier for me to get excited about cooking Thai food and to get a better grasp of what to do and how to do it. \n\nWhat are your Youtube channels for cuisines from other cultures?\n\nEdit: Thank you everyone.

When traveling in Europe, I fall in love with being able to buy chocolate treats without that hint of tangy vomit that I get here in the US. Even Cadbury made in the US has it, as do some Godiva I've purchased. I've learned that reading labels isn't effective because the flavor is a result of a process, not really an additive, so not listed in the ingredients. MY QUESTION is - do you know of a brand or style of chocolate that is widely/reliably available in the US that doesn't have this note of butyric flavor? Or a way to order a brand of chocolate from Europe that is not the american style? Thanks in advance for any tips.",

      "title": "How to be a chef",
      "text": "Hey, I'm 18 years old and currently graduating from the \"gymnasium\" (german aquivalent to HS). After my graduation I'll travel vor a year in Asia and Australia. \nThe thing is: I'm unsure about what to do afterwards.I cook at home since I'm 13 and I also try to cook on a higher level(trying out some french cuisine). \nOn one side my plan was to go to university and get a bachelor degree in economics. After or before this I wanted to at least get a cooking education. I kind of want to pursue my dream of being a chef, while having the safety of a bachelor. \nOn the other hand I thought about just sticking to the cooking idea. I looked at Cordon bleu but read its overrated and even though my family is living comfortable 30k dollars are still A LOT of money. Altough my father saved up money for university. But the thing I loved about cordon bleu is the aspect of studying abroad(Bangkok, Sydney would be the shit). I know I should work a few months at least in a Kitchen before this.\n\nSo my questions are the following:\n\n-Is it possible to get a bachelor and still pursue being a chef?\n\n-If yes, then in which order?\n\nShould I go to a culinary school?\n\n- Is there a better way to climb up the career ladder?\n-If there is, can I also do it abroad?\n\n-How long could it take until I really get to cook(in at least medium good kitchens)?\n\nOf course the end goal would be to get to cook in fine dining restaurants (at least for a short period) to inspire and impress people by the food I made. To create complex dishes that could get through as art (I do not want to sound edgy or corny). Whats the chance of reaching this If I gave it my all?\nWould I have better chances at this through culinary school? \n\nI would appreciate it if you can help me out!\nThanks:)",

They have been in the refrigerator for 2 days. Just now when I opened the clear plastic bag, I immediately smelled kind of a pungy smell. Upon inspection, one of the packages of the chicken had a lot of liquid and that package was the one that smelled off. The other package was fine - no excess liquid and no smell. I decided not to use the smelly package of chicken. It did not appear that the smelly package of chicken leaked, but somehow the smell still got out. \n\nMy question is: Even though the package with the bad chicken was not leaking, is there a risk that the other package with the non-smelly chicken got contaminated since somehow the bad smell still managed to escape?

      "title": "Weekend of food... for 25 people! (Advice needed)",
      "text": "Hello all! Essay incoming; tl;dr at end.\n\n\nI am in the early stages of planning the biggest event I've ever hosted, a 25-person weekend-long party for the 4th of July. This is also a housewarming party, and my co-host and I are absolutely on a budget- we're trying to do this as cost-efficiently as possible while also being good hosts. We've had 10-person overnight events in the past with great success, but I'm nervous about scaling everything up to such a degree, so I'd like your input on what does/doesn't make sense to prepare (I'd like to make a rough budget before even sending out the invites). This is a 3-day 2-night event, planning to go from abt 1pm Friday till noon Sunday.\n\nSo far I've learned that we can expect each person to eat about 1/4lb of meat, and about 8oz of sides per meal. The meat is easy enough to scale up- we're planning on hotdogs and burgers for night one. Rounding up, we may need about 6.5lbs of meat, split between burgers and dogs. Sides are a little more up in the air depending on what's cost effective, but im leaning towards a chickpea salad and grilled corn on the cob (subject to change depending on the cost of corn for that amount of people). For dessert, 25-person's-worth of smores (haven't done the math yet on what all I'll need.. I imagine each person may have 2 smores?).\n\nDay 2, we'll start with breakfast casserole. My co-host makes a great French toast casserole, with French bread and an egg base. I have no idea how many casseroles we will need to prep... any input would be appreciated! Throughout the day, we're planning on people mostly grazing on snacks- going to ask people to bring assorted chips/fruit if they'd like. For dinner, a taco bar where we bulk-cook the ground meat ahead of time and heat it up for serving. Would the same proportions, 1/4lb of meat per person, still hold true here? I plan to sub out some of the meat (maybe 10%) for a vegetarian option- either lentils or marinated mushrooms. For sides, I was thinking grilled veggies and pasta salad- if the 8oz per person for sides holds true, this is about 10lbs of sides. I'm thinking 4lbs for the grilled veggies (any cheap reccomendations would be welcome!), 6 pounds for the pasta salad (would it be unreasonable to use gluten-free pasta? We have one guest with Celiac's). For dessert, more smores! I will, again, need to figure out how to scale this. \n\nNext morning, going to keep it simple- the current idea is a bagel + cream cheese bar (I'll need to look into GF options for the Celiac's guest), would this be cost effective for 25 people? We're obviously not going to be able to toast them in a timely manner with the toaster, but my co-host was thinking of doing it in bulk either in the oven or on the grill. Hoping that we can get bagels and cream cheese in bulk from Costco, then maybe figure out some cheap toppings (I'd love to do avocado slices, but its probably not cost effective and would be difficult to prep ahead of time).\n\nIf anyone's wondering why we don't just host a potluck- my co-host has a severe nut allergy, one more guest has a nut allergy, another guest has Celiac's disease (gluten allergy), one guest is vegetarian, another has a strawberry allergy, two are lactose intolerant... we have a lot of needs to cater to, and I'd like to be able to confidently tell people which foods are and are not safe for them. Also, guests will be traveling anywhere between 2 and 8 hours to get here, I don't want them to be stressed about the logistics of transporting food. We're tossing around the idea of providing everything- all the meals, plus drinks (which will probably be a separate post in another sub... thinking about a keg!)- and asking guests to each pitch in some small amount of money for the weekend, $10-$15, to help offset costs (we plan to take a loss, but hopefully no more than $200 on food).\n\nWith all this, am I on the right track? Is there anything big that I haven't considered? Are there cheaper ways to do this? At the very least, its been helpful to actually write all of this out. Thank you!\n\n\nTl;dr: I am cooking 2 dinners and 2 breakfasts for 25 people, and I have ideas but I want to keep it as CHEAP as possible, while still being a good host. Help?!?",

Problem is that I live a 1.5 hour drive from him, and while I'm pretty good at baking bread, I'm really bad at transporting it! In the past, I've made fresh bread and brought it to parties and it never manages to keep the perfect crust on the way there. I've tried packing them in Tupperware, putting them them in a paper bag and/or a tea towel, or wrapped in paper towels and foil (all after they've completely cooled) but the crust always ends up more chewy than crusty by the time i get there.\n\nI did consider just making them from scratch at his house, but with the kneading and rising time and all, it would be too much to keep track of with a party going on. Plus, i don't want to take over their kitchen and make more dishes to do than necessary.\n\nThe breadstick recipe says you can \"refresh\" them by popping them in the oven again for 5 minutes at 425 and brushing with garlic butter, which i plan on doing once i get to his house, but does anyone have recommendations for a way to get the pre-baked breadsticks to arrive there in the best possible state?? \n\nI'm open to baking them way early, even the day before, so they have a chance to get cold before transport, or right up until i have to leave, so they're still warm, and i have all manner of containers/materials to pack them in, airtight and not, i just don't know what the magic combo is to keep their deliciousness/texture intact during travel.\n\nFellow bread bakers/lovers, I need your expertise!",

Why didn't it taste terrible? \n\nEdit: wow thanks everyone, I think I'll be adding some notes to my recipe! 1 teaspoon of each of these spices does seem way too little for a huge pot of chilli!\n\nEdit #2: so my chilli is 2 days old now and it is absolutely the best I've made. When I've made this recipe before, I didn't really view it as chilli, just a good ol' bowl of beans, meat and veg because it didn't really taste like chilli (I know...now I get why lol). I saw this as just a cheap, quick and easy dish that didnt require as much love as my usual chilli recipe.\n\nI won't out the poor internationally famous chef who wrote this recipe. To his credit, the recipe is definitely made for a certain audience lol. I'm usually pretty loose with my measurements but I really did think adding that much more of spices would make a noticeably bad difference. Turns out.....I've seen the light.",

Neither of us can stand the smell of this food. Also I’m not judging I’m just curious.\n\nOur downstairs neighbours have a little barbecue under our deck and occasionally they grill some kind of food that smells extremely pungent. When they first cooked it we didn’t even realize it was food and thought it was a bunny hutch that hadn’t been cleaned in at least a year. \n\nThey don’t cook it often so it’s not a big deal but I’m SO curious what it is. I would ask but a) I don’t want to be intrusive or offend them by asking ‘hey what is it you’re barbecuing that stinks so bad?’ and b) I can’t even handle having a window open in my house when they barbecue it, let alone actually going down to talk to them while they’re cooking it. \n\nAnd no it’s not curry btw, I love the smell of curry. It’s definitely some kind of meat/fish or maybe a tofu/seitan? Our best guess is something fermented. Very curious if anyone has any ideas on what it could be/knows any notoriously smelly foods.",

I've never had this issue with any other food but Indian food. \n\nNote - I am making vegetarian chickpea curry type stuff so no meat. Could it be that I need more fat in it to absorb the flavors? If so what fat can I use or what can I substitute.\n\nto be clear the recipe I am usually going with is - coconut milk, rice, chickpeas, tomato and spices. It looks perfect, just like the recipe but none of spices end up in the flavor despite making my house smell amazing for hours.\n\n***EDIT***:thank you guys so much for the informative and prompt responses, it seems to be that it was cooked for less than 30 minutes so that's probably the biggest issue. \n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nI actually made this post on behalf of my mom. I thought she was simmering for at least an hour but apparently the recipe she was using said to do it for just 10 minutes?? She did it for 20 minutes but, yeah, pretty sure just letting it simmer for much, much longer will drastically improve the flavor. Along with making sure to bloom the spices properly.\n\nEDIT2: wow, thank you all for the wonderful advice. I'm sure I will use all of your information in the future!",

      "text": "I am in for the wonderful, miraculous treat of trying almonds for the first time in my life (safely, in a doctor's office after much negative allergy testing). I want to hear all your favorite almond recipes! Pastry, pie, savory. Anything! I love to cook and bake and am highly motivated here. I'm currently most excited for an almond croissant from our local French-owned pastry shop, but I'm working on a running list and genuinely want to try it all! \n\n\nEdit: I just wanted to sincerely thank you all for these thoughtful and delicious suggestions! I got so many more than I expected, and am saving all of these to use over the coming weeks. I have a very long, arduous history with multiple food allergies (some anaphylactic, some oral allergy syndrome, some EoE-mediated). Last year, I reintroduced dairy successfully for the first time in 15 years thanks to a new biologic med and it has changed my life--my first taste was brie, and it did make me cry. \n\nThe almond introduction is one of a long line of new food introductions that we have great, consistent evidence for trialing--including all other tree nuts and all seafood. I am incredibly grateful for this opportunity and will certainly be making the most of the coming year. Can't wait to update everyone in April after my in-clinic almond trial! \n\nI responded to a couple questions in the thread about outgrowing and sorting out nut allergies, but my suggestion to those of you in a similar boat is to find an allergist affiliated with a research university or hospital. It's an exciting time for food allergies as they now have component IgE testing that can help tell you a lot about why you're allergic to an allergen (such as food-pollen syndrome and birch pollen allergies). Xolair is also now FDA approved to increase tolerance to allergens, which can help with tolerance to cross-contamination, should you be allergic to only a few nuts and have concerns about risking others. Plus, for kiddos there's OIT!",

Lovely flavour but something about the texture of fudge makes my teeth feel weird)\n\n\\-Vegemite sandwiches with white untoasted bread.

Oh dear.\n\n\\-And finally, I took \"fesenjoon\", the famous Persian pomegranate-walnut stew, served with saffron rice, which I humbly consider was the the star of the show.

      "text": "When you've waited too long to get more groceries and don't have much left, what are things you throw together with staples from your fridge or pantry?\n\nFor me, it's usually a breakfast burrito (tortilla, egg, cheese, salsa) or pasta with olive oil and garlic.  Curious for more ideas since it happens more than I'd like.\n\n\\---  \neta: After a couple months, the things that have actually stuck for me are keeping canned tuna and various kinds of canned beans in the pantry.  I don't like mayo so hadn't eaten canned tuna in forever, but making it with a normal salad dressing (olive oil, vinegar, mustard) instead of the typical tuna salad preparation makes it work for me. I put it over rice when I have it on hand, and add any raw vegetables like cucumbers or peppers if I have any.  For the canned beans, I literally just warm them up on the stove with whatever basic spices I feel like at the moment.  I also started using this site called meals hero that is helping me stay on top of ordering groceries and have ended up in this situation less often",

      "text": "Every time I look at food online for anything, I feel like people on the internet are overly zealous about food safety. Like, cooking something properly is important, but probing something with a food thermometer every 2 minutes and refusing to eat it until it's well above the recommended temperature is just going to make your meal dry and tough.\n\nYou aren't going to die if you reheat leftovers that have been around for more than 2 hours, and you don't need to dissect every piece of chicken out of fear of salmonella. \nLike, as long as it gets hot, and stays hot for a good few minutes, more than likely you will be fine. But the amount of people who like, refuse to eat anything they haven't personally monitored and scrutinized is insane. The recommended temperature/time for anything is designed so that ANYONE can eat it and 100% be fine, if you have a functioning immune system and aren't 90 years old you will be totally fine with something well below that.\n\nApart from fish, don't fuck with fish (although mostly if it's wild caught, farmed fish SHOULDN'T have anything in them)\n\nAnyway, I guess my point is that being terrified of food isn't going to make your cooking experience enjoyable, and your food any good.\n\nSo uh, feel free to tell me how wrong I am in the comments \n\nEDIT: wow so many people\n\nReading back my post made me realise how poorly it's put together so uh, here's some clarification on a few things.\n\n1 - I am not anti-food thermometer, I think they can be very useful, and I own one, my point was more about obsessively checking the temperature of something, which is what I see online a fair amount.\n\n2 - when I say reheat leftovers, I'm talking about things that have been left out on the counter, that should have been more clear. Things left in the fridge for more than like, 4 days won't kill you either (although around that point definitely throw away if it starts smelling or looking off at all)\n\n3 - I'm not anti-food safety, please make sure you're safe when cooking, and by that I mean like, washing your hands after you cut the chicken, and keep your workspace clean as you go along etc\n\nAnyway that's what I got for those three things so uh, yeah",

Out of embarrassment, I deleted the post. [Edit: I’m not asking why I was downvoted, nor am I even complaining about it, I’m just giving context to this post.]\n\nI genuinely like cooking, and being married to someone from a different culture, I also like discovering new dishes from different cultures; it’s interesting how every culture has different staple flavours. Which is why I still stand by my point: different dishes require different flavours.\n\nI don’t see the point of dipping everything in the same hot sauce, or making everything with the same ten seasonings from your personal pantry. While I understand if someone genuinely likes their favourite flavours so much they want it in everything, I don’t understand being condescending to someone who doesn’t do it like that and calling their food inherently bland. “Simple” doesn’t necessarily mean bland, either — at least not to me.\n\nI thought maybe in a community all about cooking, there would be more nuanced opinions, so I decided to post here.",

      "text": "I 35 (F) am married to a 36 (m) Chinese husband for almost 10 years. Recently my in laws have been living with us until they get their green card (it’s been 6 months). Anyway, my in laws have been cooking with moldy food.\nLike they don’t throw out anything. If i throw something out they will dig it out if the trash & tell me it’s perfectly fine. Then they tell my husband I’m wasting perfectly good food. Perfectly good food???!!! White spores, green fuzz and black mold. I have a food handlers card, I know what is and isn’t okay in the kitchen. She doesn’t even defrost food correctly & leaves prepared meat on the counter for hours longer than you are allowed in a restaurant. \n\nI have been experiencing food poisoning & constipation (which added some stress on certain muscles that were weak from having  several kids. That I need surgery for. I’m not saying that her cooking alone did it but added to an existing issue. Even my doctor says constant constipation makes it worse). I would try to cook (and take over the kitchen) to diversify what we were eating and make sure the food I was eating wasn’t moldy but she would then have her feelings hurt. I love her cooking….just not when there isn’t mold in the food. \n\nTo give you an idea of how bad it is. We made Jack-o-laterns for Halloween. They have been sitting outside in the elements for weeks. We even cut some fresh ones a few days before Halloween. They were all covered in mold: blue, red, black, and green. The day after Halloween she brings them inside, scoops out the mold, cuts it up, & wanted us to eat it. \n\nI can’t be crazy in thinking that if we ate that, we would end up in hospital, right?!?! \n\nI told her that I would take care of it…. 🚮 \n\nMy husband thinks I’m crazy and says I need to just check the food better (I do), talk to them more (I did it’s like talking to a wall), hide it in the trash better (I tried), and help in the kitchen (mil wants me to focus on LO & insists she doesn’t need help). \n\nI have surgery, so I won’t be able to go to the kitchen and check. And she will be cooking. I’m wondering if anyone has any resources that would be helpful for her & my husband to understand food safety & recognize signs of mold? Heck if someone just has a way to explain that she can digest moldy food better than me. Something please! \n\nEdit/Update: I showed my husband the post/comments and he told them that the doctor says that the food must be FRESH & high fiber. We picked up some fresh food & he will be keeping an eye. I will be having family come help. He is thinking about putting a mini fridge in the room. Thank you!",

      "text": "The first time I truly fucked up in a kitchen – I mean really, monumentally screwed the pooch – I was working garde manger at a pretentious French joint. Some smug bastard ordered the house pâté, and I, in my infinite wisdom, grabbed what I thought was the terrine from the walk-in. Turned out to be yesterday's meatloaf. I plated it anyway, garnished it with cornichons and whole-grain mustard like it was some treasured family recipe passed down from the courts of Louis XIV.\n\nThe customer, naturally, was a food blogger.\n\nThat night marked the beginning of my long, inglorious history of kitchen catastrophes. There was the time I cremated thirty pounds of veal bones, filling the kitchen with thick, acrid smoke and forcing an evacuation of the dining room mid-service. The sauce station smelled like a burning tire factory for weeks. Or the infamous New Year's Eve when I dropped an entire hotel pan of demi-glace on the floor ten minutes before service. The sound of twelve quarts of reduced veal stock splattering across tiles still haunts my dreams.\n\nBut my personal favorite remains the night I tried to impress a date by making soufflés. The recipe called for egg whites beaten to stiff peaks. What I created instead looked like a crime scene in a French bakery – deflated, burnt around the edges, and somehow both undercooked and overcooked simultaneously. We ordered pizza.\n\nThese catastrophes taught me more than any culinary school ever could. They're battle scars, proof that you've been in the trenches. Because here's the truth about cooking: sometimes you have to burn the shit out of something to learn how not to burn the shit out of something.\n\nOk, your turn.",

      "text": "Hello this is my first post and I wanted to share something special for me, I found my grandmother’s old recipe book tucked away in a box. On the very first page was a chicken stew recipe I’d heard my mom talk about many times. She always said how much she loved it growing up, and how my grandma used to make it all the time. So I thought, what better way to surprise her?\n\nThe recipe called for a lot of garlic way more than I was used to and at first I wasn’t sure if it was a mistake. But I didn’t want to change anything. I followed it exactly, down to the instruction that said not to add salt until the chicken fat began to rise and impurities could be skimmed off. It felt like I was learning more than just a recipe and more like how my grandma used to cook.\n\nWhen I served it, my mom didn’t know I had followed that specific recipe. But as soon as she smelled it, she froze. She looked at me, confused, then smiled softly. I watched as her eyes welled up with tears. She didn’t even need to say anything, I knew that smell had brought her back.\n\nI broke down too, not gonna lie. It was one of those rare moments where food becomes something so much more than food.❤️\n\nAnyway, I just wanted to share this moment with you all. It reminded me why I love cooking, and how powerful a recipe can be. Can’t wait to hear your experiences 🫶",

      "text": "I've never been to a 3 Michelin Stars restaurants. Only once I've been to a 1 Michelin star French restaurant. The weird thing was I've been to that restaurant before it was awarded the Michelin star. The food and service then was very good, the Wagyu Beef was probably the top 2 best testing beef I've ever tried literally melts in your mouth, the other being in a Japanese restaurant (no stars) but had the beef cooked over charcoal and a leaf and miso sauce. Food presentation at the French restaurant was exceptional.\n\nAfter a few years I heard that restaurant was awarded a Michelin Star and decided to go back again. This time, they changed their menu from beef to duck. Food still looks pretty and service was alright but the flavor lacked an oomph. My family also all agreed it wasn't as memorable. So it's really weird, food was better when it didn't have a Michelin Star. Which also got me to think it's the food at a 3 Stars restaurant really be the best thing you have ever tried (I have no doubt presentation and service will be exceptional) but will it really be without a shadow of a doubt be the best thing you ate over a 1 star or even no stars?\n\nI believe many food are better purely taste wise than Michelin stars. Although a Michelin restaurant (esp 3 stars) is going to have impeccable service and presentation.\n\nAgain like I said the best beef I ate were both the French (before it had the star) and Japanese restaurant. The best fish I ate was in Vietnam just by a roadside stall I kid you not, it was the freshest (prob just caught off seaside) and tastiest fish I ever ate.",

I plan to stain them black and seal them, I do not use the counter as a cutting board but food will touch it, especially since the bar part doubles as where the kids eat. What kind of sealant can I use? I had bought polyurethane only to find out it's not food safe so I didn't proceed with the Project. \n\nI also need to know how to address the mold before sealing. Any help would be GREATLY appreciated. And before it's asked, I can not afford to replace it and am already posting someone to fix my cabinets and drawers with it's already going to be a lot for me. \nI didn't want butcher block but that's what the home had so I need a solution.",

We have an exterior window in the bathroom with a single ceiling light but no exhaust or fan of any kind. We have two dogs who we have to shut the bathroom door for when we leave, or else they like to eat the toilet paper. When we shower and close the door before leaving the house, we have no way of moving air in the bathroom to help mitigate the steam and moisture we created. \n\nObviously lifestyle changes and better dog training are options, but we want to install something low effort to help move air in the bathroom while we're gone. \n\nI've seen small ceiling light fixtures [Like this one from HD](https://www.homedepot.com/p/ANTOINE-16-in-Indoor-Smoky-Gray-Low-Profile-Ceiling-Fan-with-Dimmable-LED-Light-Flush-Mount-Bedroom-Ceiling-Fan-with-Remote-HD-FSD-15/321448024?source=shoppingads&locale=en-US) that have integrated fans and lights, but can't find one that's wet or damp rated. Would installing one of these lead to short term problems, or would we only need to worry about the longevity of the fixture itself in this environment? If it's flush mounted, do we still need to be concerned about moisture seeping into the ceiling? \n\nWe're trying to avoid having to cut up the ceiling and exterior wall to install an appropriate exhaust fan. \n\nAny insights would be helpful, thanks!",

And I can take instruction well, provided it’s clear. But I’m not naturally a handyman. For example: My instant hot spout started leaking, so I just unplugged it and will call my plumber.\n\nI do have an electrician, so I’m not shit out of luck. But I’ve been flirting with this DIY lifestyle a bit and am wondering how hard it is to change a light fixture by yourself? I have one chandelier, two bathroom vanity lights and two pendants. And a few more I’ll eventually be replacing.\n\nThey don’t come with instructions - which feels like an omen, but I do tend to read in to things. Is it worth it to try replacing them by myself? Any recommendations if you think it’s doable? Am I being dramatic and it’s super easy? Best platforms for instructions?\n\nAgain, new to this. Thank you in advance for any perspective.",

      "text": "I’ve noticed a common thing while watching travel videos — to get those “walking past the camera” shots, people have to place their camera somewhere, pretend or act for the shot, and then run back to grab it.\n\nIt works, but it takes away from actually enjoying the moment. Instead of feeling the beauty of the place, you end up staging and repeating takes.\n\nSo I’m thinking… what if there was a **self-returning camera/phone holder**?  \nSomething that could:\n\n* Stay in position to record\n* Automatically return to the owner after the shot\n* Move on wheels or fly back like a mini-drone\n* Use collision detection so it doesn’t hit obstacles\n* Be compact enough to carry in a backpack\n\nThe idea is to make capturing memories effortless, without breaking the flow of the experience.\n\nI’m curious what the DIY community thinks.\n\nThanks for reading.",

      "text": "Had a tenant move out recently. She took everything, sure, but left behind mold all over the bathroom ceiling, in the living room, and in a bedroom. Down the hallway, the walls looked like someone had just showered, with moisture streaks running top to bottom. Every window had mold just on the vinyl parts. She told me she cleaned the place. It didn’t look dirty, but when you walked in, it smelled awful. Like bad hair or body odor, but really distinct and hard to describe.\n\nSo I got on Amazon and found a gallon of 99% pure vinegar that was advertised to kill mold. I figured it had to be strong stuff, because when it showed up it had chemical warning labels all over the box and came sealed in a thick plastic bag.\n\nI wore a sweatshirt, pants, glasses, and an N95 mask. I poured it straight into a pump spray bottle, undiluted. That was mistake number one. Then I made the rookie mold remediation mistake of not opening a single window first.\n\nI started spraying the kitchen, windows, and bathroom. In the bathroom, the vinegar mist came back down and hit my face. It burned like hell. Went straight through the N95, into my eyes even with glasses on. I dropped everything and ran to the kitchen sink. Of course, the water was turned off to the house. Luckily, there was still some pressure in the lines and I was able to wash off the burning spots. I didn’t end up with any burns, but it was close.\n\nI was too stubborn to stop, so I turned the water on to the house and diluted the vinegar before going back in. This time I opened windows and pulled my sweatshirt up over my mouth to breathe. Even then, the vapors were rough. The smell traveled a block. Neighbors said they could smell it down the street.\n\nEvery insect in the house freaked out. They all rushed out of cracks and toward the windows. The screens kept them in, and they just dropped dead. It was like watching chemical warfare in real time.\n\nA few days later, the house didn’t smell like anything. All the moisture streaks wiped away. I even sprayed it on weeds growing up through cracks in the concrete driveway and they were completely dead the next day. In a couple spots, some paint peeled right off the walls.\n\nThe mold stains didn’t fully wipe away, but I’m hoping anything alive got nuked. Still can’t believe this stuff is just sitting for sale on Amazon.",

I owned two dogs who would pee in our kitchen throughout the night and over time, the urine has traveled down the tile grout line and to my particle board cabinetry. I opened up the cabinet from the oven space today to see if maybe, most of the urine had pooled/dried under the cabinet itself, but it looks to be absorbed by the particle board. \n\nThere is an odor, though not as bad with a deep cleaning now. However, this needs to be addressed as I prepare to sell the house. Any tips on how I could repair/ rectify the smell without shelling out for new cabinets? I’m not in a financial position to purchase all new cabinets, therefore if an allowance in the sale price is the best move, I’m open to that. \n\nJust throwing this into the void to see if anyone has had a similar problem. I could really slap 23 year old me right about now",

I saw register fans but I’m talking about feeding air into the AC, not dispersing the already conditioned air. \n\nI have a blueprint for a closet and upstairs wet bar remodel and it needs another 20 inches to really look good but the only place to get the space is out of the air return, which seems quite large. \n\nI was thinking there should be a way to rig the fans to come on when the thermostat clicks the ac on. Then they would work essentially like a turbocharger and push the same amount of air through the return as was going through before the space was reduced. \n\nIt seems like a cool idea- I’d love to tinker with it but I don’t know if it’s something that would be dead on arrival. \n\nAny thoughts? If I measured air flow and installed fans that resulted in the same airflow I don’t see why it wouldn’t work.",

      "text": "Hey all, I’m stumped and could really use some guidance. My home was built in 1904, and the master bathroom wall (original to the house) has moisture behind it — but I can’t figure out why.\n\nHere’s what I’ve discovered so far: • I first noticed it when I took off the light switch cover and saw condensation on the back of it.\n\n• I cut out a section of drywall below the junction box and found water droplets on the bottom of the box.\n\n• The wall is uninsulated — just wood planking on one side and drywall on the other.\n\n• The wood planking is damp to the touch from the middle down, but not toward the attic.\n\n• No plumbing runs above this wall. All water lines are under the floors via the crawl space. \n\n• Sink and shower are on the opposite wall — not on this one.\n\nWhat I’ve checked:\n\n• Thought it was a roof leak at first, but multiple attic inspections (even during heavy rain) show zero signs of water above the wall cavity. \n• No plumbing in or above the wall.\n• Bought a thermal imaging gun and found cold air leaking from an A/C register on the backside (bedroom side) into the wall cavity.\n\nMy theory:\n\nCold A/C air from the register is making its way into the bottom of the wall cavity, meeting the hot humid air from the attic/inside the wall, and causing condensation — especially on metal like the junction box.\n\nSteps I’ve already taken:\n\n• Sealed the gaps between the A/C register and flooring to stop cold air from traveling underneath. \n• Added R2 foam board insulation between the joists in the crawl space, on top of the existing R15 insulation.\n\nWhat I need help with:\n\n• How can I stop this condensation problem without hiring a moisture/leak specialist (not in the budget right now)? • Should I be adding insulation directly into the wall cavity? • Could there be another hidden cause I’m missing?\n\nAny insight from folks who’ve dealt with old uninsulated walls and HVAC-related condensation would be amazing. Thanks in advance!",

I’m trying to price and is it really around ~$100 per shelf (at least 21” maybe 24”)? And where is best place to purchase? Thanks for your help!",

I’ve already:\n\n* Cut out the damaged drywall and dried everything out, replaced it with greenboard, mold-resistant mud and paint.\n* Completely regrouted all lower shower tile joints, everything from the waist down was completely gutted and redone. \n* Removed all old silicone/caulk, reapplied kitchen & bath silicone everywhere (frame, curb, seams).\n* There is no plumbing on this wall (pipes are on the other side of the shower).\n* Not condensation—active leak only when shower is used. If we don't use the shower for a while it dries up. \n* The wall here is a pocket door cavity; so I can’t access anything from the other side. When I open up the damaged spot, I can see some of the inside of the cavity but not much else. I was able to see enough to tell that there was no moisture anywhere else within the cavity. \n\nThis leak keeps returning in same spot. Could this be a failed shower pan, curb, or something else? What’s my next step if I can’t open the back wall? At a loss here.",

Also will be my household stuff in boxes that I don't need to take with me on the road.\n\nSo my thoughts are like this the tools are already on the side of the garage that's away from the garage to house entry door so could I just build a wall between the 2 garages then rent my house as a 2 car garage.\n\nTo build a wall I'm thinking grab some 2x4's one to the ceiling and one to the floor and do the standard 16\" center 2x4 studs all the way across and use sheetrock to cover the one side that will be visible from the renter side.\n\nI'm in NV the main breaker box is outside so it would still be accessible as would all water, lawn sprinkler, and gas stuff. Does anyone know of either a better way or idea to manage all my tools and personal stuff?\n\nAlso selling isn't an option I'm still in the first few years of the mortgage so I'd lose money if I sold.

The core problem seems to be that one of the junction boxes contains 3 black and 1 red wire. On the original switch the hot had two of the black wires connected to it via a black screw, and having disconnected them, it appears only 1 is \"hot.\" The remaining black and red wires were connected at opposite-sided traveller screws. My issue is that my new three-way switch has two traveler screws and then a single black wire labelled \"live.\" It also had a ground and neutral, but I know what to do with those.  Within the junction box itself, one of the red and blacks are coming from the same channel (which I believe are the \"true\" traveller wires).  What I need help understanding is what configuration am I supposed to \"connect\" them with.  So far anything has yielded the Kasa switch blinking green then a click followed by flat red light on the switch itself indicating some kind of failure.  \n\n  \norginal left side\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/2y0pp5eh8hff1.jpg?width=1080&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=03d7d461bd94c62dcbb1d29da91c0514578bd99e\n\noriginal right side\n\n[New \\(screw side\\)](https://preview.redd.it/fft5ux1g8hff1.jpg?width=1080&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=af9e5204d7cc1ef6360dc458da6a6230efe87b2d)\n\n[new black side with labels](https://preview.redd.it/ms1xb9ri8hff1.jpg?width=1080&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=14b3b211dae087d9bd09ca7cc90457f70330ea1a)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/gw0ks23l8hff1.jpg?width=1080&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=53a023ce9f9844500c5a50b0d23dcbeedd92d4a1\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/y4m1jeem8hff1.jpg?width=1080&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=8ea225bc777edba42516a25f98a8437cf5e8ba5a",

Now the clutch lever is incredibly tight and I can’t move it to engage the deck. Any thoughts on what I did wrong here? \n\n Not a ton of info available online, but I am assuming I overtightened the idler pulley arm. How much travel should there be? I'm assuming some but when I disassembled it, it was locked down tight. Probably why the arm broke in the first place. Also worth noting this tractor was purchased used.",

      "title": "Floor Prep - Bathroom Reno (please help)",
      "text": "I've seen so much conflicting information out there so hoping to consolidate everything here. I've got a few questions related to preparing my floor for an ongoing bathroom reno. Will try to keep concise and itemized to the few questions. If anyone were able to read just one of the questions and reply it would be appreciated. I decided on this approach rather than spamming the subreddit with multiple similar-ish posts\n\n**Background**:\n\nOngoing demo. This is a second floor bath above a finished dining room (at all costs would rather avoid accessing from below). Existing subfloor is 3/4\" OSB(? could be ply for all I honestly know?). Took off top layer of 1/8\" ply that was definitely rotted (not shown). The existing sub shows some old signs of water damage around the tub and toilet area. Still quite firm. Am undecided between treating with some bleach to kill anything there and leave it as is, or rip out (more details later). Bath is a small kids bath (50 square ft)\n\nMy floor joists are a solid 2x10's at 14\" on center spans (not standard 16 which is nice). Currently the floor has no deflection (play?) when walking or jumping on it. It does however have an issue with level. What I assume is one proud joist through the middle of the floor (or the house settling from framed walls) has caused a peak in the middle of the floor with just a hair over a 1/4\" dip to each side (span of just over 3 feet from high to low peaks. It isn't super noticeable, only from using a 6' level and drill bits have I been able to find this.\n\nFloor tiles to be laid are larger format 12\"x24\" tiles. Original plan was Ditra decoupling membrane.\n\n**Q1: Remove Subfloor**? - As mentioned previously I was on the fence about replacing the subfloor around the toilet and shower. Due to a slightly wider tub I need to re-do the tub drain and p-trap to gain an inch away from the wall. At first I thought this was the final straw to push me to remove the blackened OSB, enjoy the extra space for plumbing, and replace with new stuff. However, the sub continues below the floor plate of the side wall. Furthermore, the last floor joist I have is just under 4\" away from the wall. I could cut the OSB along the plate, but this would result in some overhang (and possible deflection). Furthermore the greywater plumbing travels in this joist space right along the side wall, so I could not simply sister the joist. I COULD stick a 2x4 or something in there horizontally (4\" side flush to the floor), and secure it at a 90 to the joist by screwing through the joist. It wouldn't be super strong as it is clearly weak to any torque force, but possibly enough to simply provide a little extra support to avoid deflection? Maybe subfloor needs to be thicker anyways and this 4\" overhang is nothing.\n\n**Q2: Level?** \\- Previous jobs were for LVP where I'm looking for a tolerance of 1/8\". Is 1/4\" something I can either just work with, or try to at least reduce with a little extra mortar in the affected dips? Should I be using self leveler as first step floor prep (have experience with this and aware of the steps). Yes I realize best practice is probably shave that joist down but I'm apprehensive about this as a diy'er. If I did do self leveler, I'm unsure how this affects Q1 re: subfloor required thickness.\n\nPhoto's added for context. Hopefully this wasn't too much of a wall of text. For all those who managed to read through it all and especially those who reply, I thank you so much in advance.\n\nedit: adjusted some room measurements\n\n[Basic layoud](https://preview.redd.it/7xjdo9neenpe1.jpg?width=4032&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=766bb8cd55b168d857aac3a7054169be0219037b)\n\n[Wood rot?](https://preview.redd.it/sng3faneenpe1.jpg?width=3024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=128d8c049b9b923666f9240ddd190ab95eae5ca0)\n\n[3 1\\/4\\\\\" run to wall overhang?](https://preview.redd.it/ezxxseneenpe1.jpg?width=3024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1ed0443fd6f647e9644aebba6b2a537e30f0beeb)\n\n[1\\/4\\\\\" dip in level](https://preview.redd.it/i4tn6nneenpe1.jpg?width=4032&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=44d689cb3fb36bae8a802fe5233b43da452fba45)",

      "text": "I created an automatic system to inject a water and vinegar solution into the HVAC drain line on a regular schedule, amounting to about 1 cup per month (currently it runs on a weekly schedule adding about a quarter-cup each week).  The pump is a mini 12v pump pulling from a container that has a couple of gallons of solution in it.  The container's lid has a small hole in it to prevent a vacuum (and I keep the lid only on loosely as well).  The silicone tubing reaches close (but not completely) to the bottom of the container so as to not plug itself  while drawing solution.  The output goes into a hole in the cap for the HVAC drain line.  \n  \nI tested this many times and it works well.  Last week, I went in to watch it run on its schedule, and when the trigger time was reached, the pump turned on for the full 4 seconds it was scheduled for, but no solution was coming out of the output.  I manually turned it on several more times but it wouldn't move any water, even though the pump was on each time.  \n  \nI pulled the tubing out of the HVAC drain cap and put it into a small cup and ran the pump again.  This time it moved the solution into the cup.  I ran several more tests after replacing the tubing back into the HVAC drain cap, and it worked properly each time.  I ran it again 24 hours later and it worked fine that time as well.  \n  \nDid I experience an air lock that developed over the week while it was not running?   I did notice some air bubbles in the output tubing that seemed to travel up toward the pump if I tapped on the tubing.\n\nDoes this sound like an air lock situation or does anyone have any other ideas why this might occur?  I'll attach photos of the setup so you can see what it looks like.  Thanks! \n\n[Inside pump\\/controller box](https://preview.redd.it/22r0d96d4baf1.png?width=600&format=png&auto=webp&s=8dad14ec3bf6a8765fbc5e59e3ea6b9baee5b19b)\n\n[Entire setup including pump\\/controller, and solution containter](https://preview.redd.it/e73wq96d4baf1.jpg?width=600&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d4bc1e56e1d05d1f72cc96a6e3a7a488ff0d4de2)",

Basically trying to solve [this problem](https://www.reddit.com/r/desksetup/comments/wixe2x/best_way_to_wall_mount_monitors_with_a_height/) with a standing desk coupled with a wall mount. There are slightly similar workstation setups from Ergotron, but they're odd, expensive and seem to be designed for hospitals.\n\nThe core of my design is a carriage mounted on linear rails (going to use reinforced ones from a furniture store), which holds a standard monitor arm (that itself can extend up to 50 cm - which complicates the project, so I can consider falling back a static arm later) and moved by a linear actuator controlled by Rasbperry Pi. The total moving weight (monitor + arm + carriage) is about 11 kg, and the system should provide at least 45 cm of vertical travel.\n\nMy primary concern is a torque applied to the rails. Even if I use reinforced ones (marketed as \"holding 100kg\") - they're designed for top-to-bottom symmetric force, whereas if I wall-mount them it will be a clockwise assymetric (due an arm) force applied. How can I ensure that the drawer slides don’t jam, bind or wear unevenly? The only thing I see now is adding width to the distance between rails.\n\nMaybe there's something else I'm missing, because ATM the design looks suspiciously simple. Any advice on the carriage? I'm planning to screw several rails-aligned holes in a 50x20cm steel plate. Is there a chance a wooden plate will be enough?\n\nI'm not asking anything specific to an actuator because that's the only thing I'm confident about - I'm using\n\nAny experience, ideas, or suggestions would be much appreciated!",

      "title": "Neutral wire problem with smart lightswitch",
      "text": "I am wiring up a Lutron Caseta smart switch that **does require** a neutral wire (the non-dimmer kind). I have done it the way I know to be proper from installing many of these, but for some reason on this particular circuit, it's not working correctly. When I flip the breaker back on, the light strobes and the smart switch is rebooting/losing power over and over, which makes me suspect the problem is with the neutral wire. When I use a non-neutral-needed dimmer, everything works fine, but I didn't want a dimmer on this particular circuit.\n\nThis is an old house and I thought maybe the problem is that this is a 3-way switch loop with power at the fixture, but I took apart both junction boxes and the fixture and only place where there are multiple romex lines is junction box A (where I am wiring the switch). Here is the wiring layout:\n\nJunction box A: 2-wire (white/black) and 3-wire (white/black/red)\n\nJunction box B: 3-wire (white/white/black)\n\nLight Fixture: 2-wire (white/black)\n\nIn the back of box A, there is a white and black wire capped together and a white wire going to the black screw on the old lightswitch. When I disconnect everything and turn the power on, the white wire is the only one that reads 120VAC to ground with my multimeter. I don't know why the white and black are reversed, but either way, the white should be my power to the panel, and the black/white wires capped in the back should be neutral?\n\nThe first thing I don't understand is where is the red traveler going? The only place with a red wire is box A.\n\nThe second thing I don't understand is why is there only one 2-wire at the fixture? If the power from the panel is at box A, doesn't there need to be a 3-wire going from the fixture to box B? E.g., per [this diagram?](https://daveosborne.com/newsletters/images/3wayswitch2.png)",

      "text": "Hello Reddit!\n\nReplacing a garage door opener. Instructions are below. It wants me to mount the header bracket in a very specific spot. This will be one of two main supports for the entire rail/garage door opener.\n\n[Header Bracket Instructions](https://preview.redd.it/e7igrx7q4ire1.jpg?width=4032&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=146f3a677b57972340a3f1453b44e09e017ce4b7)\n\nHere is my current rail. Notice the giant gaping hole\n\n[Current Rail](https://preview.redd.it/0cklmx6x4ire1.jpg?width=2268&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=8f971522c634cee2da682603f60c56bc92987172)\n\nHere is what it looks like when I hold the header bracket where it is supposed to go:\n\n[New Header Bracket](https://preview.redd.it/od2edex15ire1.jpg?width=2268&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a127ea11f7f77cae0d1dadba95e6b6987a732a7c)\n\nHere is a picture with no brackets in the way:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/si8tkbc65ire1.jpg?width=4032&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a6e3cb0b3e37f9e4faf0d99e32e85b5428d4d984\n\nWondering at this point, how I should reinforce this area. My first thought is to find a piece of wood (or cut to size) something about a foot wide, place it in the hole, and then reinforce it using [brackets like these](https://www.amazon.com/Mending-Stainless-Bracket-Straight-Joining/dp/B09BNG33MC). So it'd look something like this (excuse my art skills, I'm not an artist lol).\n\n[Proposed fix](https://preview.redd.it/wbyogx6v5ire1.png?width=1236&format=png&auto=webp&s=13839f2916b0d4a3339e188feaa8f979502cc068)\n\nIs this the correct/best way to do this? It's going to be kind of a pain in the ass because the opening is just slightly smaller than a 2x4, so I'll have to do a dangerous length wise cut (OR find a really wide piece of wood and do a single, cut across the width). And that's work that might not even be the safest way (or strongest) way to do this.\n\nAny advice or feedback would be greatly appreciated!",

      "text": "Hello,\n\nHope everyone is having a great day!\n\nI have a dryer vent that I have been trying to clean, and want some expert advice from y'all. So, the first problem is that my dryer vent pipe goes into the attic. So, it is terrible because it doesn't stay horizontal and then also it gets clogged alot (based on dryer times) because it is so far that it has to travel and dryers aren't made to push lint that far.\n\nSo, I have tried two methods of cleaning the pipe. One is to get a leaf blower and the other is to get the dryer cleaning kit where it is a brush and you use a power drill to spin the brush in the tube and it cleans it out. I have had problems with both, and so wanted advice on what tools you all have used successfully with these two methods.\n\nOn the leafblower side. I don't think the leafblowers I have tried were powerful enough. Do you all have specific ones you like or specs I should look for and minimum thresholds I shouldn't cross to be able to do this?\n\nOn the dryer vent cleaning kit side, when I link it up to my drill, it doesn't spin the brush unless it isn't very long (so if I don't add many attachments) I think this means my drill isn't strong enough. So, I am wondering what specs I should look for in the drill or drills you all have used that work. By the way, here is a link to the dryer vent kit I have [https://a.co/d/hh1H3Yz](https://a.co/d/hh1H3Yz) .\n\nThanks so much!",

I have unsuccessfully tried repairing a vertical drywall crack above a door frame by following the following procedure per other posts on reddit and my own research.  The results of this process has been within 1 year I can see the outline of the drywall tape in the wall.\n\n* Carve out & vacuum loos materials in the void\n* Apply mud\n* Embed Tape & apply more mud, feather it out\n* Wait for it to dry & scrape loose material with your putty knife\n* Light sand\n* Apply more drywall mud & repeat the steps until I have a nice even surface\n* Prime & Paint.\n\nHere's my question:  I have been gettin all sorts of content pushed to me on how to fix drywall cracks but for some reason they are ALL non-USA accounts & they use a Toupret Fill Flex product out of a caulking gun to fill the void. I can't find the product in the United States & I'm wondering if there's a comparable product I should be using first to fill the void?  Are there any steps I am missing based on what I've described above? It seems much easier to fill the void using a caulking gun than mixing drywall mud. Any help is much appreciated.

      "text": "I've recently found a slight gap between my floor and wall, just below a juliette balcony door. It runs the width of the window, maybe 5ft wide.  \nThere's a ¼inch or so gap between the wood floorboard and the wooden skirting board. I'd like to block off this gap but I'm not sure of the best way.  \nI've tried to make a diagram to explain the area as a photo won't really tell the whole story.\n\nThere's a cavity under the floor, and below this is the roof of my porch. The porch is open to the elements (no door) and the sealant has failed on it so I think cold air is coming up through this failed sealant, through the under-floor cavity and up through the gap into my house, which is why I've only just seen it. I will be replacing this sealant too.\n\nThe floorboard is a very large sheet so I can't remove any boards to get better access.  \nI have some expanding foam that I considered putting in through the gap until it filled it, then trimming and sealing with sealant. But I'm worried the expanding foam will just travel backwards into the cavity and never end up coming up through the gap I'm trying to seal?  \nI also don't want to block too much of the cavity in case access is needed in the future as gas pipes and cabling run through this area (albeit not near the window).\n\nPhoto of gap here:  \n[https://ibb.co/37C7hvG](https://ibb.co/37C7hvG)\n\nWhat's the best way of closing this gap?\n\nThanks\n\n[Obviously not to scale](https://preview.redd.it/0m0f70hu07be1.jpg?width=3648&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=036a7a6bee1b9f94ee1076269970cbb78c0a6523)",

      "title": "Need help with leaks in basement behind support beams.",
      "text": "Hey All, As the title states, I've got some rainwater leaking issues that occur behind these two support beams in my basement. I've lived in my home for 5 years and its been on occasional issue throughout that time. No real damage has been caused, however I'd still like to try and fix it.\n\nYou can see the overall area I'm speaking of [here.](https://lensdump.com/i/YXzThr) And a closeup on one of the support posts [here.](https://lensdump.com/i/YXzRM7) And the top of the posts look like [this.](https://lensdump.com/i/YXz1db)\n\nI have no real idea if the way these supports are set up is up to code/safe or not (I'm in the US); another reason for me posting here (I'll replace them with a better version if need be). They're simply 2x4s on top of small concrete blocks. They were nailed to the wall, but as you can see [here](https://lensdump.com/i/YXztjT) and [here](https://lensdump.com/i/YXzgPz), they are beginning to pull away from the wall, taking some concrete with them. Obviously this needs to be fixed.\n\nThe area in my upstairs that these beams are beneath is [here.](https://lensdump.com/i/YXzZ45) The main entry way to our home and a spare bathroom are immediately above them. \n\nEarlier into owning this home, we would have a small leak that went straight into a floor drain only from the right post, but as of a few days ago (tons of snow melt and heavy rain), the post on the left has sprung a significant leak behind it as well. It's quite impossible for me to tell exactly where the leaks are coming from, however it seems like they may be from the nail holes that hold the beams themselves? Not positive how long those nails are thought, admittedly, I'd be surprised if they went deep enough through the wall to hit the dirt underneath my driveway, which borders the exterior wall behind the beams for the entire length of that side of my home. It's either from there, or somewhere above the posts themselves perhaps where the poured basement meets the above-ground exterior brick wall. This would be super unfortunate because it would be behind the floor joists and unreachable without considerable destruction/replacing the wooden floor supporting my upstairs, etc. I want to avoid that at all costs. \n\nAlso worth mentioning is that, when we moved in, the seam between the edge of our poured concrete driveway and the brick of the exterior wall was pretty much an inch+ wide vacant gap straight down to dirt. A few years ago I filled this with backer rod and self leveling concrete sealant (lots of it) and that definitely made a huge impact on the basement leak situation, because now the groundwater has to travel underneath the width of my driveway to the walls of my home, instead of having a straight downward path to that area. \n\nBut I've still got these leaks when snow melts or we have HEAVY rain for a few days, not super often, but often enough to want to repair. So that leak coupled with the fact that these beams are pulling away from the wall are why I'm reaching out for help. \n\nShould I pry these away from the wall, repair the holes with cement, and replace them with adjustable floor posts/jacks? Looking for some advice.",

When I first moved in around 5 years ago & saw the floors I felt like I was standing on the top of Noahs Ark lol the owner had the floors lifted and somewhat leveled out around 5 years ago, but unfortunately time changes everything and I need to know how to level up the floors so i can place the laminate flooring down finally!\n\n\n (Also I want to add my question of: if the laminate flooring doesn’t call for any glue, but the trailers floors are known to move over time then should I glue a little bit of it here and there just in case?)\n\n   Thank you! I’m hoping you guys can shed some light and send it my way please \n    Leaving you with love and light🌫️🫶",

      "text": "My yard does have a slight slope towards the house, extending less than 10 feet from the house. I realize that a very slight slope towards the house comes with a bit of drainage concerns, but I've never had any water getting into the finished basement in the first 11 years that I owned the house that was built in 1960. Then it was time to replace most of the plumbing, including the supply line that enters the mostly finished basement. Not long after the plumbing was installed, we spotted leaks coming in at the basement wall at/through the new pipe. We called the plumber and they resealed it. That helped but it happened again. They came out a second time and now it's not coming in at the pipe.\n\nBut a few months later water started coming into the basement where the wall meets the floor (not at/through the pipe) around the area where the small trench was dug to install the supply line. Again, this never happened before that trench was dug, so it's almost definitely related to that. I imagine that the soil in the trench is less compact since it was disturbed and water is now percolating into it much more quickly. Then it's going downslope in the looser soil towards the house.  \n\n\nWhat can be done without installing a french drain parallel to the house? I'm thinking about installing some sort of barrier(s) into the trench perpendicular to the pipe. I have some particle board left over from a different project. What if I cut pieces of particle board about 15% wider than the trench, wrap it in tough plastic and insert them into the trench vertically perpendicular to the pipe and the trench? Would that effectively create some sort of dams in the trench that prevent the water soil from traveling towards the house? Has anyone tried something like this?  Good results? Other suggestions for an easy fix? Thanks!",

      "text": "Update: Going to try pavers with this design   \n  \nHi folks, I have a tiny patch of grass in my front lawn, and I actually want to make it smaller to add a direct pathway to the front door. Right now the only way to get to the front door, without going through the grass, is to go through the driveway. I have multiple cars and now I'm adding a travel trailer and would prefer to not have the direct pathway to my doorway to be through all the [vehicles.So](http://vehicles.So), I would like to cut out a chunk of the grass and extend the driveway with a walkway. My boyfriend and I are considering trying to cut out the grass and install pavers as a pathway on our own with some guides and hardware store help, but I'm wondering if we're getting over our heads.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/p80jvkekt63e1.png?width=564&format=png&auto=webp&s=d82c3af6016d814cbc12162751fc31ad09a671a4\n\nI'd like to stay away from anything loose, so just adding gravel down or something of the like is a no-go. The previous home owners already added the lava rocks and I hate them getting blown around, and it makes cleaning up lawn clippings also annoying. I do like the tiny bit of greenery that's left, even if it is just a tiny sliver, so I'd rather not just take it all out.\n\nThe lawn has a slight incline that the pathway would need to account for, and that's the one part that I  \nthink would make it too tricky for us to level out properly and set pavers on our own.\n\nAbout how difficult and how much would it be to install pavers on our own vs hiring someone to just handle it with a simple concrete pour?\n\nSuggestions or thoughts are welcome! Thanks in advance!\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/bu02e8qcwx2e1.png?width=1102&format=png&auto=webp&s=80b98c45fc513adf15a94673c85c4836cda3e907\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/qzb6gxplwx2e1.jpg?width=1102&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=6466fc48a5970cfbefb2838e86bddb6dbee367eb\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/lyaevwplwx2e1.jpg?width=1102&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=0b7fea5c480be4c53d5cbda77247392d7bf6fde8\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/p18kiyplwx2e1.jpg?width=1102&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ebe7141bd234866c6f47fe41aeb3e985ede69af1\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/zocomxplwx2e1.jpg?width=1102&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=95263eed5a8707e985531caca7efc51232e3132a",

      "text": "Hi and thank you in advance for the advice! My house had a pipe leak that was just fixed yesterday and now I need to figure out the best way to dry and repair the affected area.\n\nBackstory on the leak: a pipe leading to an upstairs radiator had a leak (not sure for how long until I noticed a spot appearing on the wall). Called an HVAC company who came after two days, poked a hole in the ceiling which leaked out maybe a liter of water, and then they turned off the boiler valves which stopped the water flow. They came and repaired the pipe after another 4 days, so whatever damp water didn't drain out the hole has been there for about a week now.\n\nThe ceiling is made out of plaster, chicken wire, and wood slats. The wall section that looks the worst is an outside wall so it should just be paint over brick. I'm guessing the water spread out over the ceiling and you can see a little bit in the upper right corner of the photo that the paint looks wet for about an inch down from the ceiling - this goes around the entire 8x12ft room. The inner walls are drywall, and even though it looks wet it doesn't feel wet to touch.\n\nMy current plan is to buy some fans (big ones for the room and a small one to stick in the ceiling hole), a dehumidifier, and a moisture meter. I will be traveling for 1.5 weeks over the holidays so I was thinking to leave those running while I'm gone and check the moisture level after getting back.\n\nIf anyone can offer advice on the drying/repair process I would greatly appreciate it! Happy holidays to you all :)",

You just want a bigger share of the inheritance, don't you?\"\n\nAnd now every time we talk or visit, at least one of my two brothers asks if I've eaten the **Murder Biscotti** yet. *Look, I know the biscotti didn't actually murder my father, but there just ain't no way I'm gon' eat that thing.* But I also can't throw it out because we're weird like that.\n\nSo, yeah...I would like to encase the **Murder Biscotti**, which has managed to become such an important part of our family lore (lol), so that it can become a pass-around family heirloom (for however long it lasts). Alternatively, I could break it down into 3 pieces so each of his sons can have one.\n\nI was hoping some of y'all would have info on precisely what I need to do, resources you can point me to, or any other tips that will help me complete this weirdo project. I've tried searching, but I keep getting results for *casting* food in resin, which is not what I'm trying to do. I *assume* I'm on some kind of time constraint, as it has been roughly 18 days since the biscotti wrapper was opened (but it seems very \"McD's French Fry\" in that there has been zero change in its appearance, sturdiness, etc).\n\nAnd thanks in advance for any help/direction!\n\nEdit: Thanks for all the info, suggestions, and links! \n\nI went to his house to hang out with big bro today (we don't like the idea of him having to be there all alone too much in his dead dad's house, so we visit every day or so). \n\nWhile there, I raided the pantry and discovered there were 6 more unopened biscotti! So I have plenty of non-murder biscotti to do quite a few test runs with, yay.\n\nOn a side note, I learned today that, apparently, \"biscotti\" is plural and \"biscotto\" is the singular form. So it's not a *Murder Biscotti*, it's a **Murder Biscotto**!\n\nI guess I'll be spending the next couple nights \"studying\" YT videos y'all suggested. And I just ordered some desiccant packets to safely store the **Murder Biscotto** while I work towards perfecting the method.",

I imagine I'd need food-grade CO2, a water line, the 5:1 syrup, a fountain apparatus, and the right lines/couplers to connect them all.  Are the three ingredients mixed in one stage or in two?  Where would I get the CO2 and the syrup on an ongoing basis?  Or would it better to somehow source and store already-carbonated water--though I'm guessing that's not as easy?\n\nNote I am not really looking for a SodaStream or a similar product where I could make my own soft drinks, but moreso a way to dispense one soft drink on demand, cold, right out of a fountain or gun.\n\nA real bonus would be if the \"fountain\" could be something we craft on our own rather than just buying one.  I imagine there's some key mixer parts that I'd buy?  Or maybe we could just start with a soda gun?  Then there's the challenge of refrigerating the water.\n\nAre there any guides out there on that I am not finding via Google?",

      "text": "Edit: I'm starting a new post with an update and a picture. I've found a drip, but not sure what to do. https://www.reddit.com/u/GloriousCause/s/SDmRuE0SkW\n\nNew (to me) house, and the toilet would run briefly every 15 minutes or so, so I replaced the flap. It kept doing it, so eventually I bought a full kit, and took the whole tank off and replaced everything. I ended up going back to the store and getting the triangle shaped Kohler plastic bit for the bottom because of the three screws. So that should be good.\n\nBut if I watch the water level in the tank, it still drops extremely slowly and after about 15 minutes it's dropped enough (maybe a half inch) that it triggers a brief refill.\n\nAt this point I'm so frustrated I'm considering calling a plumber to just install a new toilet. I have no idea what else it could be since I replaced everything in the toilet tank already.\n\nThoughts?\n\nEdit to add that I don't see any sign of water leaking on the exterior of the toilet anywhere.\n\nEdit again: food coloring from tank is definitely going into the bowl. But since I already replaced literally everything in the tank, and connecting the tank to the bowl, Im not too sure what to do. I think I'll try a different flap, and if that doesn't work some comments have suggested cutting the fill tube thing a bit shorter.",

Today we lost a bunch of food because it all thawed and we didn’t notice the outlets had gone out.\n\nThis is a common problem in my neighborhood- one neighbor suggested replacing with UP943C rated one…. And then said it didn’t work, so he replaced with a standard un-protected outlet.\n\nThoughts? We’ve never had an issue with having a freezer and fridge in the garage (3 previous houses) until we got this new build house.\n\nEDIT: Thanks everyone, you got me out doing some sleuthing now that I have things to look for. So the outlet IS GFCI protected (test button, reset, and light) ... and so is the breaker for the garage circuit (has test button, is marked as GFI on the panel...but not AFCI protected, as I guess its not a living space). I am going to ask an electrician, but based on googling and using AI to look for links, the state of Georgia requires GFCI protection at either the breaker or one of the outlets on the circuit (not both). this may be causing me nuisance issues.",

      "text": "I dealt with a small black ant problem across three different spaces my kitchen, bathroom, and home office. Rather than call pest control right away, I tried a DIY approach that actually worked better than I expected. \nHere’s what I did:\n\nTrack the Ant Trails\nFollowed the ants in the evening when they were most active.\nFound entry points around the bathroom window frame, behind kitchen appliances, and near electrical outlets in the office.\nDeep Clean and Remove Attractants\nWiped down every surface with degreaser, not just vinegar.\nCleaned behind the fridge, under the microwave, and inside the bathroom vanity.\nTurns out they were finding tiny sugar or soap residue and even toothpaste!\nSet Ant Baits\nUsed liquid bait traps.\nPlaced them near trails kitchen counter, baseboards, and behind the toilet.\nDon’t kill them on sight \nlet them take the bait back to the colony.\nSeal Entry Points\nUsed clear silicone caulk to seal visible cracks near windows, floorboards, and pipe entries.\nAlso patched a small gap behind a wall plate.\nPrevention\nLight sprinkle of Diatomaceous Earth along baseboards and outside perimeter.\nMoved food to sealed containers and keep pet food dishes on plastic trays now.\n\nTook 3 to 4 days to see major improvement.\nAfter 2 weeks: completely ant-free in all three rooms.\nIt’s a super annoying problem, but totally solvable with a bit of patience and elbow grease. Happy to answer questions or hear how others have tackled similar infestations!",

I'm not doing anything special, so it fits my needs. \n\nI wanted to add castors to it, but discovered the plates the castors are attached to are too big and when I started putting screw into the legs the screw started pulling up laminate. \n\nI do want these castors though, because they're fairly large, easy to roll, and soft. \n\nI was considering getting a piece of food that would cover the size of the table from leg to leg, attaching it to the legs, and then the castors to the timber. This way, the bench would  E slightly higher, which works for me, and I would gain an extra \"shelf\" at the bottom.\n\nDoes this sound like an idea that's too silly?",

The moment I keep any food on the table or anywhere else, they show up within minutes.\n\nI’ve checked the entire room thoroughly but still can’t figure out where they’re coming from. It’s been two days now and I’ve already been bitten several times.\n\nDon’t suggest pest control — my hostel staff won’t call them. They’re not that helpful.\n\nI’m feeling frustrated and helpless — can someone please tell me how to get rid of them? I need a proper solution 🙏",

This is the one the Lowes guys recommended and the box does say for multiple surfaces including bar tops and tables. \n\nNow my issue. After pouring the resin on and starting our long ass wait for it to finish I did some googling and discovered it's \"food friendly\" but not considered FDA \"food safe.\" Some quick googling say \"food friendly\" means safe for indirect contact and \"food safe\" means safe for direct contact with food. That's worrisome to me cause I tend to make homemade pasta and such on our countertops. \n\nSo, now I'm worried I've ruined my kitchen. I'm trying to figure out if I'm over reacting or if/how I need to go bout making it \"food safe\" like with a top coat. Any advice?",

If I'm to stain it with an oil stain (will be done outside), what should I put on top of the stain so the surface can withstand a reasonable amount of spilled drinks and food etc, and easy to clean? \n\nIf oil stain is not a good idea, then  what primer/paint/ top coat combo is good for the above application? \n\nI already have a good quality oil stain, kilts primer, acrylic enamel paint (for kitchen cabinets), minwax polyacylic,and shellac in my garage.

The smell is not in the other units. I told the landlord and he said there’s nothing he can do because there’s no gas leak. After the firefighters left I sprayed Ozium, opened every window and turned on all the fans. Smell was still there but fainter this morning when I left for work. I know it’s not a gas leak but I’m still freaking out over what it could be and how it came out of nowhere. Any advice ?",

      "text": "Hi everyone, I could really use some help.\n\nThis is my first time doing a project like this, and I’m honestly devastated with how it’s going. I have an IKEA Karlby countertop I use as a desk, and I wanted to seal it to protect against moisture, food, and wear. I chose Minwax Polycrylic (water-based, matte) and followed instructions to do multiple thin coats, sanding in between.\n\nAfter the third coat—which I applied a little thicker based on guidance I received—the whole surface started going downhill. I noticed pilling when I tried to sand with 320 grit, and there were visible streaks and patchy areas that looked like weird “jawbreaker” layers. The cure was totally uneven. Some areas were glossy, some were matte, and some felt soft or rubbery. I tried to fix it by sanding down rough parts with 220 grit, and huge sections of the poly just peeled right off in sheets. Now the surface looks and feels awful—cloudy, uneven, and a complete mess. I’ve spent around $150 on supplies and countless hours sanding and recoating, and I feel like I’ve ruined it completely.\n\nI’ve heard that it might be best to strip the finish completely and start over, maybe using Citristrip or something similar. At this point I’m exhausted and overwhelmed, and I just want to do what’s right to fix this. I need to know if Citristrip is safe to use on the veneer of a Karlby. I also need guidance on the best way to strip and reset this surface, how many coats I should realistically apply when starting fresh, whether a wipe-on method or brush is better, and what I can do to avoid this kind of failure again.\n\nI genuinely tried my best. I followed the instructions I was given. And now I feel completely lost and defeated. I just want to make this right and move on with my life.\n\nThank you in advance for any advice.",

      "text": "I have 19 litre pails (my calculator tells me that’s about 5 gal for Americans, or for those Canadians over 55) with Ready Seal lids - the kind that have a collar that goes onto the pail, and then the lid itself screws into the collar - in order to more easily store stuff like gritty kitty or birdseed or actual food. Obviously, in separate pails.\n\nThe seal on the collar is great, however there is a gap between the collar and the pail itself where stuff can get stuck. You can see the actual seal inside that gap - a black rubber seal that locks on - but I am concerned about the gap itself. It points straight down, inside the pail, towards the bottom of the pail. Which makes dumping the last little bit of the contents out problematic, as well as general use in that moving/tipping a full pail can have contents getting jammed into that gap. Plus any content dust remaining resident in that gap even after the pail is washed and repurposed.\n\nI want to be able to put caulk - any kind that works - into that gap such that the pail contents cannot get jammed into the gap. Unfortunately, unless I use a teeny-tiny caulking gun - and up here in Canada, they just don’t come that tiny - I just cannot get a caulking gun into the pail to do the caulking with.\n\nI am looking for an adjustable nozzle I can put on the end of a normal tube of caulk such that I can put only the front end into the pail and still be able to caulk straight into that gap, which points towards the bottom of the pail and is otherwise inaccessible to a caulking gun. I am thinking that the minimum angle would be 90°, with ideally something that could go up to a 120° angle from the normal nozzle direction.\n\nAmazon.ca would be ideal due to having a prime account, other sources should have a Canadian presence for shipping purposes.\n\nTIA for any help.",

      "title": "Help building caning shelving inside an existing closet",
      "text": "I need help designing sturdy shelving for an existing built-into-the-house closet. The plan is to have about 600 Lbs of self-canned food stored there. I read that 2x4's and 5/8 plywood will be strong enough, even if it's repurposed for heavier things later. What I can't figure out is how to install this maximizing the available space if I cannot screw into anything from the outside (closet walls in the way). \n\nI'll define \"frames\" as four 2x4's screwed together at the ends in the shape of a box or frame that the plywood sits on. You can likely see a frame if you look under a normal tabletop, for an example of what I mean. A shadow box that people put decorations in is also an example of the geometry I mean.\n\nI'll define posts as 5 ft 2x4's that will go in each of the 4 corners in the closet.\n\nI'm trying to figure out how to screw the frames together and screw the frames to the posts in a way where I can build the entire thing within the closet. \n\nThe hard part is that I cannot drive any screws from outside in (because the closet walls are in the way). So however I set up the screws I can only screw from inside the shelving towards the existing closet walls.\n\nI think I could install the posts by screwing them into the studs of the house.\n\nI could then cut notches in the plywood so that it slides inside the posts (the posts sit in the notch holes). To install the plywood I'd have to tip it at a 45 or so angle so it slides into place tightly.\n\nIf I use cut to shelf-height 2x4's I can support the frames with them on the inside, vertically, so the posts strengthen the shelf-height 2x4's and hold them in position, but the load is borne on the cut to shelf-height 2x4's that go vertically from frame to frame.\n\nMy main issue is that because I already have screws in the frame, I have to avoid hitting them when screwing the frame to the posts. Also, not being able to screw in from the closet wall side makes it hard.\n\nI've seen an example of the build I'm going for online, but they have screws coming in from the outside, which I can't do. See here:\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/shorts/N9RR8aGY43Q](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/N9RR8aGY43Q)\n\nCan someone show me a video or picture or explain how best to design this so that the screws don't get in the way of each other without me having to first buy the wood and make mistakes many times before I figure it out by looking at what works and what doesn't? Thanks!\n\nAlso, I'm not sure where best this post fits so please suggest another sub if it fits there better.",

      "text": "Looking for suggestions on how to finish a DIY countertop in my [1976 Toyota Chinook](https://www.instagram.com/chinook_76/).\n\nThe countertop is made of 1/2\" MDO with edge banding around the sides. My question is around finishing - I know what color I want to paint it but I don't know what paint to use.\n\nWould cabinet or countertop paint be the best option? What would be the most durable and longest lasting paint type?\n\nit wouldn't see aggressive or heavy use, but will have things (e.g. - drinks, food, coolers, etc.) placed on top of it. I'd like it to last for the life of the vehicle. Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated!\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/kn38pr9g6l8f1.jpg?width=2378&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b9a277d2889985c29033e0d313a335c257e71dfe",

      "text": "I'm moving into a place that is a little old a janky. Right now my main concern is the kitchen countertops. The landlord clearly had an old piece of fake wood laying around that they used as the countertop. My guess is overtime the renters haven't cared for the thing and now it's disgusting. We have tried cleaning it ourselves and professionally and it's only gotten stickier. I'm talking set some papers down and can't pick them up sticky so not something you want to eat around or cook on. \n\nI saw that they make contact paper that looks like wood or granite but is a thin wallpaper like cover. I was thinking that it might work to use this to cover up the sticky counter and have something smooth and safe. My drawback is these don't look like they will last when you factor in that this is a kitchen where water, cleaning materials, and food will all come into contact. Does anyone have experience using something like this for a long period of time? Any other thoughts on how to fix the sticky countertop?",

      "text": "Edit: included images\n\nSo I've been renting this place for a year, me and my partner have done a lot of work to make it look nice as the apartment itself is kinda old and shitty- walls are wonky, counter is not level, etc... images here: https://imgur.com/a/Ff5yTx1 . But one of the things that drives me mad is this gap between the stove-top and the kitchen counter-- food falls down there all the time and it looks gross. While there is also the gap on the left side  and behind the stove, the gap next to the counter bothers me more because, since the counter is not level, water that collects anywhere around the sink tends to run (in the direction I drew with blue arrows) down there and adds to the dirtiness/grossness of the gap. I don't know how to approach this really, since it's all wonky and weirdly shaped, but I mainly don't want water running down there, since I want to DIY a vertical spice rack (like this one: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M11auhBXZts&t=6s&ab\\_channel=KAIPROJECTS) in the 2inch space underneath the counter overhang. Also- my budget is kinda tight, and I can't modify the actual marble counter anyway since I'm renting.",

      "text": "Hi all,\n\nMy toilet leaks water (apparently clean, to my eyes and nose) inconsistently. What I mean is that it doesn't do it when we flush it, and somedays it doesn't do it at all. We thought it had to do with rain, since the toilet is right up next to our outdoor patio, which sometimes floods. It is definitely no condensation because the water is too concentrated in that spot and nowhere else in the bathroom.\n\nI believe the water is leaking from the cracks in this seal shown in the picture. Would it be okay to just reseal that, or does the toilet need to be removed altogether and something inside replaced? I would hate to seal it and then just have my toilet fill up with water in the ceramic itself. Can it easily be fixed, or should I just call a plumber?\n\nThank you in advance!\n\n[Water coming out of the rag, after it has been soaked by the leakage.

I'm worried either of these won't be enough support and that I need something in the middle of the desk. Not sure what I'm going to be doing with the 5.5 food desk, but it's likely just support on each end and I'm wondering if I need something in the middle. The problem is with that desk is that one of the designs I want can't have anything coming out more than 2 inches form the back of the desk. So is there a way I can calculate how much support I need and/or where to put supports?",

      "text": "As a kid I was never really able to play the latest games all my friends were into. My family wasn't necessarily broke, but a lot of my friends came from more (relatively) well-off families. I always had a cheap/old computer and didn't have money to buy games anyway, so I was always a bit disappointed that I could never really relate or participate in those conversations. I always thought that once I could afford to, I would get really into gaming.\n\nFast forward to now, I am an adult in my mid-20s with a decent job and enough disposable income for my lifestyle. Last year I finally decided I should invest in something for myself and get a decent computer. My idea was that since many of my friends moved for college and now live relatively far away, we could try to replace some of our in-person hangouts with playing some online co-op games, and I could get into some of the more popular games I keep hearing about. I saved a lot of money buying used components where possible, and overall I ended up spending a bit under $800 on what I would consider a reasonable entry/mid-level gaming PC. I had a lot of fun picking out components, looking for deals, and finally putting the whole thing together. It's nothing too special but definitely the most high-spec computer I've ever owned.\n\nAnyway, it's been almost a year since I built my computer, and while I've played a few games solo and with friends here-and-there, I don't feel like I am as excited about gaming as I thought I would be. More often than not it, feels like I'm wasting my time in front of the computer instead of doing something else. Once the novelty of finally having a gaming computer wore off, I've probably only put in a few hours of gaming a month on average. So now I'm not really sure if I just sell the computer while it's still worth something and invest in a different hobby. I'll be starting grad school soon so I don't expect I'll have much time for gaming anyway haha :)\n\nHave any of you had something like this happen to you? It doesn't have to be gaming/computer-related. I would love to hear your thoughts.",

      "text": "Hello everyone. About a year ago, when I had access to a well equipped workshop, I started to practice the art of knifemaking, I really enjoyed it and made some beautiful blades. Since then I have moved and lost access to both space and tools. I really miss this part of my life and I'm looking for an alternative hobby that is compatible with my current lifestyle.\nUnfortunately, I'm not good at drawing, not good at working with small things (miniatures, dioramas and such) and mostly like bricolage, DIY and knifemaking, not skilled at electronics or programming but would like to. I'm able to focus and enjoy something if the thing I'm doing has a function, or it's artistic. \n\nOnly surface to work on is a kitchen table but I can't cover it with permanent equipment. I know my means are pretty limited... \nIf you're asking we I mentioned my wife and my cats, it was just to let you know I'm sharing my space with another person and pets. \n\nRecently I red about sandcasting but I'm not sure if it's compatible with me (would like to know more).",

      "title": "Hobbies for a Curious Person Living in a Foreign City",
      "text": "Hello. I am looking for some hobby suggestions. I am from the U.S and I have been living in Buenos Aires, Argentina for the past few years. My husband is from here with days filled with work, his university studies, and the occassional meet-up with friends to jam and play soccer. I teach English to quite a few students both online and in-person and do the majority of household tasks/projects in our home. \n\nWhile I'm never sitting around doing nothing, **I feel stagnant**. I recently recognized that I've been feeling depressed for quite some time. I'm taking steps to combat this, such as setting aside an hour every day to improve my Spanish, equipment to workout at home, walking my father-in-law's dog, having casual meet-ups with my students, journal, reading and listening to informative podcasts instead of doom scrolling, etc.\n\n**It has been a shock to realize I don't have any hobbies.** In the U.S I was constantly outdoors when I wasn't working or studying (off-road biking, camping, swimming, hiking, fishing, etc.). I volunteered at animal shelters and even a seabird sanctuary. I did many of these activities both on my own and with my few close friends friends and family, with whom I enjoyed having long in-depth discussions with them about all kinds of topics. \n\nThis lifestyle isn't accessible to me a the moment in the city. **There are many wonderful things about living in a city but sometimes I do feel like my world is smaller, especially with the language constraint** (which again, I am diligently working on improving). It doesn't help that I live in an area where one has to be careful of the wrong person hearing a U.S accent.\n\nI would appreciate any and all suggestions you could offer. I'll list some guiding points below. **I am extremely curious and the sort of person who is enthusiastically interested in anything and everything** so please feel free to go beyond the points I've listed. I know that being too vague can make things more difficult.\n\nI hope that by having a new hobby/ hobbies I will feel less adrift, develop myself and my capabilities, perhaps it will be a way to make new connections.\n\n*  I love **learning** (information, a new skill, or practical daily life type skills)\n* I love the **sciences, history, and nature**.  \n* I like to learn skills that can help me **maintain my home, like repairs**.\n* I'd also be interested in a hobby that produces something that I can use in some way.\n* Skills that are just for fun. **Whimsical**. \n* I'm not interested in hobbies like adult coloring books or diamond art at the moment.\n* **accessible and affordable** | I don't have the same access to the same variety of products as I would in the U.S. Anything that is imported can cost 2 or 3 times as much as it would in the U.S as well. So the more basic an item is the more likely I'll be able to find it and afford it here.\n* **Something that doesn't require the participation of another person.** I'm an ambivert, but in this situation I don't want to have to depend on the involvment of others to do the hobby (although I hope it will help me connect with new, interesting people at some point!)\n\nAny ideas?",

      "title": "Looking for hobby suggestions to make friends and get dates. ",
      "text": "I am 37, male from the mid-Atlantic region of the US. I will admit I live a bit of an alternative lifestyle. I have no interest in politics or trying to make a lot of money. I live with my parents. I am a very happy and content person. But I am also friendless and have not been on a date since 2017. I have not had friends since college either. If you are wondering I have reached out to them over the years since then. But they do not want to be friends again and I live on the opposite side of the country from them as well now anyways.\n\nObviously, I do not feel the need to have friends or have dates in order to be happy. With that said though some friends would be nice to have. And well I do love sex and having long conversations with women so having them would be nice as well. Through using reddit, reading online, and watching videos the most frequent piece of advice people give in order to make friends and get dates is to have hobbies and meet people that way. I do not have any hobbies that I do with people.\n\nI am just going to write a little bit about my lifestyle and the things I enjoy doing. Any and all suggestions will be greatly appreciated. I will keep as open a mind as possible. And just because a hobby or an activity does not appeal to me personally does not mean I do not greatly appreciate anyone who takes the time to make a suggestion.\n\nFor starters I will just say I am a bit limited financially. I have a budget of about 300 dollars a month. But this does have to pay for things like my weed edibles, haircuts, gas for my car, and I typically eat out once or twice a month. Obviously, I could shift my spending habits a little. But I am still limited financially. So, for example I love to listen to music. It is one of my favorite things to do in the whole world. But going to concerts is not a huge option for me with my limited finances.\n\nNow that we have my finances out of the way we can get to the things I really do enjoy doing. For starters I have a nice little gym to work out of at home. I mostly ride a stationary bike while watching tv or listening to music. I also lift some light weights, do pushups and sit ups, stretching, and I even meditate a bit. I am in pretty good shape, and I am at a super healthy weight. But I will admit I have bad left knee that can both go out on me and cause me a bit of pain if I push it too hard. This eliminates me from doing anything from jogging, playing basketball, playing tennis (I used to love playing tennis), and going on hard hikes. Well, you get the idea. I do love slow casual walks in my neighborhood though. And like I said I love long conversations so that is something I certainly enjoy.\n\nI really enjoy weed. It suits me remarkably well. I only use edibles. I use it to get really baked about one night a week. Although I do sometimes take smaller amounts other nights to just watch movies or something. Sober I do not really enjoy movies or tv shows anymore but with a bit of weed I can enjoy them. So, taking a bit of weed and watching movies with someone does appeal to me as well. If you are curious, I am an extremely moderate drinker.\n\nI love making out with a woman. I obviously like just about everything to do with sex as well. But the kissing and the making out is my favorite part. I realize sex and making out are not really hobbies. And of course, I almost never get to do either of them. I do just want to list things I enjoy.\n\nAs I said before I love listening to music. I listen to all kinds, from classical, to almost any genre you can think of. I listen to some pop music, but I have gradually been going away from that more and more. I have still never been to a concert. I get the appeal of them, but on my limited budget I am not sure it is the best suggestion. But perhaps with the right friends or girlfriends I would enjoy going to concerts with them.\n\nThe last thing I will say I really enjoy (and I alluded to it earlier) are really long conversations with friends. And especially with girls. They are just about my favorite thing in the world. I enjoy doing them while going for a walk, while watching tv with someone, when going for a car ride, when relaxing with a bit of weed or alcohol. You get the idea. I would say I prefer long conversations with women. But having a good conversation with a male friend is also enjoyable as well.\n\nI know I am unique; I know I live an alternative lifestyle. But any suggestions will be great. Thank you all so very much.",

      "title": "Any hobbies similar to salsa bachata social dancing? High activity, close to mid contact, movement, music, meet a lot of people in a short amount of time, travel the world with it?",
      "text": "It also used to be super affordable $5 for a whole night in one of my favs even in a HCOL city like LA or SF. A salsa night would usually have a class start before they open the door 9PM to close. Bad thing about this is that you're risking your sleep and even if you come home by 12AM, your adrenaline is restarted granting you fewer chances of deep sleep. \n\nHere are some other hobbies I tried and felt a bit adjacent to this scene. Tried climbing meh. Too much energy, not enough payoff, it's good once in awhile and indoors is pretty cool. Running clubs? I hate running. Pick-up soccer or basketball? Sometimes but not for me.\n\nSmaller niche close contact types like fencing might be worth a shot. Cycling has a good community, but the buy in’s brutal $3k+ just to get into the meta of it, carbon fiber, gear and all. I’ve always been into gyms, especially muay thai or kickboxing spots. But once dance came in, these took a backseat and atleast I don't get hurt anymore, the only thing that could hurt is my heart if broken lol. But I don't date or form relationships in the dance scene anyway, save me the headaches.\n\nOther fests and anime expos? Not for me. Waiting hours for signatures doesn’t compare to dancing with someone *\"social dancing\" with someone*, connecting wordlessly. Way more intimate, way more rewarding. Learning about my body and recalling certain moves or arm pretzels, or syncopations based on the salsa music? Priceless. Forget about other music festivals too. What do I do now, just stand and stand dance?? And \"dance\" like the normal people? I kid but social dance really made most events super bland for me. \n\nOkay, these are maybe sort of other hobbies? But probably not too similar to salsa bachata social dance but close contact sensuality and intimacy from someone you don't even know: There's cuddling communities but I think some sensual bachata scenes already cover this lol. Gambling has that same rush and quick interaction but not worth it. \n\nMaybe the answer’s more dance scenes... Tango’s pricey. Kiz and zouk feel like wedding dances in smaller scenes. Swing/lindy hop is cool but cliquey and some scenes have established pairs because they're just too small, hard to break in. Sure bachata is there but sometimes it can be more like a pseudo \"clubbing\" scene. However, it still doesn't contend with a lot of people I got to know in the bachata scene, some started traveling around the world, to Spain, not even knowing the language but knowing how to bachata was enough.\n\nImprov dancing, contemporary? I'm talking about something like close contact salsa social dance. Maybe adult theatre and speech is one? There's also partner acrobatics which often had people who crosses over social dance. Meetup has gone to shit though too. Other hobbies that might have similar flavors: roller blading, acro yoga (already mentioned) anything similar?? In a salsa social dance, going to a festival for example, these 3-4 day weekend all night long until next morning events they have, you'd definitely meet and dance with more than 50-100 plus different people, it doesn't have to be intimate or close, I'm surprised this isn't more popular.\n\nGaming/streaming spaces are close you meet tons of people fast but not great if you’re more private. The only other close thing is probably university or college type communities because everyone is there for a reason. \n\nSide note, for work office life’s fine, but honestly, I had more energy for dance when I was doing physical labor. Sitting all day doesn’t help but I wasn't constantly broke. \n\n[**Any hobbies similar to the salsa bachata zouk kizomba social dancing world?**](https://youtu.be/AYQ7yb3oPCY)",

      "text": "I have plenty of hobbies already, but none of them are perfect and I'm questioning whether it even exists. It just sucks to spread my money across so many different things instead of just a few targeted ones that do everything I want. Here’s what I’m looking for:\n\n1. **Both Indoor and Outdoor Elements**: Want something that blends both indoor and outdoor activities. Stargazing is a great example- plenty of travel and setup to observe the night sky outdoors, then processing photos, sketches, and planning future outings indoors. Also several resources to study subject matter in the trade to satisfy my nerdy side.\n2. **Indoor Element**: Ideally also something with a creative element, but ultimately just needs to be as engaging as the outdoor portion. \n3. **Outdoor Element**: Ideally involves some sustained, moderate physical activity. It doesn’t need to be intense, but getting my heart rate up and enjoying fresh air is a big plus.\n4. **Year-Round Feasibility**: Even though there’s an indoor component, I’d love the outdoor aspect to be something that can be done in all seasons with the right preparation.\n5. **Enhanced by Travel**: It would be amazing if the hobby could be enriched by exploring different geographic locations. I’d love something that gets me excited about travel and experiencing new places.\n6. **Customizable Gear**: I enjoy hobbies where gear plays a role. Starting with entry-level equipment and upgrading over time as I learn more would be ideal. I also love researching, tinkering, and optimizing gear to better suit my needs—but without a huge upfront cost in case it doesn’t stick. I have an awful habit of spending way too much on a hobby that I'm not sure about, so I'm setting a hard limit of $200 to get everything that I need to get started (used equipment is completely fine with me tho!)\n7. **Active Community**: Hopefully with an active subreddit or discord! Honestly not a hard requirement but would just be awesome.\n\n**What I’m** ***not*** **looking for**:  \nPlease don’t suggest the following hobbies: playing an instrument, gym/weight lifting, geocaching, hiking, birding, photography, rock climbing, biking, or running. I’m currently already enjoying some of these or have tried them in the past. They’re great, but I’m really after something fresh and unique that I haven’t considered yet.\n\nAnyone have any ideas?",

Or why you disagree\n\nEdit - Guys I used the word \"superior\" here as a sentiment, don't take it so literally. I had an amazing year reading many fatastic books after I was in slump for a while. This is not to shame non-readers or people who enjoy different hobbies. It is just to express how it can play a vital role depending on your life. This post is a safe and happy place 😊 ❤️ \n\nEdit 2 - I don't want to hear why it's not superior or why hobbies shouldn't be counted as superior. Stop commenting that, read my first edit!!!!! but since so many of you are soo keen to police what's superior, let me tell you it was superior for me!!!!! I was a broke college kid who didn't have any travelling experience/or golf practice and even though I read books because I loved it, it did end up being a good conversation so see? how it turned out for better. \n\nAlso I said \"...one of superior...\" not most, cut some slack",

      "text": "It’s interesting to learn more and more about hobbies as time goes on.  There are so many hobbies that did not exist 20 years ago. \nIn another thread, people are speaking about hobbies that were basic survival skills until not even 100 years ago. \n\nMost include sewing, knitting, baking, cooking, collecting stamps and coins, pickling, jarring, DIY, home improvement, etc. and most of all reading. \n\nThe creating of clothes and wardrobe was a survival skill until the 1970s universally since that was the only way to provide clothes for family.  Nowadays, a lot of people (both genders) don’t even know how to thread a needle nor know what knitting is.  I actually enjoy those things. Quilting was an absolute necessity so family would have blankets.  Same with crochet. Since late 60s, stores sell them at mass production. That was never the case until mid 20th century.\n\nCooking, baking and pickling is the same but now due to ready made meal kits, many avoid the work.  Bakeries sell a lot more now than ever.  I don’t bake at all. But many bake just out of necessity or they love it so it’s a hobby. Many men now bake as a hobby. \n\nCoin and stamp collecting, due to travel relocation in early time, people just hung on to the currency to use when needed. Now it’s a fun thing and it’s a learning experience. \n\nReading was strictly to learn and for education and teaching kids how to read. Now a lot of books and magazines are available to those who enjoy stories and most love learning from history and biography. I enjoy all kinds of books. \n\nI’m here to read comments about other hobbies especially those that were once basic survival skills.",

I can fill up when I get paid every other week and that's it because I work very limited hours. It doesn't mean I *can't* travel or make extra trips outside work, I just can't go very far. I live in a fairly urban area too.\n\nMy main hobby is writing (fanfiction specifically! About 25 years at my craft) and most everything else I do revolves around that. So I also do things like worldbuilding, reading for research, and so on. I also do diamond painting. I play video games albeit sparingly. I also do martial arts twice a week and I sing in my church's choir when I'm on my normal schedule.\n\nI not the craftiest person out there as I haven't really tried my hand at anything like that. Granted I know I don't like knitting because I had to do that in middle school and *hated* it. Our final exam was a 3 foot scarf with a color change in it. I'm not sure if I'd like crochet or anything like that, but I know the costs of hooks, yarn, etc can add up quickly.\n\nI also don't have a ton of room either. My brother recently moved in with us and I lost about 30-40% of my space so he and his wife can have room down in the basement to live. So I can't have anything like a treadmill or workout equipment.",

I don't collect anything. I abhor cooking, baking. \n\nAlso, please, no talk of \"hyper focus\". I've been spoken to two psychiatrists and they dismissed it completely.\n\n1. Books, since I was 5. That means that all my hobbies are: I'll reread the entirety of Sherlock Holmes for the 5th time. When this is over, the new hobby is to look for East European authors that are known in their countries but not abroad. Then next hobby is, say, Nabokov. I'll read 5 or 6 straight and then leave to get some fresh air. The next hobby will be to reread my favorite Dostoievski's, some books I read once per decade.  Last year I reread some ten by Agatha Christie. In the meantime, I read books about my profession, or a complete outlier, just because. \n\nBut, I ask myself... Is that it? I tried piano, I'm a disaster. I go hiking every two years, say.\n\n2. Second hobby is also books, art books, but this also entails traveling abroad, which I love. I read books on art and get a kick of arriving at a new museums and, from a distance, identify the painters, only to have it confirmed by the plaque. Not always I'm right, but it's on.\n\nI wouldn't say \"going out with friends\" is a hobby. \n\nAny suggestions for hobbies in an urban environment, no green rea, shed or garage? Or are my hobbies just that, reading a d traveling, and that's ok? I see people developing talents of all kinds and get jealous. :(",

I disagree and classify a hobby as something that I enjoy doing in my free time and do often. I just want to know if people consider it a hobby. If it’s kinda not and people don’t look at it like that then I don’t want to be telling people because I’ll just look lazy. \n\nEdit: Just wanted to clarify I’m asking about just going to the pool not swimming specifically",

I’m skinny so I don’t currently need it too much but I am trying to go outside more I just dont want to do anything strenuous, I hate running)\n-Anything that costs a decent chuck of money (i am a student who has $12 lol)\n-Coding (tried it for a few days a few days ago and i hated it. kinda sucks cause i was thinking of going into tech for a career)\n\nGive me other suggestions :))) I don’t have friends so unfortunately I can’t do any activities with friends, something to FIND friends would be really nice!!!",

I'm starting to feel depressed and unhealthy just drinking by myself and playing battlefront 2 because it's cheap and easy. I hate mid 20s culture, because all I see is shallow hookups at clubs and bars which doesn't make me feel any better and I wake up w/ - $150  hungover. I like nature, art, pottery, roller skating, traveling, etc. none of which are cheap or convenient for me or close to where I live. Any ideas? Is there any place for a mid 20s guy that won't fuel my alcoholism or drain my wallet?",

I'm studying proportions to draw anatomy and when I have energy, so rarely, I work in a small lab to make herb remedies, sort of an apothecary I made in the corner of my bedroom. It takes time because I gotta sterilize all the stuff but it makes me be so focused. I live in the city so I don't have contact with nature. But when summer arrives and I can travel, I really desire to have a telescope to stargaze. Sadly, stargazing is just a summer hobby in here. I don't know if I can do all of this with the little time I have. At least it keeps me away from doom scrolling or elden ring addiction. I have to make time for sports too, at least 30 minutes",

      "text": "I was reading an enjoyable book on the slow food movement (Barbara Kingsolver’s *Animal, Vegetable, Miracle*), and she casually dropped, as though all her readers already knew this about cheesemaking or tomato breeding, that “like Karl Marx says” hobbies are the opposite of capitalism. I was like, “hang on, some hobbies are expensive, this can’t be right.” So I looked it up. Of course a google search came back with an AI result at the top, so along with learning that our newborn AI laborers might already be Marxists, it gave me Marx’s thoughts on hobbies.\n\nWhile he never explicitly used the word hobby, he said that constantly having to participate in capitalism (aka being worked to death by the bourgeoisie or fretting that your proletariat might stop earning for you) takes away from the development of the creative and unique and culture-producing individual. I had it wrong, he wasn’t against expensive hobbies, he was against people being ground down into units of labor, with no time to become bizarre and unique creators of culture.\n\nI’m seeing hobbies now through that lens. The more unique your hobby becomes over time, the better it is for you as an individual and a member of your community. Screw “there are no new ideas”: examples I saw just this morning of hobbies bringing joy or expanding culture or inspiring thinking:\n\nMy morning BBC scroll told the tale of Tim Friede, whose bizarre hobby is being bitten by snakes. WTF? Most ridiculous hobby ever. Yet Tim’s blood is on track to create a broad-spectrum snake bite antivenin that could save countless lives.\n\n Also on that morning scroll was Alex Hall, who made the Ben Drowned copypasta and inspired nightmares, frank discussions of the intrusiveness of technology, and a new genre of video games.\n\nAnd the lovely member of this community who recently posted her ballet portrait and shook up all our assumptions about ballet being just for anorexic miserable girls playing willing victim to an obsessive consuming audience (you know, Swan Lake, Black Swan, Suspiria, the new remake of Suspiria). Nope, she’s comfortable en pointe, she’s happy in her body, she’s loving her hobby, she inspired tons of us to rethink our toxic view of ballet.\n\nI love that you all hobby weirdly and communally. If I could time travel, I’d tell my younger self to pull my headphones off and engage with all those strangers who wanted to ask about my urban sketching. Hobbies are community and individuality, an act of self-love and shared love. I hope you all have a hobby-filled weekend.",

I enjoy so many hobbies, but even more that I don’t do because of time. It just feels like I have too many passions for one lifetime. For example:\n\nI want to be an Astrophysicist/professor (so i tutor sometimes and do some research)\nI want to be an astronaut (cliche want, but a realistic goal of mine. PhD in stem, healthy, etc.)\nI want to do astrophotography\nI want to make a manga/comic (i have an incredible idea, I have no talent artistically…)\nI want to do educational content creation (algebra, calculus, physics…) \nI want to travel to 50+ countries\nI want to learn to fly a plane (would help to becoming an astronaut as well)\n\nand that’s just a couple of the things i want. i want to do so much in this lifetime and it feels like ill never be able to be truly happy if im always between wants and can never make up my mind. \n\nMostly, I was wondering if anyone else felt like this. I have so many passions and it feels like i don’t have the talent or skill set for any of it. I can’t draw, so that takes off manga/comic creation. Hiring illustrators is way too expensive. I feel like i’m even not smart enough for my degree and I feel like i’m constantly behind. \n\nDoes anyone have any advice or anything?\n\nTLDR; I have too many hobbies and not enough time to do all of them. I feel conflicted and lost.",

As I work on these scarcity beliefs and try to find a hobby, I see how it effects every aspect. \n\nSo whether you have these beliefs yourself or not, how did you meet that hobby that makes you come alive?

But the most important thing I’m looking for is a community. I would say that in my experience joining different communities, the dancing, running, and hiking communities are pretty awesome. \nI wish I could run faster or better, but physically I’m limited to enjoy running at a faster pace.  in my city running clubs are mostly free, they’re super fun, they throw big events that look like little mini festivals which is great because I don’t go out at night anymore and they sometimes do giveaways which are either Nike, Puma or even lululemon merch. \nThe hiking community is also pretty great because you have several guides and don’t have to think about following the trail and can just socialize or enjoy nature. They also throw little hiking picnics to socialize and grab a drink after the hike. The most advance plan mountain camping trips and even travel overseas. \nMy limits with the dancing community is that I can’t go out social dancing anymore, as I prioritize my sleep now and have to be in bed by 11 pm even on weekends and holidays. So I can only go out to afternoon parties or stick to urban/jazz studio dance. \nI’m learning how to surf and it’s so hard, so I haven’t really met any surfers yet, because I still feel the need to be with the instructor in the water. But I do paddle board and I just can randomly talk to strangers on other boards. It’s like the water lets peoples guards down. \nOne community I’m honestly thinking of quitting is CrossFit. I like their program, but at least in my experience they’re pretty toxic and elitist. They all want to compete, I know few people who just want to exercise for wellness and the coaches act like drill sergeants. Fk that.",

About 90% of every choir are over 70, they’re lovely people (and you should never judge a person by their age) but I also want to make friends closer to my age who I can see outside of the choir eg coffee, live music, walk, movies etc. But the over 70s mostly talk about their grandkids, grey nomad travelling, hospital operations, specialist visits etc, none of which I can relate to. They go to bed early whereas I’m just starting my night! We’re just in different life stages (hate that expression). \n\nApart from choirs, can you suggest other ways I can have a music-related hobby? I thought maybe I could work behind the scenes for amateur musical theatre but I hear competition v. fierce & I have zero experience, although I used to run my own events business & wrote advertising/public relations material for a living.

(please avoid bankrupting me if possible hahaha)\n\ni’m more than open to general recommendations but damn, my parents are picky, so i’ll also give a quick rundown of my parents and their interests if anyone has specific ideas! \n\nmy dad is 71. he is a hobby pilot and farmer. he loves being outdoors and he’s quite skilled at identifying local flora and fauna. he’s mentioned winter are particularly boring because he is cooped up inside. he really likes mechanical work and building things. he gets satisfaction by getting them to run. i’ve suggested model engines but he isn’t interested because there is no functional use that is central to his enjoyment. he’s very interested in history. he really enjoys 60s music and singing. he claims he “isn’t creative” like me but i disagree, so my immediate thought was something like photography because it can be done inside and out. but i’m unsure if that would resonate.\n\nmy mom is 65. she has two dogs that she adores; she really enjoys taking them places and has recently picked up seriously grooming them. she’s tried gardening, canning, and a little crocheting, but they haven’t seemed to stick. she has an entrepreneurial mindset, and enjoys problem solving and mental exercises to keep her mind sharp. she’s been really into interior design and home improvement lately. she’s shown interest in fashion and the fine arts. she watches a lot of movies (though, i’m unsure how much is out of boredom vs. enrichment/entertainment), but doesn’t engage with music as much despite her mother keeping her childhood home full of music, so i wonder if a more fulfilling way to engage with music might be a good idea.\n\nthey are both excellent cooks, trying to travel more often, and similar to me in the sense that they need to be doing something and feel productive. also, neither of them drink.\n\nany ideas are so deeply appreciated! thank you so much and have a safe, happy holiday season!!",

I am looking to pursue a side hustle as I can always use the extra money lol. My interests are really just history and exercise but I’m always open to learning new hobbies/hustles to make money. My night shift may leave me with less options. Pleas provide me with some ideas for side hustles I can purse. Open to all ideas thanks for your time!",

My inclination would be to enjoy the process then throw the object away, but that cuts against my environmental impulses.\n\nCase in point, I inherited a 3d printer. Enjoyed learning it, made a few dozen objects, made more objects for friends, but a lot of times it seems like I have a lot of plastic trinkets to just throw away. I always try to think my way out of a problem rather than buy my way out of a problem.\n\nI'd love to fix up a car, but don't want an extra car. I used to love building plastic models, but I don't want the finished model in the house. Speaker building, furniture building, circuit building, instructible-type projects: I don't want the thing at the conclusion of the project, and I don't want the weight of the trash at the end.\n\nI do a lot of cooking, that's ok because you eat what you build. And I guess that gardening would be ok (either you make food or your plants can just go into compost and become new plant)s, but gardening doesn't fit into my life right now.",

Sharon Ojala’s YouTube channel really helped me get started, though I recommend finding a youtuber that works for you! (Plus: if you have ADHD I've also heard people recommend crocheting amigurumi plushies specifically cuz they're such small projects you won't get bored of them before finishing!)\n* **Drawing/Coloring:** Another great flow state activity. Coloring books especially helped me let go of perfectionism and are great if you feel too burnt out to come up with something to draw.\n* **Baking/Cooking:** Bonus points for this hobby is you'll end up with lots of great food/treats! Plus, I find focusing on a recipe is especially grounding and almost meditative.\n\nI especially like these hobbies since they're relatively inexpensive and easy to start! What have your guys' experiences been like though? And what other hobbies have helped you feel calmer or more present?",

I like to play online chess, I do research for work and I find it interesting, watch youtube, read stuff online, etc, and all of that stuff takes up about 80% of my \"free time\"\n\nThe only thing I do IRL is go to the gym, but even then I feel like my attention span is cooked and I'm just listening to music and/or watching a Youtube video and/or texting a friend or something on my phone.\n\nThe only thing I actually enjoy doing that isn't online, is cooking/going out for food, going out shopping somewhere (ironic because I do everything online EXCEPT shop), and that's basically it\n\nSaw a thread [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Hobbies/comments/1m9t7do/young_men_1830_what_do_you_do_when_your_not/) asking what young guys under 30 do as hobbies, and people are saying painting/RC, trading fossils, DJ'ing, etc stuff like that.\n\nI don't know if my attention span is just omega cooked and I'm chronically online or whatever, but doing anything that isn't internet related just isn't very interesting to me. Obviously you can force yourself to do stuff, but I feel like I don't even have the motivation to do anything that isn't online. It's such a bizarre thing to say out loud, but it's true.\n\nSo my question is how do you guys actually get interested in these hobbies in the first place? Obviously you can sign up for lessons for music or martial arts or whatever you want to get into, but even then I feel like you just need to go back to the internet to actually expand on it past those lessons (probably just 1 or 2 hours a week)",

      "text": "Lately I’ve been noticing how easy it is to lose time, hours of scrolling, endless notifications, always looking outward instead of inward. After everything I’ve been through, I’ve come to deeply value what truly brings me peace. \n\nThis summer I started doing things I never made time for before. Walking barefoot in the grass. Making watercolour art outside. Dancing with my little cousins under summer sky. If you’re feeling burnt out, overstimulated or just numb, I highly recommend this. Step outside. Let summer remind you what it means to live in your body. Not everything worthy of your attention is behind a screen. \n\nChoose presence over passive consumption. Replace dopamine hits with real joy. Experience what it feels like to be curious, creative, connected without a screen.\n\nThis is what I did this summer. I visited new parks. Had a phone free picnic in our own yard with homemade food. My brother and I went to the splash pad like kids again and laughed until we couldn’t breathe. I floated on my back in a pool and let the sun touch my skin. Painted with ice chalk in the morning before my brain filled with notifications. Walked to get ice cream without headphones, just soft conversation. Helped my little cousins wash their play dishes with grass, water and giggles. We ran through sprinklers barefoot. Washed the car with Papa after a thunderstorm. We planted corn and measured how it grew.\n\nWe built a fort with leftover cloth and sticks. I tried geocaching (yes it still exists) and felt the thrill of hidden treasures. We jumped in puddles after rain. Built a backyard obstacle course with ropes, chairs and chalk. Created sidewalk masterpieces. Played follow the leader until we were dizzy. Watched a baseball game, no phones. Did scavenger hunts for feathers, odd rocks, yellow things. Identified trees. Picked sun warm peaches at an orchard. Built a drive in movie setup with bedsheets. Drew chalk roads and sent toy cars on adventures.\n\nI danced in the rain. Bird watched early in the morning with binoculars. Went to a fair. Made water silhouettes on hot pavement. Caught fireflies in jars with holes punched in the lid. Flew a kite in the golden hour. Played tag with neighbourhood kids. Roasted s’mores. Ate dinner outside by candlelight. Made collages with flowers and leaves. Rode bikes slowly through quiet streets. Found feathers, smooth stones, heart shaped clouds.\n\nI read outside. Watched clouds move. Painted on the porch. Invited friends for a no hands ice cream sundae party. Rolled down grassy hills. Camped in the backyard. Went on a boat ride at dusk. Built and painted a bird feeder. Had a wild outdoor dance party. Built a sandcastle with my neighbour’s daughter. Tie dyed old t-shirts. Made a time capsule. Did leaf rubbings. Went on an ABC scavenger hunt (A for ant, B for bark, C for cloud). Hula hooped like fools. Made pinecone bird feeders. Went camping. Played barefoot soccer. Jumped rope. Jumped again because it made me feel like me.\n\nWent fishing with my uncle. Planted a garden with Mama. Lit sparklers, it felt like Diwali. Let the kids run wild while we watched them. Washed bikes. Painted flowerpots. Took hammock naps. Played cornhole. Sold lemonade. Did yoga on bare earth, no mat.\n\nWe turned delivery boxes into forts, cars, houses. Watched butterflies flit. Blew bubbles. Hosted a progressive brunch with neighbours, each house served a dish. Played bocce ball. Pretended to be pirates. Observed bugs with magnifying glasses. Played hide and seek. Had a 2000s music BBQ. Played ladder ball. Made garden markers with stones. Had a literal pie throwing contest. Watched another baseball game. Took a bird counting walk with my Aaju. Had a messy water balloon fight. Went horseback riding. Drew racetracks. Built DIY mini golf. Did a puppet show. Built a giant Jenga tower. Had a watermelon seed spitting contest. Watched the sunset in silence. Played tennis. Visited the farmer’s market. Weeded the garden I planted. Took care of it. Took care of me. Made a birdbath. Watched them come.\n\nI did all of this instead of disappearing into a screen. Because I wanted my life back. This isn’t about being perfect. I still use tech. But now, it doesn’t use me.\n\nAnd if you’re feeling wired, numb, lost I promise the cure isn’t online. It’s under the sky. Go outside. Do something real. Touch the grass. Feel the dirt. Hear yourself laugh again.",

Oh it’s an amazing world under us, that so many of us never think about. I think about soil and landscapes all the time! I love making art about it but want to create something bigger. I have a soil themed podcast which is fun. \n\nI’m curious if anyone has ideas for larger crafts/creations that I could make (and eventually share) with others, to grow their own curiosity and fascination of the earth we live on and impact through daily actions. Some ideas include a soil themed art shanty; a soil display for the local farmers market; pottery class involving clay harvesting and processing so we learn about pottery while learning about soil/earth; soil kids book; soil 3D dioramas; foraging classes that connect mushrooms, biology, landforms, and soil types; soil field tours; among many other ideas.\n\nI’m surrounded by soil friends but I want to expand this learning and earth-curiosity to others. \n\nSo I want to know, what creations/hobby communities could I dive into/work with on larger products/projects that are interesting to you and larger communities? What ideas do you think are engaging to folks and fun to create? How could I better work with hobby communities to integrate soil/earth learning? What is a cool soil (earth)-themed project to create? \n\nThank you in advance for your contributions, ideas, questions, thoughts, and willingness to share!! :)",

      "text": "So i am a 25 year old woman. Autistic, wear hearing aids, and blind in one eye. I don't drive and am going through the disability process rn so I'm stuck at home all day for the foreseeable future. I've been watching YouTube but that's been getting kind of stale. \n\nI remember when i was a kid i loved reading. Couldn't get enough of it. To the point where when i got in trouble i was grounded from my books. But i can't remember the last time i actually sat down and read a print book. I mainly listen to audiobooks and podcasts now, but it would be nice to have something to do while listening to them instead of just sitting there. \n\nI also loved writing, but after a traumatic experience involving it where all my writings got destroyed, I don't have the heart to go into it again. I was the weird kid that grew up watching animal planet and shows about medicine and history instead of Cartoon Network lol. I used to play clarinet in middle school but it got too confusing so i stopped and haven't played it in like ten years. \n\nI've thought of a lot of things. I like to do things with my hands and see the progress of something I've worked on so i tried crocheting and cross stitching, but i got frustrated because i couldn't see that well. I do like legos but they're expensive. I'm trying to lose weight and distract myself from food so even though i want to improve my cooking, which is basically making hamburger helper meals and casseroles, i don't think that's a good idea. I don't have a green thumb and killed every plant i had.\n\nMy boyfriend is into gaming and said that I needed to do something more than just be on YouTube and Reddit all day lol. I have a steam deck and he's tried to show me some games but i don't like what he likes and stuff like stardew and roots of pacha get old fast. My long term goal is to be a kitten foster mom, since i like taking care of things and helping them, which is why i like medicine. But we have 3 cats so i can't do that right now lol. I've thought about trying to work out while listening to podcasts but i hate any form of exercise except swimming, and i can't drive to a swimming pool. I want to like exercise but it's boring and i don't have any workout equipment and no idea where to start.\n\nWhen i'm on YouTube i try to find history, medical, and true crime/psychology documentaries but i've ran out of stuff to watch. I don't have any new ideas for stuff to do at home that would be interesting to me and i wish i did. Does anyone have any tips?",

BUT these items are being priced in a way someone running a business might price their goodies. I'm not selling things at $5 each essentially.\n\ni in no way shape or form expect myself to one day create something worth making a business out of but i also intend to keep crafting and posting things online for sale with the hopes that someone would even want to purchase, and that any purchase gives me a little bit of money back in my pocket.\n\nI'm in MN for additional context. is there a line that has to be crossed in order for it to go from \"hobby\" to \"side hustle/business\" or the moment i put a price tag on something does that mean i should be looking into sales tax and the possible need for a business license depending on my states requirements?\n\nive started to do the digging into this a little (before being active on reddit) so it was my assumption and understanding that because im trying to sell anything at all id need to become a business entity. i'm wondering if my thought is still correct, or if people are actually able to have hobbies they post the creations online for sale for with no fear that theyre making too much money?\n\nwhere does the line get drawn?",

I’m not opposed to meeting up with people to do these things but id rather have a hobby buddy in general, rather than have to worry about finding someone near me with the right hobby. I’m interested in movie/TV show analysis, music, writing/poetry, journaling, arts n crafts, philosophical discussions, photography, anything related to history, food reviewing, language learning, etc. im also curious about other people’s hobbies and passions and am pretty open to trying new things!",

This weekend I’ve shopped at CVS and Food Lion (grocery store in NC). \n\nLast night I managed to get a free pack of toilet paper, some discounted dish soap and cleaning supplies, and frozen dinners and some other items. I also got a coupon for x amount off my next order because of buying items in different categories (which I needed). \n\nToday I spent like $5.52 and got a large pack of baby wipes, 2 Hallmark birthday cards and a pack of razors. \n\nI thought it would be tedious or hard to learn but with apps and digital coupons it was actually pretty simple. I do have to return something today, grabbed the wrong product and paid full price. \n\nJust an idea out there especially for people who want to save money or are low on funds. I recommend making your grocery list of items you need or will need soon that way you aren’t just buying because it’s discounted. \n\nHoping I can get good enough at this where I’ll have stuff to donate and gift to others. \n\nWhere’s the pro couponers at?? 👀",

It is drawing.\n\nFirst of all I wanted to say that I'm no professionalist and do it only for fun and time consumption.\n\nThe big advantage of such entertainement is that it doesn't require much effort to go into it and doing small sketches drawings may take a long hours (in case of big projects) or few minutes (in case of small works).\n\nThere are lots of inspiration posts on pinterest, so finding any reference (if drawing from nature is too difficult) is very easy.  I the past I dad the flower period, the elephant period, was drawing mice and food,  now I'm focusing on woman's postures (but this isn't so easy as drawing comic characters).\n\nIn addition I can do it with my kids because sketching is an activity which may be performed by everyone. And with each next drawing you learn something new.\n\nThe most difficult in this activity is starting. To find real joy in drawing you need to get a few essential skills. It doesn't get long to get them, but making first steps may be discouranging.\n\nIn attachement my few drawings (remember I'm not a pro ;)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/sj5z9pq0v8ke1.jpg?width=1500&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=2fa8a1567f8fd94f81dfc4748c07eb1638aad477\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/5ra7frq0v8ke1.jpg?width=1500&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=7de74a1776b7b57a4e67c427cf17783f0554269a\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/9wnf6nq0v8ke1.jpg?width=1200&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=6f0d9a0b15614d00b7e69537b064ed44f844ca04\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/gidz2nq0v8ke1.jpg?width=1500&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ca3bc3229e0b55e9262cfc942d0cde85c4e335f0",

I don't make a lot of money, at best 100 a week as I am in school to be a medical assistant, and my money goes towards, food, gas and little spending. So, do yall know any hobbies to get out of the house other than fishing. I like the outdoors, and I am close to the country and city. I made a list of some stuff, but almost all of them cost money. Any ideas would be great. Also, I am not a social person and I do not like to talk to strangers.",

      "text": "Hello,\n\nI'm 21F who is deeply passionate about classical music. I started learning a percussion instrument called \"tabla\" when I was about 12 years old. I learnt that for 9 years with breaks during important academic years. I also really wanted to learn a melodic instrument so I picked up a string instrument when I turned 18.  I ended up giving up both of them for a competitive exam prep when I was 20 years old. When I announced this to my music prof he got really upset and he just cut contact with me. Now I'm halfway through my master's degree in business and I feel lost.\n\nI'm worried that my job will not leave me enough time to practice music and take serious lessons. I don't like the education or job I will be doing but I have to because I'm poor and I really need it (I've sort of accepted it but the idea of not being able to be the musician I always wanted to be sort of hurts).\n\nI would like to restart my music journey but my professor doesn't understand that at times, you have to prioritize something else too. But I also know that most Indian classical musicians have unreasonable expectations out of their students (eg. my prof expected me to not go for a professional degree because it meant I would have to take a break from music - which is completely unreasonable for me because I gotta put food on the table).\n\nNot making music is harming my mental health a lot. I could always make music on my own but i) I wanna learn further ii) I live in a hostel where I don't have my instruments\n\nPlus, my mom developed spondilosis and I'm wondering if I should just start learning vocals because if I can't play instruments in my old age what's the point of putting all my life learning them? I could still switch to vocals (I did learn vocal but my anxiety really made it difficult to breathe and sing in front of the prof).\n\nI just want to hear from people how I can stop being a victim of the circumstances and prioritize my hobby.",

Baking gives me the satisfaction of actually having a real edible thing as a result of my doing. Very un-like my job, where the result is always virtual.  \nThe physical aspect of it is something I'm missing on my work that I love for other reasons.\n\nBut half of my closest family discovered they are gluten-intolerant. This really sucks because although I am able to bake GF stuff, sweat and salty, I dont really enjoy that anymore. I just do that so they can eat it, and baking \"normal wheat-y stuff\" just for myself loses the point for me (im big in doing things for others, that really nurishes me).\n\nKnowing this, what would you recommend? Im okey with experimenting, I just dont want to start something I need to buy a lot of stuff for, or that requires very special equipment.\n\nGot small children so if they could join me in it from time to time, that would be a lovely benefit",

      "text": "Hey there, I'm trying to figure out a better technique for shredding or grinding a rope into tiny fibres. It's for making homemade flocking, and so far the results have been amazing. Unfortunately the only method I've found to make these fibres is cutting the rope strands with a pair of scissors. It's time consuming and rather hard on my hands. Anybody have a better suggestion? I'd like to keep using rope as a material because it's really brought down the cost of flocking tables and terrain. Thank you.",

She just turned 50 so she isn't elderly or anything she just got a severe case young. I have tried to think of things but im coming up short. I could really use your help I have no problem buying things for her on amazon or something so price isnt the issue I just want to give her a better quality of life and a more engaging day to day.",

The same could be said with Fencing, even when I've actually got some experience in Fencing because I used to be part of a Fencing club in College. \n\nI've also recently moved into a new apartment, and I'm hesitant about dropping money on so many hobbies on top of being at work all the time.\n\nI think the older I got, the more I feel like I've lost my personalty and became really closed off. These hobbies would be a great way to get out, do new things, and meet new people, but I just have a lot nerves and anxiety to get over.\n\nDo y'all have any advice about to get over these nerves and anxious feelings?",

There would be presentations centered around our activity...someone even did the occasional song parody. After the meeting everyone would go get food and have fun.\n\nThe store changed it's hours after covid, and we could no longer meet there as it wasn't open late enough. The restaurant where we get food is nice and allow us to reserve tables and do the meeting there, but it's just no longer practical to have presentations...you can't set up a projector screen in the middle of an active restaurant.\n\nThe meetings have become really dry and boring, and again, the hours at the restaurant are shorter than they used to be so everyone eats during the meeting, there's a bit of chatter afterwards but not much cause the place closes, and we disperse. Fewer and fewer people have been coming or sticking with the meetings...\n\nDo people have any suggestions for how to make the meetings more engaging? We could look for a different venue, but that would be a big step at this point and I'm hoping for some more short term suggestions or ideas?",

      "title": "Hobbies for groups or teams ",
      "text": "Back to compile another list of hobbies that are great if you're working with a team or a large group. \n\n  \n1. Cooking Classes\n\nCooking isn't something everyone can do, but it IS something everyone can learn! If you've got a group and you're trying to find a way to get them more involved, try cooking. Whether it’s a pasta-making class or a sushi workshop, the shared experience of getting your hands in the food does a lot of good for bringing a team together. That AND it's a transferable skill. When people know how to cook and care for themselves, they can thrive. I remember learned to cook from my stand-in mom when my own mother passed - that skill has carried me through MANY functions, and people are always asking me where I learned to cook and how to cook. I've done several cooking nights with friends where we pick a curry and go! LOL. Cooking as a hobby, rather than as a job, can open up a lot of doors later on down the line in terms of opportunity.\n\n2. Board Games and Trivia Nights\n\nThis one is popular, and I'm sure if we're all working most of the day, we've tapped into this already. My sister does things like DnD, and murder mystery nights. Classic board games, strategy games like Catan, or hosting a trivia night (or even going out to your local bar for trivia nights - my friend used to love those) are excellent ways to bring a group together for some lighthearted competition. Trivia as a hobby is also a bonafide way to learn enough that you can actually get on your friends' nerves during long car rides haha. By extension, video games are a big hobby of mine. On the weekend, my siblings and I will sometimes coordinate a night where we go into a lobby and play a game together (recently it's been Ghost of Tsushima huhuhu), and we just spend a few hours on FB messenger while we play. Keeps us in touch doing something we all enjoy! Don't underestimate the power of games, no matter what format. \n\n3. Creative Workshops\n\nJust a more general recommendation for more traditional hobbies that translate well to group work. Art classes like pottery, painting, or craft-making are ideal for a group. Painting in particular has a few setups that work well for teams, including paint and sip or collaborative murals. If you're into photography, doing photography walks can get in a bit of physical activity alongside your hobby. I've heard a lot about knitting or crochet circles - when I used to work on campus, we had a group that would donate hats to charity, and their whole purpose was to sit in a circle and chat for an hour or two once a week so that they could make those together. It was called cozy chats and it was such a cute way to get involved with the community but also build up a network around a specific hobby. \n\n4. Sports/Physical Activity (when possible)\n\nBasketball and soccer seem to be the most popular. Volleyball is that one thing you all decided to try again when you first got to college. One that many don't think about (but which I saw a lot of on my college campus) was ultimate frisbee. Even something like joining a walking club can be nice. If you're thinking of picking up a new hobby in the new year and want to get physical with it, I'd recommend doing a physical sport of some sort.\n\nDo you all have favorite hobbies that work well with bigger groups, or that translate well to teamwork?",

Or share what they do when they get home from work please? \nThank you Xx☺️",

      "text": "I’ve noticed I go through “phases” with hobbies. I’ll get really into one—like cooking, guitar, or gardening—for a few months, buy all the stuff, dive deep into learning… then eventually drift into a new one. Sometimes I feel bad, like I’m just wasting money or not being consistent, but at the same time it keeps life exciting.\n\nCurious how you all approach hobbies—do you focus on one long-term and master it, or do you cycle through different ones depending on your mood and season of life?",

      "text": "Recently I've seen a fair amount of posts where whether it's the primary or secondary focus, people are asking about productive hobbies.\n\nTo me, first and foremost, hobbies should be for you. Not for others, not to skill build, not for productivity. \n\nThey should be for you to explore your interests, and see what you like doing.\n\nMaybe you do different hobbies at different times of year, maybe you'll get really big into one specific hobby.\n\nThe hobby though, should be for you.\n\nAnything else is secondary.\n\nEvery hobby, however, is going to give or help you with some form of skill.\n\nCollecting things will help you learn more about that thing, as well as have you get an eye for detail on what you're collecting.\n\nEven video games help with hand-eye coordination. Beyond that, the type of game you play adds other things. Fast-paced games like shooters will help with mental acuity. Strategy and puzzle games will help you with problem-solving.\n\nI think people need to stop worrying about the productivity of a hobby, focus more on what will bring them joy and relaxation, since those should be the primary goals of a hobby.\n\nThe skills will come with time as you do more of a particular hobby, naturally.",

      "text": "Lately I’ve been struggling with this thing where I sit down to do something I enjoy, like playing guitar or messing around with a sketchbook, and this voice in the back of my head immediately goes, “You should be doing something useful.”\n\nIt’s annoying because I know hobbies are supposed to be fun. They're good for your mental health and all that. But even when I have actual free time, I feel like I need to “earn” it first by finishing some chores or checking off a to-do list. And then when I do finally sit down to enjoy myself, I just feel kind of guilty or distracted.\n\nI’m guessing it’s some mix of burnout and constantly feeling like I need to be productive all the time. Anyone else deal with this? How do you get past the guilt and actually enjoy your hobbies again?\n\nWould love to hear how other people handle this. I kind of miss just doing stuff for fun without overthinking it.",

It's weirdly calming, like it clears my head after a long day. I've even started listening to podcasts while I run, and it feels less like exercise and more like \"me time\". I've also met some really cool people at local running groups, which I never expected. I'm not super fast anything, but I love how it makes me feel.",

Would anyone have any ideas as to what I can do with my free time?\n\nTo be clear it's not really that I am not interested in certain things. I am very interested and motivated actually. Rather, I find myself too traumatized and hurt to partake in the things I enjoy.\n\nThis is a list of the things I want to do but struggle with or can't for reference:\n\n* Read (newspapers, books, research, etc)\n* Write (stories, essays, diary entries, etc)\n* Golf\n* Tennis\n* Study French\n* Play the piano\n* Apply to/work a job\n* Model building\n* Cooking\n* Exercise\n* Volunteer work\n* Play with pets (I give them attention but I wish I could spend more time with them)\n\nI mainly want to find things to do to keep myself preoccupied for the coming months. I can't quite treat my depression due to abusive parents so my only choice is to survive till I turn 18, at which I can start taking the steps necessary to properly alleviate my depression (I am 17 at the moment). For now I'm more so stuck in a \"survival\" state wherein my objective is to make it to 18 alive.\n\nSince depression hinders my ability I can't do anything too intensive. I'm specifically looking for \"easy\" activities to partake in. Though, I hate engaging in things like video games, watching TV, or browsing social media. These activities do not capture my interest at all, but unfortunately they are some of the only things I can do.\n\nBy the way, I figured I should mention I've already been seeing a therapist, a psychiatrist, etc, for years now.\n\nAny help is appreciated. Thanks!",

      "text": "I'm 26 and a couple years ago I randomly got into gardening and it honestly changed how I spend my free time. At first I thought it was just something older people did, but I bought a few small pots and sees and tried it out. Watching something grow that you planted yourself is such a calm feeling, and it's weirdly addictive. I started wit herbs like basil and mint because they're easy, and I remember the first time I used my own basil in pasta, I felt like a chef even though it was just basic cooking.\n\nThe best part is how much it slows you down. I used to spend every weekend just scrolling on my phone, but now I actually look forward to checking on my plants. Sometimes I'll just sit outside with coffee and it feels like a mini escape. It also gave me something to talk about with my grandma, since she's been gardening for years and now we swap tips. \n\nI honestly think everyone should try growing at least one plant, even if it's just on a windowsill. It doesn't take much space or money, and you'll be surprised how good it feels.",

I stopped thinking about work, money, and all the stuff that normally made me anxious. It feels like my brain finally  gets to rest for a while. I'm still not great at it but I like seeing my progress when I look back at old drawings. \n\nI've also started sharing a few with friends and they actually loved them, which gave me more confidence. It's kind how a simple hobby of mine turned into something that makes my days lighter. I just feel happier and more at peace since I started.",

I played tennis a lot when I was younger, which I loved, but I wear glasses full time now and it puts me off haha.\n\nI recently started sewing and went to a little group near me which was really enjoyable.

      "text": "I've been interested in music for years now, specifically rock music forms. But I've considered letting go of my interests in music because I think it might be more burdensome and delusional to continue with.\n\nA reason being its a very personal experience of mine I'd be embarassed to share or explain. I don't really share my musical interess with anyone, and I don't care to either. I would be too embarassed to do so unless its online or with someone who happens to fanatically like the same things as me. Hell, I'm too reluctant to even go to shows or buy the media, just out of reluctance or embarassment. It sucks not having anyone to share my interest with, being able to support artists, let alone being even comfortable to share this passion. Even then, common hobbies are far from a guarantee at friendship.\n\nAdditionally, a major force keeping me interested is the thought of being able to create my own music. At the same time, I have no experience playing instruments or in musical theory. I would probably only work solo, but I think that adds another layer of challenge to making art I'd be proud of, in terms of being good enough at programming, arrangements, coming up with good ideas, et cetera. Of course I could learn, but my work ethic isnt strong enough right now to make good progress. The time and money investment is also huge, when that could be spent towards things like family or towards a career.\n\nThere is also the problem of music being a too escapist and time consuming for me, to the point its delayed my productivity and focus at times. And yes, there isn't anything wrong with getting enjoyment, but I also can find enjoyable things with greater utility, like physical activities.\n\nObviously I cant stop liking something immediately, and I'll always have an interest in art to some degree - I cant just get rid of that aspect of myself. But maybe I can just let this interest slowly fade away, and occupy myself with pursuits that I'm more comfortable with and that would be fruitful. What is to be done?",

      "text": "I love gardens, especially flowers, but this year is my first year in a home with a backyard and honestly I’ve learned I don’t enjoy being in it and doing the actual work of gardening. \n\nI really dislike the bugs and pests. Every time I step into my backyard it’s like a war zone of cobwebs, spiders, midges, flies. And then on the flowers there’s aphids… \n\nI spent so much time going to the nursery, researching, digging, planting, etc that I didn’t have as much time for my usual outdoor hobbies like hiking and camping. \n\nI also enjoy traveling, we recently went on a 2 week trip out of town, and coming home to see the sad state of my plants and all the overgrown weeds makes me kinda annoyed.\n\nWatering also feels like a chore. I’ve automated most of it (we have sprinklers and I have a few solar powered irrigation kits for the pots) but there’s still a few pots that require hand watering and some of those plants have died from neglect.\n\nAnyways I may need to rethink my plan for the backyard. I need to make it work with my lifestyle. It’s still mostly a blank canvas. Where do I go from here? We already put a lot of effort into ripping up the grass so I do not want to revert to grass. Right now it’s 90% mulch, a couple of roses and shrubs and perennials that I planted along the border. I think the mulch might be contributing to the bug population? I want to pave it eventually but we don’t have the funds yet. I’m almost tempted to start growing mint because it could help keep the bugs away…",

      "text": "My parents just moved to a new place and are starting a new garden plot this spring. My mom was discussing the need for fencing since we have a massive rabbit population (come on coyotes, do your friggin' job) but that we would need a tractor sizes gate to allow my uncle's tractor mounted rototiller in. For some reason I can't seem to convince her that rototilling is the same as shooting herself in the foot beyond year one.\n\nMy issue with this is that at our last place I was allowed (my mom is also a gardening freak, but with some control issues) a small plot in the yard to grow my legally allotted four cannabis plants (among other annuals). I had finished a degree in Plant Science by that point and so went balls-to-the-wall regenerative and no-till strategies since the plot I started with was a sandy bare patch next to our barn wall; the only non-planted area we had left in our yard.\n\nLong story short I can prove through the soil tests I paid for that in just over 3 years that I increased organic matter from 3% to over 7%, with CEC and pH buffering improving drastically as well. My parents could not stop talking about how much better my plants were doing than the other gardens, and how I was able to get away without watering during droughts when my mom had to soaker hose her plots multiple times a week. Time and time again I explained that it wasn't up to chance, and that I was making very specific choices to get where I was. For some reason however, my mom is stuck in the mentality that spring time requires ripping apart your soil and it's microbial community to shreds.\n\nI think part of the reason I'm having a hard time persuading her is that during COVID I was adamant about not taking people's personal lifestyle blogs as objective truth about how to live your life, but now when I try to show her people supporting no-till it's almost exclusively \"Emily's Extravagant Garden Blog\" type of websites. \n\nSo what do you think, do I continue advocating for soil health or do I say this isn't the hill I want to die on?",

For me, it’s brought waves of grief—not just over what’s happening now, but everything I’ve buried for decades.\n\nI had a traumatic childhood. My stepmother was narcissistic and emotionally abusive, and it left me with PTSD, anxiety, low self-esteem, and major confidence issues. My stepfather was never emotionally present, and I’ve never had a real relationship with any of my blood relatives. On top of that, I struggled with fertility issues for most of my adult life. So this stage of life—the closing of that door—hit me hard.\n\nThen, two years ago, I lost the one man who felt like a real father to me—my father-in-law. He passed away in his sleep from health issues, and it shook me to my core. It was the first time I had ever lost someone close to me. I don’t know any of my real family well enough to have felt those kinds of losses, and my step-parents are still alive. I hadn’t even lost a pet until last year, when my 15-year-old chihuahua passed away in his sleep.\n\nIt felt like my body, heart, and mind were all breaking down at once. The depression and anxiety came in hard. I started having health issues, including heart rate problems caused by chronic stress. My doctor gently nudged me toward lifestyle changes—less caffeine, red meat, sugar, and processed foods. I ended up going fully plant-based, and while it helped me feel better physically, holy moly is it expensive.\n\nSo this year, I decided to start gardening. It seemed practical—cut food costs—and maybe even therapeutic. But to be honest, I was scared. I’ve had a huge fear of snakes ever since I saw a kid get bit by a cottonmouth in 4th grade. So I started small—container gardening on my patio, high up where snakes and wild rabbits couldn’t easily get to my plants.\n\nI had this dusty herb kit my husband gave me the Christmas before. On a whim, I dumped the thyme, rosemary, peppermint, and basil seeds into their containers at the start of April, with zero research, just hope. I live in zone 10b (Central Florida/Pinellas), so I had no clue if it was even the right time to plant.\n\nTwo weeks later, little green shoots popped up. I couldn’t believe it. Something *I* planted was growing. Me—someone who’s spent her whole life trying to control everything, terrified of failure, used to things not working out—had planted something without a plan, and it *thrived*.\n\nThat was all it took. I was in. I started researching what grows in my zone, joined local FB gardening groups, and discovered things like fish fertilizer (which I weirdly love the smell of—it reminds me of water and life). I found a local grower on FB Marketplace and bought 12 starter plants—tomatoes, peppers, dill, papaya, passion fruit.\n\nFast-forward to now: I have over 40 containers on my patio. I’ve made my own potting mix, fallen in love with the texture of coco coir and perlite, and collected over 100 seed packets of herbs, fruits, veggies, and flowers. My patio is full of life—and I finally feel alive again too.\n\nGardening is teaching me to let go. To stop overplanning. To have faith in what I can’t control. To trust that even in decay, there’s growth coming. That *I* can still grow too.\n\nI know this was kind of a trauma dump, and I don’t have many people in my life who share this passion. But I wanted to put this out there in case someone else is hurting and wondering if gardening might help.\n\nIf you’re scared you’ll mess it up—just throw some seeds in a pot. See what happens. Nature might surprise you. And you might discover that yes, you *do* have a green thumb—and maybe even a way to heal. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/c69valcc853f1.jpg?width=4000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a521881d014aca16b2b16d3bcc5c1c92587909fd\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/0ot9g21f853f1.jpg?width=2252&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b28522614f5473ad0ec58f3a907a6b4c93d1ad50",

      "title": "Soil/Bed Prep: To Dig, or Not to Dig, that is the question.",
      "text": "Hi Team. I'm a semi-long time (9 years) gardener in 5b.  I rent, so my experiences have mostly been: inherit random bed untouched for who knows how many years, double dig while amending, plant, care, winter, amend, double dig, move.\n\nI'm coming up on my fourth year at my current place.  I've got two little raised beds that are 4'x4', connected, but separated by a (now rotting) wooden partition. Both beds were already here when I moved in, but according to the roommate had never been touched or moved around in the 4 years he's lived here prior to me.  Soil wasn't too bad considering, and continues to have a healthy makeup and consistency with my amendments and care.\n\nTwo years ago I tore up the weed blocker along my back fence and created a bed that is roughly 12'x2.6'.  The soil probably hadn't been turned over for.......well forever.\n\nThe past four planting seasons I double dig my garden the basic old school way: deep shovel depth, remove first trench, etc...\n\nI have amended with good healthy compost, perlite, general aeration, some blood meal and that's it.  The long trench has a tendency to compact a little given its recent glow-up, so it's gotten some extra TLC with the above mentioned amendments.\n\nI love double digging.  I love being out in the sun.  I love getting my hands in the soil.  I love the feeling of aerating the soil--seeing it rise a few inches with the new space.  I love tearing open bags of compost--sprinkling it into a trench and chopping it up and turning it over. I love that layer of dirt sweat I get all over my arms and legs and how dirty my knees get and the soil stained sock line.  I love whispering sweet nothings into the piles of soil and smoothing them out and combing their hair and telling them how beautiful they're going to be--how Spring prom is going to go so well and they'll be the belle of the ball.\n\n**BUT**.  I have a roommate who is highly (horse type?) ecologically minded and motivated and is becoming a staunch advocate of no-dig practices. I honestly don't know too much about it, other than vague ideas of keeping the microorganisms and their micro-ecology whole as a way of benefiting soil health in a longer run. But long story short, I'm getting pressure to leave the beds alone.\n\nKeep in mind: I'm the one who does all the heavy lifting here; planning, starts working, watering, etc... (which I love, as I've mentioned ad nauseam).\n\nWhat is everyone's opinion here?  Should I back off some of the joyful part of my gardening life and lean into the no-dig lifestyle?  I know I'll probably get a lot of \"Do what makes you happy, bro,\" and I appreciate that, but I'm also amenable (see what I did there?) to new practices and theories. I just want my soil to be so very healthy and happy, that way all my little plant friends can be similarly ecstatic when they move into their new home.  I'm originally from the midwest, so unfortunately (through upbringing, farming family background, manual labor jobs I've had all my life) the ethos of happy sweat, hard work has been ingrained in me from a young age.\n\nBeds are still tucked in at the writing of this post, but I'm itching.  I got the itch.  It's sunny. The squirrels are on the move. They're digging more than me right now. I'm gonna end up double digging the whole backyard if I'm not careful.  Please help!\n\n**TL;DR** Double dig like usual at fourth year of untouched spaces, or adopt roommate's pressure of no-dig? Benefits of both I'm not seeing?\n\nP.s. Thank you all so much for your time if you've read this far or are just taking the time to pitch in.  This community is truly a vast and knowledgeable gift and I am greatly appreciative of you all.  And sorry, as I'm sure this question has already been posed before, thousands of times.\n\n  \n***P.P.S. EDIT TWIST!!!*** Could I manage a mini hugelkultur through the long trench bed length of 12'x2.5'?",

      "text": "I will start by listing off the plants I started my garden with this year.  Blueberries, tomatoes, strawberries, 3 different mints, assorted herbs, raspberries, haskap, currant, cauliflower, beets, ghost peppers, and apple tree.  I was not expecting a good harvest this year especially the fruit, I am more planning to build up the plants over years into hopefully a mostly self sufficient lifestyle is the goal.  However it has not gone according to plan.  I am sure that the soil quality of my yard is bad and plays I'm assuming the biggest factor into why my plants are not doing well at all and if so I am wondering how to address it.  I do plan on moving certain plants next year mainly my blueberries and strawberries into a more full sun area as I did not plan where to put stuff very well admittingly, but even in my full sun spot where my raspberries and veggies are, the plants did not make much food.  For example I had no problem last year making ghost peppers, but they were in a pot and I pretty much did everything the exact same but this year they are in the ground and they have not produced a single pepper.  the beets leaves are only maybe 6'' high, and the blueberries, strawberries and raspberries produced extremely little fruit and in general I feel everything grew really slowly.  If it helps I will say for some reason the tomatoes have done exceptionally well but that is it.  I am curious if anyone could give me some tips on possibly feeding the plants properly next year I am also debating getting maybe cow manure, taking my plants out in spring and mix all of it into the dirt, or maybe some method of basically giving the dirt nutrients.  Again any tips or suggestions is very appreciated.",

I’m specially focused on cabbage and brassicas that can be mature enough to transplant early spring so they don’t bolt when it warms up in early summer. \n\nThe problem: I have a trip planned for 3 weeks at the end of February. I have done a deep google search, but I’m coming up empty handed on how to keep my seedlings watered while traveling. I unfortunately don’t have any friends/family in town available to pop by, so looking for a solution that I can set up to manually water for the time I am gone.

This latest round especially so. The doc thinks poison ivy but my garden is not wild. Literally converted grass areas to beds with the only things I planted growing. Doc suggested it could have traveled on the wind. \n\nAnother suggestion was chiggers and poison ivy/something combo. \n\nI don’t want to stop gardening. But I can’t be getting this sick every month I do a big project. \n\nHow can I fight possible bug bites (without pesticides) and mysteriously sourced poison ivy on the wind? I put on bug repellant when I garden now (not that it helped with the latest round of whatever I have) but poison in the air? \n\nHas anyone else had to rethink their gardening because of its possible effects on their body? (Not just heavy lifting) were you able to find a compromise?",

      "text": "I’m a very newbie gardener who just moved into our first home with a yard last year. \n\nInitially I didn’t really do anything in the yard because we were so focused on just getting all the basic furniture for our rooms. \n\nBut this spring the gardening bug has bit me and I started planting things in our yard. It started with just some annual potted flowers and a little azalea shrub but then I kept going back to the nursery to get more! I now have a rose, several perennial flowers, more annuals, and a little herb garden on my windowsill. And I bought a packet of zinnia seeds.  \n\nI thought I’d be happy just starting “small” with my garden - and so far working on it has brought me a lot of joy - but my head keeps spinning about all the potential ways to keep improving - adding more plants (maybe a maple tree), hanging more flower baskets, installing a paved patio area and paved path, having some kind of mini water feature (fountain/bird bath), a mini Japanese zen garden, a swinging bench and pergola, growing cut flowers so I can have fresh bouquets, climbing roses on trellises and an espalier camellia tree to cover the fencing… \n\nI’m feeling frustrated now because everything is so expensive and takes years of work to cultivate, and I don’t have a lot of time or patience to dedicate to gardening. I work a full time job, go to school part time, and I also enjoy traveling too much! While I love looking at pretty flowers, I just don’t think my dream garden is realistically achievable. A simple large outdoor container pot can cost $100, which is enough to make me give up on the dream. I’m also really squeamish around bugs - I had to get some aphids off my rose buds and it sucked. \n\nAnyway, just needed to vent. Life was simpler when I didn’t have a yard. Now I can’t stop thinking about it/what it could be 😅",

It was a larger diameter fabric hose that ran down the end of the rows that had couplers every so often to run a smaller fabric hose down the row. If I remember right there was no sprayer heads of any kind, they had a deal at the end of the row hoses to cap them off that looked like it could've also maybe been used to join another hose to it if you wanted to. I also have no idea of something like that could be simply hooked up to a regular water hose from the house to water my garden or if I should look for something smaller that might already have hose connectors on it.

I was worried my garden would be toast by the time I got back ... until my neighbor stepped in... but I had to do the following to help them survive (and not overburden my neighbors):\n\n* WiFi faucet timer with soaker hose\n* Aspirin water before leaving (heat wave)\n* Fertilizer to give plants a boost before the week alone\n\nWhat I’m wondering is:\n\n* Should I upgrade my faucet timer? What I used has only 2 zones with regular AA batteries and some Tuya controlled thing (I'm not super concerned about cybersecurity for only gardening \"smart\" devices)\n* Is a soaker hose the best option, or should I look at drip irrigation or something else?\n* Can certain plants (herbs, post-fruiting strawberries, tomatoes) go a full week without water in Zone 6a? Keep in mind that I have 3 raised beds and one in-ground bed.\n* My zucchini looked fine before the trip but are now on the decline... normal for early August?\n\nI’d love to hear how others prepare their gardens before being away, especially if it’s mid-summer.",

Eventually I hope to offer it as a product for gardeners who want smarter, more sustainable watering without overcomplicating things.\n\nI’d love to hear from you:\n\n* Would something like this help in your setup?\n* Would you prefer to control it from your phone, or let it work automatically?\n\n👉 If you're interested in updates when it's closer to release (no spam), feel free to leave your email here:  \n[**https://dashboard.mailerlite.com/forms/1490731/153179647794742519/share**](https://dashboard.mailerlite.com/forms/1490731/153179647794742519/share)\n\nThanks, and happy growing! 🌱",

Still wanna get my hands on. So maybe anyone has any experience?",

      "text": "I would like to start a small garden and grow a few plants this spring. I know it's not ideal, but I will be traveling for a month during the summer so I'm looking for plants that could survive being neglected for that long. I know it will affect the plant and the produce, but if I get them planted and cared for for the first month, are there any plants that could survive until I get back? I will be trying some natural ways of weed suppression to try and help them and typically it rains a good amount until August when I'll be back.",

What would you plant if you suddenly had a half-acre garden? The garden is in full sun, zone 8b, and good soil.  \n\nI'm looking for things I can plant, set up automated watering, and come back a few times a week to check on it.  I won't have time to do much more than that.\n\nMy thought is to plant long-season crops that grow for a few months and then are harvested once.  Or things that take up more space than I have room for in my own garden. So far I've got onions, leeks, potatoes, melons, and winter squash. Any other suggestions?",

They just put everything out this week (4 weeks from last expected frost, but I think we will be closer to 2-3 based on our weather patterns). \n\nI’m trying to resist going early and getting the “best” picks and also avoiding the risk of missing out on certain varieties I really want to try that I have missed out on in the past. However, I don’t have the time to be moving dozens of plants in and out every day because they are hardened off already by the nursery. So do I get them and keep them under my lights and then just redo the hardened off period? Do I wait 2 weeks and get them then so I’m just doing it all together and risk missing certain things?",

The idea is to help people who love plants — but sometimes forget to water, travel, or just want a more hands-off experience.\n\n# Some key goals:\n\n* No wiring or manual timers\n* Smart watering based on real conditions\n* Solar-powered and battery operated\n* Optional mobile setup and insights\n\nI’d really appreciate your thoughts:\n\n* Have you tried any smart watering devices? What annoyed you?\n* Would you use something like this — or do you prefer to water manually?\n* What would make this *actually helpful* to you?\n\nThis is part of a product I’m building, and your input helps shape what it becomes.\n\nIf you're curious or want updates when it's ready, you can leave your email here — no spam:  \n[https://dashboard.mailerlite.com/forms/1490731/153179647794742519/share](https://dashboard.mailerlite.com/forms/1490731/153179647794742519/share)",

For now, I’ll be growing food for myself and my partner, maybe even our pets, and I’ve been daydreaming about upgrading to aquaponics at some point down the road.\n\nIt’s got me wondering—has anyone else thought about how we, as home gardeners, can help our communities through what’s looking to become very food insecure times? It’d be great to hear how others are thinking about this.\n\nEdit:\nI was going to leave it alone but a lot of people seem very concerned I’m going full doomsday prep or fully replacing my grocery runs with a garden. I assure you that I love my favorite snacks far too much for that 😆",

      "text": "This is my first year really growing food. I planted a few variations of the same thing in my raised bed garden. For example, I have due to two different types of shelling peas, Green arrow and Alaska. The Green arrow peas are so much sweeter and tastier. The Alaska peas are basically shite. I also planted two different kinds of snap peas, one of which is basically inedible, just way too fibrous to eat whole. I want to pull them so badly, but it took so much effort to grow them that I feel so bad about it. I also have way too many edible flowers and the garden bin containing them is just getting incredibly overcrowded. The borage is flopping over and crushing everything. Borage is way more productive than I thought it would be. So what would you do? Should I just leave them and chalk it up to lessons learned - don't plant them next year, or would you just rip them out right now and not bother dealing with them at all because they suck?",

      "text": "Before the question. Small amount of infoSo I made a small terraced garden bed, about 8f by 6 ft. We are testing out the spots viability and it seems to be working fine for the zucchini and green beans. The summer squash is flowering well but havent seen a single one form a veggie yet, but it might just take a bit longer than the zucchini. We also have a single watermelon plant, a few potatoes, etc. We will be expanding it next year by about double the gardening space\n\nWe want to have a steady supply of some of them. Zucchini, summer squash and green beans will be priority next year.\n\nMy question, Is there a chart or website or does anyone have info on how much needs to be planted to be able to collect enough to regularly eat said food? How many green beans plants need to be planted to have green beans as a side dish a few times a week for a family of 3 that kind of thing.",

Basically, it’s a minimalist system using compact containers, and it works indoors. I’ve been testing it for about two weeks and already have herbs, spinach, and green onions sprouting.\n\nThought I’d share in case anyone else here is trying to boost food independence without a homestead. If anyone wants to check it out, let me know and I’ll DM you the guide I used.",

      "text": "(solved) Hello team, bit of a whoops on my end.\n\nI used some **Ibadex rooting hormone powder** on a few Carolina Reaper cuttings before realizing the label says **“Do not use on or around food plants/items.”** Too late — plants have rooted and are growing well, but now I’m stuck wondering:\n\n**Can I still safely eat the fruit from these plants, or is that a hard no?**\n\nI applied the powder just on the stem ends when rooting the cuttings — didn’t spray the plant or anything like that. But I know some synthetic rooting hormones (like IBA or NAA) can be absorbed and move through the plant.\n\nAlso wondering:\n\n* Are the **seeds** safe to save and grow from?\n* If I grow a second generation from those seeds, is that a clean restart?\n* Any solid **organic alternatives** for rooting hot peppers in the future?\n\nWould appreciate any advice from folks who’ve dealt with this or know more about the long-term risks. Cheers!",
