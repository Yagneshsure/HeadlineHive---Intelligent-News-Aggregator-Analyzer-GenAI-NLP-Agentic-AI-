I'm a 26-year-old progressive running for Congress in [Illinois' Ninth District](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illinois%27s_9th_congressional_district) because (1) I think there's a new way we can do politics and (2) *Democrats aren't -- and haven't been -- doing enough.* A little bit about me:\n\n>I am an expert in far-right narratives and misinformation, having worked at outlets like Media Matters, Mother Jones, and Zeteo News, both in research and original reporting capacities. My video explainers about right-wing BS have amassed tens of millions of views across platforms (here's my [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/@katmabu) and [TikTok](https://www.tiktok.com/@katmabu) for anyone interested). I'm also often targeted by the right. Elon Musk has personal beef with me, along with Tucker Carlson, Laura Loomer, Libs of TikTok, and a bunch of other unhinged figures who now control our most important institutions.\n\n>I decided to run for Congress because I got sick of waiting around for the Democratic Party, our supposed opposition party, to actually *do something*. I want to use my expertise to properly resist Trump's authoritarian agenda and my lived experience to push for a bolder vision that prioritizes working Americans over billionaires.\n\n>**We are a grassroots campaign.** We raised more than $400,000 in our first two weeks, have over 11,000 individual donors, and our average donation is around $33. Oh, and we're taking **no** corporate cash. Best of all, our money isn't getting wasted on consultants and pricey ads. We're using it for public service projects and making sure our events, outreach, and mutual aid efforts are accessible to *everyone* in the district, regardless of income.\n\nIf you want to know more about me and what I believe, you can go to [katforillinois.com](http://katforillinois.com/). And if you want to help us support our community \\*and\\* win an election, you can [donate here](https://secure.actblue.com/donate/abu-ama).\n\nOkay, that's enough yapping. Ask me anything!!\n\n[PROOF](https://bsky.app/profile/katmabu.bsky.social/post/3lmfxf6yns227)\n\nEDIT: Thank you to everyone who came and asked questions! I'm so sorry I couldn't get to every single person but if you're in the district and I didn't answer your question, drop us a line at [hello@katforillinois.com](mailto:hello@katforillinois.com) or come to one of our events! We'll be announcing more soon. Thank you again!!",

She is a great person -- always pushing me to do the right thing! Terrible!\n\nIt seems as though President Trump is quite explicitly and actively targeting Nordstrom because of his family's business engagements with the company. This could end up hurting Nordstrom, which could have a subsequent \"chilling\" effect that would discourage other companies from trifling with Trump family businesses. \n\n* Is this a conflict of interest? If so, how serious is it?\n\n* Is this self dealing? I.e., is Trump's motive enrichment of himself or his family? Or might he have some other motive for doing this?\n\n* Given that Trump made no pretenses about the purpose for his attack on Nordstrom, what does it say about how he envisions the duties of the President? Is the President concerned with conflict of interest or the perception thereof?\n\n* What will be the consequences, and who might bring them about? Could a backlash from this event come in the form of a lawsuit? New legislation? Or simply discontentment among the electorate?",

      "text": "In recent politics there have been two major political pushes for diversity and equality.  However, both instances led to backlashes that have led to an environment that is arguably worse than it was before.  In 2008 Obama was the first black president one a massive wave of hope for racial equality and societal reforms.  This led to one of the largest political backlashes in modern politics in 2010, to which  democrats have yet to fully recover from.  This eventually led to birtherism which planted some of the original seeds of both Trump and MAGA. The second massive political push promoting diversity and equality was in 2018 with the modern woman election and 2020 with racial equality being a top priority.  Biden made diversifying the government a top priority.  This led to an extreme backlash among both culture and politics with anti-woke and anti-DEI efforts.  This resent contributed to Trump retaking the presidency.  Now Trump is pushing to remove all mentions of DEI in both the private and public sectors.  He is hiding all instances that highlight any racial or gender successes.  His administration is pushing culture to return to a world prior to the civil rights era.  \n\nThis leads me to my question.  Will there be a backlash for this?  How will it occur?  How can democrats lead and take advantage of the backlash while trying to mitigate a backlash to their own movement?  It seems as though every attempt has led to a stronger and more severe response.  \n\nAdditional side questions.  How did public opinion shift so drastically from 2018/2020 which were extremely pro-equality to 2024 which is calling for a return of the 1950s?",

      "title": "How did the generation that once created powerful political protest music come to embrace Trump?",
      "text": "In the 1960s and 1970s, music was a powerful tool for political expression and protest. Songs like Bob Dylan's \"The Times They Are A-Changin'\", Edwin Starr’s \"War\", and The Beatles’ \"Revolution\" became anthems for change, speaking directly to the injustices of the time — civil rights struggles, the Vietnam War, and economic inequality. These songs echoed a collective desire for progress and a better future.\n\nFast forward to today, and many members of the Baby Boomer generation—the very ones who helped create this powerful music—are now among the most ardent supporters of Donald Trump. This is especially striking considering how much of the political activism and social consciousness of the 60s and 70s was a direct reaction to authoritarianism, injustice, and the excesses of the elite.\nSome examples of iconic political songs from that era:\n\n\t•\tBob Dylan – \"The Times They Are A-Changin’\" (1964): This song captured the essence of the 1960s political shift, urging people to embrace change and fight for justice.\n\n\t•\tEdwin Starr – \"War\" (1970): A powerful anti-Vietnam War anthem that called out the horrors of conflict and questioned the motives behind it.\n\n\t•\tThe Beatles – \"Revolution\" (1968): A song that challenged the status quo and called for a revolutionary change, reflective of the broader counterculture movements of the time.\n\n\t•\tBuffalo Springfield – \"For What It’s Worth\"(1966): A protest song addressing the social unrest and growing tension in the country, often interpreted as a critique of government repression.\n\nThese songs weren’t just catchy tunes; they were calls to action, social commentary, and even direct criticism of the establishment.\nSo, here’s the question: How did a generation that pushed for progressive political change through their music end up aligning with a political figure whose rhetoric and policies seem to contrast so starkly with the values of the 60s and 70s?\n\nIs it a case of cultural nostalgia clouding their judgment? A result of shifting political landscapes? Or has there been a fundamental change in values and priorities within this group?\n\nHow can the generation that created and embraced these songs now support someone like Trump? Was it the power of the political system or the media that shifted their perspectives, or something deeper? What do you all think?",

To what extent should institutional norms or rules be adhered to on a consistent basis? Do those rules and norms provide an important function for government, or are they weaknesses to be exploited for maximum political gain to effectuate preferred change? Should the Senate particularly, and Congress in general, limit itself only to consistency when it comes to Supreme Court decisions regarding constitutional requirements, or is the body charged with more responsibility? \n\nAnd, specifically, what can we expect for the process of seating justices on the Supreme Court going forward?",

      "text": "According to [polls](https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2021/10/26/growing-share-of-americans-say-they-want-more-spending-on-police-in-their-area/), the slogan \"Defund the police\" embraced by elements of the Black Lives Matter movement and some politicians and activists on the left is wildly unpopular. It has been used by Republicans and conservatives this election season to hammer Democrats as being \"soft on crime\" and unsupportive of policing given the sharp rise in crime since the pandemic. Most Democrats, even in liberal enclaves, have disavowed that message even if it alienates those progressives who wanted it to become a reality in some form or fashion.\n\nPutting that aside, how did it come to pass that such a slogan like \"defund the police\" could be considered so toxic a political brand so quickly? Did activists not know that calling for diminished policing was counterproductive? Did they want the policy implemented regardless of political repercussions?\n\nHave those on the pro-police right been vindicated or will those reforms like cashless bail and decriminalizing \"minor\" offenses be still on the books in blue areas after the midterm election regardless of voters' wishes? How should activists who want to pursue \"defund the police\" go from here especially with the 2024 presidential election up next?",

      "text": "Unlike 2016 where he was a genuine upset surprise to everyone and a clear underdog in 2020, in 2024 Trump was cruising to victory when Biden dropped out in late July after his disastrous debate performance. Assume nothing much changes between now and November, if Trump manages to defeat Harris, what will be the political headline story of why he accomplished it and thwarted Democrats with their replacement switch to Kamala?\n\nWill it be a reserved undercurrent of change from Biden, even if he is no longer running for re-election, but Harris is tied to his administration? May it be the hidden favorability Trump gained from being shot at and nearly assassinated? Will it be Harris being unwilling to literally meet the press in terms of having many interviews and press conferences that make voters weary of her campaign policies? It might just be that voters want Trump for one final term as president and then go back to normal elections.\n\nWhat do you think will be the narrative as to that reason why voters elected Trump should it happen?",

Some of Mr. Sanders’s closest advisers began mapping out the financial and political considerations for him and what scenarios would give him the maximum amount of leverage for his policy proposals, and some concluded that it may be more beneficial for him to suspend his campaign.\n\n\n\nWhat will be the consequences for the Democratic party moving forward, both in the upcoming election and more broadly?

Clearly we're not at that point yet, as the majority party is pursuing both tax cuts AND spending increases.\n\nI specifically wonder about DEFENSE spending - this seems to be the one area that nobody dares to cut, but it seems to be the biggest area that we could cut back on.\n\nEDIT: I am *not* talking about the debt ceiling.

      "text": "On July 5, billionaire Elon Musk took to X to announce the creation of a new political party: the \"America Party,\" which, in Musk's words, \"actually represents the 80% in the middle.\" It's certainly a bold move for Musk, who, just a few months ago, donated millions of dollars to Donald Trump in an effort to support his presidential campaign. Since then, however, Musk's relationship with Trump has quickly deteriorated, leading to a very public feud in which the two exchanged insults and revelations about one another.\n\nEven before July 5, Musk had openly mused about forming his own political party--for example, he created multiple X polls on the idea, of which each garnered over a million votes. Some election pollsters went as far as to survey Americans about whether they would support such a party, to which nearly one-quarter of respondents said they would be at least somewhat likely to do so. While third-parties in the U.S. have historically failed to gain significant traction, the \"America Party\" seems to be polling considerably better than previous efforts. Combined with Musk's substantial resources, this raises questions about its potential impact on the political landscape.\n\nSo, what do you think? Is the \"America Party\" already set up for doom (i.e.: they receive a minuscule portion of the vote), or does it have the potential to disrupt the so-called \"Republican-Democratic uniparty,\" as Musk calls it? Will it merely split the conservative vote by swaying right-leaning independents away from the GOP, or could it turn the next election into a competitive three-way race? And what might this mean for Democrats and others across the aisle?",

      "text": "Carroll filed the civil lawsuit in November 2022 under the “New York State Adult Survivors Act,” a state bill which opened a look-back window for sexual assault allegations like Carroll’s with long-expired statutes of limitation \\[In her case 1996 battery\\].\n\n[New York Adult Survivors Act Effective on Nov 24 2022 (natlawreview.com)](https://www.natlawreview.com/article/new-york-adult-survivors-act)\n\nA federal jury \\[6 men and 3 women\\] began deliberations Tuesday \\[05/09/2023\\] in E. Jean Carroll's battery \\[of various degrees that could have included rape or unconsented touching\\]; they found middle ground of sexual abuse and defamation, a day after attorneys for both sides made final arguments.\n\n**Highlights: Arguments and Evidence**: In asking the jury to find Trump liable for battery in 1996, Carroll attorney Roberta Kaplan said: \"He thinks he can get away with it here.\"\n\nAttorneys for Trump, who claims that the 1996 incident never happened, told the jury that Carroll failed to make her case. They said the plaintiff made up the story for financial gain and political revenge against the former president.\n\nThe trial, in federal court in Manhattan heard seven days of testimony from 11 witnesses called by Carroll, who alleged she was raped by Trump and also alleged Trump defamed her by calling her a liar when she wrote about the alleged attack. Although Trump didn't call any witnesses and decided not to attend the trial. A video was presented for the jury from a deposition Trump gave in this matter.\n\nOver the course of three days, Carroll testified in detail about her account of the alleged rape, her response at the time, and her behavior in the decades since. She said Trump raped her in a dressing room in the lingerie department on the sixth floor of Bergdorf Goodman.\n\nShe said she believed the attack occurred on a Thursday evening in the spring of 1996, but that she wasn’t certain of the timing. And she said she told two friends right away but never told anyone else until 2019, when the “Me Too” movement inspired her to publicize her account.\n\nSeveral of her primary witnesses recalled contemporaneous event testifying called to report what Trump had done.  Lisa Birnbach, for instance testified that Carroll called her in the early evening one spring night in 1996 and told her that she had just left Bergdorf, where she had encountered Trump, who assaulted her in a dressing room, pulling down her tights and penetrating her with his penis. Birnbach said she told Carroll that Trump had raped her and advised her to report the incident to the police.\n\nAnother witness, Carol Martin testified, Carroll came to her a day or two after the alleged incident and told her about it. “She said, ‘Trump attacked me,’” Martin said, recalling that Carroll was visibly upset. “I was completely floored,” Martin said. She said she cautioned Carroll against taking any steps in response to the incident “because it was Donald Trump and he had a lot of attorneys and he would bury her.” Evidently, the Jury choose to believe Carroll and her witnesses.\n\nAs noted, Trump did not attend the trial or give testimony in court \\[a portion of his deposition was played, however\\]. Since it is a civil trial his decision to not testify could have been used by the jury in assessing liability.\n\nApplicable Standards of Proof: In a civil trial guilt or innocence is not adjudged; only civil liability is. Standard of proof is generally a preponderance of the evidence \\[meaning, more likely than not, or more than 50%.\\]  Not beyond a reasonable doubt, which is the highest of three standards of proof and used in criminal cases, the middle one being clear and convincing, used in certain types of civil cases and is also applicable here with respect to part of her defamation claim.\n\nTo prove her defamation claim, the jury would have to find that Carroll’s legal team proved by the preponderance of the evidence that Trump knew it was false when he published the statement about Carroll and knowingly exposed her to public ridicule. They must also determine that she proved by clear and convincing evidence that the statement was false, and that Trump made the statement with actual malice. \\[Clear and convincing evidence leaves no substantial doubt in the juror’s mind and establishes that the proposition is highly probable.\\]\n\nIs this verdict likely to erode Trump's current status as the GOP front runner or encourage other GOP runners to use this verdict against Trump as a political talking point?",

      "title": "US Politics: What if *neither* Biden nor Trump run in 2024?",
      "text": "Hi, all. First time poster, long time lurker. I've just been pondering a distinct possibility lately. Nothing crazy, and some of you have probably considered it too: What if neither of the seemingly likely candidates for 2024 *actually run* in 2024? Or, to put it even more narrowly, what if neither gets their respective party's nomination?\n\nI'm not partisan myself, just asking questions and thinking out loud. Biden's literally the oldest man to ever be elected president. It's not outside the realm of possibility that he won't be the Democratic candidate in 2024, either by choice or for health reasons (including death, I hate to say). Meanwhile Trump is as polarizing and unpredictable as ever. He could lose the primary, or just decide not to run at all. I'm not a gambling man, but I'd say his status being the Republican is far from a safe bet.\n\nSo we have a very real chance of what amounts to a termed out, open season race in what is arguably *supposed to* be a bid for a second term presidency. That's actually the first time such a thing has happened, let alone been possible, in my lifetime. Kinda crazy.\n\nSo, to recap, two main questions:\n\n1. How likely do you think a 2024 election with neither Biden nor Trump is?\n2. What happens in the event of this?",

And within politics, it’s undeniable that doubt and mistrust and bias have come to shape the US public’s perception of politics. And we’ve got this extreme polarization between two parties that have two extremely different versions of reality that cannot both exist if there isn’t an agreement on what actually occurs based on empirical evidence or facts.\n\nI was curious if there’s ever going to be anything after this era or is post-truth always going to be an integral aspect of US politics indefinitely?

Other than a brief moment in 2011 with Occupy, the 2014/2020 BLM protests, and the women’s march at Trump’s first inauguration there have been little protest movements. Why did they happen so much more in the early 1900s and the 1960s? Are people less educated now than back then despite access to better resources? In general I just am confused why there is so much apathy when something such as a general strike involving tens of millions WOULD be so effectual? Is it organizational issues?",

      "text": "Between 1916 and 1970, approximately 6 million blacks moved from the rural South to cities in the North and West to escape poverty and Jim Crow laws. Prior to the Great Migration, 90% of America’s black population lived in the South, primarily in rural areas. Today, about half the black population lives in the South, and 80% live in urban areas. \n\nCharles Blow, an African-American author and journalist, is calling for a reverse Great Migration, with millions of blacks moving from the North and West back to the South, with the goal of having an African-American majority in at least one Southern state. (Blow himself recently moved from New York to Atlanta.) \n \nHe says the current political system is corrupt. He points to the numerous efforts to make voting more difficult in Republican states in order to keep the white majority in power.   \n\nA black majority state would, he believes, have politicians (whether they are personally black or not) would represent a radical power restructuring. Politicians would have to be responsive to black constituents at every level of government, from local to federal, rather than viewing them as part of a coalition. \n\nHe points to Georgia — where the black population has doubled over the last thirty years, now 33% of the state’s population — voting for Biden and two Democratic Senators as an example of the power blacks could wield by concentrating their numbers. \n\nThe black majority state would not be a utopia for blacks, he says, no more than white majority states are utopias for white people. But it will give black people real political power, and perhaps begin to address systemic racism in America. \n\nSome counterarguments Blow answers in his book, *The Devil You Know: A Black Power Manifesto*, and in interviews about it: \n\n* It’s not easy to pick up and move. \n\nHe says this is a revolutionary act to seize power. It shouldn’t be easy. \n\n* Blacks already have political power in blue states in the North and West. \n\nHe argues that blacks do not have power in blue states. California, for example, is only 5% black and doesn’t have a single black-majority city. Democrats do not need black voters to win in California. Blacks have been asking the white majorities in the North and West for equity and justice for decades, but aren’t getting them. He says as long as blacks have to ask instead of having the power to do, the system will never change. \n\n* There are no jobs in the South. \n\nHe argues there’s also no jobs for African-Americans in the North and West, citing unemployment and poverty rates. He says a black majority state would allow blacks more economic opportunities than are available in white majority states. \n\n* People can’t afford to move. \n\nThe reverse of the first argument, that African-Americans in the North and West are too poor to relocate. Blow cites the numerous examples of migrations, including the original Great Migration, of poor people moving. \n\n* This isn’t realistic. It couldn’t happen. \n\nBlow points to the so-called “hippie invasion” of Vermont, where an influx of about 50,000 young people in the 1970s — representing about 12% of the state’s population at the time — led to a transition of what had been a conservative state into a liberal one. \n\n* The white majority is declining anyway. No state will have a white majority in the future. \n\nBlow argues that whenever the white majority is challenged, the definition of white is broadened to include new demographic groups that were previously non-white — Irish and Italians, for example. Perhaps American-born Latinos or East Asians will be the next group absorbed in order to keep whites as the majority. \n\nFor additional reading: \n\n* [Article on Salon](https://www.salon.com/2021/02/21/charles-blow-the-key-to-building-black-power-is-to-reclaim-the-south/)  \n\n* [Interview with KQED](https://www.kqed.org/forum/2010101881952/the-devil-you-know-charles-m-blow-on-a-black-power-manifesto) \n\n* [Interview with Larry Wilmore](https://www.theringer.com/2021/2/21/22294409/charles-blow-on-his-black-manifesto-of-great-migration-back-to-the-south)",

And I am genuinely curious - what happened to drive such a huge wedge between people? Where I'm from (a small European country), politics are important, but they don't define who we are as people and I have a lot of friends who hold very different political beliefs from me, however, it has never been an issue and generally has no effect on our friendship. Same with my friends in the U.S.A. - I have friends that identify both as Republican and Democrat, and have never felt like that has been an issue or had an impact on how I view those people. Furthermore - when I listen to what they say - it has become clear to me that at the core majority of them (despite their political alignment) want the same things, namely:\n\n\\* A safe environment for them and their family  \n\\* Ability to provide for themselves and their family  \n\\* Affordable housing  \n\\* Freedom to practice their religion / not practice religion (be atheist without scrutiny)  \n\\* Healthcare that doesn't break the bank and make them feel safe in case something goes wrong  \n\\* Freedom to exercise their freedom of speech\n\nSo how is it that there is such a - for lack of a better term - hatred between people these days? And why is it that the loudest voices are the ones of the crazies on both sides - the extreme left and extreme right? Is there really no more middle ground and place for people to have a peaceful dialogue?\n\nThank you in advance for your insights.",

      "title": "Rank Choice Voting (RCV) has been proposed as a way to reduce partisanship, allow diversity of political parties and candidates, and empower voters. Would it work?",
      "text": "RCV means that instead of voting for one candidate, candidates are ranked -- who is the first choice, who is second, who third, etc. When votes are counted, a candidate receiving 50% or more of the votes immediately wins. If no candidate receives 50%, then the second choice of votes which supported the candidate with the fewest votes are given to the other candidates -- and so on for other candidates with lower vote totals until one candidate gets 50%. For example, in the 2004 presidential election in Florida, Bush received 2,912,790 votes, Gore 2,912,253 (a margin of 537 votes) and Ralph Nader received 97,488. If there had been RCV, the second choice of Nader voters would have been distributed between Bush and Gore.\n\nRCV advocates suggest that RCV allows a greater range of candidates and political parties while freeing voters from worrying whether they should vote for a candidate with a better chance of winning rather than a less popular candidate who they would really prefer. In addition, since candidates must compete for second-choice support from their opponents’ supporters they will have less incentive to run negative campaigns. \n\nRCV is used in Alaska, Nebraska (for the state legislature) and in many U.S. cities. Would it be beneficial to use more widely? What obstacles would prevent its wider adoption?",

      "title": "Starting in the mid 2000's, the frequency of American mass shootings has skyrocketed. What political or cultural shifts has caused this?",
      "text": "It's well known that America has a unique mass shooting problem.\n\nAccording to this [graph,](https://www.statista.com/statistics/811487/number-of-mass-shootings-in-the-us/) America has seen the amount of mass shootings steadily climb since the year 2004. I don't know exactly how Statista defines a \"mass shooting,\" but this is the only graph I could find that goes back until the 80's. I believe that the curve itself is well represented, as it is roughly corroborated by [this](https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2012/12/mass-shootings-mother-jones-full-data/) data from Mother Jones.\n\nNote that, from 1982 to \\~2004, America saw relatively few mass shootings, compared to recent years. But, starting in 2004, the frequency of mass shootings has been steadily rising. The question I'm trying to ask is:\n\n**What political/cultural events has started this sudden shift in 2004? And why does it get worse every year?**\n\nBecause it's relevant, I will outline some facts about American firearm ownership, but here's a disclaimer- I am NOT debating/debunking the effectiveness of gun control measures, nor am I seeking to push any agendas. That is not the purpose of this post. I'm trying to understand the *root psychological and/or cultural cause* of America's violence epidemic.\n\nBecause, while guns are a major component in mass shootings (as in, shootings cannot occur without a gun), *the American availability of firearms doesn't seem to be the only factor.*\n\n* From 1982, up until the assault weapons ban, gun control was relatively lax. During that time period, America saw relatively few mass shootings (compared to recent years), which may show that the availability of firearms didn't really effect mass shootings.\n* Consider that in Switzerland, a country with [only light gun control](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firearms_regulation_in_Switzerland) (it's comparable to the US, though not *quite* as lax), mass shootings are [exceedingly rare](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Mass_shootings_in_Switzerland). *Why might this be?*\n\nIt's worth noting that the [Federal Assault Weapons Ban](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Assault_Weapons_Ban#Definition_of_assault_weapon) expired in 2004, which does correlate with our sudden spike, though [the actual effectiveness of the AWB (in the stopping of mass shootings) is debated.](https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2019/aug/07/bill-clinton/did-mass-shooting-deaths-fall-under-1994-assault-w/)\n\nSo, with that background information, what could've caused this sudden spike?\n\nEDIT: Some legitimate concerns have been raised about the data, I have this in response: \n\nOn the definition of \"mass shooting:\" Notoriously difficult to actually define. My second source, the Mother Jones page that tracks mass shootings, uses this definition:\n\nhttps://www.motherjones.com/crime-justice/2012/08/what-is-a-mass-shooting/\n\nI am unsure if my first source (the Statista graph) uses the same definition (Likely not). However, it is important to note that the trend is mirrored in both sources, and so I've decided that the purpose of this post still stands.\n\nDouble edit: For those still commenting, I must reiterate the purpose of this post, as I've seen a lot of comments that miss the point. We are seeking to understand *what happened in/ around 2004 to spark this rise in mass shootings.* Many comments are instead a variation on the following:\n\n\"America has guns, of course there will be mass shootings.\"\n\nYes, you are right. A mass shooting cannot occur without a gun. But that doesn't answer the question of this post, it only leads to people getting in fights and citing FBI statistics.",

Even supposed feature pieces that were routine in previous eras have gone wanting except for the occasional one by a \"maverick\" like Rep. Liz Cheney or Maryland gov. Larry Logan.\n\nThose quoted in the article say that it's not worth it for Republicans or conservatives to spend time replying to journalists from these outlets because they surmise the outcome will likely be a slanted hit job against them in contrast to fawning coverage of Democrats and liberals from these same journalists. Whether or not this accusation has merit conservatives believe it such that they have gravitated to mostly friendly media like Fox News, National Review and the like.\n\nDo you think it is wise or healthy for one political party to not engage with the mainstream press? Who do you think is at fault for this development? Should the press change to account for this, perhaps by hiring voices who take a conservative worldview in mind when reporting on politics?\n\nIf you are a Democrat or liberal, do you care that conservatives perceive mainstream journalism as the enemy? If you are a Republican or conservative, do you care that your party's top voices are restricting themselves to a much smaller, if friendly audience?",

      "text": "Trumps rise to power was primarily due to a populist wave that his supporters envisioned him aggressively fighting for them.  This was seen with his supporters adoring his strong man act and fighting against democrats at every turn.  Since then, the Republican Party has heavily leaned into strategy.  DeSantis rise from a largely unknown politician to governor was due to his large support to trumps policies.  Texas politicians have led the way for adopting aggressive Republican policies. South Dakota governor aggressively pushed against any sort of action against covid.  The list of passed policies and actions are numerous with blanket refusal of cooperation towards investigations, passing tax cuts for the rich, pushing against election results, passing laws to make it more difficult for voting, putting more election power in the hands of republicans, banning abortion at 6 weeks, banning mask mandates, banning critical race theory or other studies regarding race, banning transgender athletes from participating in athletics, to blocking Supreme Court nominations and heavily gerrymandering congressional districts.  \n\nThis political strategy has proven t be extremely divisive.  Supporters on the right have heavily praised their politicians and a common response from republicans is “elections have consequences”.  Their opponents heavily attack these politicians with a variety of critical attacks.  When it comes down to it, the large majority of these policies range from being mildly unpopular to heavily distasteful rom the general public.  \n\nThe question is, is this strategy politically savy or suicide?  The most notorious example for this is the North Carolina bathroom bill.  This likely resulted inthe governor losing the next election.  I’m 2018 there was a strong backlash with a democratic wave.  In 2020 democrats won Georgia due to motivation risen from losing the 2018 election.  Yet despite this, republicans have maintained legislative control in NC and won the house, senate and presidency in 2016, gained senate seats in 2018 over performed expectations in 2020 for house and state elections.  There is a strong sentiment that republicans are expected to easily retake the house in 2022.  Republicans have also shown to consistently maintain control over state governments across the US.  So while republicans may lose some battles, on the whole the general public does not punish the Republican Party.  On the contrary that their base is more devoted than ever.\n\nIs this strategy good?  What does it say about the Republican Party?  What can democrats learn from this?",

      "text": "Recently, the politics of Canada has rapidly evolved due to Trump's threats from the south of the border, giving the Liberal party a rapid rise in polls (exhibit A: https://www.axios.com/2025/03/05/trump-tariffs-canada-liberal-party) to the point that the election now seems pretty competitive now. This was not the case last year when the Liberals were falling behind in polls by double digits. But Trump changed all of that.\n\nWhich begs the question: Why did the Liberals benefit from Trump's threats and not the Conservatives? You can imagine a scenario where Trump's tariffs makes Canadians further sour on the Liberals and they drop further down in polling as incumbents. But that didn't happen, and the opposite occurred (as shown by polls). \n\nSo why did the Liberals benefit politically from Trump's threats but not the Conservatives? There was no guarantee that either party would benefit, but one clearly did while the other did not. So why?",

There is still pressure to have the other two presidents resign as well.\n\nWhat do you make of the controversy whereby Jewish students feel threaten by others on campus and being targeted for antisemitism where in any other situation (blacks, trans, etc.) the students found to do this sort of behavior would be punished? Should colleges keep their hate speech codes or assert that free speech is acceptable? How will this play into the broader politics of the debate about antisemitism and the Israeli-Gaza conflict?",

If so what are the items that should make the list?",

      "text": "I just read [this piece by David Wasserman](http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-political-process-isnt-rigged-it-has-much-bigger-problems/) that discusses what he finds are the real problems with the way we elect representatives and how they have been increasing in recent decades.  He breaks it down into 5 primary problems:\n\n1. **Geographic sorting**: partly through gerrymandering but much more through our own decisions to live near people with similar political leanings as us, we have created a situation where very few Congressional seats are competitive and Presidential elections are decided by increasingly fewer voters.\n\n2. **Straight-ticket voting**: increasingly less people are voting for candidates in different parties and simply voting straight-ticket.  This makes races even less competitive and leads to most races being little more than a census of party members in an area.  \n\n3. **Primaries have become the new general elections**: because so few seats are competitive, the real races for most seats are in the primaries which have particularly low turnout dominated mostly by the most partisan voters, leading to representatives that are even more partisan.\n\n4. **Congress grinds to a halt**: because of number three, representatives are increasingly unwilling to collaborate and/or compromise for fear of being primaried.  They feel they have to maintain ideological purity in their votes and rhetoric.  This leads to Congress having difficulty accomplishing anything.\n\n5. **Anger at politicians grows**: all of the above leads to anger and disillusionment from the electorate who grow increasingly frustrated with Washington and the political system.  This leads to the rise of candidates who stoke these fears and campaign against these establishment systems like Donald Trump and Bernie Sanders.\n\nI know many of these concepts aren't exactly new ideas, but I found this piece compelling for two main reasons.  First, as FiveThirtyEight is known for, he cited a lot of data to back up these claims.  Second, I think the organization of these five points in this order is excellent.  Starting at the beginning, each problem leads to the next problem.\n\n* What do you think about these arguments?\n\n* Is this a growing problem that will continue to make things worse?\n\n* Are there other root causes besides increased partisanship and geographic sorting that you can think of?\n\n* How can we address this issue if you think it needs addressed in any way?\n\n* If they aren't addressed, what do you think the next step in symptoms is beyond anger at politicians?\n\n* Is this ultimately a threat to our system of government as we know it?",

They have gone after them on \"defund the police\", progressive prosecutors, no cash bail, and generally that liberals are \"soft on crime and criminals\".\n\nWhether or not this is true, it is this perception that is driving much of the recent campaign advertising. While some Democrats had for a short time in 2020 after the George Floyd killing sided with those calling for \"defund the police\", they have largely abandoned that claim and returned to a more police-friendly stance. Yet, Republicans are still attacking them for it.\n\nWhy do you think that Democrats have been recently and historically defensive about the crime issue in political campaigns? What can/should they do about it? Deflect the issue/change the subject/or assert they are actually pro-law enforcement? Is it enough to cite statistics like red states have a crime problem too?\n\nLikewise, do Republicans deserve their historical claim to be the \"law and order\" party? Where are they politically effective or alternatively exaggerating their assertions? If the GOP does well in the midterms and strongly captures the House or wins both the House and Senate, how will the crime issue drive the rest of Biden's first term through the 2024 presidential elections?",

      "text": "[It is reported that President Trump has just signed a new revised executive order](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/new-executive-order-bans-travelers-from-six-muslim-majority-countries-applying-for-visas/2017/03/06/3012a42a-0277-11e7-ad5b-d22680e18d10_story.html?hpid=hp_hp-top-table-main_trumpban-desktop-1017%3Ahomepage%2Fstory), which effectively is a Travel Ban 2.0. I've noticed a few changes compared to the original travel ban:\n\n- 6 countries instead of the original 7. Iraq was removed.\n\n- Current visa holders and green card holders exempted.\n\n- Delayed implementation; the ban won't take place for another 10 days (March 16th).\n\n- No prioritization based on religion for refugees.\n\nIt appears the largest change was the grandfathering of existing visa holders and green card holders, which is pretty much what sparked the largest controversy of Travel Ban 1.0. Is this change enough to allow the new executive order to pass the muster of the courts? How does this revised ban now get viewed by its opponents? Will the ACLU and other opponents fight just as hard against this new ban as the old one?",

After 2019 defeat, Labour Party under new leader Keir Starmer witnessed a major rightward shift that saw the New Labour Blairites returning to dominance within the party. Corbyn was suspended from the party in 2020 in an antisemitism controversy and formally expelled in 2024 prior to the election.\n\nIn 2024 election, Labour swept back to power with the largest majority since 2001. However, critics on the left have long criticised Keir Starmer and his current Labour Party as being \"right-wing\" \"and \"Tories in red ties\". On the right, the right-wing populist Reform Party has siphoned large amount of voters from the Conservative and is now leading in the polls.\n\nYesterday, Corbyn and another independent ex-Labour MP Zarah Sultana announced the formation of a new left-wing political party focused on massive redistribution of wealth and power to \"take on the rich and powerful\" and support for Gaza.\n\nThe new party does not have an official name yet and its interim name is \"Your Party\". Many people have compared its policy platform to that of the Green Party. and voiced concern that it could benefit Reform by splitting the left vote.\n\nWhat do you think will be the impacts of this new political party on the increasingly volatile British political landscape?",

Once amplified by Redditors, the backlash against Musk has spread to the mainstream, where disapproval of Musk can be seen in the declining sales of Tesla cars, the fallen stock price and more recently protests and boycotts that have in some cases led to vandalism, arson, fire-bombings and other acts of domestic terrorism.\n\nIn response to these incidents, Trump and the DOJ have beefed up support for Tesla and have vowed to prosecute anyone who attacks a Tesla car or dealership with harsh penalties, including up to 20 years in prison. While some on Left and democrats in general haven't explicitly advocated for violence against Tesla, many have also cheered those who have done it or at least excused it.\n\nWhat are the political implications of the Left being associated with violent acts against Tesla and not just peaceful protests? How should Democratic politicians respond? How should Republican respond? Will the protests/violence against Tesla increase or decrease in the near future?",

This got me wondering if it could be the start of a larger trend.\n\nRural Areas have been on the decline for decades, but If you are working from home anyway, why spend more than twice as much on housing in the city, when you could live in a smaller town and pocket the extra cash, or stretch your dollar further? \n\nfor an example of how much further your dollar can go, check out these two listings for the exact same price in my home town of Paducah, KY (about 27k population/96k micropolitan population, 2 hours from Nashville) vs one in Nashville, TN\n\nPaducah listing 725k: https://www.realtor.com/realestateandhomes-detail/165-Corbett-Dr_Paducah_KY_42001_M91218-03953\n\nNashville listing 725k: https://www.realtor.com/realestateandhomes-detail/102-Stoneway-Close_Nashville_TN_37209_M82315-39316\n\ncensus data:\nhttp://paducahky.gov/demographics\n\n\nEdit: I feel like I should clarify: by rural areas I really mean non major metropolitan/suburban areas. A lot of commentators seem to think your options are a major metro area or a one horse town. Living in a town of 20-100 thousand people is still way more affordable than a big city. And yes… we have high speed internet, hospitals, grocery stores, restaurants, etc. \n\nMany towns of this size have been on the decline as populations have trended towards major metro areas, and these are the areas I think could start seeing some growth.",

Recently, the Trump administration announced the discontinuance of the NOAA disaster database.\n\n[https://www.cnn.com/2025/05/08/climate/noaa-ends-disaster-database](https://www.cnn.com/2025/05/08/climate/noaa-ends-disaster-database)\n\nI did a search for \"MSNBC NOAA disaster database,\" and received no responses.\n\nA likely reason for lack of coverage of climate change issues on mainstream media is that climate change specifics, such as discontinuance of the NOAA disaster database, aren't a focus of Democrats.\n\nHurricane intensification directly is a result of climate change impacts, especially accelerating ocean heat content (oceans absorb about 90 percent of the heat resulting from greenhouse gas emissions).\n\n[https://yaleclimateconnections.org/2024/11/human-caused-ocean-warming-intensified-recent-hurricanes-including-all-11-atlantic-hurricanes-in-2024/](https://yaleclimateconnections.org/2024/11/human-caused-ocean-warming-intensified-recent-hurricanes-including-all-11-atlantic-hurricanes-in-2024/)\n\n>Milton’s 11% increase in winds because of human-caused climate change likely made it nearly twice as destructive.\n\n[https://yaleclimateconnections.org/2024/10/without-climate-change-hurricane-milton-would-have-hit-as-a-cat-2-not-a-cat-3/](https://yaleclimateconnections.org/2024/10/without-climate-change-hurricane-milton-would-have-hit-as-a-cat-2-not-a-cat-3/)\n\nWildfires also are impacted by climate change.\n\n[https://www.nature.org/en-us/what-we-do/our-priorities/tackle-climate-change/climate-change-stories/extreme-wildfires-are-getting-worse-with-climate-change/](https://www.nature.org/en-us/what-we-do/our-priorities/tackle-climate-change/climate-change-stories/extreme-wildfires-are-getting-worse-with-climate-change/)\n\nDiscontinuing the NOAA disaster database will decrease transparency about the impact of climate change on the nation.",

      "text": "Just watched [Frontline’s Trump’s Comeback](https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/frontline/documentary/trumps-comeback/), and it really digs into how Trump’s political brand was built through PR, reality TV, and media influence. *The Apprentice* played a huge role in reshaping his image, turning him into a decisive business mogul while downplaying his bankruptcies and financial missteps. The documentary also covers how he’s used the press to his advantage for decades, from planting tabloid stories to commanding nonstop coverage in 2016.\n\nTrump isn’t the first politician to shape his own narrative, but his ability to dominate media cycles, even through scandals, raises bigger questions about how much perception outweighs reality in politics. In an era where social media and 24/7 news drive engagement, does branding matter more than actual achievements?\n\nCurious to hear others’ thoughts: does the documentary change how you see Trump’s rise, or is this just how modern politics works?",

      "text": "Polarization has always been characteristic of American politics. Especially with our two-party system, it's nearly inevitable that opposing parts of the political spectrum will collide at one point or another. The last decade, however, saw political polarization in the U.S. reach new heights. What changed? America met Donald Trump.\n\nAfter Trump came along, it was obvious that the days of friendly political rivalry, notably, like that of Barack Obama and John McCain, were over. Trump quickly built a reputation for being ruthless against his opponents, spewing lies and other rethoric to put them whenever possible. But this paled in comparison to the attack on the Capitol Building on January 6, an event which arguably marked the peak of modern U.S. political division. And it didn't stop there. As president, Trump's aggressive conduct and authoritative approach to power continue to amplify the tensions in American politics.\n\nSo, is Trump simply a symptom of the deepening political polarization in America? Did he just capitalize on division that was already brewing? Or, is he the root cause of this division? In a post-Trump era, could American politics ever return to friendly and respectful competition? Can we \"depolarize\" without addressing the issues that led to Trump's success in the first place?",

The Stare of the Union address which contained a Republican representative shouting \"you lie\" seems important as well.\n\nGeorge Bush's \"Mission Accomplished\" speech is the major one that comes to mind from his time in office. I was fairly young at the time, but I'm struggling to think of another particular speech of his of note, though I'm sure there are some examples surrounding 9/11, going into Iraq, and catching Saddam Hussein.",

How are candidates like Desantis going to view this especially as a 6 week abortion ban makes its way to his desk?\n\nAre these special/off year election results also a sign that the Democratic party is capturing more and more educated voters? \n\nIf you were a Republican strategist, how would you approach 2024 with these results in mind?",

One that if carried out as advertised, could have significant economic, social and political impacts.\n\nIn terms of economics, there is potential for such a crackdown to have [significantly effects on the agricultural and construction sectors](https://www.channelnewsasia.com/world/trump-mass-deportation-pledge-faces-legal-economic-barriers-4731381) that rely heavily on migrant labor. What is the potential for mass deportation to cause an inflationary spike on the economy not soon after Trump was elected on the back of discontent over inflation?\n\nSocially, Trump owed his victory to support from Latino voters, be it Mexican-Americans who are legal citizens that strongly dislike illegal immigration from Central America, or Guatemalan and Honduran migrants that genuinely believe Trump is blustering. If Trump goes as far as stated with deportation, is there a risk of eroding that support, particularly if legal migrants and naturalized citizens are caught up in the deportations as advocates have warned? Would it potentially lead to the pendulum swinging back in favor of pro-immigration sentiment much like the [family separation policy](https://www.vox.com/2024-elections/383845/trump-mass-deportations-immigration-family-separation) did during Trump's first term?\n\nPolitically, how would Trump try to negotiate with Mexico, Guatemala and other Latin American countries in trying to get them to accept deported migrants back? How would those migrants be sheltered and cared for while awaiting deportation? \n\nFinally, there has been talk as to whether Trump can even accomplish such a massive immigration crackdown. Aside from the sheer logistics in terms of manpower and resources needed to carry out such a task, there are other obstacles from [litigation in immigration courts](https://www.politico.com/news/2024/11/07/trump-immigrant-advocates-battle-00187971), to companies trying to plead for exemptions in their particular sectors. Then there is the influence of Trump's longtime adviser and architect on immigration policy Stephen Miller, who among other things had advocated sinking [migrant boats with drones](https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/jun/27/trump-stephen-miller-migrants-boats-drone-attacks-book) and supports [denaturalization](https://x.com/StephenM/status/1712094935820780029?lang=en) or stripping natural-born citizens of their rights. \n\nWould Trump inevitably balk at the sheer logistical, legal and economic challenges of pursuing mass deportation enough that he just does the classic Trump overpromising and underdelivering by deporting a few migrants before declaring Mission Accomplished? Or would the influence of ideological hardliners like Miller ensure that they will pursue mass deportation with no exemptions or compromises?",

According to most popular accounts, this proposed shift was unpopular with the political establishment in Washington, including the \"intelligence community.\"  The Flynn resignation was based on [presumably illegal leaks](https://theintercept.com/2017/02/14/the-leakers-who-exposed-gen-flynns-lie-committed-serious-and-wholly-justified-felonies/) condemned by the Trump administration.  \n\nDoes the current debate over the AG, the intelligence leaks and Russian influence demonstrate that there is a deeper political crisis within the United States?

There have been exceptions, such as Bill Clinton's two wins, but I think it's fair to say the South favors Republican candidates. There are numerous reasons for this, stemming from the famed \"Southern Strategy\" to current day policy; but many believe we may be starting to see a shift in this dynamic.\n\nPosted just today by the WSJ (linked below, apologies for the paywall), the Biden campaign will be going after NC, GA, & TX more than any Democratic ticket in recent memory. Additionally, we are seeing Senate races in NC and GA become very competitive for Democrats (also in TX and SC if Democrats have a really, *really* good day). Plus with numerous House seats and state-level Congressional seats all over the South being fiercely targeting by left, are we beginning to see a movement away from Republicanism in the area?\n\nIs there actual, genuine political shifting occurring?

Mueller III, then followed the house search with a warning: His prosecutors told Mr. Manafort they planned to indict him, said two people close to the investigation.\n\nOn the one hand, this may spell trouble for President Trump as it may implicate the highest ranking members of his campaign in nefarious activity.\n\nOn the other hand, this may at least partially validate Trump's claims of wiretapping.

That is, not someone currently serving in government office, perhaps a Michelle Obama or Oprah type.

Pride began as a response to the Stonewall riots, fundamentally a political act, but has evolved into large-scale festivals often featuring corporate sponsorship and mainstream appeal. While I understand the value of inclusive, joyful events that welcome questioning youth and build community solidarity, there’s also a compelling argument that we’ve become too comfortable while our rights face active threats. The tension between accessibility and activism feels particularly relevant when considering how different approaches might serve various segments of our community. Do we need to choose between political action and celebration, or can Pride events effectively balance both approaches? And given that our very existence remains politicized regardless of our personal preferences, how do we navigate the responsibility of advocacy while maintaining spaces for community joy and connection?\n\nI’m genuinely curious about different perspectives on this. Should Pride prioritize political activism given the current climate, or does the celebratory approach actually serve as a more effective tool for social change and community building?​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​",

      "text": "In 2016, it seemed like the only candidate on the news was Trump. And he was on the news *all the time*. Every outrageous, offensive or downright crazy thing he said was reported on obsessively. Even during the GOP primaries, the focus was on Trump in the media.\n\nDuring the general election, I remember reading a study (I wish I could find it) that on tv news, Trump got way more coverage than Hillary. \n\nFrom my recollection, it almost seemed like Trump was the only candidate running - or, at least, the only one the media cared about.  \n\nAny other candidate who espoused similar rhetoric would never have left the sidelines. Jill Stein and RFK JR don’t get coverage like Trump did, because they’re crazy. \n\nI feel like the media inflated Trump from being a former 80s celebrity turned tv personality turned conspiracy theorist into a major political figure.\n\nFlash forward to now.  \n\nWho do you hear about on the news? Trump.\n\nWhose trials and tribulations and insane comments still dominate the news? Trump.\n\nConsider that after Watergate, Richard Nixon spent over a decade in the political “wilderness” as a pariah, the one big exception being the Frost/Nixon interviews in 1977. It wasn’t until the late 80s that news papers started talking about his rehabilitation.\n\nYet, for as much as the media talks about J6, or Trump’s other wrongdoings, they can’t seem to stop giving him a platform, to stop talking about him. \n\nSo my question to all of you is:\n\nDo you hold the media culpable in any way for Trump’s first election and for him continuing to be a mainstream political figure?",

      "text": "On Monday, July 15, Sean O'Brien became the first Teamsters President to address the Republican National Convention. He did not endorse Donald Trump for President, though he praised his strength in relation to the recent assassination attempt. He also offered praise for specific Republican officials who in his view have supported unions (Josh Hawley in particular). At the same time, he called out anti-union politicians and groups within the Republican coalition, including the Chamber of Commerce, and he referred to corporate union busting as \"economic terrorism.\"\n\nThe Republican Party has historically been extremely hostile to unions, from opposing New Deal-era pro-worker policy to Reagan's breaking the air traffic controller strike to Republican-led state passing \"right to work\" laws. While union members are more likely to vote Republican than they used to be, unionized workers still lean Democratic and union leadership overwhelmingly supports Democratic candidates. \n\nWhat does Sean O'Brien's speech tell us about the present and future of unions in national politics in the U.S.? Does the Republican Party have the potential to transform itself into a pro-union populist party? Was O'Brien's decision to speak at the RNC a positive or negative contribution to the labor movement?",

Joe Smith could say, \"I hate this bill. Sen. Jones was stupid in bringing it up. His colleagues are also dumb to support him.\" instead of \"The right honorable Sen.

      "text": "We are al suffering from political bias in American media.  Political bias has become a defining feature of the modern news landscape. Outlets like Fox News and MSNBC are accused of favoring specific ideological perspectives, shaping narratives in ways that deepen polarization rather than inform across divides. This bias often manifests in both **story selection** and **framing**, creating parallel realities for different segments of the public.\n\nWhile bias itself is not new, the current environment—driven by digital engagement metrics—seems to reward **outrage, confirmation bias, and emotionally charged content**. As noted in [Outrage industrial complex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outrage_industrial_complex), outrage is now a business model, where ideological intensity is profitable, regardless of nuance or accuracy.\n\nHistorical documents show these concerns are longstanding. For example, [Thomas Jefferson’s 1807 letter to John Norvell](https://founders.archives.gov/?q=norvell&s=1111311111&sa=&r=7&sr=) criticizes the press for substituting sensationalism for facts—a concern that seems even more relevant in today’s hyper-partisan environment.\n\nThis raises several questions worth exploring from a political and structural perspective:\n\n1. **What could the federal government do**—within the bounds of the First Amendment—to help reduce the spread or impact of political bias in news reporting? Are there examples from U.S. history or other democracies that offer guidance?\n2. **What role can a small number of organized citizens play** in promoting more politically balanced news coverage? Could boycotts, media rating systems, or cooperative funding models have an impact?\n3. **How might wealthy individuals or philanthropic organizations—who are not themselves media owners—intervene** to support more politically neutral journalism? Is there room to build trusted, nonpartisan institutions that rival biased legacy outlets?\n4. **How can this be organized -** considering that organization will take place on the media platforms themselves?  The owners control the algorithms and will suppress any organization for control.\n\nI’m interested in discussing practical, nonpartisan solutions that are achievable in today’s political climate—not just theoretical ideals.",

I have been thinking about how political movements succeed and fail, and to what extent tactics, leadership, messaging, and outside influence can affect the degree of success a movement can have. To that end, I have a few questions which I think make sense to ask once a movement is less newsworthy and its impact is easier to assess retrospectively.\n\n1. Should a movement have clearly-defined goals that are obvious to outsiders? On the one hand, it may help to frame success in terms of an actionable request. On the other hand, it provides opposition with a concrete ideological attack surface.  \n2. To what extent should unlawful protest (e.g. vandalism, trespassing, curfew violations) be used in a movement?  \n3. How should a political movement react to opposition, especially with the knowledge that it may be motivated by bad-faith actors? In the case of BLM, we know that \"White Lives Matter\" was in some instances organized by foreign bad actors.  \n4. To what extent should a movement focus on inclusivity vs exclusivity?  \n5. How does organizational structure play a role in movements? A charismatic leader may inspire others and drive a message more effectively than a faceless website, but also is vulnerable to personal attack, both ideological and physical.  \n\nAgain, this is not just limited to BLM, and can be answered with regards to movements in the abstract.",

      "text": "http://www.cnn.com/2017/12/17/politics/doug-jones-sotu-cnntv/index.html\n\n>The winner of the Alabama special election, Democratic Senator-elect Doug Jones, says it's time to move on from the sexual misconduct allegations that have been made against President Donald Trump.\n\n>Jones told CNN's Jake Tapper on \"State of the Union\" Sunday morning that he doesn't agree with some in his party who say Trump should resign from office over the sexual harassment and sexual assault allegations against him, which Trump has denied.\n\n>\"(T)hose allegations were made before the election, and so people had an opportunity to judge before that election,\" Jones said.\n\nThis statement was surprising considering that Doug Jones largely owes his own victory to the sexual assault allegations made against his opponent, Roy Moore, which shifted the race in the last few days before the election.\n\nIs Jones correct? Would it be better for Democrats to stop focusing on Trump's scandals and focus on policy? Or do they have a better chance of winning in 2018 if they continue to bring up the sexual assault / rape allegations?",

      "text": "Let me explain. \nToday’s shift in politics is in a more radical and polarized one, both sides agree on less and less issues each passing year, this is already happening in developed countries and it’s about the same in developing countries.\n\nIt’s argued that moderates want just to preserve a failed or in shambles system and don’t search to destroy and rebuild this system, thus more radicals from the left and the right win elections and change the status quo.\n\nIn fact, many people who vote in more ideological and radical parties and politicians want just big changes, so for example; many trump voters would vote for Bernie sanders if he trump didn’t run in the elections and vice-versa. They just want some big figure who dares to challenge the status quo and so, vote on radicals from both sides.\n\nIn my country (brazil) one of the reasons that explain why Bolsonaro won is because of the feeling that everything was the same and the old moderate parties were actually cooperating to maintain the status quo.\n\nAmerica is a curious case, trump redefined the Republican Party, shifting the party more right, Christian, nationalistic and made everyone who wasn’t supporting him obsolete, “too moderate”, or RINO. The Democratic Party also passed this as well, there was a time not too long ago when it was okay for Obama to say that he didn’t supported gay marriage, there was a time when democrats supported only “safe” “limited” abortions, Bill Clinton even signed a bill reaffirming that a marriage is between a man and a woman, there was a time when many democrats had a tougher instance on crime and immigration, even more than current day republicans (see Biden history on senate for example) Obama deported more people than trump. Today’s democrats embraced a surprisingly progressive agenda like trying to redefine the concept of free speech, over a third of democrats want to repeal the 2nd amendment, defunding the police became a serious discussion in certain circles, the idea to create a tax specifically for billionaires and of course, the embracing of identity politics.\n\nIt looks like it’s near impossible to find a mid ground in the present day. Polling is showing that Gen Z is becoming more conservative, traditional and religious, potentially even more than their grandparents, however the progressive gen Z and millennials uphold very robust progressive values so it creates a deep gap between them.\n\nWhat do you think?

      "text": "As stated, what are the most useful frameworks to analyze and understand the present day American political landscape?\n\nTo many, it feels as though we're in an extraordinary political moment. Partisanship is at extremely high levels in a way that far exceeds normal functions of government, such as making laws, and is increasingly spilling over into our media ecosystem, our senses of who we are in relation to our fellow Americans, and our very sense of a shared reality, such that we can no longer agree on crucial facts like who won the 2020 election. \n\nWhen we think about where we are politically, how we got here, and where we're heading, what should we identify as the critical factors? Should we focus on the effects of technology? Race? Class conflict? Geographic sorting? How our institutions and government are designed?\n\nWhich political analysts or political scientists do you feel really grasp not only the big picture, but what's going on beneath the hood and can accurately identify the underlying driving components?",

Extreme ideological self-labelling is also higher than before, with only 34% of Americans labelling themselves as moderate (a record low) while a majority now identify with “very liberal” or “very conservative”. Both affective polarisation and extreme ideological self labelling are terrible for democracy because both make opponents seem like existential threats making violent outcomes even more conceivable.\n\nExperts warn we are reaching a tipping point, without renewed civic courage, moral clarity, or outright rejection of violence, it may become even worse.\n\nWhat do you think?",

Obama also highlights the stakes of the 2020 election by arguing Trump and Republicans in the Senate are solely interested in power, not making progress for Americans.\n\n> \"If there's one thing we've learned as a country from moments of great crisis, it's that the spirit of looking out for one another can't be restricted to our homes, or our workplaces, or our neighborhoods, or our houses of worship,\" Obama says in the over 11-minute endorsement video. \"It also has to be reflected in our national government.\"\n\nWhat will be the consequences for the Democratic party moving forward, both in the upcoming election and more broadly?",

It had both a Republican and a Democratic senator for 30 years. It had a Republican governor throughout the 90s and Democratic governors throughout the 2000s. As well as having some very competitive house districts.\n\nHowever sense around 2014 it has drifted in the Republicans direction. Trump won it by similar margins in both 2016 and 2020. It currently has a Republican trifecta in the state government. It has 2 Republican senators and nearly all of the democrats house victories in 2018 were wiped out in 2020.\n\nThere has been very little discussion about politics in Iowa outside of the presidential caucus. So my question is can Iowa still be considered a swing state, What can the Democrats do to make it more competitive, what will the Republicans be able to do with their current political standing in both a policy perspective and to lock down their popularity, and finally who are some rising politicians that will be important in Iowa as it goes on.",

I think too many Americans -- particularly those older -- are conflating culture with politics. They seem to make no distinction between a decadent, socially-liberal pop culture and an economically pro-working class, liberal political party.\n\n\nYou basically have republican/conservative-oriented entities and industries -- like Wall Street, Madison avenue, and big media -- churning out endless images of increasingly decadent, offputting, repulsive, and shock-value \"liberal\" culture (think Miley Cyrus in underwear swinging on a wrecking ball). Then, average Joe in Kansas, or Idaho, or Indiana basically redefines and re-interprets that as \"liberal\" in a political context. Young people, I've noticed, are beginning to do this too. A lot of the back and fourth I see taking place in political discourse, actually has very little to do with politics, and a lot more to do with culture and the culture wars.\n\n\nDo you think democrats are not doing enough to separate themselves from socially-liberal pop culture? When you consider that it's large corporate industries -- inherently conservative and free-market oriented -- that are the ones painting the democratic party with this image, do you think that they need to work on revamping their image and making a clear distinction between culture and politics?

      "text": "Recently there was a US house candidate attack, Nancy Pelosi's husband was attacked, we're seeing voter intimidation at ballot drop off locations, there was a plot to kidnap a governor, and we had a small insurrection at the Capitol. It's safe to say political violence is on the rise in America.\n\nHow do we turn away from this route?\n\nI can think of two quick examples in which nations failed to turn away.\n\n1. After Cesar crossed the Rubicon and crowned him self emperor, he was stabbed many times by his friends. This would lead to more assassinations, and a civil war.\n\n2. Japan went through government by assassination before and during the start of WWII.\n\nAre there examples where counties started down the path of political violence and corrected their path? What lesson can we learn from such nations?",

      "text": "A few weeks ago, New York Gov. Kathy Hochul nominated Hector LaSalle to the state's highest court, the Court of Appeals, replacing Chief Justice Janet DiFiore. Up until now, Hochul has been a fairly lowkey governor who usually would work with the legislature to pass their agenda.\n\nHowever, the NY State Senate is not too pleased with Hochul's pick. Democrats, who have a supermajoirty in the chamber, are opposed to LaSalle's nomination, citing LaSalle's [anti-union and anti-abortion rulings](https://www.commondreams.org/news/hector-lasalle). Hochul has argued these rulings only tell one part of a story and should not impact the impartialness of LaSalle.\n\nAs per NY Senate rules, any judiciary nominee must first pass through the judiciary committee, and it is heavily implied LaSalle will not survive a committee vote, therefore denying him a full floor vote.\n\nIn response, [Hochul's office retained a litigator, ex-state solicitor general Caitlin Halligan, for a likely legal battle with Senate Democrats over Hector LaSalle's nomination. At issue: whether nominee can be voted down in the Judiciary Committee or requires a full chamber vote](https://twitter.com/ChrisBragg1/status/1615500689643388929?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Etweet), effectively bypassing the judiciary committee where Hochul will seek Republican votes to confirm her nominee since she does not have enough Democratic votes.\n\nMy questions are: does this legal strategy have any chance of succeeding? And second, does this signal a return to Cuomo-style politics? Cuomo was incredibly involved with the legislature, to the point of being able to strong-arm a lot of members, which is why the Senate jumped at the chance to impeach Cuomo when his scandals broke. Does this seem like Hochul is trying the same strategy?\n\nEDIT: The New York State Senate Judiciary Committee has voted down LaSalle’s nomination with 2 in favor and 10 opposed.",

During this period more than 5 million (5.2M by the end of 2016 according to UNHCR) immigrants entered Europe.\n\nDue to the large influx of migrants pouring into Europe in this period, many EU nations have seen a rise in conservative and far-right parties. In the countries that were hit the hardest (Italy, Greece, ...) there has also been a huge rise in anti-immigrant rhetoric even in centre-right parties such as Forza Italia in Italy and Νέα Δημοκρατία (New Democracy) in Greece. Even in countries that weren't affected by the crisis, like Poland, anti-immigrant sentiment has seen a substantial rise.\n\nDo you think that this right-wing wave will continue in Europe or will the end of the crisis lead to a resurgence of left-wing parties?\n\nDo you think that left-wing parties have committed \"political suicide\" by being pro-immigration during this period?\n\nHow do you think the crisis will shape Europe in the near future?

Will society become much more traditional with more strictly adhered to gender norms again like for instance the 1950s and vote in more conservative candidates that will preach those ideals, or could we see a revolution of some sort away from present structures where we could see greater parity in employment between men and women? Could policies like UBI gain greater traction and come into the picture more, for example? And when do you think we could start seeing these changes?

      "text": "Changing from open ballot to recorded ballot for whenever the legislature of XYZ is voting on individuals, as opposed to policy like a bill or resolution, would make it so that you have the incentive to support policies that work and apply regardless of the individual, helping with the principles of rule of law and just codifying things, so elections for speaker for instance become less of a problem.\n\n~~And for elections, multi day voting would be nice. All the general elections I've voted in have had multiple days of voting and I voted early. usually about ten days before the typical election date (in one case because I was a poll worker so it wouldn't make much sense for me to vote on the day of the general election).~~\n\nEdit: I clearly said SMALL. Many of you are proposing some pretty major changes.\n\nEdit II: I said SMALL!!! Stop replying with anything that needs a constitutional amendment like overturning Citizens United, term limits, abolishing the electoral college, and things you know need major legislation to do. What I suggested is a rules change by a majority vote in the House of Representatives and a technical change in a law that needs little adaptation or rethinking. People's models of voting don't change.\n\nEdit III: Because people apparently are not reading the rules of the post here, changing the size of the House of Representatives is out of bounds as is anything changing the constitution. To clearly state what small means, it refers to the resources needed to implement the rule and to change it. A majority vote in a House can change a rule. A technical rule about succession in legislation to the presidency after the vice presidency needs little to bring effect to it, the cabinet secretaries would become next in line, which they already were anyway, and the US did in fact used to leave out the president officers of congress. Changing the size of the legislature needs a good amount of money just to pay for the members and their staff, and the administrative resources it takes to redistrict almost all of the states is also a huge logistical challenge. It does not mean the idea is a bad idea, it is just ill suited for this post.",

      "text": "In one of his two interviews for a PBS Frontline special on Trump's rise, Steve Bannon gave a lengthy interview about his life and background, his world views, and made commentary on how Trump shaped American politics. In it, Bannon says the US is in a \"post-persuisian\" age of politics, where the goal isn't to pursue voters but rather turnout and ground game. He cited that as why Obama upsured Clinton in 2008. \n\nAnd it has made me wonder if he is right. Are we in a post-persusain age? Despite what people say, polarization is nothing new in US Politics. After the Civil War, when Andrew Johnson was speaking in Indianpolis, a riot between supporters and opponents broke out and one person was shot. \n\nWe remained bitterly divided over race, over women's suffrage, over drug use, over war, over the culture. \n\nBut if you look at political maps from 2016 and 2020 you will see the red areas get redder and the blue areas get bluer. Biden carried 2/3 of Mecklenburg County, home to Charlotte NC, by 5-6 points above Clinton. Some areas like Pinellas County in Florida, Tarrant County in TX, or Maricopa County in AZ all flipped. But in many ways urban and liberal centers went further left and rural areas went further right. \n\nBut ticket splitting does happen. This is part of how Susan Collins, or Roy Cooper Winning NC governor and Thilis winning senate. So are we past persuasion?\n\nInterview: https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=pm5xxlajTW0",

      "text": "I’ve been following the Trump situation for years now, and I can't wrap my head around how he's managed to avoid any real consequences despite the sheer number of allegations, investigations, and legal cases against him. From the hush money scandal to the classified documents case, to the January 6th insurrection — it feels like any other politician would have been crushed under the weight of even *one* of these.\n\nI get that Trump's influence over the Republican Party and the conservative media machine gives him a protective shield, but how deep does this go? Are we talking about systemic issues with the legal system, political corruption, or just strategic maneuvering by Trump and his team?\n\nFor context:  \n📌 Trump was impeached *twice* — first for pressuring Ukraine to investigate Biden, and then for inciting the Capitol riot — yet he was acquitted both times because Senate Republicans closed ranks.  \n📌 The classified documents case (where Trump allegedly kept top-secret files at Mar-a-Lago) seemed like an open-and-shut case, yet it's been bogged down in procedural delays and legal loopholes.  \n📌 The New York hush money case involved falsifying business records to cover up payments to Stormy Daniels — something that would likely land an average citizen in jail — but Trump seems untouchable.  \n📌 The Georgia election interference case (pressuring officials to \"find\" votes) looks like outright criminal behavior, yet Trump is still able to campaign without serious repercussions.\n\n📌 Trump's administration recently invoked the Alien Enemies Act to deport Venezuelan migrants to El Salvador, directly defying a judicial order halting such actions. The administration argued that verbal court orders aren't binding once deportation planes leave U.S. airspace, a stance that has left judges incredulous. \n\n📌Trump's recent actions have intensified conflicts with the judiciary, showcasing attempts to wield unchallenged presidential authority. For instance, he proceeded with deportations despite court blocks, reflecting a strategy of making bold decisions and addressing legal challenges afterward.\n\n📌 In a landmark decision, the Supreme Court ruled that presidents have absolute immunity for acts committed within their core constitutional duties, and at least presumptive immunity for official acts within the outer perimeter of their responsibilities. This ruling has significant implications for holding presidents accountable for their actions while in office\n\nIt seems like Trump benefits from a mix of legal stall tactics, political protection, and public perception manipulation. But is the American legal system really that broken, or is there some higher-level political game being played here?\n\nIf you want to read more about these cases, here are some good resources:\n\n* [Classified Documents Case – DOJ Filing](https://www.justice.gov/)\n* [Georgia Election Case – Background](https://www.nytimes.com/)\n* [Stormy Daniels Hush Money – NYT Report](https://www.nytimes.com/)\n* [January 6th Capitol Riot – House Committee Findings](https://www.jan6th.house.gov/)\n* [https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2025/mar/17/donald-trump-kennedy-center-jd-vance-tariffs-ukraine-immigration-us-politics-live-news?utm\\_source](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2025/mar/17/donald-trump-kennedy-center-jd-vance-tariffs-ukraine-immigration-us-politics-live-news?utm_source)\n* [https://www.politico.com/news/2025/03/17/trump-presidential-power-courts-test-00234173?utm\\_source](https://www.politico.com/news/2025/03/17/trump-presidential-power-courts-test-00234173?utm_source)\n* [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trump\\_v.\\_United\\_States\\_%282024%29?utm\\_source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trump_v._United_States_%282024%29?utm_source)",

People would be chosen randomly, with a follow-up system to make sure people were fit (and willing) to serve.

In politics, that often shows up as voters saying things like “Candidate X isn’t progressive/conservative enough” or “Neither party represents me 100% so I won’t vote at all.”\n\nSome people argue this fallacy plays a big role in elections, since rejecting imperfect options can shift outcomes in ways the voter may not have wanted.

      "text": "Australia derives substantial wealth from coal, iron, gas and critical minerals, yet an estimated 56% of its exported gas currently attracts zero state royalties. This royalty-free framework has yielded billions in foregone revenue, while mining companies report windfall profits. Critics point to Norway’s model, where a sovereign wealth fund channels resource rents into citizen dividends, as evidence that more transparent, equitable mechanisms are feasible.\n\nThis post invites an impartial discussion on reshaping Australia’s resource revenue regime. Please focus on policy trade-offs and international examples rather than partisan rhetoric.\n\n**Background and Context**\n\n* Offshore gas exports beyond three nautical miles fall under the federal Petroleum Resource Rent Tax (PRRT), which only applies once project costs are recouped.\n* Onshore mining royalties remain with states, but generous deductions and write-offs have kept Australia’s combined public take below 10% of total petroleum export value, well under the OECD average.\n* Norway’s model returns roughly 64% of oil and gas sector revenue to its citizens through a combination of taxes, state-owned enterprise dividends and a national pension fund.\n\n**Questions for Discussion**\n\n1. What are the key advantages and disadvantages of distributing a portion of Australia’s resource rents directly to citizens as dividends, compared to investing solely in public services?\n2. Which governance structures and transparency measures, drawn from international precedents, could Australia adopt to ensure accountability in royalty collection and dividend distribution?\n3.

The amount used every Presidential term has only risen, with a $25 billion budget penned by Biden for FY25 alone.

      "text": "Sharia law creates a two-tier legal system that disadvantages non-Muslims. These are some of the most accepted tenets of Sharia:\n\n* Religious freedom is restricted: Non-Muslims often cannot build places of worship freely, nor can they preach their faith to Muslims, while conversion to Islam is allowed and even encouraged.\n* Marriage inequality: Muslim women are generally not allowed to marry outside their faith unless the partner converts, whereas Muslim men can marry Christian or Jewish women. This creates population growth advantages and imbalances in interfaith relationships.\n* Polygamy is legal for Muslim men, which further amplifies demographic shifts and is unavailable to others.\n* Jizya tax on non-Muslims: In some implementations, non-Muslims pay a special tax (jizya), which some justify as \"protection money\" and others interpret as institutional humiliation.\n* Apostasy laws: Leaving Islam is criminalized or socially persecuted in many jurisdictions, and promoting atheism or other belief systems is often illegal.\n* Unequal justice: Some legal schools (like Hanbali) allow reduced punishment if a Muslim harms a non-Muslim. For example, prison or death penalty may not apply, and only a monetary compensation might be imposed—even for serious harm. If the opposite happens, the non-Muslim is guaranteed to face prison or death penalty\n* Political and military exclusion: Non-Muslims are often barred from positions of authority, especially in justice systems based on Sharia, and may be restricted from commanding roles in the military.\n\nThere are various other gender based laws:\n\n* Men can marry outside Islam (Christian/Jewish women), but women generally cannot; men may have up to 4 wives, women only 1 husband.\n* Men can often divorce unilaterally; women usually need court approval or proof of specific grounds.\n* Women inherit half the share of male counterparts (e.g., daughter vs. son, widow vs. widower).\n* In financial/legal matters, a woman’s testimony may count as half a man’s, or not be accepted in some cases.\n* Women may need male guardian approval for marriage, travel, or certain decisions.\n* Adultery laws, child custody, and dress codes are often stricter on women than men.\n\nSome people may argue that religion is a choice, however, when societies submit to Islam, their culture typically disappears. This can be considered as cultural genocide. Do you agree with calling a Sharia based state religion based or gender based apartheid?",

The goal is to find new ways to give citizens the ability to check government power.\n* Or, should we weaken civilian armament?

      "text": "With remote work becoming a lasting feature of the economy, some have suggested that policy incentives could be used to shape where and how people work. For example, the government could provide tax credits to companies that allow remote work in designated areas, relocation support for employees moving to lower-cost cities, or cost-of-living assistance to encourage migration from expensive urban centers (like New York City and San Francisco) to economically struggling cities (like Detroit). Proponents argue this could simultaneously revitalize local economies and address affordability challenges, while funding might come from higher-income tax contributions.\n\nThis raises several political questions:\n\n* Why hasn’t remote work policy become a more prominent campaign issue, especially for Democrats, who often highlight worker rights and cost-of-living concerns?\n* What are the political or economic drawbacks of using federal incentives to shift workforces geographically?\n* Could such a policy realistically address regional inequality, or would it mainly benefit employers and higher-paid remote workers?\n* How might this fit within broader Democratic priorities, such as housing, labor rights, and urban policy?\n\nWhat do you think are the main political barriers or opportunities for elevating remote work incentives into the national conversation?",

      "title": "What do politicians/media mean by \"fascism\" today?",
      "text": "The term fascism is used in modern politics to qualify very different ideas, actions and opinions. This has led, on the one hand, to the loss of any specific historical connotation tied to the Italian and foreign events of 1919–1945, and, on the other hand, to the term becoming a shapeless and undefinable cluster of ideas and actions, to the point that attempts to “define fascism” produce very different results.  \nSo let us try to narrow it down and set some boundaries around this term: this is my attempt to define what today’s politicians/press/media mean when they speak of fascism (avoiding the definition of historical fascism, which has little or nothing to do with the contemporary use of the term). Since I am Italian, I mainly have access to the Italian political debate, so I will try to define what contemporary Italian politicians mean when they label someone as ‘fascist.’ You can judge whether this definition also applies to other countries or not.\n\nAll of today’s labels of fascism tend to focus on the following points. It is likely that even one of them may be enough to apply the label, depending on the intensity of adherence to that point:\n\n* **Anti-democracy**: restricting universal suffrage or believing that some people should not be allowed to vote because they are too stupid, uneducated, poor, etc. Fascism, in this logic, can only exist in the restriction of voting rights, never in their expansion. However, it is acceptable to criticize the ignorance of voters, but the solution must always be education. It is considered “fascist” to criticize democracy as too slow and inefficient, since one must strictly adhere to democratic rules of checks and balances, parliament, etc. Nevertheless, in Michela Murgia’s \"Fascistometro\", presidentialism is considered as tending toward fascism; therefore what is really being criticized is *decisionism*, that is, the possibility of a small group of people to make decisions even if the system is democratic (consequently, even a large democratically elected parliamentary majority making decisions without consulting the opposition is labeled a fascist choice). It is also fascist to appreciate so-called “illiberal democracies” abroad, such as Orbán’s, etc.\n* **Elitism**: believing that Western culture is superior to others and thus justifying it historically, believing that one’s own nation is superior to others (Nationalism), and consequently invoking Christian values, defending traditions, rejecting multiculturalism, preventing the mixing of different cultures. (This is odd because asking foreigners to “integrate” is acceptable, even though integration means losing part of one’s own culture.) Elitism is tolerated only if applied to political positions. In America this is much more pronounced, and fascism itself is identified as the desire to establish a white ethnostate and defend the white race; everything else is probably secondary and tied to this primary purpose. Thus fascism is inseparable from racism.\n* **Anti-politics**: criticizing “experts” and refusing their advice, criticizing all politicians (it is acceptable when aimed at certain politicians/parties, but not the entire political class), criticizing trade unionists, journalists, judges, etc. The criticism always consists of accusations of corruption, ignorance/laziness, or collusion with a political side. Naturally, conspiracy theories are seen as fascist in nature.\n* **Social conservatism**: essentially opposition to the three major progressive social currents today: multiculturalism, feminism, LGBT. Attempting to oppose the advance of these phenomena, taking steps backwards or simply not adhering to these currents are considered forms of fascism. However, the fascist can be extremely progressive from a technological point of view, and therefore, in this case, anti-fascism is environmental conservatism.\n* **Apology and nostalgia**: justifying, exalting, remaining indifferent, or not sufficiently condemning the fascist period is considered a form of fascism. Naturally, it also includes making fascist salutes, possessing something related to fascism like a Mussolini statue, etc.\n* **No economic position alone** can lead to the attribution of the label of fascist; fascism and economics are seen as unrelated. One may incur the accusation only if economic measures could have as a secondary purpose various forms of discrimination.\n* **Freedom of speech and use of force**: this constitutes the core of accusations against governments: predominantly using force to counter something (police force, deportation, etc.), and repressing the right to protest, debate, publish, etc. All of this can be summarized as “repressing freedom of speech.” In fact, the label of fascist is usually applied to someone who talks over you or interrupts you, etc. However, repressing freedom of speech is accepted when applied to conspiracy theorists, far-right parties, or certain political positions such as remigration. Thus, the conclusion is that a fascist is only someone who represses freedom of speech within a predefined framework of acceptable topics, whereas those who repress speech on topics that the majority considers unacceptable are not fascist.\n\nIs this an accurate definition?",

[2.2 on this article for context](https://www.realinstitutoelcano.org/en/analyses/near-miss-assessing-the-impact-on-the-election-of-the-trump-assassination-attempt/)\n* If Trump's prospects did not significantly jump, why? What makes this case different from Reagan?\n* Besides election polls, are there other significant impacts of his assassination attempt? If so, what?\n\n[my article for those interested](https://medium.com/@yangwrites/one-year-later-what-can-we-learn-from-trumps-near-assassination-db0f2a37bc1b)",

      "text": "One of the central debates around the war in Ukraine is whether concessions to Russia would reduce or increase the likelihood of future aggression. Some argue that if Russia is able to hold on to additional territory, it may feel emboldened to use military force again in the near future. Others suggest that the high costs of the conflict - economic sanctions, military losses, and diplomatic isolation - could discourage Russia from attempting something similar again soon.\n\nQuestions for discussion:\n\n* Historically, how have outcomes like this, where a state gains territory through war, affected its likelihood of launching future conflicts?\n\n* What political, economic, or military factors might encourage or discourage Russia from another invasion in the next decade?\n\n* Would Russia’s domestic politics or leadership changes be more decisive than international pressure in shaping this outcome?\n\n* How should other states prepare, either diplomatically or militarily, for the possibility of renewed aggression?",

It could be used due to its geography.  However, I am unsure whether it has the financial infrastructure to organize such a facility.\n\nI was initially outraged by the implementation of Alligator Alcatraz.  However, 6 months into Trump's administration, I see it to be a losing fight already.\n\nThere will be more facilities set up.\n\nIt's just a question of where.",

It seems like losing both of those races were devastating to democrats because after that, Republicans gained a huge advantage and 7 years later Republicans hold a 1.3 million voter advantage over democrats and Florida is a ruby red state sort of in the mold of Texas.

Although he later expressed opposition to using force to spread democracy and criticized the invasion of Iraq, serious questions remain about the extent of a thinker’s responsibility when their ideas are used to justify disastrous policies.",

      "text": "The “blue wall” once referred to the 18 states, including Wisconsin, Michigan, and Pennsylvania, which voted for Democrats in every consecutive presidential election from 1992-2012. In 2016, Donald Trump famously broke through the wall by flipping those states, raising significant questions about Democrats’ ability to win presidential elections in the future. Even in 2020, which was a considerably favorable year for Democrats, Joe Biden won each by less than three percentage points.\n\nSince then, the erosion of Democratic support in the U.S. has become more widespread, affecting even institutionally “blue” states. In fact, in the 2024 presidential election, Democrat Kamala Harris won New Jersey by just under six points—a staggeringly low margin. In the same cycle, neighboring New York saw a 10-point rightward shift from the previous election, marking the worst Democratic performance there in years.\n\nSo, today, what is the “blue wall”? If Wisconsin, Michigan, and Pennsylvania are no longer secure, and other traditionally Democratic states are becoming increasingly competitive, what is the Democrats’ path to victory in future presidential elections? Can Democrats feasibly reverse the gains Republicans have made, or are said gains indicative of a more alarming, long-term trend?",

Most of my educated relatives are pretty conservative by American standards and even my pretty Americanized immigrant parents are solidly to the right on some issues and have right leanings on a bunch of smaller issues (though most political quizzes point to them both as quite in the middle of the centrist spectrum).\n\nIn addition I saw a comment on Youtube talking about how Middle Eastern countries tend to emphasize Islam as essential in getting many degrees even those unrelated to theology at all such as accounting and painting. Maybe not emphasize Islamic classes but a lot of required courses for all majors like some credits in a literature or some other writing based classes will bring up Islam as a topic to be read about and discussed with with written essay assignments.\n\nThat practically in East Asia, universities don't focus on sexual liberation and other secular humanist ideas is a thing I seen thrown around in East Asia and subs devoted to specific countries in that region. In fact one poster I remember even said all the people teaching in North Korea's universities and colleges openly endorse patriotism, social hierarchy, and other Confucianist values.\n\nAnd in several telenovelas I watched, across a lot of Latin America, the clergy is directly involved with how universities and colleges are run. Esp prominent in telenovelas from Mexico.\n\nSo I'm wondering, despite how education at the college level is so associated with liberalism and secularism and adopting democratic values in the West esp in North America, in the rest of the world, does education actually tend to make people more conservative and often alongside even more religious? Esp in 3rd world countries such as Morocco and Nepal?",

His face wasn't just in official portraits, it was EVERYWHERE.\n\nStores were full of items portraying him on mugs, T-shirts, calendars, magnets, etc.\nThey photoshopped him as a total badass.\nRiding a bear with explosions in the\nbackground, dressed like a ninja, or posed as a ripped warrior god. I even saw a guy with Putin's face tattooed on his arm.\n\nIt felt weird to walk through stores and streets filled with excessive portrayals of one man. I also felt kinda curious, because it was so unfamiliar to me. I remember thinking, our U.S presidents might get pop culture references, sure, but not this level of hero worship.\n\n\nFast forward to 2025... and now I'm seeing eerily similar things here, but with Trump. The same over-the-top, heavily edited \"badass\" images, this time with Trump instead of Putin.\nI've seen people proudly sporting Trump tattoos. The glorification, the obsession is the same pattern I saw in Russia, just with different colors & slogans.\n\nBack in 2016, it felt like a uniquely Russian thing. Now it feels like Americans have started doing the exact same thing.\n\nThe rise of excessive Trump imagery, similar to Putin’s portrayals, really makes you wonder what it says about political culture in the U.S. \n\nWhat drives these people to worship a man who doesn’t even know they exist? \n\nPLEASE NOTE: I’m asking this question as a Puerto Rican (technically American) but as someone who often feels alienated from U.S. culture. \n\nI’m curious about the psychology behind this. What drives people to become so obsessed with leaders? How does this affect individuals and society as a whole?\n\nPlease excuse any grammatical errors btw. English isn’t my first language.\n\n\n\nUPDATE: I’d like to thank everyone for being so civil & respectful in the comments. The experiences shared here have helped me understand why people behave the way they do. And I enjoyed reading all of your perspectives! \n\nMany of you have kindly explained that certain materials / merchandises doesn’t always reflect the general public’s opinion.

      "text": "There’s been a lot of focus on the stated purpose of U.S. tariffs,mainly as trade leverage or protection for domestic industry. But I’m wondering if we’re overlooking a more structural role they’re playing in the broader fiscal landscape.\n\nSince the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA), we’ve seen successive waves of major tax breaks, mostly benefiting the wealthy and corporations. The most dramatic example is the recently passed “Big Beautiful Bill” (2025), which not only extends the TCJA cuts, but adds new layers of high-income and business-friendly. According to CBO projections, the bill will add several trillion dollars to the deficit, even after accounting for spending cuts.\n\nMeanwhile, the Trump-era tariffs remain in place. These tariffs are effectively regressive taxes: they raise the price of imported goods, which low- and middle-income consumers feel most acutely. Unlike income taxes, tariffs don’t scale with wealth—they hit everyone who buys affected goods.\n\nSo here’s the theory:\n\nCould tariffs be functioning—intentionally or not—as a regressive revenue tool to help “offset” the massive tax cuts for the wealthy?\n\nThat is, while the federal government slashes top-line revenue from income and corporate taxes, it quietly maintains a consumer-side tax system that disproportionately burdens those least able to afford it.\n\nI’m not saying this was explicitly designed as a two-step wealth transfer, but the structural outcome is hard to ignore:\n1) Wealthy Americans get permanent tax relief\n2) Social programs are cut\n3) Working people pay more for essentials via higher import costs\n\nIs there any policy analysis, budget modeling, or behind-the-scenes commentary that digs into this possibility? Or are we looking at a pure coincidence of unrelated policy streams that happen to shift the tax burden downward?",

      "text": "I’m asking this out of curiosity, not to push any agenda.\n\nIf a population democratically elects a government that then dismantles democratic institutions and establishes an authoritarian regime, is that regime still considered legitimate or democratic in any meaningful way?\n\nDoes the democratic process that led to its rise justify its existence, or does the outcome invalidate the process retroactively?\n\nI’m wondering how political theory approaches this kind of paradox, and whether legitimacy comes from the means of attaining power or the nature of the regime itself.",

Would a pre determined number of years between redrawing improve the issue? Maps are only allowed to be altered every 10 or 20 years?\n\nI know getting states to implement these changes is an uphill battle.

      "title": "Imagine the Outrage: What If a 2029 Democratic President Pulled a “Trump 2.0”?",
      "text": "Now that President Donald Trump has returned to office for a second term, we’ve seen a wave of executive actions and appointments that have been viewed by critics as deeply unconventional—even if not technically illegal. Among the more debated moves:\n\n* Dismissing multiple Inspectors General across agencies\n* Issuing blanket pardons for individuals convicted in the January 6th Capitol riot\n* Replacing boards and commissions (e.g., the Kennedy Center) with ideological allies\n* Significantly downsizing or restructuring foreign aid institutions like USAID\n* Floating controversial clemency ideas involving high-profile convicted individuals, ostensibly for political benefit\n* Renaming public entities or landmarks in symbolic ways\n\nSupporters may view these actions as corrective or necessary to \"drain the swamp,\" while critics argue they undermine institutional independence and democratic norms.\n\n**Discussion Scenario:**  \nImagine that in 2029, a newly elected Democratic president adopts a similar approach. This future administration begins aggressively using executive authority to reshape agencies, issue ideologically motivated pardons, restructure traditionally non-partisan institutions, and take symbolic actions that provoke the opposing party.\n\n**Questions for Discussion:**\n\n1. Would congressional Republicans respond with hearings, investigations, or legislative pushback, even if the actions were technically legal?\n2. How might public perception shift if both major parties begin embracing this kind of executive behavior? Would voters normalize it, reject it, or become more polarized?\n3. Are there institutional guardrails—legal, cultural, or political—that still function effectively to limit executive overreach? Or are those largely dependent on precedent and public tolerance?\n4. If one party breaks norms, is it reasonable—or even inevitable—for the other party to respond in kind? Or is long-term restraint still politically viable?\n5. What precedent is being set for the presidency going forward, and how might this affect future transitions of power and interbranch relations?",

      "text": "The election of Donald J. Trump to the presidency in 2016 and again in 2024 represented a seismic disruption in the landscape of American political tradition. Lacking political experience, employing a combative and often incendiary rhetorical style, and defying the established norms of decorum that typically define presidential campaigns, Trump nonetheless succeeded in capturing both the Republican nomination and the White House. His victory, which defied the expectations of most political analysts, stands in stark contrast to the fate of another prominent conservative figure: Senator Barry Goldwater. In 1964, Goldwater, though similarly critical of the political establishment and committed to a strong ideological vision, was thoroughly defeated in a landslide election that many believed discredited the far-right wing of the Republican Party for a generation. Goldwater, a decorated military veteran and five-term U.S. Senator, offered a coherent—if controversial—vision of limited government and individual liberty, grounded in a tradition of constitutional conservatism. Trump, by contrast, eschewed detailed policy positions in favor of emotive, populist appeals and a media-dominating persona.\n\nThis paradox—that Trump, the more inflammatory and unorthodox candidate, succeeded where Goldwater, the more conventional and principled conservative, failed—invites a deeper inquiry into the transformation of American political culture across five decades. Why was the American electorate willing to embrace Trump’s populist nationalism in, while it had so forcefully rejected Goldwater’s ideological conservatism in 1964? What changed in the political, social, and media environment that allowed a candidate once considered unelectable by establishment standards to ascend to the presidency? And to what extent does Trump’s victory represent a culmination of the long-term realignment of the Republican Party that Goldwater’s campaign helped set in motion?",

      "text": "I was thinking about the California fires, and increases in climate related disasters driving up insurance premiums for home owners. I was noticing specially in California fire insurance is getting less and less practical for insurance companies since now instead of one claim being filed for a home it's entire neighborhoods. Like with the LA fires $12 billion dollars was paid out by insurance companies.\n\nMy idea is what if we nationalized the insurance companies getting rid of the profit incentive and expanding the pool of insurance payers. \nThe problem with these weather related phenomenon is that insurance companies don't have large enough pools of insurance premiums to cover these disasters in such large concentrated areas. But if it were nationalized now it wouldn't be restricted to certain regions and people suffering from fires in California can supplement the damages with east coast premiums or if there's a hurricane in the south it can be helped payed by other regions who are all contributing to the same pot for insurance claims. It would also expand the pool in the sense of all the current insurance companies with there pool of clients would become one. By having a larger pool of prayers it would drive down premiums. It would also take away the profit incentive for companies to give as much shareholder value to its buyers as possible. Allowing for a pay in and pay out system that would be similar to social security. Maybe even being invested in broad U.S. focused index funds or at least a percentage of it which I feel social security should've been doing as well since it's foundation instead of a pool of money not being invested.\n\nThis was just a thought I had in my investments class when we were going over the math for insurance companies when they have multiple claims vs one. Curious everyone's thoughts and if there's a mistake in my own thoughts. Would this be possible?",

      "text": "I’ve been thinking a lot about how democracy works in practice. We always say it’s “majority rule,” but then there are times when what the majority wants can be harmful or unfair to certain groups.

I’m wondering where the line should be drawn—how do you make sure a government reflects what most people want without trampling on the rights of others?

      "title": "With Republicans redrawing Texas maps to gain 5 seats, should Democrats gerrymander too?",
      "text": "The Republican Party currently controls the U.S. House of Representatives; however, they hold one of the narrowest majorities in modern history--just 220 seats versus the Democrats' 215. Combined with an increasingly unfavorable political climate (fueled in no small part by backlash against the Trump administration), it seems increasingly likely that the GOP could lose House control in the upcoming midterm elections.\n\nIn an effort to combat this, President Trump recently asked the Texas GOP to redraw the state's congressional maps to yield 5 more seats for Republicans, providing a cushion for future losses. For clarity, the existing Texas map is already a prime example of gerrymandering: it provides Republicans control of roughly two-thirds of Texas' congressional delegation--25 out of 38 seats--despite a closer partisan split among voters. Yet, per Trump's demands, Texan legislators this morning unveiled a new map proposal that would give Republicans  30 seats, cutting the Democratic share to just 8.\n\nYou might ask, why don't Democrats do the same? Historically, Democrats have been opposed to gerrymandering, and support bipartisan/independent redistricting commissions instead (bar a few exceptions, notably, Maryland and Illinois). But recent events have sparked a widespread push for Democratic leaders to \"fight fire with fire\" and redraw congressional maps to offset GOP gains in Texas. California governor Gavin Newsom has been at the forefront of this push, urging voters to vote out independent redistricting commissions so Democratic gerrymanders can take place. It has been suggested that, if such efforts succeed across multiple states, Democrats could gain up to a dozen additional seats in 2026.\n\nSo, should Democrats embrace partisan redistricting in blue states to counter GOP advantages? What might the implications be of such a move? Could this renewed battle over gerrymandering push the U.S. toward reform, or is polarization too deep for that to happen?\n\nEdit: I hear what people are saying—yes, Democrats also gerrymander their maps; however, they don’t do it at the same scale or extent that Republicans do (ex.: the NY map is definitely favorable for Democrats; however, it’s nowhere near as lopsided as the proposed Texas map, for example).",

The office of Management and Budget is basically giving the middle finger to Congress in regards to spending. Congress is appropriating money, which is their right, and OMD is simply ignoring the laws to spend it.\n\nThis article was easily the most alarming article I’ve read in a while regarding norms, the law and precedent.\n\nAnd let me make it crystal clear. This isn’t just me calling out the GOP. Imagine if a Democrat admin simple said “We’re not going to spend what Congress allotted to defense this year.” I would be just as frustrated. \n\nI am all for spending less, and that starts with Congress. Not some executive branch office simply saying “we’re not going to do what Congress has instructed us to do.”\n\nWhere or what is the pushback here? It seems like the constitution is pretty clear on where this power resides. \n\nHere are a few quotes.\n\n“The standoff is approaching a pivot point. Funds that expire in September have been held up, often without the required notification to Congress. Funds for the National Institutes of Health, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration and foreign aid are among those at risk.”\n\n“The congressional Government Accountability Office has the power to file a lawsuit to force the release of money. It has only ever done so once before, in the 1970s. The GAO has opened about 50 investigations into the Trump administration’s funding freezes and told lawmakers that the OMB hasn’t been responsive. This past week, it found that the Trump administration had illegally withheld money for Head Start, the early-childhood education program.”\n\n“Vought quickly reasserted himself. In March, the OMB refused to follow a requirement to spend all of the $12.4 billion in money designated as emergency funds. The law explicitly said that the White House had to spend all or none. “It is incumbent on all of us to follow the law as written—not as we would like it to be,” Collins wrote in a letter with her Democratic committee counterpart.”\n\n“That same month, Vought stopped publishing data on a website showing the pace at which money was being allotted to various agencies consistent with annual spending laws.”",

If you follow that logic of America as a purely creedal nation, America purely as an idea, that is where it would lead you.\n\nThat answer would also reject a lot of people that the A.D.L. would label as domestic extremists even those very Americans had their ancestors fight in the Revolutionary War and the Civil War. I think the people whose ancestors fought in the Civil War have a hell of a lot more claim over America than the people who say they don’t belong”\n\nNow, the vice president did not completely exclude immigrants, but he conditioned his acceptance of new citizens on their gratitude, condemning those who would criticize the United States as ungrateful. To make this point, Vance went after Zohran Mamdani, the Democratic nominee for mayor of New York City.\n\n\"Today is July 5th, 2025, which means, as all of you know, that yesterday we celebrated the 249th anniversary of the birth of our nation, Now, the person who wishes to lead our largest city had, according to multiple media reports, never once publicly mentioned America's Independence Day in earnest. But when he did so this year, this is what he said, and this is an actual quote.\"\n\n\"America is beautiful, contradictory, unfinished. I am proud of our country, even as we constantly strive to make it better.\"\n\n“There is no gratitude in those words. No sense of owing something to this land and the people who turned its wilderness into the\n\nZoran Mamdani’s father fled Uganda when the tyrant Idi Amin decided to ethnically cleanse his nation’s Indian population. Mamdani’s family fled violent racial hatred only for him to come to this country, a country built by people he never knew, overflowing with generosity to his family, offering a haven from the kind of violent ethnic conflict that is commonplace in world history, but it is not commonplace here, and he dares on our 249th anniversary to congratulate it by paying homage to its incompleteness and to its, as he calls it, contradiction.\n\nI wonder, has he ever read the letters from boy soldiers in the Union Army to parents and sweethearts that they’d never see again? Has he ever visited the gravesite of a loved one who gave their life to build the kind of society where his family can escape racial theft and racial violence? Has he ever looked in the mirror and recognized that he might not be alive were it not for the generosity of a country he dares to insult on its most sacred day? Who the hell does he think that he is?”\n\nWhile what Vance says is theoretically true, it also means he think Mamdani doesn’t have the right to criticize the US system even though he has to take the oath to the same constitution and go through the legal process to become a citizen. Does this extend to someone who is say a second generation immigrant. Are they allowed to be ungrateful if they couldn’t be here without the generosity of the US?\n\nOr is the US is a creedal nation? While I don’t know if I can make a good argument, I can refer to Abraham Lincoln.\n\nHere’s what he said on July 10, 1858, in a speech on “popular sovereignty,” the Scott ruling and the expansion of slavery.\n\n“””We have besides these men — descended by blood from our ancestors — among us perhaps half our people who are not descendants at all of these men, they are men who have come from Europe — German, Irish, French and Scandinavian — men that have come from Europe themselves or whose ancestors have come hither and settled here, finding themselves our equals in all things. If they look back through this history to trace their connection with those days by blood, they find they have none, they cannot carry themselves back into that glorious epoch and make themselves feel that they are part of us, but when they look through that old Declaration of Independence, they find that those old men say that “we hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal,” and then they feel that that moral sentiment taught in that day evidences their relation to those men, that it is the father of all moral principle in them and that they have a right to claim it as though they were blood of the blood and flesh of the flesh of the men who wrote that Declaration, and so they are. That is the electric cord in that Declaration that links the hearts of patriotic and liberty-loving men together, that will link those patriotic hearts as long as the love of freedom exists in the minds of men throughout the world.”””\n\nI think it is under this assumption, that everyone who becomes a US citizen has a direct heritage back to our founding fathers, that Lincoln and the Republicans signed birthright citizenship and the 13th, 14th, and 15th amendments into law.\n\nSo is the US a creedal nation or based on blood and soil?",

While titillation has always been present in media, it seems to obviously have worsened. Some is due to an American president who uses falsehoods and conspiracy as a tool for attacking his opponents and strengthening his supporters.  Some is due to the growth of social media and the prominence of sites like TikTok and Facebook. Some is the nature of capitalism and western culture. But do you agree that this has become collectively our dominant focus of conversation?\n\nThe second premise of my question, if you agree what we mostly talk about, is whether this is leaving us dangerously unprepared to address the many consequential issues facing humanity. Climate change, mass starvation, immigration and military conflicts are topics of international importance that I fear a substantial portion of our population have a poor understanding -- and some have been misinformed by the aforementioned sources. Even less consequential but still very important issues like domestic politics are overwhelmed by nonsense (personal gripe: just today, I saw a post which credited Trump with stopping illegal immigrants from having the government pay for gender affirmation surgery). How will are we going to avoid the many disasters which threaten us if we spend most of our time on the trivial?",

      "text": "Right now, more than 400,000 people in the United States are locked up while legally presumed innocent. They are being held before trial, often simply because they cannot afford bail or are labeled a potential risk. The average wait is around 8 months. That is long enough to lose your job, your home, and custody of your kids. Many eventually have their charges dropped or are found not guilty, but the damage is already done.\n\nThe legal foundation for this system comes from the 1987 Supreme Court case *United States v. Salerno*, which upheld the constitutionality of detaining people pretrial for being \"dangerous.\" What is often left out is that the defendant, mob boss Anthony Salerno, had already been convicted and sentenced to over 100 years. A judge delayed formal sentencing so the case would technically qualify as \"pretrial,\" allowing it to be used to test and uphold the 1984 Bail Reform Act.\n\nThere is another overlooked issue. Chief Justice William Rehnquist, who wrote the majority opinion in *Salerno*, had previously helped draft the very law it was reviewing. He worked on the 1984 Bail Reform Act while serving in a DOJ advisory capacity under the Reagan administration. That dual role raised serious questions about judicial impartiality and whether one person should be both architect and final interpreter of a law that reshaped pretrial liberty in the United States.\n\nSince that decision, the use of pretrial detention has exploded. Many people accused of nonviolent offenses, especially those from poor and minority communities, are detained for months simply because they cannot pay to get out. The system also costs taxpayers billions of dollars annually.\n\nSome states have taken steps to reduce reliance on pretrial detention. New Jersey largely eliminated cash bail in 2017 and saw no increase in crime. Illinois recently became the first state to abolish cash bail statewide. Others are experimenting with risk assessment tools, though those bring concerns about bias and fairness.\n\nStill, national reform has been slow and politically complicated.\n\nHow do we significantly reduce the number of people held in pretrial detention while maintaining public safety? \n\nIs this even constitutional?\n\nWhat would meaningful reform look like?\n\nPodcast source:  \n[**Justice Abandoned: Rachel Barkow on the Supreme Court’s Role in Mass Incarceration**](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5L1YZaGHlECXimOpvYlIRi?si=NpunvjpvSt2tS-1OWZky9g)",

But all of these Unions haven't been successful in the long term. Why is this the case? Now I know that one of the reasons is that they were either kingdoms or were authoritarian regimes, but I don't think that that's the only thing that explains this phenomenon. The only exception that I know of is the Russian Empire.\n\nThis especially intrigues me as an Indian, because India is exponentially more diverse than all these Unions, and is more diverse than all of Europe, and yet it has stayed stable and united for longer than all these aforementioned Unions, despite challenges, while also being a democratic republic. It's not without its flaws ofc, but it's still stable and united, and has been so for longer than the aforementioned Unions. Now I know that Europe has a tendency of decentralisation, and that the concept of a nation-state arose in Europe. But India also was made up of tons of different kingdoms before it united. So I don't think that that perspective explains Europe's track record in this regard.\n\nI'm only talking about sovereign Unions, so the EU doesn't qualify for this. But even if you include the EU, it has only been around for a few decades, and the UK has already left the EU. Russia is also a young country, so it doesn't count either. \n\nThe only examples of successful diverse Unions in Europe in the long term, are the really small ones, such as Belgium and Switzerland. \n\nSo what explains this phenomenon in Europe?",

Similarly, current healthcare treatments and pharmaceutical costs place a significant burden on the American people. If the government were to invest in accelerating the development of more effective treatments, it could substantially reduce overall healthcare costs, lower pharmaceutical prices, and even bring down insurance premiums due to the availability of more efficient therapies. Such advancements could also help move the needle toward achieving universal healthcare.\n\nWhile the government already subsidizes many tech, healthcare, and pharmaceutical companies, to my knowledge, it invests relatively little in the development of fusion technology compared to its heavy support of the natural gas industry—an industry that would be directly and negatively affected by a breakthrough in clean, reliable alternative energy. Likewise, pharmaceutical and healthcare companies could see reduced profits if new treatments lead to fewer doctor visits and less reliance on prescription drugs.\n\nShould the government create contracts to directly support the development of fusion technology and life-changing medical innovations? Such contracts would encourage private sector competition, promote innovation, and drive economic growth. This approach also uses economic demand to force change, offering a more effective way to push for environmental and healthcare progress by building market-driven alternatives that challenge existing industries. These technologies wouldn’t just lower everyday costs for Americans; They could also expand opportunities for people to pursue healthier, freer, and more fulfilling lives.",

It seems like any criticism of Trump, even when well-founded or coming from a conservative perspective, is instantly dismissed as betrayal, conspiracy or even seen as somehow good?\n\nIn my country (Germany), political discourse - even among supporters of one party - usually includes a fair amount of self-criticism. You can absolutely support a party or a politician, but also acknowledge when they mess up. For example, even many Social Democrats openly criticized Olaf Scholz for his hesitant stance on Ukraine or poor communication. This kind of internal debate seems healthy and necessary in a democracy.\n\nWith Trump, however, it feels like any crack in loyalty is treated as heresy. Why has it become so absolutist? Is this a uniquely American phenomenon? Is it something about the media ecosystem (Fox, Truth Social, etc.), about how Trump frames himself, or about deeper cultural shifts?\n\nI'm really not trying to provoke - I'm trying to understand.  \nLooking forward to your insights!",

But with tightening visa policies, general anti-immigrant sentiment, and increasing uncertainty, many are talking about leaving (or not coming at all, Fall apps are down by a lot, admissions office hasnt disclosed data but the inboxes are vacant)\n\nAt the same time, the U.S. is pouring billions into AI, robotics, chips, and biotech. Which is great! But who’s going to staff those projects if the international talent pipeline dries up?\" The American Worker!\"-I hear you say. But it takes years to train a top-tier researcher, and the U.S. education system—especially public STEM—hasn’t been receiving enough support(funding cuts and all that)\n\nI'm struggling to see the long-term strategy here. Is there one? Or is this just policy contradiction from different arms of the government?\n\nOpen to hearing any side of this—just want to understand what the big-picture thinking is supposed to be.\n\nOpen to hearing any side of this—just want to understand what the big-picture thinking is supposed to be",

It challenges the idea that Western democracies (like the U.S., UK, France, Germany, etc.) function as representative governments of the people. Instead, it argues that these systems are increasingly dominated by corporate and billionaire elites, across party lines.\n\nThe video points to financial ties between major politicians and global financial institutions (e.g., Goldman Sachs or BlackRock), the influence of campaign contributions and policy decisions that consistently favor capital over public interest.\n\nWhether or not one agrees with the ideological framing, it raises key questions:\n\n* Is having elections enough to qualify a system as democratic?\n* What structural changes (if any) would make democracies more accountable to ordinary citizens?\n* Are there any current political figures or mechanisms that escape this cycle of elite influence?\n\nI'd be interested in hearing perspectives from across the spectrum.\n\n*(For anyone curious, the video is called “Rule by the rich: Western governments are oligarchies, not democracies” from Geopolitical Economy Report on YouTube. It’s about 43 minutes, but it is dense with examples and references.)*",

The last two times democrats have had an incumbent president they have been +7, both in 2005 and 2017.  The current polling has democrats far behind where they’ve been previously.  The current polling also suggests that retaking the house is not a sure thing with the historical margin of error.\n\nWhat does the under performance of democrats in polls suggest for both republicans, democrats, and the general state of politics?

What can they do to make themselves more popular?  Is there a route to make republicans less popular?",

Why do we as a general society lack even a basic education and understanding of political science and theory?**\n\nWhat I mean is, we have data and examples going back thousands of years on how certain policies affect a governed people.\n\nI understand that societies evolve and societal wants and needs change, but shouldn't the core principles and policy drivers still basically be constant? Maybe not something as simple or elegant as PV=nRT (ah, volume goes up so pressure must go down or temp must go up), but... something... \n\nLike why are we still having debates (not the most recent presidential debate, but more like a generic political discourse) where one politician can say (just as a random example - I am not picking a political side one way or another - if you feel this example leans too far toward one side, make up another in your head going the other direction) \"I will cut taxes to promote spending\" and another will respond with something vague like \"we know that doesn't work\" or \"we've seen in the past that that's not how it plays out\" and then they just kind of... move on without anything changing. The first politician can just respond \"you're wrong\" or \"my plan is 'different'\" or \"'better'\" and we are just left to accept that that is that.\n\nWhy aren't they responding with something with explicit citations? \"My fellow candidate, that may be your \"opinion\" on the policy, but as the data has proven time and time again in cases X, Y, and Z, dating back to 1923, your \"opinion\" is as valid as that of believing the earth is flat.\"\n\nOf course that is getting more into political discourse theory. My question is more around the idea that shouldn't we have \"answers\" for most of the common issues by now? I guess, why do we (myself absolutely included) lack even a basic education and understanding of political science and theory?\n\nI feel like things would be much more amicable for society (or at least far less polarizing) if we were all (conservatives, liberals, middlers, whatever) like \"dude, we all learned in 3rd grade polisci that your plan is idiotic, get off the stage... next!\"\n\nI realize there's also a subtext that \"yes, I know that it doesn't work the way I am stating it, but it will benefit me and those who support me.. and if I can state it in such a way that you believe it will also benefit you, then you will vote for me.\"\n\nI also realize that politicians on both sides want people to be less educated on the policies so that they can manipulate them and come in as a sort of savior with their genius plans.\n\nLastly, I understand that issues evolve and that new issues arise as society changes. These would be new things to learn and test and gather data on... just like anything else \"new\" in any other field of science.",

I would be more than happy to clarify anything if needed.\n\nI’m a 15 year old guy trying to learn more about politics. I mainly hold left (minor) libertarian (more major) views. I am open to information of any side of the political spectrum as I believe that it is important for one to be educated on all aspects of a debate/issue.\n\nOne of my biggest wishes is to participate in political discourse with people that hold strong political beliefs. I have loose beliefs and I just want to learn more - it doesn’t matter if it’s info on liberal or conservative views, I just want to learn more and formulate my own beliefs through those discussions.\n\nIf you don’t have the time, I would be extremely thankful if you could leave some tips on how to become more educated. If possible, I would also love to learn more about news sources that you think depict the most accurate news.\n\nThanks!",

      "text": "This is a curious and rather bizarre trend or phenomenon I've been noticing for the past year during this entire political season. All the more bizarre because no one else seems to talk about it. Every time there is a filmed political rally speech where there are people placed behind the speaker at the podium, they ALWAYS, without exception, heavily prioritize placing East Asian women behind the speaker. Yesterday, with Donald Trump giving a speech, was just the latest example of this (though in this case they happened to pick a particularly good looking one). And. while white males are also placed along with them, you rarely ever see white females put in such positions nowadays.  And this is done completely regardless of whether they're attractive or not. All that matters is that they are of a certain race. Can someone explain this socio-political phenomenon to me, which seems to have started in recent years (post 2016)?",

Either people change their voting substantially or the parties themselves change. \n\nIn the 2022 Australian Federal Election, the ‘Teal Independents’ took over 6 Liberal seats in inner city suburbs, adding to Zali Steggall’s seat in Sydney. Currently they hold collectively 7 seats in the House of Representatives, 4 in Sydney, 2 in Melbourne and 1 in Perth. \n\nThese seats for decades formed the base of the Liberal Party and prior conservative counterparts, often being held on substantial margins and almost always winning more than 50% of the popular vote (therefore not needing to rely on preferences). \n\nThese seats are typically much wealthier seats, in fact most of them (if not all) are in the top 10 wealthiest federal divisions in Australia. And I should know I live in one of them. Apparently these electorates are fiscally conservative or liberal, and socially progressive. To an EXTENT, that is true. \n\nNone of the ‘Teal Independents’ seats are held on high margins. And apart from Steggall’s seat in Sydney, all of the Liberals won the popular vote (but lost on preferences. A large part of why they lost is that some people chose the ‘Teal Independent’ as a tactical vote to remove the Liberal candidate (that is also, to an EXTENT, true, as the Labor and Greens vote declined in these seats). But many also changed from voting liberal. \n\nAs someone who even lives in one of these seats, I don’t even know myself whether the Liberals would ever have a shot at these seats again. The liberals got trounced in the cities in 2022 but comparatively did quite well in regional and rural areas. \n\nIs this the beginning of a political realignment in which the liberals can only form government through outer suburbs and the rural and regional areas? Or was this a setback which they can come back from?",

Something I always assumed was Forbes being generally more \"center-right\", with most of their platform being right only when it comes to economic policy.  Lately, they've really pushed culture war \"gotcha\" moments (especially GOP politician clips on trans debates), and comparatuvely they use charged language in many of their video titles.  Based on the comments in each video, they seem to pander to the right broadly as of late.  Did they get new management?  Have they been bringing on more extremists, or is their YT branch more radical compared to their writing staff on Forbes proper?  Or have I been blind to this because I've only recently seen these clips just now?\n\nSome examples:\n\n[Boebert on gas stoves](https://youtu.be/3Q8vVjIJyQk)\n\n[Haley on Trans Athletes](https://youtu.be/Lnr2uLf0BSc)",

They are heavily involved with the economy, and have political members on the board of every company. \n\nThe upside of this is that they are able to be highly efficient. Rather than being bogged down by endless debates, political polarization, the constant handing off of power, they are able to make decisions and act very rapidly in the face of changing environments. \n\nHypothetically, if a one-party government were ethical, just, utilitarian, etc… wouldn’t this be the ideal system to run, akin to Plato’s philosopher king?",

      "title": "Would this political system work ?",
      "text": "TL;DR : a federal parliamentary system with a 4th branch of government that controls public services (performance, corruption and audit). This 4th branch can also pass a bill to Parliament without government approval.\n\nI imagined a parliamentary federal system for my country (Mali) with a little twist here's how it works :\n\n1) Parliamentary regime : \n\nThe Federal President is the head of state, elected indirectly by an electoral college (regional+federal assemblies). They can appoint and dissolve the government under certain conditions, based on the Prime Minister's advice.\n\nThe Prime Minister leads the government, appoints ministers, and implements policies approved by Parliament.\n\nParliament has two chambers:\n\nThe Federal Assembly (main legislative body with 147 members, elected for 3 years).\n\nThe Council of Regions (45 regional representatives with longer 6-year terms). They focus on regional and federal balance in decision-making.\n\n\nLaws are debated and passed in Parliament, with mechanisms for resolving disagreements between the two chambers. Basically like Bundestag and Bundesrat\n\n\n\n2. Competence Bureau's Role:\n\nThe Competence Bureau is a specialized body designed to ensure government efficiency and reduce corruption. This 4th branch of government is inspired by Taiwan's Control and Exam Yuans.\n\nIt is led by a General Secretary and consists of 2 subunits each led by a secretary :\n\nExam Bureau: Organizes evaluations for government roles, ensuring qualified and capable people fill key positions.\n\nControl Bureau: Monitors government agencies, verifying performance and rooting out corruption. It has no power to directly remove people from office but an impeached official can face charges by administrative courts.\n\n\nExperts are assigned to specific fields within the Bureau. They analyze government performance, collect data, and report findings to Parliament for further action.\n\nEvery three years (or before elections), an Experts Congress is held, where performance reviews and recommendations are shared to the newly elected government. This would allow to correct mistakes and evaluate effectiveness of previous policies.\n\n\n\n3. Relationship Between the Competence Bureau and the Parliamentary System:\n\nThe Bureau acts as a safeguard for the parliamentary regime, ensuring that laws are implemented effectively and public officials perform their duties responsibly.\n\nParliament can use the Bureau's findings to make informed decisions, remove underperforming officials, or amend policies.\n\nCitizens indirectly influence the Bureau’s work since it reports to Parliament, which they elect.\n\nThe Bureau can pass a bill for the Parliament to vote, the government cannot block this bill. However as the secretaries are appointed by the prime minister (with Parliament approval), they should be likeminded and have similar ideologies.\n\n\n\n4. Regional and Citizen Participation:\n\nAt the regional level, Governors and Regional Assemblies manage local governance. They tie into the federal structure by contributing members to the Council of Regions. I chose a federal structure because of the complex ethnic diversity, federalism might reduce tensions.\n\nAll citizens can integrate the aforementionned bureaucracy through the Exam, thus guaranteeing a meritocratic institution.\n\nWould this system work? Is it unrealistic (mostly financially) to have this much bureaucracy or can it actually prevent corruption ? How would you improve it?",

      "text": "According to former Defense Secretary Mark Esper, when Trump was President, he discussed the idea of firing missiles at Mexican drug cartels' bases.\n\nThis did not happen.  But I have a few questions about the details of this scenario:\n\n- Is firing missiles into a country's territory automatically an act of war against that country?  Would doing this put the US at war with Mexico?  Does it matter that they would be aimed at a criminal organization?\n- Back in 1916 Pancho Villa [attacked New Mexico, possibly several times](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pancho_Villa#Attack_on_New_Mexico) leading to a [US military expedition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pancho_Villa_Expedition) into Mexico.  Are the drug cartels' actions comparable to Villa's raids?  Could firing of missiles against drug cartels be considered, for purposes of international law, roughly equivalent to the Pancho Villa Expedition?\n- The US is in a permanent War on Drugs.  Does that relate at all?  My thinking is that since we've declared war on drugs, then missile strikes (or other military operations) against drug cartel installations, in whatever nation they may be located, might automatically be authorized?\n- Would it conceivably be possible for the Mexican government to agree to let the US Military attack the cartels?  Would it conceivably be possible for this kind of attack to be approved by the US and Mexican governments, but carried out in secret from the public (presumably to avoid outrage in Mexico that the government would permit a foreign country to launch weapons at populated targets on Mexican soil)?  Or would news organizations be able to use civilian radar / satellites / surveillance footage to quickly piece together why a bunch of drug cartel bases \"suddenly and inexplicably exploded\"?",

      "text": "I live in nyc and this presidential election will be my first time voting. When I registered to vote I didn't pick a political party so now I'm worried if I can still vote or not. I saw that if you don't register to vote with a specific political party than you can vote in the primary election, I want to know if that's true and how that affects me voting next month. Also if I wanted to register with a specific political party can I still do that now and can I change the party I'm registered with in the future (after election) if I wanted to?",

Part of that is because of past abuse that I won't get into here. The other part is that I ignorantly thought that nothing politic or even political-adjacent affected me. I know better than that now. \n\nI'm essentially asking for an ELI5: Politics Edition. I know that it's kind of a big ask for anyone to  answer such a broad question simply, but I'm hoping that someone would be willing to help me understand. \nI have a few starting questions:\n\n1. Is there any way to get unbiased information about the current nominees, like their policies, hot button issues. (they are called nominees, right)?\n\n\n2. How do you figure out where each nominee stands with different issues? (I started watching the democratic debate last night, but I noticed that they have a tendency to not fully answer the question or just change the subject completely?)\n\n\n3. Do we the people get to vote for which Democrat/Republican/third party nominee gets to run for president?)\n\n\n4. How do the people for Senate and House get elected? \n\n\nPlease be gentle. I'm trying to understand how the system works.\n\n \nI want to have my voice be heard even if it's only a tiny voice among millions. Most importantly, I want to be able to look my children in the eye and at the very least be able to tell them that I tried to make a difference, that I stood up for their rights.",

While it would certainly require taking the long view in strategy, winning some local or state elections seems like a great opportunity to grow a new organization.\n\nIf a minor political party focused on a single state or region, wouldn't it be a much better use of their resources to get their people elected there?  This would allow them to develop examples of their ideas and platform in work while also giving them a solid base from which to operate and develop new sources of press and funding.  If a party grew like this, they could potentially push for state level election changes such as ranked choice or proportional voting that could help break the two party system in the long run.\n\nThis idea seems obvious to me, but I know that there are much wiser political minds in the world who would have thought this up if it was a valid strategy.  What would be the problem with this approach?",

      "text": "Now, I’m just a teenager getting into understanding politics. From birth, as an American and from what I learned, I grew up thinking that democracy is the best and everything other than it is backwards. But, now, I feel like there are merits in the political  systems I always used to disagree on. I even thought at one point that every country should just be a democracy. Is democracy really the “best”?\n\nDemocracies can be slow and inefficient, having to go through so much bureaucracy to get anything done. To add, and not to sound cynical, but sometimes the most popular decision by the people may not be the “best” decision. I feel like a system like ours could discourage leaders from making the hard or unpopular decisions that will look great in the near or far future, but harder to appreciate in the present (whether due to traditionalism, or lack of vision). Also, some politicians may only care about “having a seat in the gov’t”, so it’s not like democracy completely blocks off selfishness and corruption\n\nNow, some of the political systems I used to disagree with the most were monarchs and dictators.\n\nI feel there is a benefit to a monarch :  a leader raised from birth to love their people, educated with good teachings on science,leadership and philosophy c, and doesn’t have to worry about being replaced and doing anything to stay in power . They’ve been prepared their whole life to be a leader for their nation and to represent them for the long term. \n\nAs for sole leaders/dictatorships not by blood, I think they also have merit. They’re extremely efficient, things can get done just like that. And if they’re decisions align with the people the people get what they want at a faster pace. \n\nThere are only 2, but these are the ones I disliked the most before. That’s not to say I think they’re without their faults, but looking at both the positives and negatives, I don’t see democracy as necessarily “better”? I think any system can have a positive run at any point of time, but the world is not that ideal.\n\nI’m interested in anywhere I was wrong since I want to learn more. Thanks!",

Proven false considering fascism and socialist/communist are both collectivist, though opposite\n2. Views on economics. Left for regulated (planned to complex taxing), right for free (less to no tax). Proven false considering libertarian and fascism is on the same, though fascists like government controlled economy for the state\n3. Cultural. Left for progressivism, right for conservatism aka saving the tradition. Proven false as libertarians and fascists don't share the views on culture I guess\n4. Origins. The left for overall changes, the right for reactionism, just like in the FBR. Obviously, we would need some sort of the zero meridian, which is, in my opinion, considered the Western world (namely the US, and the EU in some ways). Then rightist fascists make no sense as they DO advocate changes\n\nAnd if we add some capitalist centrists here, everything just falls apart.

However, despite that, it is one of the most complicated political theories I ever encountered, especially the fact that all sub-versions of Communism have their own interests and priorities apart that they all share the philosophies that Communism stands for. So please correct me if I got something wrong about the philosophy of Communism\n\nApart that history tells us a lot on how the philosophy of Communism has been abused or used in very scary ways (like the Russian Revolution led to millions dead, Lenin's version of Communism involved a heavy use of propaganda to demonize the bourgeoisie class, Stalin's tyranny in the USSR involved harsh actions of a dictatorship, Mao's Chinese Revolution led to famine and even genocide, and the many other Communist leaders that were prone to corruption and those countries later experienced economic stagnancy and even poverty and famine), Communism always had a bad reputation in politics, even before the paranoia of the Cold War even started.\n\nEven today, whenever someone wants to criticism against actions that are more related to socialism (like the prioritization of equality, social welfare, or LGBT activism), are immediately deemed as \"Communist\" practices or any kind of practices that is related to Communism (many people use the word \"Marxism\" which I have not understood yet why they exactly use that version of Communism considering that Leninism, Stalinism and Maoism all had their criticisms as well)\n\nI can understand the paranoia against Communism given that it can easily attract corruption or government acts that are related to fascism, dictatorships or military force, such as history tells us during the Cold War but I have not really understood why Communism itself always becomes a label itself that is associated with horror, paranoia or any kind of demonisation you can think of\n\n(much like what other people can easily do against those who do not agree with their points of view. If for example, I am not pro-LGBT, I can be easily labelled as a homophobe by an activist even though I never stated that I was. Or if I am a supporter of the right, I can be easily labelled as a \"fascist\" against someone from the left even though I never started that I supported fascism)",

I realize that the lobbying industry would collapse. Akin & Gump, Patton Boggs... gone. But... why is that a problem? Is this just a problem of \"weak entity corporations\" that rely on Congress for their existence in our modern world because of the money they can give them to have Congress push subsidies into an industry/company?\n\nThanks in advance, I know its probably not the newest idea.",

The second half of the Green Book covers social issues, which seem rather right-wing when compared to the first half.\n\nThen there's the founders of Baathism. Depending on who you ask, they were either inspired by fascism and Nazism or they weren't.

      "title": "Help me understand presidential politics in rural America",
      "text": "A few months ago discovered that every Wikipedia page for American counties include results for every presidential election going back to 1896. I stumbled upon this by accident because I was curious about the origin of the name of a very rural county (Pend Oreille) in my state of Washington. \n\nThe vote totals in Pend Oreille County interested me because Democrats won 13 out of 17 presidential elections between 1932 and 1996 (Eisenhower ‘52, Nixon ‘72 and Reagan ‘80, ‘84 were the sole GOP winners), and often by landslides (12.5 percent average margin of victory with FDR winning by 33.2% in ‘32 and LBJ by 33.5% in 1964. Notably, the only Republican to exceed those margins was Trump in 2016 with a 34.7% margin over Hillary Clinton. At the time, I looked at a few other counties in rural Eastern Washington and the pattern was similar. FDR Country had become Trump Country. \n\nTonight I decided to look at another state, Iowa. I looked at 20 rural counties and noticed the same trend of strong support for FDR, Truman and LBJ, and was expecting a steady trend to the GOP since ‘96, but it wasn’t really like that. \n\nFirst of all, I was expecting Jimmy Carter and Bill Clinton would be the most successful Democrats since LBJ. But I couldn’t have been more wrong. The most successful presidential candidates were Michael Dukakis and Barack Obama. Two guys about as far from rural Iowa as you could get and they either beat their GOP foes or came in a solid second. \n\nSecond, Bill Clinton generally won, but got a big helping hand from Ross Perot. \n\nThird, Hillary did as bad as you might expect in the smallest counties and the gap between her and Obama’s vote totals averaged about 15-20%. \n\nFourth, Trump’s margins of victory in rural Iowa were enormous, matched only by FDR in ‘32 and LBJ in ‘64, and much larger than those of Reagan and Bush the Younger. \n\nIf you are still reading this, I’m curious about what you garner from all  and encourage you to pick another state and let us know what you discover. Here are my takeaways: \n\n- It is still possible for Democrats to win in rural America, especially in a down economy like 1988 and 2008, and possibly in 2020.\n\n- Economic issues are more important than cultural issues. \n\n- Candidates do not have to be folksy to appeal to rural voters. Perhaps they just need to listen and show that they care. \n\n- I’m still not sure how to explain the large gap between Hillary Clinton’s vote totals and those of Obama and Trump. How much comes down to talk radio ranting against her for 25 years vs her likeability as a candidate vs just plain sexism. Politically, IMO, there isn’t much difference on the issues between her and Obama on the issues. \n\nTL:DR Michael Dukakis - Hero of Rural Iowa. Seriously, how did the guy that lost in a landslide do so well in rural Iowa?",

      "text": "Morning everyone!  /u/Dennis_Langley  and I wanted to make the community aware of some changes that are coming to r/Ask_Politics.  I'll spare any other flowery introduction and just get to business.\n\nAs you might guess, we have a *bunch* of submissions here, especially given our size.  Unfortuantely, I'd say a good percentage of them break our rules.  We've used the automoderator to be able to automatically remove many, there are still some that either automoderator can't do (ecause its not something we can codify into a rule for the bot either because we don't know the knowledge to do so or its one of those fuzzy logic things that is hard to explain).\n\nGiven the election coming up, submissions here have increased and, with it, the number of submissions that break the rules have grown as a proportion of the total.  Given Dennis and I have jobs and sleep on occasion, we often get over here and find fires starting to burn and 128 comments on a thread that should have been reported dozens of times.\n\nSo, starting today (9/23) and going through the end of this month (9/30) **we are turning on the requirement that all submissions must be approved before they are posted for the general public to begin commenting on**.\n\nYes, this is going to cause a slowdown on questions here but we feel that it is going to be a better value to the community than our current process.  And yes, we understand that makes our jobs a bit more difficult.\n\nSo to that end, we're moving ahead and conducting final interviews with three members of the community that threw their hat in the ring to become ~~objects of hate~~ moderators.  My goal is to have someone selected soon and hopefully up and running before the end of the month.\n\nMore changes might still be coming as we try to cope with the crunch of activity here (oh, for the slow days before election years...) but these two are clearing going to be large changes.\n\nWe thank you for joining us here and I hope that these changes make the community a little bit better.\n\nEdit: And if you want a good idea of the type of crap we end up wading through, I give you [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/iyazbt/are_the_mods_of_askpolitics_biased_in_any_way/).  Obviously didn't read the announcement and rather than actually waiting for a mod to reply to modmail.\n\nEdit 2:  We've now added a new, automated welcome message for new subscribers!  Maybe I ought to go spend more time at the new site since it does impact users of the old...\n\nEdit 3:  Let's be clear.  If you don't like the rule or the moderation here, you have one of three choices:\n\n* Unsubscribe and leave our community\n* Ask the moderation team to ban you\n* Suck it up and be part of the community.\n\nWe moderate heavily here.  Many generations of moderators have lead to the rules we have now.  Many attempts at \"loosening\" the rules have lead to the rules we have now.  The rules aren't changing.  We're all adults here.",

      "text": "**DISCLAIMER - If you wish to comment about this or wish to criticise against my thread, then please do so with respect. There are already enough people who point fingers at people who are known to be PC without giving a detailed reason why they think that way. Be respectful and don't be an assh*le** \n\n**EDIT - [This video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFndzvZ0TVM) tries to bring an overview of what political correctness is and it also shows that the term political correctness is really complicated and there is no clearly established definition of political correctness and more often used as a weapon**\n  \n\nSo I am going to be focusing on the two extremes here without going into too much in-depth with the political complications involved between the two - the side where political correctness is enforced and also attributed to the alt-left of the political spectrum, and those who oppose or hate anything involving political correctness who are sometimes regarded as the alt-right *(sometimes called that way by those who are regarded as a part of the alt-left as a form of projection for trying to criticise their agenda)* \n\n  \n\nIn the beginning, I was given the assumption that political correctness was originally intended to promote self-awareness, respect to others and especially to those who are in the minority such as calling someone \"retarded\" may be offensive or very personal for someone who have intellectual disability  \n\n  \n\n*(was originally called \"mental retardation\" but was later replaced because of certain labels as supported by the labelling theory, allow certain people's behaviours to behave towards a self-fulfilling prophecy which in turn brought more hardships such as depression and so on)* \n\n  \n\nIt was something that I understood as some minority groups and the labels or statements that other people give that are related to that group *(like the words \"moron\" or \"retarded\" for intellectually disabled people, or \"weird\" and \"strange\" or \"socially awkward\" for autistic people, or \"religious nuthead\" for devoted religious people, or calling an unmotivated or unhappy person as a \"wimp\" or a \"weakling\", and so on)* are often taken for granted without realising that certain statements can be insidiously powerful and damaging even though they can be subtle or minor  \n\n  \n\nI originally became more aware about my actions, thoughts and even statements as I was not aware that while some statements may seem to be harmless, they may not be the case for other group in other social groups and this mostly helped me a lot in my psychology studies considering [that micro-aggressions may have a long-lasting impact for some people](https://www.npr.org/sections/codeswitch/2018/02/17/586181350/strong-black-woman-smart-asian-man-the-downside-to-positive-stereotypes) \n\n  \n\n*(which in turn may have effect on how you view certain client or certain people have a certain social group or may even have an effect on how treatment works or how people will react or behave towards certain people)* \n\n  \n\n  \n\nI felt that it was not as harmful as the other people would assume as being PC was regarded as being weak or a wimp when I should have been more bold *(imagines that being more empathetic or caring was the image of an omega or beta group member where the alphas are more aggressive or bold or masculine which surprisingly, studies say that those who are deemed the alphas are more of the opposite)* \n\n  \n\nBut as time went on, though my intentions were to avoid unconsciously harming others based on my actions or statements, I became more aware that my actions were more harmful than I realised  \n\n  \n\nFor starters, I was exposed to [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-4R0bWC41g4) and also [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9_cAtfyhec) about how the people who push the political correctness agenda are pushing the agenda to the point of intolerance, extremism and naive ideologies turned delusional mentalities and the ideas of [\"safe spaces\" ](https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/safe-spaces-college-intolerant_us_58d957a6e4b02a2eaab66ccf) even though the [\"safe space\" phenomenon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safe-space) was as the name goes – a safe environment where people from minority groups are safe from hate speech and so on. \n\n  \n\nI originally thought that the video was exaggarated and was meant to be an attack towards those who are deemed as PC as change may be hard for some people even though the post-modern era has brought a rise of tolerance towards other types of people from different cultures, mentalities and so on \n\n  \n\nBut I later learned more that some of these PC agendas can be taken out of control, even though I never realized that even sometimes my own thoughts and opinions were somehow a bit flawed such as when someone made a comment about Islam in a negative manner, my first thought that there were Islamophobic, or when someone called anyone who has a mental illness is \"crazy\", my first response is that they were being arrogant since my psychology studies tell me that the mentally ill were not as stereotypical as they are portrayed as popular media even though I later learned that some people are mentally ill but sometimes excuse that to behave as an arrogant person, or some people have mental disorders and are also a bit arrogant or egocentric *(whether their mental disorders interferes with their personality or not, that is another story)* \n\n  \n\nFor starters, I learned that the [colour-blind approach](https://www.huffingtonpost.com/dani-bostick/how-colorblindness-is-act_b_10886176.html) may be more harmful than I originally thought as it may make you blind towards the microaggressions that certain people may face and have a large effect on how they think about others or about themselves. \n\n  \n\nThere is also the issue of freedom of speech too as [a certain psychologist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FtgKRpjVXSg&t=489s) mentioned in a new bill in Canada about pronunciation of the proper pronouns towards gender-fluid people may be abused if someone mentions the wrong pronoun and is later immediately seen as an insult or a transphobic comment as the bill states that this is enforced, not encouraged. \n\n  \n\n*(and of course, in his debate in the University of Toronto, some people REALLY did not agree with him)* \n\n \n\nEven certain statements that are enforced or encouraged today have a shady line like you need to be a bit sensitive like for example causing someone who is autistic as \"someone with autism\" or \"someone diagnosed with autism\" as the term can put heavy baggage on the person and label them as such based on the [social labelling theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labeling_theory) \n\n \n\n*(which I do understand and encourage to some degree because I come from a psychology degree background so you have to be empathetic and sensitive)* \n\n \n\nBut there is also another side of this shady line where limiting certain terms or pronunciations or labels can put certain people into a constant state of denial to the extreme.  \n\n \n\nI can possibly understand this because I experienced this kind of behaviour in my life regarding my depression where all my days were full of sadness and grief and many other of negative emotions and feelings so anyone even mentioning it, I did not want to talk about it because it felt that it provoked me into thinking that I was much worse than I already think that I was *(think of it like denial where you want to think that everything is ok but you cannot but you would rather live in that damaging and delusional environment because you cannot take all the pain)* \n\n \n\n*(imagine that you are already self-critical about yourself but cannot bear the pain of that kind of self-abuse and anything else that may hurt you or attack you, you deny it completely  \n\n \n\nThis constant state of denial will make every person [less resilient](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychological_resilience) when facing adversities of any kind in life meaning that any kind of adaptability or change is less likely to happen and the well-being of that person will continously hinder and will continue to use [denial as their defense mechanism from anything that may hurt them](https://www.simplypsychology.org/defense-mechanisms.html#rep) project anything that they see as threatening, whether the external factor was a geniune comment or not, sometimes even [enforcing violence or intolerance towards anything that they do not personally like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?annotation_id=annotation_2623304739&feature=iv&src_vid=FtgKRpjVXSg&v=iAr6LYC-xpE) *(sometimes this can also be a bit manipulative too as they may enforce others to see things however THEY see fit)* \n\n \n\nAnd of course, there is the other side of this too … The kind of people who would rather do whatever they desire, regardless of who is involved and regardless of what the actions are like for example, someone who really wants to offend someone just because they can like fat-shaming since overweight people can be sensitive about their weight and physical appearance because of the taboo and social discrimination that they face because of their physical appearance. \n\n \n\nI am not encouraging any kind of intolerance or violence or any kind of destructive behaviour that is meant to dehumanise or demonise these people who enforce politically correct ideologies. But I do however realise now that I do believe that certain ideologies of the politically correct ideology is becoming more and more damaging than we think. \n\n \n\nThere are some things out there that we can change like many societies today are not as segragated between the blacks and the whites. However, certain behaviours that involve segretation or certain microaggressions still exist to some degree. It is good to make people a bit more self-conscious about their behaviours towards people of any kind, whether they are a part of a minority group or not because those who are not in the minority experience taboo or stigma of some kind such as males are often [pressured to have this masculine image](https://goodmenproject.com/featured-content/men-and-the-stigma-of-mental-illness-dg/) \n\n \n\nBut I cannot condone behaviours where people **enforce** others to behave the way they desire, whether it involves some kind of violence or conflict or it involves any kind of legal action too like in the Canada bill that I mentioned earlier.",

      "text": "Hello all, since I am an undergraduate Economics student, I have realized the importance politics play in the economy and the progression of a country. I personally believe that I am open to beliefs of all political parties, but I am not sure how to find quality information about what is going on in politics. I am going to vote in this upcoming presidential election for the first time, and aim to start voting in smaller and more local elections. However, I do not know what political party I should register in. \n\nIf you all can help become more educated I would greatly appreciate it. I am generally looking for threads to follow, news websites to subscribe too ( or to stay away from ) and just general ways to keep myself informed so I can make my own unbiased opinions.\n\nThank you all in advance.",

There are people on the left don't like Biden but will always vote against Trump and there are people on the right that don't like Biden so they vote Trump. So why is both side sticking with two polarizing candidates when choosing anyone that is slightly more moderate should result in an easy victory? For example, if Republican just choose a candidate that Democrats won't vehemently vote against, then they should swing enough votes to win the presidency. Same goes for the Democrats side because they are people on the right that is tired of Trump but really dislike Biden and will most likely not vote for Trump if someone else is the candidate. There is also the 3rd party voters too that will probably pick a new less polarizing candidate if there is one. Isn't the whole point and goal is for the party to win the presidency? Why aren't they choosing this strategy?",

      "text": "Several important political movements in the late 20th century produced figureheads which were inseparable from the movements themselves, at least so it seems from the point of view of this 29 year old who wasn't there to see it and can only go from historical accounts. There's Nelson Mandela (anti-apartheid movement), Fidel Castro and Che Guevara (Cuban revolution), Yasser Arafat (PLO), Martin Luther King Jr (American civil rights), the Dalai Lama (Tibetan independence). These are just some examples. To be clear, I don't wish to comment on whether these leaders were noble or admirable, merely that they had remarkable prominence and the movements they led were inextricably associated with their personas.\n\nI can't think of any contemporary figure that has a similar status. From what I see, protesters no longer wave signs with movement leaders' faces printed on them, instead resorting exclusively to slogans or symbols. The people mentioned above often managed to get embedded in culture, having songs written about them and appearing on T-shirts. These signs of admiration are also rarely seen today. You'd think people like Boris Nemtsov, Edward Snowden or Peter Tatchell might get this kind of attention, but the buzz they create is nowhere near the same. Heck, when Al-Baghdadi was killed, most people I knew had to google his name to find out who he was, even though he led this decade's most successful terrorist movement. Funnily enough, the only people I can think of who might fit the bill are Bin Laden and Trump (and perhaps to some extent Berlusconi? Duterte? Netanyahu?).\n\nWhat happened to the modern political hero? Is it that the population no longer sympathizes with subversive figures, which is usually how these people gain fame? Is a lack of reverence for leaders a sign of sophistication and advancement among the populations, and therefore this is a good thing? Was there some element present during the 20th century that brought forward all these charismatic individuals, which is no longer around? Or am I completely wrong and these figures do exist today, and I just haven't heard of them?\n\nThanks in advance for any answers :)\n\nNote: I realize that people such as George Floyd, Beronna Taylor and Tamir Rice are frequently cited in Black Lives Matter protests, but they serve as symbols, not as leaders, so this isn't the same kind of hero. In general, I think it's very telling that movements such as BLM or Antifa still don't have any unified leadership after several years of them existing.",

It's a coalition of loosely  conservative political parties that has formed Putin's official party(although on paper his association with its formation is loose). So I'm wondering without the strong leadership Putin provides this party(studies have shown more people support Putin than the party itself) that the country could open up politically to other parties?

      "text": "Anti-police sentiment has grown in the US. Usually, this takes the form of simply protesting abuse of police power, calling to partially defund police/redirect funds elsewhere, create additional oversight, etc. But there are plenty of not-that-small leftist movements that seem to characterize their opposition to law enforcement much more overtly: phrases like ACAB (all cops are bastards), MDC (millions of dead cops), \"No such thing as a good cop,\" etc. It comes across to me that their ideal government would have no law enforcement at all.\n\nI assume that a lot of this rhetoric is thrown around in order to make a point. But I don't want to dismiss the idea too easily if there's something I haven't considered. So my most basic question here is: **Can you advocate for the abolition of all law enforcement without being an anarchist?** Or at least, can you do it rationally and consistently? And if so, how does it work?\n\nI know in the US, there has been talk of replacing traditional police departments, at least in part, with social workers, community watch, etc. Is anyone advocating for a complete transition away from police? And if so, would it still count as abolishing law enforcement? If someone in a community has the power to stop others from breaking the law, isn't that still law enforcement? If no one has that power, then how can any government function at all?\n\nOr is it really just rhetoric to voice how little trust they currently have in that particular institution, as it exists today? Is no one *actually* advocating for the nation to cease all law enforcement indefinitely?\n\nI hope this doesn't come across as closed-minded or biased. I certainly have my opinions, but I'm completely sincere in asking this question. Thanks!",

The communist ideal is exactly that. \n\nNow on the political quadrants it would seem that the 'main' parties are right and middle right. Any ideals that even consider moving slightly back towards central are quickly shouted down and called Marxist. \n\nSo looking at Corbyn and Sanders now, they are both a lot more central. But demonised by the hyperbole of Marx etc... I'm a teacher in the UK and my desires to have some autonomy/fair working conditions etc are frequently shouted down as being 'Old red guard' and Marxist. \n\nPinning my colours to the mast,  i am more central/left. But i am realistic with it. (for example with the Green party in the UK... Lots of wonderful ideas.. Would many of them realistically work...  Probably not) so constantly being bombarded with the idea that you have any left-givings makes you a communist is wearing very thin. \n\nNot trying to change any minds or get up on any soapboxes here..

It's not something I could easily prove or quantify, and for the most part it's anecdotal (e.g. whenever I see a user on Twitter or Youtube with the political compass as a profile picture, more often then not the person is classified in the lower-right quadrant). \n\nThrough a quick search, it seems that this accusation of right-Libertarian bias has been said of [Eysenck's diagram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_spectrum#Relationship_between_Eysenck's_political_views_and_political_research), of [the Nolan chart](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nolan_Chart#Criticism), and [of the Political Compass Test](https://www.reddit.com/r/Ask_Politics/comments/1wrg02/what_is_the_consensus_on_the_political_compass/). \n\nWhat do you think explains this Libertarian affection for \"quantitative\" measurement and classification of political ideologies? Does it boil down to [what this user wrote (below)](https://www.reddit.com/r/badpolitics/comments/2uomoe/why_is_the_political_compass_bad/cob0zjg/) or is there more to it?\n\n>Basically, people are struggling to find identity and appropriated a legitimate political science tool that was designed for a different purpose to do so. The minority groups, like libertarians, figured out that the linear model doesn't help them construct a separate identity from the greater party coalitions and changed it to better support their ideological narrative.\n\nFeel free to tell me if this question would be better suited to /r/AskSocialScience or /r/AskPsychology.\n\nThanks for the replies!",

He has gone as far as compared Obama to Hitler a few times. Ever since then I haven't really listened to his lectures as closely because that seems very extremist to me. \n\nI have recorded almost all of his lectures and I'd me more than willing to post them onto this thread so you all can see this. As a freshman in college though my political knowledge has been from my far right wing dad and my far left wing aunt. I feel like I have a good understanding of both sides of the story from all of this and this is also why I'm fairly un-sure about the legitimacy of my professors speaking.\n\nIn summary: My political science professor seems to be a little biased on his political views and his teachings. I would like to know if he really is from people that seem to know more about politics than me. I would like responses that are not biased and are fairly reputable. I will post his lectures into the comments. First they will be not cropped, then I will edit them as I get time.\n\nThanks guys!",

      "title": "How can we fix American politics? What do you think about Delegative Democracy? What do you think about my idea?",
      "text": "So I've been thinking about creating something lately. Call me naive or whatnot. \n\nI think American democracy needs radical reform. And I think the way to accomplish reform is to create our own alternative government. This alternative government will first act as a nonprofit lobbying interest group, funneling money to preferred local candidates. Then the alternative government will slowly \"take over\" local governments, state governments, and finally the whole shebang. \n\nSo what's so great about the \"alternative government\"? It's sole purpose will be the eventual realization of [*delegative democracy*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delegative_democracy), or another purer, more robust form of government than our first-past-the-post voting system, which in my opinion is unstable and does a terrible job representing the will of the people. \n\nIMO delegative democracy is the most impressive form I've read about. In the reality of day to day life, it's impossible for anybody to actively manage legislatures, judges, and bureaucrats. The vast majority of Americans do not have the time or desire to research dozens of political candidates to elect to dozens of political offices. As a result, our Democratic process is complete bullshit. Our government is out of control of the people, because the people do not know what is happening on the local, state, and federal level. \n\nIn other words, Democracy needs to be simplified. People have enough trouble choosing a single candidate. Well, why don't we just let them do just that? Just pick one person, anybody you want, to be your representative, your delegate. It could be your mom, or your boss, or a celebrity, or somebody in your social circle. It could be yourself. It could be someone you trust to make wise decisions on your behalf. Then your delegate could take on the responsibilities of politics, or he could then pass his and your choice along to somebody else. Hell, with the advent of computers and machine vision, we could even start *splitting* votes. Can't choose between two great candidates? Elect both of them. Don't want to give up all of your legislative voting power? Then split your choice. \"The average voter is stupid\". Well, is the average politician any smarter than the voter? \n\nSo how can we realize this? I believe we must create an \"Alternative Government\" that fakes it until it makes it. \nThe alternative government will begin as a lobbying interest group composed of any US citizen who wants to join. Dues would be first collected on a voluntary basis and would be used to target local governments and \"convert\" them to a delegative democracy or alternative system. Meanwhile, money will also be pumped into political candidates in proportion to the alternative government's voter choices. Lobbyists would be hired as the first proto-delegates. So the purpose of the interest group would be first to advocate for democracy, and then attempt to force the actual government to vote according to Democracy's desires. \n\nIn the ideal, delegative democracy would be able to minimize the degrees of separation between the American people and their legislative representatives. I believe that Democracy has made good choices. I believe that if Democracy was working, we would have never had to choose between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump. \n\n\nTLDR: I have a crazy idea. Do you think it could work?",

I was focused on being an unaware college student... honestly, I was the definition of \"happy and stupid.\" I thought that because I was a white female living in middle class Los Angeles, CA that nothing going on in the rest of the world would ever have change anything in my life, so why worry about it....\n\n\nAs soon as I entered the real world I realized I was horribly wrong. In a matter of months I have developed a want for the important information I have been missing. But there is SO much of it.. I don't know where to start! Climate change? Gay marriage is STILL not legal in every state? Ferguson? We are the 99%? The war? All I know about George W is that he was hilariously stupid sometimes, and I voted for Obama because Sarah Palin seemed crazy and he sounded like he knew what he was doing. I voted for bills and props that I knew nothing about except for what I saw on billboards and bumper stickers around town.\n\n\nI have followed the basics that everyone hears about (presidential elections, huge catastrophes, Arnold Schwarzenegger and Emma Watson are in politics somehow now), but I don't know the details about anything. I have been living in a bubble, and I am willing to read as many books as I can find about what is going on right now and the events that have happened to lead up to all of this.\n\n\nPlease, judge me. I can't believe I have been so blind to the problems in this world, and I want to do everything I can to have a voice and try to make a difference. But first, I need to be educated. Books, websites, news broadcasts and YouTube videos. Anything helps on my quest for information!\n\nEDIT: WOW! Thank you all so much! I have a lot of reading to do, but I am excited to get started!",

Local average people won't say \"oh wow, new roads, ok I'll vote for this guy.\" They're much more concerned about current hot topic issues like criminal justice, jobs, cultural hot button issues, healthcare, etc.\n\nAnyone care to educate how infrastructure spending actually gets politicians votes?

It got me thinking about the big ISP lobbyists at Verizon and Comcast who have been \"lobbying\" for this massive restrictive change to the internet in the US.\n\n**How do we draw the line between lobbying and bribery?**\n\n\nThis [investopedia](http://www.investopedia.com/financial-edge/0912/the-differences-between-bribery-and-lobbying.aspx) article defines the terms as follows:\n\n\n**Lobbying**\n>   A lobbyist tries to influence political opinion to his or her benefit. Lobbyists traditionally were considered \"information givers,\" usually in support of their cause to swing legislation and government agencies in their favor.\n\n\n\n**Bribery**\n> ...a bribe occurs on an individual level...This results in an unfair advantage for the bribe giver. Over time, the system erodes the economic foundation of the country, hurting the most vulnerable members of the society and filling the middle class with a sense of hopelessness and cynicism.\n\n**If you swapped those definitions around and removed the words \"bribe\" and \"lobbyist\" I would find it very hard to tell the difference**\n\n\n* So what is the difference? Nowadays it seems as if every big corporation in America is \"lobbying\" for their own interests - at the expense of the consumer (a.k.a) the lower and middle class\n* Can Lobbyists at Comcast and Verizon really be considered \"information givers\" when they are literally supplying **[Disinformation](https://www.theverge.com/2017/5/2/15520818/verizon-net-neutrality-craig-silliman-truth)** ?\n\n\n**Bonus Question**\nWhat makes EU lobbying legislation different? Why are we not seeing similar attacks on internet freedom in Europe? (Trump aside)",

Would such a move benefit President Trump and the Republican Party politically? While it would be unprecedented, it would prevent a trial in the Senate, in which President Trump's prior conduct would be presented nationally in unfiltered form. Or would a Senate trial be preferable, as Trump's attorneys could mount a formal defence and the Democrats would need 20 Republicans to vote to impeach in order to secure impeachment. An acquittal in the Senate could be spun as an exoneration.",

If the President has any executive power, couldn't he impact what gets paid for?\n\nCouldn't the President, as the chief executive, direct his employees to selectively shut down industry in Republican-run states in order to shift the game theory calculations and encourage Republicans to start funding the government? For example, if the government runs out of money, why couldn't the President selectively shut down, just in red states, things like the BLM, BOEM, BSEE, EPA, OSHA etc, and then direct federal law enforcement to close all related industry in those states since the government isn't able to fund safety or regulatory oversight? While keeping those agencies working in blue states?\n\nObviously its a fine line to abuse of power but it seems like there's a legal abuse of power either way, it's just that Republicans have entrenched an abuse of power in their favor into the status quo.",

      "text": "I would argue that it is far more dangerous for a political party to control such a large percentage of government than it is for a corporation to control a large percentage of any given market. Perhaps it is because the government in question is the one who would regulate such matters.\n\nEdit: 06/07/13 (GMT+09:30) Adelaide.\n\nHere's what I have deigned from this discussion. \"Liberty too must be limited in order to be possessed\" - Edmund Burke, I never quite understood that until now. The nature of a majority rules party will always force several things to happen, any party will always try to sway public opinion in whatever manner possible. Secondly (I don't like it but it works in a way) democratic rights are limited in the United States particularly so the peoples vote has less power, this is because the people are too easily swayed by too many factors to be relied upon to elect an effective ruling party. PoliSciUgGuy explains the premise better and has provided a link http://www.volokh.com/2013/07/05/restricting-democracy-in-order-to-protect-other-liberal-values/. Thirdly the fact that the people's power is limited leaves government more susceptible to other forms of manipulation the most evident being big business, however this is preferable to many other possible influencing factors because this particular influence relies largely upon the approval of the product and in a less direct way is also subject to public opinion. This seems to create a triumvirate where the people have as much power as anywhere else but are often unaware, I think perhaps the only thing required to make the system more viable is to make them more aware of exactly what factors influence their government and then they can also willfully regulate them. This will also obviously have flaws but I'd like to see you better without starting some kind of bloody revolution.",

(I won't bother going into the Republican facepalms, mostly because I think my forehead as red the entirety of the 2012 campaign.)\n\nIts not that I entirely disagree with both of those statements, I think there is validity to them, but its what usually follows after they make those claims, usually \"right now\".  Doing anything in a swift motion usually ends poorly, especially when politics right now.  For me, a cautious, graduated approach is better.  First audit the Fed (at least we're hearing that) and then see what we can do.

Despite all of the protests in 2020 and in years prior, the numbers are unchanged from 2015 levels [https://www.pennmedicine.org/news/news-releases/2020/october/fatal-police-shootings-among-black-americans-remain-high-unchanged-since-2015](https://www.pennmedicine.org/news/news-releases/2020/october/fatal-police-shootings-among-black-americans-remain-high-unchanged-since-2015).\n* The white-black ecomonic/wealth divide is as big today as it was in the 1960s [https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/25/opinion/sunday/race-wage-gap.html](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/25/opinion/sunday/race-wage-gap.html)\n* The average black family's net worth has been falling rather than rising in recent years, with it standing at just $17,600 at the start of the pandemic and expected to fall to closer to $10,000 now. For comparison, the average white family's net worth was $171,000 at the start of the pandemic and is expected to RISE to closer to $185,000 going forward.\n* Black people have been disproportionately affected by COVID-19, with them being 13.4% of the US population yet accounting for 18.7% of casualties from the virus [https://www.statista.com/statistics/1122369/covid-deaths-distribution-by-race-us/](https://www.statista.com/statistics/1122369/covid-deaths-distribution-by-race-us/). This means that more than 53,360 black people have died from Covid which equates to around 1 out of every 768 black americans overall. It is by far the worst ratio out of any major ethnic group.\n* 50% of black-owned small businesses have permanently shut down throughout the pandemic [https://www.forbes.com/sites/pedrodacosta/2020/08/10/the-covid-19-crisis-has-wiped-out-nearly-half-of-black-small-businesses/?sh=6ff224664310](https://www.forbes.com/sites/pedrodacosta/2020/08/10/the-covid-19-crisis-has-wiped-out-nearly-half-of-black-small-businesses/?sh=6ff224664310).",

Maybe it always has been, but it just seems to me that nowadays if you want to succeed in politics you need to be all the way Right or all the way Left. Am I wrong?\n\n\nIt just worries me that we will keep trending this way, and the farther away from the middle our political climate gets the less gets done. It's like people can't say anything the other side has done has any value, because if they did that they might not be a \"real\" Democrat or Republican.\n\n\nAm I seeing this wrong? Is this a fairly new development or has our political climate always been like this? When did it start? Can we ever go back?",

So when someone or some group tries to tells us what to do, them's fightin' words.\n\nBut look at the wealthiest and most powerful people and their companies. They can and do hire the best Mad Ave marketing experts to convince people about politics the way they convince people to buy all sorts of things they don't need or should avoid, and that results in political decisions strongly favoring the things the wealthy and powerful prefer. The media is owned by these people. They decide whether their workplaces will be Chinese sweatshops or Scandanavian 4 day workweeks with 6 wks vacay. No surprise the Epsteins and Weinsteins are fabulously wealthy and powerful, and some celebrities say we don't know the half of it, although the wealthy and powerful involved in sex cults is a thing now. Why do we get angry about people with large control over others in govt, but when it comes to similar control outside of govt, we forget all about the control and corruption problem our founders repeatedly warned us about?",

      "text": "Are there any authors or works that explore a defense of a more conservative liberalism that does not rely on natural rights (as Locke did) or advance an abstract societal blueprint (as Rawls did), such as the utilitarian approach of J. S. Mill (non-natural rights derived from the harm/utility principles and institutions/policies sensitive to concrete circumstances), while at the same time explicitly stressing a precautionary skepticism regarding the use of abstract reasoning or rationalism in politics to avoid the dangerous radicalisms that such systems promote if not applied conservatively (as seen in Burke's brand of traditionalism)?\n\nWhile it doesn't need to be specifically a utilitarian approach, that seems to be the most common alternative to a defense of liberalism. Coleridge's romanticism influenced Mill's utilitarian liberalism to theoretically be more historically sensitive than Bentham's, but in practice he continued to advocate for similarly profound and radical institutional changes. Sidgwick seems to be the only major utilitarian in the conservative tradition, but I can't find much on his political views aside from economics, not to mention contradicting sources pointing towards him not being so conservative after all.\n\nLiberalism is the dominant political philosophy in the western world, but there seems to be a surprising lack of diversity of non-natural rights-based approaches, in particular a branch of such a liberalism that avoids radical institutional changes in favor of more gradual reform, as I expected utilitarian empiricists (also associated with skepticism) to gravitate towards.\n\nIf this is an unreasonably specific request, I would appreciate recommendations of more material that addresses individual elements of what I have mentioned, even if it doesn't include all of them.\n\nNote: For clarity, I started this search when reading SEP's article on Conservatism, which claimed Sidgwick to use somewhat Millian-Liberal principles to arrive at somewhat Burkean-conservative conclusions (which striked me as a surprisingly harmoneous synthesis, in theory).",

      "text": "When I was about 20 or 21, Dank Meme Vine compilations were a huge phenomenon on YouTube, and many of said compilations seemed to have strong populist right messaging, often featuring overtly Pro-Trump/Anti-Hillary memes, anti-feminist memes, anti-LGBT memes/jokes about how many genders there are, etc. Granted, these were interspersed with bog-standard absurdist or edgy memes, but the editorial slant of these compilations was pretty clear.\n\nHaving heard all the recent discourse about this Jubilee debate between Medhi Hasan and young conservatives (at least one of whom reportedly accepted the label of \"fascist\"), it occurs to me that a lot of the youths in that video are probably young enough to have seen these compilations when their political consciousness was just starting to develop and to have had their outlooks shaped by these memes on some subconscious level. More broadly, Gen Z is noticeably flipping right (as demonstrated during this past election cycle), and internet culture is playing an increasingly bigger role in youth politics, so I wonder if Dank Meme Vines were one of the initial catalysts for this shift, and if so, whether lobbyist/special interest/data mining groups were involved.\n\nAs cursory as my understanding of cyber warfare is, I do know that Cambridge Analytica used Facebook surveys to build psychological profiles of users, disseminate targeted Pro-Trump memes to these users, and covertly influence their voting decisions/political opinions. With that in mind, could a group like Cambridge Analytica or even a foreign political body like the Kremlin have produced Pro-Trump/populist right Dank Memes as a form of astroturfing and subsequently paid compilation producers to curate Dank Meme compilations in a way that favored far-right interests? Given how people like Peter Thiel are now essentially psyopping Zoomers into \"trad\" ideology with faux-grassroots \"new media\" or how Tim Pool (a self-proclaimed \"independent journalist\") was revealed to have taken funding from RT, it wouldn't surprise me if some Machiavellian organization had also used Vine/Dank Memes as a covert influence on youth politics circa 2016.",

      "text": "I’ve been thinking ahead to the 2026 midterms and the final two years of President Trump’s term. What worries me the most is a full-blown debt ceiling standoff, government shutdown, and economic crisis.\n\nHistorically, when we have a divided government, we get the usual brinkmanship. Lawmakers hold the economy hostage for political points, and then — at the last possible second — they raise the ceiling like they were always going to. The system barely holds together.\n\nBut Trump doesn’t play by those rules. He doesn’t answer to Congress. He doesn’t respond to public pressure. If he wanted to tank the economy and blame Democrats for it, he could simply let the country default — and he might.\n\nSo I started thinking: What if we didn’t have to wait for Washington to do its job?\n\nAbout 26 states allow citizen-initiated ballot measures. The idea is to coordinate across those states to introduce ballot initiatives to form and join a 14th Amendment Fiscal Responsibility Interstate Compact.\n\nIf the federal government defaults on its debt, all member states would trigger an emergency statewide split-rate tax to pay federal obligations from within the state until the crisis is resolved.\n\nIn plain terms: if the federal government won’t do its damn job, then we will do it for them.\n\nThe compact is named in the spirit of Section 4 of the 14th Amendment, which states that the validity of the public debt “shall not be questioned.”\n\nWe could start with Florida and encourage other states to follow.\n\nI don’t care who takes the blame for a future default. I just don’t trust the current government enough to feel confident that they won’t destroy the economy on purpose. Again.\n\nCurious what others here think. Not sure what the implications are regarding a confederalist safety net like this or the feasibility or deadlines of getting something like this onto the ballot in time for the midterms",

Also is it even worth it to do it, if you're sure b/c of party affiliation how the person will vote and you are a member of another party, but you're still a constituent.",

How they all have titles such as ‘the honourable’, the amount of music and ceremony surrounding was is essentially the swearing of an oath of office (the only stipulation in the constitution).

Donald Trump did not sign the Presidential Transition Act by October 1st which is the last day in the Statute of Limitations for the Memorandum of Understanding for this election cycle\n2. There are no provisions in the PTA that has exemptions or processes that allow for late signing or appeals.\n3. The PTA mandates a smooth transfer of power by creating a framework where an incoming and out going administrations can pass critical information to each other. \n4.

Read it here https://www.congress.gov/116/plaws/publ121/PLAW-116publ121.pdf\n\n\nDonald Trump did not receive daily up to date briefings on current events and issues regarding the nations security and operations until November 27th. 58 days after the statute of limitations ran out. \n\nhttps://www.cnn.com/2024/11/26/politics/trump-team-signs-transition-agreement/index.html\n\nDonald Trump team did not sign the Justice Department MOU until December 3rd. \n\nhttps://www.cnn.com/2024/12/03/politics/trump-transition-justice-department-agreement/index.html\n\n\nBecause Donald Trump did not fulfill a posted essential requirement that must be completed to fully qualify for the Office of the President. Do you think this is grounds for disqualification?\n\nhttps://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/the-size-of-donald-trumps-2024-election-victory-explained-in-5-charts\n\nDo you think Congress should disqualify Trump for the reasons listed?\n\nBy my count it’s 60 or 70 representatives away.",

I also learned that the \"New Deal Coalition\" was made up of a huge tent approach. Is it possible for Democrats today to recreate that type of success, especially with their current leadership and increasing partisanship, and with what demographics/voting blocs? Thanks for your time, any replies appreciated",

HTS has gained significant ground and influence, yet it appears that some international voices seem supportive or at least less critical of their advancements.\n\nGiven their background as a terrorist organization, why would there be this shift in attitude? Are there geopolitical reasons behind this seeming support, or is it more about a lesser evil mindset compared to the Assad regime? What are the implications for Syria’s future and regional stability if HTS consolidates power?\n\nI’d appreciate any insights or perspectives on this complex issue. Thanks!",

Their legislature was able to override the president’s order, but it was a scary few hours since the military was ordered to block access to the National Assembly building. \n\nHere’s the official martial law declaration the Korean president made: \nhttps://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/full-text-south-koreas-martial-law-decree-2024-12-03/\n\nSo my question is could a US president attempt to do something similar with a martial law order? That is declare martial law, use the national guard/military to block access to the Capitol, and issue arrest warrants for political opposition? What guardrails are there to stop such a rogue president? There’s the Supreme Court, but would a rogue President really listen to the court at that point? Can Congress override a martial law order? Could Congress convene outside the Capitol if they had to? How fast could impeachment and removal occur if it was an emergency? \n\nSorry if that seems like a lot of questions, but the recent events in Korea had me thinking about this.",

I have a few points I'm planning to argue already, but I was curious about something. Would the plans of Donald Trump (and by extension, the GOP as a whole) to restrict the voices and potential healthcare/support related rights of queer Americans be *literally* unconstitutional? Or are they likely to use legal loopholes/federal rulings to make it technically legal? For example, if he plans to rescind Federal policies about discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity, would that not violate the 14th Amendment? Thank you in advance.\n\nThis isn't bait and I'm not trying to start a flame war. I'm just trying to write an essay and I'm lazy.",

I'm not American, don't follow its politics too closely so I'm asking so more aware people what they think is likely. \n\nTo my understanding, he's proposing a tariff of 10% on all foreign imports with the exception of China, which will be getting a 60% tariff. Mainly concerned about the tariffs on China, I reckon, but not overly thrilled about the 10% for everyone else.",

I am genuinely confused. Is there something specific in Argentina as far as imports or exports supporting this and making it seem like it is working? Are we months away from some sort of crash? It seems to defy everything I thought I understood about the economy. When austerity was tried here it was criticized from beginning to end and seemed to have the opposite effect, making the economy worse. \n\nAgain, no fight, I am curious if any economy buffs might be able to shed light on this.

I tried to be more circumspect in my original post but got rejected for not being in the form of a question.\n\nWith the Manhattan DA agreeing to postpone the sentencing of Trump in the hush money case in New York, I got to wondering about the immunity of the President in general. I did some googling and didn't find an obvious answer, probably because this is unprecedented.\n\nWe are told that, in America, nobody should be above the law, and that would seem to include the President when he is convicted of a felony for actions taken in or out of office (ignoring the recent Supreme Court decision). Why would the courts not sentence a person to prison and issue an arrest warrant if they fail to surrender just because that person holds a political office? I doubt they would hold off on sentencing a sitting member of the House of Representatives or the Senate.\n\nAnd if the President cannot execute his duties due to being imprisoned, wouldn't the 25th Amendment allow the VP, Vance, to assume the office of Acting President until Trump is released?\n\nThis seems like the most straightforward path to following the rules-as-written but it doesn't seem to get discussed and I'm very curious as to why not. Surely it's not the court's responsibility to ensure the ability of one man to take office, regardless of the office, or to ensure that America has a President.\n\nI would appreciate hearing from people who are more deeply steeped in constitutional law on this one.\n\nTIA.",

      "title": "NeutralPolitics Super Tuesday Megathread",
      "text": "Welcome to the biggest night of the primary season: Super Tuesday.  Today, 14 states as well as American Samoa^1 will be voting in primary elections to allocate delegates to the Democratic National Convention.^2\n\n* **How are the delegates are awarded?**\n\n The key number to keep in mind when looking at results is **15%.**  If a candidate is [above 15%](https://www.270towin.com/content/thresholds-for-delegate-allocation-2020-democratic-primary-and-caucus) in a state or congressional district, the candidate gets delegates proportional to their vote.  If you're below 15%, [you get nothing.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5QGkOGZubQ)\n\n States award generally 1/3 of delegates statewide, and the other 2/3 by congressional district, with more delegates allocated to districts [that have voted more democratic in past Presidential elections.](https://www.thegreenpapers.com/P20/D-Alloc.phtml)^3  So if a candidate is just below the 15% bubble statewide, they still might get a few delegates from individual congressional districts where they broke 15%.  \n\n* **How many delegates are at stake tonight?**\n\n [There are 1357 delegates up for grabs,](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/03/02/us/politics/2020-super-tuesday-states.html) out of a total of [3979 total.](https://www.270towin.com/2020-democratic-nomination)  1991 delegates are needed to win the nomination.  \n\n Today is a much bigger delegate haul up for grabs than in [2016](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_Democratic_Party_presidential_primaries#March_1,_2016:_Super_Tuesday) largely because California moved its primary to today.  As both the most populous state and a Democratic stronghold, it has huge delegate numbers, 415, accounting for more than 1/10 of the entire number of delegates available.\n\n* **When will we know results?**\n\n It will vary, with the first polls closing at [7PM ET in Virginia, and the last polls closing at 11PM ET in California.](https://www.vox.com/2020/3/3/21161503/super-tuesday-voting-polls-results-what-time)\n\n However, some results may take quite a while.  California especially is both the biggest haul today, and [famously slow](https://www.npr.org/2020/03/01/809941998/on-super-tuesday-dont-expect-quick-election-results-from-the-west) in counting ballots.  Because California encourages a lot of mail voting, and counts ballots mailed on election day, they won't have all the ballots in today, and will need to process a lot of envelopes.\n\n* **Who is gonna win?**\n\n Who do I look like, Nate Silver?\n\n* **Where can I see results?**\n\n * [Washington Post results page](https://www.washingtonpost.com/elections/election-results/super-tuesday/?itid=hp_hp-bignews4_results-promo-2%3Ahomepage%2Fstory-ans)\n\n * [CNN results page](https://www.cnn.com/election/2020/primaries-and-caucuses)\n\n * [Fox News results page](https://www.foxnews.com/elections/2020/primary-results)\n  \n * [Decision Desk HQ](https://results.decisiondeskhq.com/2020/super_tuesday) (signup required)\n\n * [PBS Newshour election night coverage](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KU5JFZFqR_s)\n\n * The New York Times [has 14 needles.](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/03/03/us/elections/forecast-super-tuesday-primary.html?action=click&module=ELEX_results&pgtype=Interactive&region=Navigation)\n\nI'll add updates as the night goes on, but first I shall engage in my election night tradition: sushi.\n\nBefore results come in, feel free to ask any questions you think I can address above, or answer my question:\n\nBesides voting, what election day traditions or habits do you have?\n\n**7:00PM ET** First polls have closed, and networks are calling Virginia for Biden and Vermont for Sanders at poll closing.\n\n**7:07PM ET** Looks like the VA call is based on Biden doing _very_ well in the exit poll, which [has him around 50% to Bernie's 25%,](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2020-primary-elections/virginia-results?icid=election_nav) with all other candidates apparently below the viability threshold.  If that held (very big if) it would mean about 66 delegates to Biden, 33 to Bernie, 0 to anyone else. \n\n**7:30PM ET** Polls have closed in North Carolina, and networks are calling it for Biden at polls close based on the exit poll.\n\n**7:37PM ET** American Samoa has reported [the results](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2020-primary-elections/american-samoa-results?icid=election_nav) of its caucus, which looks like it will give Mike Bloomberg and Tulsi Gabbard their first delegates of the process.  Looks like it'll be 4 delegates for Bloomberg on 175 votes and, 2 for Gabbard on 103 votes.\n\n**7:58PM ET** Looks like Biden will break the 15% threshold in Vermont, so he will get some delegates there.  In 2016 Sanders managed to keep Clinton below that threshold and got all of Vermont's delegates that year.\n\n**8:00PM ET**  Alabama called for Biden at polls closed, no calls in other states closing at 8pm.\n\n**8:10PM ET** Looks like a genuine three way contest for first in MA based on exit polls among Warren, Sanders, and Biden. \n\n**8:23PM ET** Seeing some results in TX showing a close race, but I think that's early vote, so it might move a lot as we get today's vote in if trends in late deciders from VA/NC/AL hold into TX.\n\n**8:26PM ET** For those who are election turbonerds like me, the DecisionDeskHQ people use some different methods from most of the networks to get results numbers, and are usually a good bit faster at reporting.  So if you're the kinda person who need their results now, it may be worth dealing with their signup.\n\n**8:30PM ET** Arkansas polls closed, no call at polls close.\n\n**8:37PM ET**  Looks like outside of MA, Warren is struggling to hit the 15% threshold in many states, so she'll probably be looking at a quite small delegate haul out of tonight, unless she does surprisingly well in CA.  She might get a few congressional district delegates still in other states, or results may change, but being below 15% statewide is a big loss in delegate terms.\n\nBloomberg is also shy of the mark in a few states so far.  Looks like he'll miss in VA, VT, and MA.  So far looks like he'll make it in states that have closed so far, but if that's early vote reports, he might fall on election day totals.\n\n**8:47PM ET** With about 90% of results in from Virginia, NYT is allocating about 67 delegates to Biden, 31 delegates to Sanders, 1 to Warren.\n\n**9:00PM ET** Texas, Minnesota, and Colorado polls close.  No calls at closing.\n\n**9:03PM ET** Biden is expanding his lead in NC as same day vote comes in, with Bloomberg falling and possibly on track to end up below the threshold.\n\n**9:11PM ET** Looks like networks are calling TN for Biden.  Seems that Biden, Sanders, and Bloomberg will all make the threshold there.\n\n**9:17PM ET** More calls: OK for Biden, CO for Sanders.\n\n**9:31PM ET**  MA is looking likely Biden, Sanders 2nd, Warren actually close to the threshold in her home state.  Fairly disastrous for Warren.\n\n**9:37PM ET** Gonna take a moment to recognize the recently departed-from-the-race Amy Klobuchar for [the best walk on music of the campaign.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhX06ovfnas)\n\n**9:42PM ET**  As I said above, the 15% threshold matters a ton.  Looking at who's currently on track to make/miss it, with the proviso that this could change (and using DDHQ numbers)\n\n* Biden: Gonna make it everywhere\n* Sanders: In some danger of missing it in AL, but safe everywhere else.\n* Bloomberg: Won't make it in VT or VA.  Very likely won't make it in ME, MA, AL or MN. more likely than not to miss it it in OK and TN.  In danger if late returns are bad for him in TN and TX.  Likely safe in AR.  Certain to make it in CO.\n* Warren: Won't make it in most states.  Has a good shot of making it in ME, MN, and CO.  Almost certain to make it in MA.\n\nNone of these include California because polls are still open there.\n\n**9:50PM ET**  NBC News reports that Bloomberg will [\"reassess\"](https://twitter.com/JesseRodriguez/status/1235028685717045248) his campaign tomorrow.\n\n**9:56PM ET** Some, but not all, networks calling AR and MN for Biden.\n\n**10:11PM ET**  Polls closed in Utah at 10PM.  Sanders holds a susbtantial lead there in early returns.\n\n**10:14PM ET**  Update on who's hitting the 15% threshold.  Sanders looks safer to make it in Alabama, meaning he would get at least some delegates everywhere.  Bloomberg has fallen below threshold in Oklahoma and North Carolina, still teetering above it in Tennessee.\n\n**10:31PM ET** DDHQ (but nobody else I can see) is calling MA for Biden.  If that holds, that's an extremely good sign for him.  This is really about as good of a Super Tuesday as Biden could have asked for so far.  Though California is still not even polls closed, and that is the big prize of the night.\n\n**10:35PM ET** Utah has been called for Sanders.\n\n**10:52PM ET** Reports are that in many precincts in California and Texas, long lines are going to delay vote results, and of course those lines reflect a substantial failure of election officials to do their job and operate an efficient election.\n\n**11:00PM ET** Polls are now closed in California, though many voters remain in line.  If you are in line to vote, stay in line and you will be able to vote.\n\n**11:03PM ET** AP is calling California for Sanders at polls close.  I find that a bit surprising, but I assume they have some good reasons for doing so.\n\n**11:04PM ET** Other networks are not calling California.  I am really surprised by the AP call on zero results, especially in a heavily mail-vote state which is infamously slow to count.  I think Sanders is more likely than not to win CA (it's a strong state for him generally, and heavy early vote helps him).  But with the big late movement to Biden I'd want to get some real votes in to make that call.\n\n**11:09PM ET** OK, I assume AP is making the call based on the exit poll, which as of 6:30PM ET had [Bernie around 38 and Biden around 23.](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2020-primary-elections/california-results?icid=election_nav)  That's aggressive, but if it represents same day voters even close to accurately, I can see being comfortable with the call.  But I'd still hold off on a call.\n\n**11:19PM ET** Gonna make a threshold chart to show where candidates are making/missing it.  \n\nLegend:  Bold is made the threshold.  Italic is missed the threshold.  Standard is uncertain.\n\n* Biden: **ME, VT, MA, VA, NC, TN, AL, AR, OK, TX, CO, UT, MN, CA**\n\n* Sanders: **ME, VT, MA, VA, NC, TN,** AL, **AR, OK, TX, CO, UT, MN, CA**\n\n* Bloomberg: *ME, VT, MA, VA, NC,* **TN,** *AL,* AR, *OK,* TX, **CO, UT,** *MN,* CA\n\n* Warren: ME, *VT,* **MA,** *VA, NC, TN, AL, AR, OK, TX,* **CO, UT,** MN, *CA*\n\n**11:32PM ET** It looks like Texas will be very close between Biden and Sanders.  Given proportional allocation, it actually doesn't matter that much who ekes out a win if they're within a point of each other, though it may matter for narrative.  Much bigger is the question of whether Mike Bloomberg holds on to enough vote to crack 15% and swipe a share of delegates.  Currently he is at 18.19% which might hold him through what's been a consistent drop in day-of results for him today, but maybe not.  With it now looking like Biden would have the only path to the nomination with a majority of pledged delegates, whether Bloomberg hits the threshold in Texas could actually make a big difference.  It's probably worth on the order or 25 or so delegates.\n\n**11:55PM ET** Based on early returns not being strong for her in CA, plus her weak performance nationwide in same day vote, I am going to project that Warren does *not* make the threshold in California.  That's a significant boost to Sanders, as it probably means he's consolidated more of the left-wing vote there, and means he has to share fewer delegates out of the only state tonight where he's still got a shot at earning big delegate haul.\n\n**12:02AM ET** With 100% reporting in TN, I can say Mike Bloomberg has made the threshold there.  NYT projects 34 Biden delegates,  21 Sanders, 9 Bloomberg out of TN.\n\n**12:09AM ET** With over 90% reporting in Utah and Colorado (per DDHQ) I am comfortable calling that Warren _will_ make the threshold in those states.  That will cut down the haul Sanders gets out of them, though if Warren eventually drops out and supports Sanders, he would benefit on net from this outcome.  (That is a big \"if\").\n\n**12:17AM ET** Biden is now on track to win Texas, and probably by a few points.  The delegate math is hard to pencil out because Bloomberg is still dropping on same day results, and flirting with the 15% threshold.  My best guess is Biden nets ~12 delegates if Bloomberg makes the threshold, and nets ~20 delegates if Bloomberg misses it.  Perhaps more importantly, Biden probably gets 20 more delegates in absolute terms if Bloomberg misses the threshold than if he makes it, which helps his prospects for a first ballot win.\n\n**12:28AM ET** I am gonna call the liveblog here because I like sleep.  Overall, this is about as good a Super Tuesday for Biden as he could have asked for.  Sanders is in contention but in trouble.  Warren and Bloomberg do not seem to have any viable path to the nomination.\n\n---\n\n^1 American Samoa had a caucus.\n\n^2 There is also a Republican primary today, but it is not seriously contested.\n\n^3 If they didn't do this, then you'd see districts which are heavily republican get far more delegates per democratic primary voter than heavily democratic districts.",

The stated reason being:\n\n> I do not believe it is appropriate for me to speak further about the investigation or to comment on the actions of the Justice Department or Congress.\n\nTherefore, given his resignation, close of the Office of the Special Council, and brief comments on the report, is the political situation changed?

      "text": "Burisma Holdings is a Ukrainian natural gas producer. It holds 35 government concessions to produce hydrocarbons (per Reuters, see https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-whistleblower-burisma-factb/factbox-burisma-the-obscure-ukrainian-gas-company-at-the-heart-of-us-political-row-idUSKBN1W91UG)\n\nIt has been alleged that the owner of Burisma— Mykola Zlochevsky, the former ecology minister of Ukraine— was able to secure the concessions from the Ukrainian government via some corrupt means. (I heard on NPR this morning and found this NYT article with some broad strokes on this saga but does not address the concessions directly: https://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/09/world/europe/corruption-ukraine-joe-biden-son-hunter-biden-ties.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share)\n\nHunter Biden was appointed to the board of Burisma in April 2014 and was allegedly paid up to $50k per month for his services. Hunter had tested positive for cocaine and was discharged from a ceremonial post with the U.S. Navy in February 2014. He remained on the Burisma board until April of this year. (https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/01/us/politics/biden-son-ukraine.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share)\n\nHe is a Yale educated lawyer who did some lobbying work while his father was in the Senate. What specific expertise did he bring to bear on the governance of a natural gas company in Ukraine?\n\nI have seen some reporting that Ukrainian officials looked into this and said Hunter broke no Ukrainian laws. There is no legal limit in Ukraine on board compensation. (https://nypost.com/2019/05/16/joe-biden-and-son-hunter-cleared-of-wrongdoing-by-ukraine-prosecutor/) But how is that relevant?

I'll be keeping a running tick tock below as the night goes on.  If you know of helpful resources I can add above please share in the comments and I'll try to integrate them. \n\n**6:01 PM EST** First polls have closed in eastern KY and most of Indiana.  KY-06 is an interesting race to watch, [rated as a toss up](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2018-midterm-election-forecast/house/kentucky/6/) by forecasters.  \n\n**6:21 PM EST** Posted a new thread because of an issue with the title of the old thread.  Sorry about the error.\n\n**6:33PM EST** First called race of the night is KY-05 for Republican Harold Rogers.  No surprise there as [he was forecast to win by 50.](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2018-midterm-election-forecast/house/kentucky/5/)\n\n**7:00 PM EST**  Big poll closing, GA, SC, VA, VT, NH, and most of FL closed.  Remainders of KY and IN closed.  Networks calling **VT** and **VA** Senate for Democrats.\n\n**7:25 PM EST** Lot of votes coming in now.  Looking decently good for Democrats.  McGrath in KY-06 up by 6 with over 40% reporting.  FL-Sen and FL-Gov looking pretty close to 2012 results for Obama (who won FL).\n\n**7:30 PM EST**  Ohio and West Virginia close, no calls.\n\n**7:38 PM EST** First flip of the night, **VA-10** has flipped to democrats.\n\n**7:55 PM EST** OH-Sen has been called for Sherrod Brown (D).  I am still trying to get a handle on IN-Sen, but it seems like a probable R pickup at the moment. But no votes from Bloomington and minimal from Indianapolis, so no calls yet.\n\n**8:00 PM EST** Big poll closing, calls in MA-Sen, CT-Sen, DE-Sen, MD-Sen, PA-Sen RI-Sen all for democrats.  No calls in TN, NJ, ME.  MA-Gov for Baker (R).\n\n**8:22 PM EST** 538's live model now has Republicans favored to take the House.\n\n**8:46 PM EST** 538 [has now changed their model to be less aggressive.](https://twitter.com/NateSilver538/status/1059982719554215936?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)  Also first toss up call of KY-06 has gone to Barr (R)\n\n**8:47 PM EST** ABC has projected Braun (R) to unseat Joe Donnelly in IN-Sen.\n\n**8:59 PM EST** Manchin (WV-Sen) has held his seat.\n\n**9:00 PM EST** Poll closings in a bunch more states.  No call in TX-Sen, TX gov for Abbot.  NY-Gov for Dems, NY-Sen for Dems, No call in AZ-Sen, ND sen no call, MN-Sen (Klobuchar) elected. WI-Sen Dem, WY-Sen R, \n\n**9:03 PM EST** Networks calling **TN-Sen** for Blackburn (R).  There does not seem to be any path for Democrats to take the Senate.\n\n**9:44 PM EST** Texas Senate is surprisingly close given the overall national environment.  Lot of house races to be called but a lot of small dem leads in them that might give it to the dems.\n\n**9:51 PM EST** NYT has their needle working finally and it is saying dems will win the House (and Beto will lose)\n\n**10:00 PM EST** Polls closing in more states.  Romney wins UT-Sen.  Kobach called loser in KS-Gov to flip that to democrats.\n\n**10:06 PM EST** After some initial freakout for Democrats, looking more like the middle range of the night we expected.  Biggest surprise so far is Donnovan in NY-11 (Staten Island) being ousted.  Very curious to see if that extends to the other NY metro area seats in contention (NY-1 and NY-2 on LI, where there are no results in yet).\n\n**10:16 PM EST** Texas, and with it the Senate, have been called for Republicans, looks like Republicans will pick up 2 to 4 seats in the Senate.\n\n**10:21 PM EST** Networks calling the House for democrats.\n\n**10:42 PM EST** Little downballot news, FL amendment 4 has passed, restoring voting rights to about 1.4 million Floridians who have a felony conviction.  May be a big deal for future FL elections.\n\n**10:55 PM EST** Looks like [Democrats will get a trifecta in New York State.](https://twitter.com/NickReisman/status/1060017122338844672)\n\n**11:00 PM EST** More poll closings on the west coast.  Everything in the lower 48 is in (apart from people still in line to vote).  Lots more counting to do, but the headline for the night is known.\n\n**11:13 PM EST** NYT projection now has FL-Sen at a 0.0 gap between the candidates.  Who likes Florida recounts?\n\n**11:45 PM EST** Biggest upset of the night so far is in OK-05 where Democrat Kendra Horn has unseated Steve Russell in [a seat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oklahoma%27s_5th_congressional_district) Trump won by 13, and Romney won by 18.\n\n**11:48 PM EST** MO-Sen called for Republicans.  Their 3rd pickup of the night.\n\n**11:49 PM EST** Anyone know why there's no results in Nevada yet?  Polls closed almost 2 hours ago.\n\n**11:55 PM EST** More downballot news, Michigan [has passed a major election reform measure allowing same day registration and no excuse absentee voting.](https://twitter.com/PoliticsWolf/status/1060026162276122627)\n\n**12:04 AM EST** Looks like Democrats will [break GOP supermajority in NC's House, and are leading but not called in enough to do so in the Senate](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/11/06/us/elections/results-north-carolina-elections.html) which had led to a lot of [veto overrides.](http://www.wbtv.com/story/38812360/nc-legislature-makes-quick-work-with-veto-overrides/)\n\n**12:20 AM EST** ME-2 has both candidates under 50%, so it looks like this may be the first [usage of Maine's new ranked choice voting scheme.](https://bangordailynews.com/2018/11/06/politics/how-maine-is-handling-its-first-general-election-with-ranked-choice-voting/)\n\n**12:24 AM EST** Finally got an answer as to why no results in Nevada, apparently no results are released until all votes are cast, and some people [have been in very long lines in the Reno area.](https://twitter.com/NVElect/status/1060039493745487873)\n\n**12:32 AM EST** [Utah and Idaho have approved Medicaid expansion referenda.](https://twitter.com/JTHVerhovek/status/1060041180287787008)   Also looks like a close race in CT-Gov.\n\n**12:48 AM EST** Since we have the headline results baked in, I am going to end the tick tock here.  There are a number of races still to be resolved, but we know who will control the houses of Congress.",

As far as I know, the outlets doing high quality election night decision desks are: ABC, CBS, NBC, Fox, the Associated Press, and Decision Desk HQ.  If you know of another you want added to this list please mention it in the comments.  Because there are likely to be significant partisan skews by vote method and what methods get tabulated first in different states, it is much more difficult this year than normal to call states, and I want to encourage everyone to be a little more patient than usual on election night.\n\n**7:00 PM EST**  First wave of full state poll closings.  Looks like AP is calling Vermont for Biden and Kentucky for Trump.  NBC has called Indiana for Trump but not seeing that call from AP.\n\n**7:16 PM EST JRB:3, DJT: 11** In several Florida counties (Pinellas and Hillsborough at least that I can see) Biden has already exceeded the total number of votes cast for Clinton in 2016.  Trump will need very good election day turnout to overcome these numbers.  We shall see if that happened.\n\n**7:21 PM EST JRB: 3 DJT: 11**  [The infamous NY Times needles are back](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/11/03/us/elections/forecast-president.html) but only for 3 states.\n\n**7:23 PM EST JRB: 3, DJT: 11**  Looks like [a quite disappointing result](https://twitter.com/Nate_Cohn/status/1323782789934784512) for Biden in Miami-Dade county is driving the estimate that his odds of winning FL are quite slim according to the NYT.\n\n**7:40 PM EST JRB: 16, DJT: 24** Virginia called for Biden, Kentucky and West Virginia for Trump, all expected.  Shelly Moore Capito (R) has won re-election for her WV senate seat.\n\n**7:48 PM EST**  I found [this helpful tool showing different outlets' calls of states.](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/11/03/upshot/network-race-call-tracker.html)  Given the big differences between them so far, I am not going to be putting electoral vote counts in the timed updates.\n\n**8:15 PM EST**  Looks like Trump is extremely likely to win Florida, yet to be seen if this is something particular to FL (especially Miami) or a national trend that Trump is overperforming polls.\n\n**8:25 PM EST**  Decision Desk HQ is the first major outlet to call a swing state, with FL being called for Trump by them.\n\n**9:12 PM EST** Took a little dinner break there.  Trump appears to be performing pretty well in the south with the NYT projections indicating him likely to win NC and GA as well as looking like pretty much a lock for Trump to win FL.\n\n**9:36 PM EST** Looks like some calls for Hickenlooper to unseat Gardner in the CO-Sen race, which would be the first Senate flip of the night.\n\n**10:21 PM EST**  We are getting a lot of votes in, but with the huge differentials from different voting methods, very few race calls and not a lot definitive to say, except that we can pretty much exclude some of the Biden blowout scenarios.\n\n**11:32 PM EST**  Fox News (but no other outlet yet) has called Arizona for Biden, which would be his first pickup.  \n\nWith that result, and with Biden trailing in GA and NC, it seems within the zone of plausibility that we could see a 269-269 tie.  That would result in invoking the contingent election process laid out in the 12th amendment.\n\nIn that case, the House would pick the President, and the Senate would pick the Vice President.  The House would however not vote like they normally do.  Instead, each state would vote as a state bloc.  And an absolute majority of states would be required to win.\n\n**12:00 Midnight EST** OH has been called by Fox, DDHQ, and NBC for Trump and I see no reason to dispute that call.\n\n**12:09 AM EST** Fox and DDHQ have called Texas for Trump.  All outlets have called NH for Biden.  Still unsure about the Fox call for Biden in Arizona - seems aggressive to me but we shall see.\n\n**12:12 AM EST** The NYT needle in Georgia is now tilting slightly to Biden, and reports are that Fulton County (part of the Atlanta metro) is not going to report more results tonight and has sent their election workers home until tomorrow.  So I would expect about no chance of a GA call tonight.\n\nGiven that we will not know PA/WI/MI tonight either, I think we can fairly safely say the election result won't be known tonight.  I'll stay up til I can find someone making a formal call on the House of Representatives at least, though I've seen nothing to indicate it will not be in Democrats' hands.\n\n**12:15 AM EST** AP has called Minnesota for Biden.\n\n**12:27 AM EST** Fox has retracted their call for Biden in Arizona.\n\n**12:38 AM EST**  NBC has called control of the House of Representatives for Democrats.  I don't see anyone contradicting that call, nor any evidence of a bunch of flipping seats that would lead me to question it, so I am gonna put it up top.\n\n**12:41 AM EST**  Most outlets are calling Iowa and Florida for Trump.\n\n**12:42 AM EST** We are not going to know the result of the election tonight.  We may not know it for a couple of days yet with certainty.  I am going to end the tick-tock here and encourage everyone to get a good night's sleep.\n\n**12:53 AM EST**  One small update.  I was mistaken about the Fox Arizona call being retracted.  Fox has not retracted the call, and they are still saying Biden has won Arizona.",

      "text": "EDIT: The mods have noted that the feedback so far is almost exclusively from users who have little to no posting history in this subreddit. We would like to hear from some regular contributors, so if you're out there, please share your perspective below or by modmail.\n\n----\n\nDear users,\n\nOver the past month, the moderator team of r/NeutralPolitics   and our sister subreddit, r/NeutralNews, has done some soul searching about our future. \n\nAs a discussion platform, Reddit has been in steady decline for years. With the shift to mobile and the [redesign,](https://www.reddit.com/r/redesign/comments/7zndq9/the_redesign_doesnt_value_discussion_subreddits/) content that favors quick engagement and upvotes, continued scrolling, and serving ads seems to be winning out over the kind of text-heavy comment sections we favor here. Reddit admins have frequently promised tools and administrator engagement to improve moderation for subs like ours, and although there has been some progress, delivery often falls short. Reddit's recent [announcement about API access price hikes](https://www.theverge.com/2023/5/31/23743993/reddit-apollo-client-api-cost) has [pushed most third party apps out of business,](https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/third-party-reddit-apps-shutting-down) which in turn has driven half our mod team off of Reddit. It's been years of feeling like we're swimming against the tide.\n\nNevertheless, the mods believe that the kind of environment we try to foster here has value for certain subset of internet users who are looking for evidence-based discussion of political and current events, so rather than shutting down the project, we've decided to seek out a new platform. The trouble is, none of the Reddit alternatives we've looked at are quite ready for us yet. They're quickly maturing, but don't currently provide the tools necessary to moderate this kind of environment with the small team we're able to assemble. We're following the latest developments on those platforms and will transition when we feel it is appropriate.\n\nIn the meantime, there's a question about what to do with these subreddits while we're waiting. r/NeutralPolitics and r/NeutralNews are currently \"restricted,\" meaning no new submissions are allowed, which diminishes the prevalence of comments and practically eliminates our content from users' feeds. \n\nPart of the remaining team thinks we should reopen (allow new submissions again) and place a kind of protest banner at the top of the subs (and perhaps stickied to each post) explaining our status, future, and reasoning. Others on the team believe it's important for us to stick together with protesting subreddits, remaining restricted so that we can motivate Reddit to negotiate with the mod community over API pricing. Under that model, there's a suggestion that we could follow the lead of r/AskHistorians and have [mods post occasional content](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/14jfrwj/floating_feature_a_sky_built_before_us_the/) that keeps the subreddit alive, even while it remains blocked for user submissions.\n\nMost of the third party apps are already gone and the pricing changes are due to take effect on July 1st, which is only a couple days away, so now is the time for us to make a decision. We'd like to incorporate user feedback in that choice. Eventually, we'll be off Reddit, but in the meantime, what do you users think? Should we reopen or remain restricted?\n\nThanks.\n\n— r/NeutralPolitics mod team",

I tried to use that as an (albeit opinionated) \"introduction\" to Soviet history. I feel as if I missed the forest for the trees with that one. Too many details. Perhaps I haven't read enough of it yet.\n\nI would be eternally grateful for anyone willing to help me out.\n\nEDIT: Someone asked below on what *types* of politics and history I want to learn about.\n\nI'd love to learn about world politics (EG what the Marxists believe, where Capitalism originated) and world political history, specifically narratives (EG a narrative of WWI or the USSR, ETC).

The mods have had a chance to preview the question and some of us will be posting our own responses.

Giuliani. Mr. Giuliani has been pushing Ukraine aggressively to look into the Bidens and the origins of material that implicated Paul Manafort, Mr. Trump’s former campaign chairman, in 2016.\n\n---\n\nI have a few of questions on this topic:\n\n1. Do Presidential powers allow a President to dictate terms on appropriated Congressional aid to a foreign country? For example, suppose President Trump said Ukraine would not receive aid until they pledged to hold a public referendum on joining NATO. Can a President set such conditions on Congressional approved aid?\n\n2. Specific to the ongoing Ukraine story with President Trump, are there any legal issues raised when a President asks a foreign nation to investigate US citizens? What about political opponents, other groups?\n\n3. On question two, does adding the layer of withholding appropriated Congressional aid complicate that legal analysis?",

This can be seen especially clear within the success of political satire, and comedians like Jon Stewart, Stephen Colbert, Samantha Bee, and John Oliver.\n\n- After leaving The Daily Show, earning massive success on the Colbert Report, and taking over The Late Show, [host Stephen Colbert now averages 3.2 million viewers per night.]( http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/tv-ratings-stephen-colberts-winning-streak-hits-7-weeks-987663)\n\n- [The January 11th episode on TBS of Full Frontal with Samantha Bee, about a week before Trumps inauguration, aired to an audience of 2.11 million viewers.]( http://variety.com/2017/tv/news/full-frontal-with-samantha-bee-ratings-bump-trump-1201991397/)\n\nThese comedians are almost overwhelming left leaning, I understand that, but I’m very interested in seeing how both left, right, and middle respond to my questions. It also begs the question: [**Why is there no conservative Jon Stewart?**]( https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2015/02/why-theres-no-conservative-jon-stewart/385480/)\n\n**My Questions:**\n\n1.

What is the right's equivalent of this satire trend and what are it's broader impacts?\n\n4. How do you personally approach the consumption of political satire and what is your advice to others?\n\n##I’ve been thinking about this topic for a while now, but here are a couple articles that really inspired this question and research.

Most submitters put it in the title, but that wasn't a requirement until now.\n* **The \"request for sources\" exemption to Rule D is eliminated.** *All* submissions must now include a link to a [qualified source.](https://www.reddit.com/r/NeutralPolitics/wiki/guidelines#wiki_sources) Submitters looking for sources are advised to include what they've found and explain why it's insufficient.\n* **Submissions that take the form of \"Does this label apply?\" are explicitly prohibited.** We've long rejected such posts, because they're reductionist, which runs directly counter to the subreddit's purpose to explore issues in depth. But this policy wasn't explicitly stated in the rules until now.\n* **The following guidance for Rule 2 has been added to match r/NeutralNews:**\n\n> All statements of fact must be clearly associated with a supporting source. Users can hyperlink a source for the claim (preferred), provide a footnote (^1 or [1]), or enclose the link in parentheses. If you're referencing a source in the submission or one that's already been posted in the same comment chain, please indicate that and block quote the relevant section.\n\n**Other announcements and guidance:**\n\n* The description of the subreddit as it appears in Reddit searches has been updated.\n* Reminder: our [submission rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/NeutralPolitics/wiki/guidelines#wiki_submission_rules) don't allow polls, requests for opinion, or promotion of one's own content. \n* Did you google it? Many submitted questions can be answered with a simple web search. The subreddit itself is also searchable.\n* Along those lines, our [Frequent Topics wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/NeutralPolitics/wiki/frequenttopics) is a resource for discussions about issues that come up often.\n* Previous META posts have good explanations of this subreddit's [origin,](https://www.reddit.com/r/NeutralPolitics/comments/4cxvz1/meta_neutralpolitics_origins_and_purpose/) [philosophy,](https://www.reddit.com/r/NeutralPolitics/comments/4wwj5n/meta_on_the_meaning_of_neutral/) and [moderation style.](https://www.reddit.com/r/NeutralPolitics/comments/8qvwvw/meta_reminders_and_clarifications_about_the_rules/)\n\nThanks to all our users for continuing to make this little corner of the internet a great place for evidence-based discussion.

      "text": "I ask this because the mods and users of r/neutralpolitics have always been a haven of mostly reasonable individuals that can give straight answers and cut through the politics and spin, directly to the facts. \n\nFor quite some time now, the conventional wisdom is that gerrymandering creates an unfair election system and is partly responsible for the increasing political polarization we’ve seen in America today. \n\nhttps://campaignlegal.org/sites/default/files/CLC_PartisanGerrymandering_Report_FINAL.pdf\n\n\n\n> *”Contributing to this environment of hyper-partisanship is the practice of partisan gerrymandering, which has been allowed to run rampant nationwide. Partisan gerrymandering creates an unrepresentative and unfair democracy and encourages self-interested politics.”*\n\n\nBut after doing some further research it seems that there isn’t nearly as much hard evidence for it as some news sources would claim. \n\n\nhttps://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/abs/10.1086/697120\n\n\n\n> “*We find that redistrictors marginally help sustain the electoral security of incumbents. Yet counter to expectations, we find that independent redistrictors produce virtually the same degree of insulation as plans devised in legislatures or by politician commissions. Overall, our results suggest caution in overhauling state redistricting institutions as a mechanism to increase electoral competition; independent commissions may not be as politically neutral as theorized.”*\n\nhttps://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1540-5907.2009.00393.x?casa_token=szE8E571AZYAAAAA%3ASnOYHpovXvF_ZI32PR4IBYySxTRl1C6MMKBU83TGATpmZv1ikHaV6HmWepzkT4GFW0HSq3qlxy6XcsQ\n\n\n\n> *”We assess whether there is a strong causal relationship between congressional districting and polarization. We find very little evidence for such a link. First, we show that congressional polarization is primarily a function of the differences in how Democrats and Republicans represent the same districts rather than a function of which districts each party represents or the distribution of constituency preferences. Second, we conduct simulations to gauge the level of polarization under various “neutral” districting procedures. We find that the actual levels of polarization are not much higher than those produced by the simulations. We do find that gerrymandering has increased the Republican seat share in the House; however, this increase is not an important source of polarization.”*\n\nhttps://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/ps-political-science-and-politics/article/gerrymanderers-are-coming-legislative-redistricting-wont-affect-competition-or-polarization-much-no-matter-who-does-it/89F49B2029DBE6A8F755B06B909454F1\n\n\n\n> *”Our analysis of evidence from state legislatures during the last decade suggests that the effects of partisan redistricting on competition and polarization are small, considerably more nuanced than reformers would suggest, and overwhelmed by other aspects of the political environment.”*\n\n\nhttps://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0261379416303201\n\n\n\n> *”The analysis reveals that while Republican and Democratic gerrymandering affects the partisan outcomes of Congressional elections in some states, the net effect across the states is modest, creating no more than one new Republican seat in Congress. Therefore, the partisan composition of Congress can mostly be explained by non-partisan districting, suggesting that much of the electoral bias in Congressional elections is caused by factors other than partisan intent in the districting process”*\n\nFrom the studies that I could find, and the ones that weren’t locked behind the walls, the evidence is either nonexistent or very moderate in terms of any affect gerrymandering has, not only on political representation, but in fair voting districts itself. \n\nThough I did find one study that did find some evidence that appointing a relatively nonpartisan arbiter in the drawing of legislative districts *did* increase competitiveness. \n\nhttps://heinonline.org/hol-cgi-bin/get_pdf.cgi?handle=hein.journals/vllalr54&amp;amp;amp;amp;section=9\n\n\n> *”Contrary to the initial expectations of the authors, the evidence reviewed here suggests that politically independent redistricting seems to reduce partisanship in the voting behavior of congressional delegations from affected states in statistically significant ways. The authors conclude with notes about the study's implications for further research into redistricting and partisanship.”*\n\n\nAm I missing something here?\n\nWhat kind of effect do we know gerrymandering has on the make up of our legislative bodies and on political polarization?",

Our sub relies on active, committed, and passionate moderators, and to that end we're putting out an open request for new mod applications to make sure we can keep the discussion at the level you expect.\n\nHere's what the job entails:\n\nFirst, you need to have time. /r/NeutralPolitics is a heavily moderated subreddit that requires mods to check in every day. Some days there won't be much to do, but others you'll have to spend an hour or more reading posts and messaging people. For our regulars, that's probably close to their participation pattern anyway, but applicants should understand that there's a time commitment involved.\n\nSecond, you need to be familiar with [our guidelines](https://www.reddit.com/r/NeutralPolitics/wiki/guidelines) and understand the type of community we're trying to build. Mods read all submissions, and we make an effort to read all comments as well. The vast majority of submissions to /r/NeutralPolitics get removed by a mod for not conforming to the guidelines. In each of those cases, the mod who removes the post will message the OP explaining why the post was removed and/or work with them to craft an acceptable post. Comments that don't conform to the guidelines are also removed, though they're more difficult to pick out than submissions. It's kind of like a garden: left unattended, some of the plants will creep around and get unruly, but if you stay on top of it, it's a really neat place to hang out.\n\nWe also make heavy use of browser extensions to assist us with our work, so you will need to be able to moderate from a computer with a recent version of Chrome or Firefox, and be willing to install a few extensions.\n\nOther responsibilities include:\n\n* Take note of problem users and bring them to the attention of other mods.\n* If you have a question about a post, submit it to other mods for review.\n* Join discussions with other mods about ways to improve the subreddit.\n* And of course, participate in the sub as a normal user.\n\nIf you're interested in becoming a mod in /r/NeutralPolitics, [message us](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FNeutralPolitics) with the following info:\n\n* A brief explanation of why you want to join the team\n* Why you would be a good fit\n* Your time zone, or what time you would be available to help moderate\n* Which forest animal you would be and why\n\n* Do not tell us your political leaning. **Any application that includes such information will automatically be disqualified.**\n\nWe look forward to hearing from you.",

Though they don't utilize misinformation as heavily, Democrats are not immune to it either; for example, Kamala misrepresented Project 2025's plans for [Social Security](https://edition.cnn.com/2024/07/24/politics/fact-check-harris-project-2025-trump/index.html) and [pregnancies](https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2024/nov/01/kamala-harris/kamala-harris-wrong-that-donald-trump-would-force/).\n\nCurrently there are very few checks on fake news and misinformation in the U.S., except for slander directed against specific people (e.g. [Alex Jones being taken to court for defamation by victims of the Sandy Hook shooting](https://thehill.com/homenews/4267650-judge-alex-jones-must-pay-families-of-sandy-hook-shooting-victims-despite-bankruptcy/)). Are there any other countries that have laws or provisions in place to limit the spread or impact of politically-driven misinformation? What legal obstacles are there to implementing such protections in the U.S.?",

      "text": "Dear users,\n\nToday we're announcing a few small updates to the rules and procedures. Some of these were already mod policy, but hadn't been added to the official guidelines yet. Others are new.\n\n\n**1. The table in the [sources section of the guidelines](https://www.reddit.com/r/NeutralPolitics/wiki/guidelines#wiki_sources) has two new lines to deal with personal blogs and tweets:**\n\nSource type | Submissions | Comments\n---|---|----\nPersonal blogs* | Disallowed | Permitted if the blog post links to qualified non-blog sources\nTweets | may only be used for attributing a statement to the verified account holder | may only be used for attributing a statement to the verified account holder\n\nThis means tweets may not be used to support any assertion of fact other than a claim of attribution. For instance, a [tweet from the NeutralPolitics Twitter account](https://twitter.com/NeutralPolitic/status/1022531083341058048) saying, \"NeutralPolitics has the best looking mods on all of Reddit!\" cannot be used to support assertions about the attractiveness of the mods. It can only be used to demonstrate that the NeutralPolitics mod team *stated* it has the most attractive mods (even though it happens to be true).\n\n \\*A personal blog is defined as a blog with any one of the following characteristics: only has one contributor, allows anonymous contributors without editorial oversight, doesn't have a masthead.\n\n**2. Users may not post top-level comments on their own submissions.** Such comments will be automatically removed.\n\nThe review process for submissions is strict and detailed in NeutralPolitics. The mods view top-level comments by submitters as a way to circumvent that process, adding content that would not have been approved under the submission rules. Submitters are free to participate in the discussion as replies to other users.\n\n**3. Submissions asking whether something is \"unusual\" (and other variations using that word) are no longer allowed.** They are considered non-specific and leading, and as such, violate submission rules A and B. \n\n Submitters may still pose questions that examine historical standards and expectations in any of the following more evidence-based forms:\n\n* Is there historical precedent for x?\n* What are some examples of when x has happened before?\n* In what ways, if any, does x break from historical norms?\n* What legal/political/historical basis is there for X to be considered?\n\n**3. Links that redirect from Google are now allowed**, so long as they don't disguise the final destination in the URL (e.g., https://www.google.com/amp/www.latimes.com/politics/la-pol-sac-skelton-california-pension-liabilities-20180118-story.html). Other redirecting links are still prohibited.\n\n**4. After a [16-month hiatus,](https://www.reddit.com/r/NeutralPolitics/comments/5xr3xn/meta_rneutralpolitics_is_opting_out_of_rall_and/) r/NeutralPolitics has returned to r/all on a trial basis.** As always, this runs the risk of attracting participants who don't follow the rules, so we remind our long-time users that the mods rely on reports to find comments that are in violation.\n\n**5. Our sister subreddit, r/NeutralNews, needs more mods and submitters.** See [here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/neutralnews/comments/91srzl/meta_call_for_mods_and_feedback_summer_2018/)",

The big dichotomy here is between right and left, where both liberalism and conservatism are (usually) treated as positions in the right part of the spectrum\\*, whereas the left (usually) rejects (at least one of) them.\n\nI try coming up with analogies in order to understand, say, \"which side is which\" when following US politics: the liberals are the equivalent to the left and the conservatives, to the right...? My experience with my country's politics **heavily** contradicts this, as I already explained, but I try working with this view anyway.\n\nAs if it wasn't confusing enough, I then began following discussions in American leftists circles (mostly in Facebook) and I learned that most of them are strongly against not only conservatives but liberals too, as [this article](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/05/magazine/hated-by-the-right-mocked-by-the-left-who-wants-to-be-liberal-anymore.html) addresses, which lead me to write this post. This position of the left makes sense when approaching the subject from the world view of my country's politics, where they're often seen as parts (not necessarily in agreement, but still) of the same side, but it doesn't make any sense when talking specifically about the US, where both are frequently seen as parts of a dichotomy.\n\nSo, I ask: Who/what exactly is this dichotomy addressing? Can it be adequately juxtaposed to a left-right dichotomy?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\*I am not implying that they always come together, (in fact, Instituto Liberal, the \"Liberal Institute\", published an article saying that [there is no such thing as a liberal conservative](https://www.institutoliberal.org.br/blog/nao-existe-liberal-conservador-2/) as Amoedo suggested) just that they're both seen as part of the right",

But the GOP's results in the three presidential elections since then are not good. In 2008, the election was marred from a centrist's perspective by [Sarah Palin's nomination for VP](http://dallasmorningviewsblog.dallasnews.com/2008/11/five-reasons-th.html/), combined with [stronger unity within the Democratic party](http://www.nytimes.com/2008/06/08/us/politics/08dems.html?_r=0). In 2012, Romney and Ryan ran a [bizzarely poor campaign](https://shadowproof.com/2012/11/08/mitt-romneys-ten-biggest-mistakes/). In 2016, we have only seen the Primaries drama and Trump so far, so centrist voters are naturally alienated—but there is no guarantee the Republican nominee will swing far enough back to the center to entice moderate voters this election.\n\nPolitically, I am divided almost 50-50 between Democratic platform and Republican platform. I vote more based on foreign policy than domestic policy matters. I would be happy to consider a viable Republican challenger to Hillary Clinton, if one appears. But the Republican Party still has been unable to produce an appealing candidate in recent years.\n\n**Is there a concrete reason why this is? Perhaps it's just a case of bad luck in wooing swing votes? Or maybe the answer is simple, and I'm just not a representative centrist voter?** Thank you for your thoughts.",

If you have an idea for a post and aren't sure about the rules, ask us for help and we can help make sure it works. [Here's a post from last years with tips on how to get your submission approved.](https://www.reddit.com/r/NeutralPolitics/comments/aq73o3/meta_how_to_write_a_successful_submission_for/)\n* We sometimes get asked what \"neutral\" means with respect to this subreddit and how it plays into our moderation. This is covered in the [guidelines,](https://www.reddit.com/r/NeutralPolitics/wiki/guidelines#wiki_neutral-ness) but basically, we moderate by the rules, not by personal opinion. We don't remove content because either we or you don't like it. Submissions must be framed in a neutral way, per Rule B, but **there is no neutrality requirement for comments.** Participating in the comments does not require you to be neutral. It requires you to be factual and respectful. The [four rules on commenting](https://www.reddit.com/r/NeutralPolitics/wiki/guidelines#wiki_comment_rules) are what apply and we remove content that violates them.\n* Our companion news subreddit, r/NeutralNews, is not dead. The reboot has taken a lot longer than we expected, but we've just begun testing our new moderation tools there, so we are making progress.\n\n\nOK, that's it for the info. Feel free to comment below with things you like, things you dislike, features you'd like to see, etcetera.\n\n— r/NeutralPolitics mod team",

      "text": "[This fascinating article](http://grist.org/politics/science-confirms-politics-wrecks-your-ability-to-do-math/) about a recent Yale study does not bode well for the potential to build political consensus between disparate groups.\n\nI highly recommend reading the whole thing, but the gist of it is this: given a math problem relating to the efficacy of a skin cream, people got the answers right according to their individual mathematical ability (numeracy), but given *the same data* relating to the efficacy of gun control laws, people were more likely to answer according to their political beliefs. What's more, respondents with higher numeracy were actually *more* likely to be affected by their bias.\n\nSo, if facts don't trump bias, even in those people best equipped to analyze the facts, what hope do we have of producing effective policies? And to get meta, what is the point of this subreddit?",

It seems like there’s growing momentum across the continent to challenge Western influence.\n\nThis raises an important question for me: What is it that Russia and China truly offer as a better alternative to the West, or what is it that appeals to African nations?\n\nSome call China’s Belt and Road Initiative ‘debt diplomacy’ (https://odi.org/en/insights/why-china-is-seeking-greater-presence-in-africa-the-strategy-behind-its-financial-deals/) and others seeing it as an opportunity for much-needed infrastructure and development. Do these projects genuinely benefit African nations and their citizens, or are the risks of dependency and exploitation just taking a new form?\n\nI’m also curious about how African leaders can navigate these shifting alliances. What steps can they take to ensure that deals with China and Russia are transparent, fair, and truly focused on long-term development for their people?\n\nLastly, as Africa diversifies its partnerships, how does China and Russia’s approach compare to Western influence in terms of sustainability, sovereignty, and real development outcomes? Are these new alliances are a step forward for Africa or is the continent simply trading one set of challenges for another?",

      "text": "##**Due to the attention this topic has been getting, the moderators of NeutralPolitics have decided to consolidate discussion of Net Neutrality into one place. Enjoy!**\n\n---\n\nAs of yesterday, 21 November 2017, Ajit Pai, the current head of the Federal Communications Commission, [announced](https://twitter.com/AjitPaiFCC/status/933009189991079936?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Etweet) plans to roll back Net Neutrality regulations on internet service providers (ISPs). The proposal, which an FCC press release [has described](http://transition.fcc.gov/Daily_Releases/Daily_Business/2017/db1121/DOC-347868A1.pdf) as a return to a \"light touch regulatory approach\", will be voted on next month.\n\nThe FCC memo claims that [the current Net Neutrality rules](https://www.cnet.com/news/13-things-you-need-to-know-about-the-fccs-net-neutrality-regulation/), brought into place in 2015, have \"depressed investment in building and expanding broadband networks and deterred innovation\". Supporters of Net Neutrality [argue](https://www.savetheinternet.com/net-neutrality-what-you-need-know-now) that the repeal of the rules would allow for ISPs to control what consumers can view online and price discriminate to the detriment of both individuals and businesses, and that investment [may not actually have declined](https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2017/09/in-anti-net-neutrality-push-fcc-downplays-data-that-contradicts-narrative/) as a result of the rules change.\n\nCritics of the current Net Neutrality regulatory scheme argue that the current rules, which treat ISPs as a utility subject to special rules, is [bad for consumers](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/innovations/wp/2016/07/07/why-treating-the-internet-as-a-public-utility-is-bad-for-consumers/) and other problems, like the lack of competition, [are more important](https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2014/06/we-dont-need-net-neutrality-we-need-competition/). \n\n---\n\n**Some questions to consider:**\n\n* How important is Net Neutrality? How has its implementation affected consumers, businesses and ISPs? How would the proposed rule changes affect these groups?\n* What alternative solutions besides \"keep/remove Net Neutrality\" may be worth discussing?\n* Are there any major factors that haven't received sufficient attention in this debate? Any factors that have been overblown?",

First, you need to have time. /r/NeutralPolitics & /r/NeutralNews are heavily moderated subreddits that require mods to check in every day. Some days there won't be much to do, but others you'll have to spend up to an hour reading posts and messaging people. For our regulars, that's probably close to their participation pattern anyway, but applicants should understand that there's a time commitment involved.\n\n1. Second, you need to be familiar with [the guidelines](https://www.reddit.com/r/NeutralPolitics/wiki/guidelines) and understand the type of community we're trying to build. It's kind of like a garden: left unattended, some of the plants will creep around and get unruly, but if you stay on top of it, it's a really neat place to hang out.\n\nMods read all submissions, and we're making an effort to read all comments as well. The vast majority of submissions to /r/NeutralPolitics get removed by a mod for not conforming to the guidelines. In each of those cases, the mod who removes the post will message the OP explaining why the post was removed and/or work with them to craft an acceptable post. Comments that don't conform to the guidelines are also removed, though they're more difficult to pick out than submissions.\n\nWe also make heavy use of browser extension tools to assist us with our work, so you will need to be able to moderate from a computer with a recent version of Chrome or Firefox, and be willing to install a few extensions.\n\nOther responsibilities include:\n\n* Message an OP asking them to modify their submission.\n\n* Take note of problem users and bring them to the attention of other mods.\n\n* If you have a question about a post, submit it to other mods for review.\n\n* Join discussions with other mods about ways to improve the subreddit.\n\n* And of course, participate in the sub as a normal user.\n\nIf you're interested in becoming a mod in /r/NeutralPolitics, [message us](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FNeutralPolitics) to our inbox including the following info:\n\n* A brief explanation of why you want to join the team\n\n* Why you would be a good fit\n\n* Your time zone, or what time you would be available to help moderate\n\n* If you could be any Halloween \"monster\" what would you be and why \n\n* Do not tell us your political leaning. Any application that includes that information will automatically be dropped.\n\nAdditionally, as part of your application, include what you see as issues of the subreddit and possible solutions to the same. \n\n**Please note you do not need prior mod experience to apply**",

      "text": "**This is not an April Fools joke!**\n\nDear users,\n\nFrom 5:00 p.m. EST today until the morning of April 4th, /r/NeutralPolitics will be in \"lockdown\" mode for restructuring. This meta post, and the various other meta posts linked within, describes what we're doing and why.\n\n(Again, not an April Fools joke.)\n\n--------\n\n**What the lockdown means:**\n\n* Mods will approve no new submissions from now until Monday morning.\n* All posts from the previous seven days will be locked until Monday morning. Mods will use the interim period to clean up discussions in those posts to make sure the comments comply with the rules.\n* This series of meta posts will stay open so users and mods can interact.\n\n----------\n\n**Why we're doing what we're doing.**\n\nr/NeutralPolitics has a long history of encouraging a certain type of discussion that's not found in many other places on the internet. If you're not familiar with that history, [reading about it](https://www.reddit.com/r/NeutralPolitics/comments/4cxvz1/meta_neutralpolitics_origins_and_purpose/) might help you understand our larger goals.\n\nIn the last few months, this subreddit has undergone an unprecedented period of subscriber growth and it has brought about a shift in the tone of discussion. That has prompted increasing complaints from the users, which fall roughly into two camps.\n\nUsers who are accustomed to the discussion environment we have built over the last four years (we'll call them 'Group A') have complained repeatedly to the mods about the:\n\n* Decline in comment quality.\n* Decline in vigilance of policing comments for citations.\n* Increase in \"eloquent opinions parading themselves as facts.\" (Thanks to a specific user for this apt description.)\n* Comments that should be removed for rule violations are instead upvoted by a large number of readers.\n* Diminished participation from users who used to contribute well-sourced insights that counter the common narratives.\n\nMeanwhile, other participants (who we'll call 'Group B') complain the rules and enforcement are *too* strict to allow the kind of freeform discussions they find on other subreddits, websites, facebook, at dinner tables, etc. Some of the comments we've received from these users are:\n\n* \"I think\" statements shouldn't require a source. It's just personal opinion.\n* Concepts that are, or should be, common knowledge don't require a citation. Everyone knows what their definitions are.\n* Speculation is useful, even if it can't be supported with evidence.\n* These rules are stifling discussion.\n\nPast waves of growth have been accompanied by similar adjustment and complaint periods, but in all those cases, the Group A folks have vastly outnumbered those from Group B. This time is different. The split of opinions is roughly even now, which means there's a sizable portion of our users who want a discussion environment with more relaxed rules.\n\nThis has put us at a crossroads. We have to decide what kind of subreddit we want to be.\n\nAfter careful consideration, the mods have concluded that adjusting the sub to accommodate Group B would be throwing in the towel on creating the evidence-based environment outlined in our [mission statement](https://www.reddit.com/r/NeutralPolitics/wiki/guidelines#wiki_mission_statement), which we're not quite ready to do yet.\n\nInstead, we've decided to launch an outlet specifically for those users. /r/NeutralTalk is a new subreddit based on the rules of /r/NeutralPolitics, but with a few key restrictions eliminated to allow more freeform and speculative discussions. [The official announcement is here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/NeutralPolitics/comments/4cxvs8/meta_announcing_neutraltalk_a_companion_sub_to/) We encourage you to check it out.\n\nIn the meantime, /r/NeutralPolitics, will undergo a *tightening* of the rules, and especially enforcement, in an effort to bring quality back in line with what our long-time users expect and to entice quality contributors back to the discussions.\n\nThe following concepts are all outlined in the rules already, but we'll be focusing on more strict enforcement from here on: \n\n* Prefacing a comment with \"I think\" does not absolve you of the need to support your assertions with logic and evidence. If you're making a claim, you need to make a case for that claim. There are myriad sites on the internet (including /r/NeutralTalk) where you can state your personal opinion without the need for evidentiary support. This isn't one of them.\n* \"Commenters should respond to any reasonable request for sources as an honest inquiry made in good faith.\" What may seem \"obvious\" or \"common sense\" to you is often not to others. In fact, the most obvious conclusions are often wrong and, as it's said, \"*common sense* is the least common of the senses.\" So, if somebody — mod or user — asks you to provide a source for your assertion of fact, please just comply. You might end up teaching something, or learning something, or both. The fact that you think your point is obvious, or common knowledge, or self-evident is irrelevant. Assertions of fact require sources on NeutralPolitics and requests for such sources are part of the deal. Don't view them as an assault or a challenge. They're just an invitation to provide knowledge.\n* As per [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/NeutralPolitics/comments/49fy8q/meta_rneutralpolitics_passing_60k_subscribers_new/) past announcement, posts that are requests for speculation are no longer be permitted on NeutralPolitics. The answers to speculative questions are inherently handicapped against the rules. Please take your requests for *informed* speculation to /r/NeutralTalk.\n\nTo some users, especially the folks firmly in Group B, this period of enforcement is going to seem especially brutal. So be it. Hopefully, you'll find a home in /r/NeutralTalk or elsewhere. For right now, the preservation of four years of work is the mod team's highest priority.\n\nOn the other hand, if you want to help us restore the tone of discussion that we set out to foster from the beginning, please review the guidelines, source your assertions, and report content that violates the rules. And if you're really committed, [become a mod!](https://www.reddit.com/r/NeutralPolitics/comments/4cxwm0/meta_neutralpolitics_needs_new_mods/) We need the help.\n\n--------\n\n**Other important notes and changes.**\n\n* We have a new, stricter policy on banning users. Please [read the details here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/NeutralPolitics/comments/4cxs5o/meta_new_ban_policy/)\n\n* Most posters don't read the [submission rules,](https://www.reddit.com/r/NeutralPolitics/wiki/guidelines#wiki_submission_rules) which makes a lot of extra work for moderators. This problem has only increased as our traffic has increased. Fully 60% of submissions never see the light of day in the subreddit. See [here for more information.](https://www.reddit.com/r/NeutralPolitics/comments/4cxwow/meta_neutralpolitics_traffic_and_submission/)\n\n* We'd like to encourage proposals for additions to our [Comment Hall of Fame](https://www.reddit.com/r/NeutralPolitics/wiki/commenthalloffame). If you have a comment you think is deserving, please let us know in the comments! Additionally, the Hall of Fame will now be more prominently featured on our sidebar as a series of model comments. We hope that they will serve as examples for what we want to see on NeutralPolitics. \n\n\n-----\n\nWe look forward to your comments below.",

      "text": "Yesterday, in a [New York state trial,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prosecution_of_Donald_Trump_in_New_York#Closing_arguments_and_jury_instructions) a Manhattan jury found former president Donald Trump guilty on all 34 counts of falsifying business records. \n\nThe prosecution's theory of the case was that Trump, during his 2016 campaign for president and in the midst of a public scandal around the release of the [Access Hollywood tape,](https://www.courthousenews.com/longtime-trump-aide-hope-hicks-recalls-access-hollywood-tape-leak-in-hush-money-trial-testimony/) was so concerned that revelations of his alleged 2006 sexual encounter with adult film star Stormy Daniels would sink his chances for election, that he instructed Michael Cohen to buy her silence, then falsified his business records to explain the reimbursement to Cohen. Because this payment was in furtherance of his campaign goals of keeping the news from the voters, it was a violation of Federal Election law and/or tax law, and therefore the falsification of records was a felony. The prosecution's underlying point was that Trump directed and funded an effort to [keep information from the voters](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-68877610) in order to improve his electoral chances.\n\nTrump's defense was that [Cohen is a prolific liar](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c6ppz2l16n7o) who had [decided on his own to make the payment to Stormy Daniels,](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/05/28/trump-trial-closing-arguments/) and further, that Trump had nothing to do with the payments to Cohen, which were only recorded as legal expenses due to a [software limitation.](https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/justice/2996491/trump-attorneys-highlight-key-reason-cohen-payments-labeled-legal-expenses/) \n\nOutside of the proceedings, Trump repeatedly made [claims that the prosecution was unfair and politically motivated.](https://www.mercurynews.com/2024/05/06/the-latest-12th-day-of-donald-trumps-hush-money-trial-adjourns-early/)\n\nQuestions:\n\n* What's the evidence for and against this being a politically motivated prosecution?\n* What's the evidence for and against this having been a fair trial?\n* Other than the defendant, was there anything unusual about the proceedings that would cast doubt on the fairness of the result?\n* Are the charges in line with other cases in this jurisdiction?\n* What grounds does Trump have for appeal?\n* Can such appeals go to the US Supreme Court even though this is a State jury trial?\n* According to New York judicial practices, what's the range of potential sentences for this conviction?",

      "title": "[META] Reminders and clarifications about the rules and moderation in r/NeutralPolitics",
      "text": "Dear users,\n\nThe mods here feel like it's time for some reminders about how this subreddit is run.\n\nPrimarily, as we write at the top of every post:\n\n> /r/NeutralPolitics is a curated space. \n\n> In order not to get your comment removed, please familiarize yourself with our [rules on commenting](https://www.reddit.com/r/NeutralPolitics/wiki/guidelines#wiki_comment_rules) before you participate.\n\nA lot of people seem to ignore this, but we're begging you… **please read the rules!**\n\nNow, here are a few refreshers on the specifics…\n\n**Why are sources required?**\n\nThe requirement to provide sources for all assertions of fact (Rule 2) is part of the [founding ethos of this subreddit.](https://www.reddit.com/r/NeutralPolitics/comments/4cxvz1/meta_neutralpolitics_origins_and_purpose/) Many things people believe to be true are, in fact, not. Providing sources is the best way to support your assertions. It is our cornerstone philosophy.\n\n**How to handle requests for sources.**\n\nCommenters should respond to any reasonable request for sources as an honest inquiry made in good faith. What may seem \"obvious\" or \"common sense\" to you is often not to others. So, if somebody — mod or user — asks you to support your statement, please just comply. You might end up teaching something, or learning something, or both. Assertions of fact require sources on NeutralPolitics and requests for such sources are part of the deal. They're not an assault or a challenge. Think of them as an invitation to provide knowledge.\n\n**\"You can just google it.\"**\n\nNo. It's the responsibility of the person making the claim to support it. It's also far more efficient for the one person making the assertion to link to the source than to charge thousands of individual readers with supporting it.\n\n**There's no exception for \"common knowledge.\"**\n\n[This is explicitly stated in the rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/NeutralPolitics/wiki/guidelines#wiki_rule_2.3A_source_your_facts) because \"common knowledge\" is poorly defined and completely subjective. What qualifies as common knowledge to one person might be a shocking fact to another. For example, people who are new to a topic or are from cultures other than the dominant one in the discussion may have no idea about these supposedly \"common\" pieces of knowledge.\n\nAdditionally, statements of \"common knowledge\" are often wrong. The fact that a large number of people may believe something has [no bearing on whether or not it's true.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argumentum_ad_populum)\n\nWe occasionally get pushback from users on this point, and it often takes the form of something like, \"Do I have to source that the sky is blue?\" This is a convenient example for a few reasons:\n\n1. The sky is *not* blue. It only looks that way to us because of [human physiology](https://www.livescience.com/320-blue-skies-eye-beholder.html) and how the [light scatters through the atmosphere.](https://spaceplace.nasa.gov/blue-sky/en/)\n2. Even at that, it doesn't always appear blue. It's red and orange at sunrise and sunset, white on an overcast day, gray when there are rain clouds, and black at night.\n3. Finally, this is a political discussion forum, so any assertion about the color of the sky is likely to be removed for being off topic. The same goes for similar examples, like \"water is wet.\" When we get into political topics, there's actually much *less* agreement on what constitutes common knowledge, so we don't accept any of it.\n\n**Removal reasons (we don't always post them)**\n\nThe mods try to reply with a reason for each removed comment. However, users have repeatedly complained that heavily redacted threads get crowded with removal reasons, making it hard to find the actual content. \n\nThat in mind, there are some situations where we don't post them. The most common is when they're in a chain that is off-topic or stemming from a rule-violating comment. In that case, we'll just nuke the whole chain rather than post a dozen or so removal reasons. Comments that are just obvious trolling, spam or repeats may also be removed without notice.\n\nWhat this means is that you might not notice if your comment is removed. The best way to avoid this is to not violate the [rules on commenting](https://www.reddit.com/r/NeutralPolitics/wiki/guidelines#wiki_comment_rules) in the first place, but if you have any doubt, you can also check the public mod logs.\n\n**Public mod logs**\n\nIn the interest of transparency, moderation logs are public on r/NeutralPolitics. We have [our own system](https://modlogs.fyi/r/NeutralPolitics) (there's also a link in the sidebar) or you can use [ceddit](https://www.ceddit.com/r/NeutralPolitics).\n\n\nThat's all. Feel free to post your questions or comments below.\n\nAs always, thanks for your participation.\n\n— r/NeutralPolitics mod team",

If you are at the wrong polling place they will not have your name on the list of voters. If you are at the correct location and are not on the list, you can still cast a ballot. Ask the poll worker for a *provisional* ballot. After the polls close on Election Day the state will check on the status of your voter registration and if there was a mistake made. The state must notify you as to whether your ballot was counted.\n\n*Q: On Election Day, if I think my rights have been violated, what should I do?*    \nA: Call or text the Election Protection Hotline at 866-687-8683. There will be lawyers on hand to answer Election Day questions and concerns about voting procedures.\n\n*Q: Can I vote if I'm out of the country?*    \nA: Yes. U.S. citizens who will be over 18 on election day may vote even if they're traveling, serving, or residing outside the country. The specific rules for overseas voters vary based on a number of factors. More information can be found through the [Federal Voting Assistance Program.](https://www.fvap.gov/)\n\n*Q: Do I have to wait until election day to vote?*     \nA: Probably not. Early voting has begun, or will soon begin, in all states that have it. Check the [rules and deadlines for your particular state here,](https://www.usvotefoundation.org/early-voting-dates) noting that early voting *ends* before election day in some states.\n\n*Q: Do I have to be registered with the party of the candidate I want to vote for?*    \nA: No. In general elections, you can vote for any candidate of any party, no matter your personal affiliation. Depending on the state where you're registered, primary elections may be different, but those have all passed for this cycle.\n\n*Q: Do I need to vote on every candidate and issue in order for my ballot to be valid?*    \nA: No. Your ballot is valid even if you decline to vote on specific races or questions. Your vote will still be counted in the contests where you voted.\n\n*Q: May I bring notes and/or a sample ballot into the voting booth?*    \nA: Yes, you're allowed to bring notes with you, but some polling places restrict the use of cell phones, so notes should be on paper.\n\n*Q: Where can I learn more about the candidates and issues on my ballot?*    \nA: For ballot initiatives, your Secretary of State's office will usually send a voter information booklet and sample ballot, which may also be available on their website. Check [BallotReady](https://www.ballotready.org/) to find yours.\n\nFor comparisons of the candidates, these sites are useful:\n\n* [ISideWith,](https://www.isidewith.com/) \"the world’s most popular voting guide for citizens to find information about elections, political parties, candidates, voting districts and popular political issues in their country.\"\n* [Ballotpedia,](https://ballotpedia.org/) \"the digital encyclopedia of American politics, and the nation’s premier resource for unbiased information on elections, politics, and policy.\"\n* [VOTE 411,](https://www.vote411.org/ballot) \"Personalized Ballot and Candidate Information.\"\n* [We Vote,](https://wevote.us/) \"a digital voter guide.\"\n* [ProCon.org](https://2024election.procon.org/side-by-side-comparison-chart/) Side-by-Side Comparison Chart.\n* [Open Secrets,](https://www.opensecrets.org/) \"the nation's premier research group tracking money in U.S. politics and its effect on elections and public policy.\"\n* [Reuters comparison of Harris & Trump on key issues.](https://www.reuters.com/graphics/USA-ELECTION/ISSUES/zdpxqnodovx/)\n\n----\n\n*This is an informational post for our users.*",

I've always thought of American politics as being much more moderate than the rest of the world, considering the moderate tendencies of the Democratic and Republican party when compared with large parties from many large European countries (France, Spain). \n\nI'm thinking that maybe the reason that American politics seem \"moderate\" is because of our two dominant parties being very middle-ground. \n\nhttp://www.msnbc.com/morning-joe/meet-the-moderates\n\nHowever, some articles have the opposite viewpoint of me.

Lynching, for example, is an explicitly extra-judicial form of punishment, of which there were [4,743 during the Jim Crow era between 1882-1968](http://law2.umkc.edu/faculty/projects/ftrials/shipp/lynchingsstate.html). There is also the matter of [honor killings](http://time.com/4415554/honor-killing-qandeel-baloch/) and [other violent acts](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/may/26/muslim-mob-in-egypt-strips-elderly-christian-woman-in-violent-attack) to discourage and punish violators of religious and cultural norms.\n\nSome political scientists have argued that [violence against the state](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2013/11/05/peaceful-protest-is-much-more-effective-than-violence-in-toppling-dictators/?utm_term=.a6bb92ee270f) is an ineffective form of revolution compared to non-violence. If true, does that same dynamic apply to civic groups without the state relationship?  Does success rely on factors like a permissive state or the reaction of the group violence is being done upon? Size and scope of the violence?\n\n**In summary:**\n\n* Is civic violence against citizens an effective political tool?\n\n* What forms are the most or least effective?(or counterproductive, to the inverse)\n\n* What factors influence success or failure?\n\n* Why?",

Reddit is now forcing our hand. They've threatened to replace the mod team if we don't reopen.\n\nWe haven't exactly figured out how to deal with the reduced capabilities of moderating without third party apps, but we're also reluctant to see all the effort we've put in over the last dozen years passed to an unknown team, so we're giving it a try.\n\n**What has changed about the subreddit?**\n\nVery little. The rules and procedures are just as they were. \n\nHowever, mods are on Reddit less, so response times may be a little longer. If that becomes a problem, we'll address it.\n\nAdditionally, it's a little easier for users to get banned now. Since the summer protests, we've noticed that the quality of discussion has declined sitewide. The percentage of comments we remove for rule violations in our sister subreddit, r/NeutralNews, has gone way up. Because we pride ourselves on not banning users capriciously, we've maintained the same system of warnings and escalating bans as always, but lowered the thresholds for bans in both subreddits. \n\n**Why not bring on more mods?**\n\nIt's easier said than done. When we've put out calls in the past, we've gotten very few responses. Of the people who do respond, a very small number follow through and end up qualified. On average, we take on one new mod per mod call, and it's rare that they last more than a month after the training period. Simply put, trying to bring on new mods involves a lot of time investment for the existing team with traditionally poor return. However, as stated above, if continuing to manage the subreddit becomes difficult, we'll consider it.\n\n**Other than becoming a mod, what can I do to help?**\n\nFollow [the rules,](https://www.reddit.com/r/NeutralPolitics/wiki/guidelines) report any violations you see, and generally don't make more work for the mods. If you're about to click \"save\" on a submission or comment and you think, 'this probably isn't compliant, but if so, a mod can remove it,' please don't. That just makes more work for the team and lowers the proportion of quality content for everyone else.\n\n**Why not just turn it over to another team?**\n\nWe've spent over a decade building a userbase that expects a certain level of quality and a particular kind of adjudication from the mods. We wouldn't be able to guarantee that if we cede it to another team, which seems disrespectful to the users who have stuck with us.\n\n**What are the plans for the future?**\n\nWe've had some productive discussions about our next steps and there are some ideas in the works, one of which we're really hopeful about, but it's still too early to announce anything.\n\n**What if I have questions or feedback about the subreddit?**\n\nPut them in the comments below, but please be polite about it.\n\nThanks.\n\n— r/NeutralPolitics mod team",

On the flip side, if we vote for socialized healthcare, how would that effect the economy with hundreds of insurance companies being forced out of business, millions of their employees becoming unemployed, etc. This may also have an effect on the salaries earned by healthcare providers, etc. I mean, it's one thing to say you want universal healthcare implemented in America. It's another thing to understand all of the causes and effects that would come about as a result.\n\nWhen I vote, I want to be as informed as possible. I want to vote not just for what I *think* I want to happen, but policies that will actually have a positive effect on this country, our economy, and our overall well-being.\n\nNOTE: the questions I outlined in my post are just examples and not things I am actually expecting you all to answer directly (although feel free to give it a try).

The biggest mistake I believe that he made, and I disagree with him on a number of policy issues, but his biggest political mistake is after his brilliant 2008 political campaign, when he rallied millions of people to stand up and fight back, basically what he said after he was elected, \"***Well, I will take it from here***, I will negotiate with Boehner and Mitch McConnell and Republicans...\"  \n\n>The only way we bring about real change in this country, which represents the needs of the middle class and working families, is when millions of people stand up and say \"enough is enough\"!  They are organized and that is what I'm talking about when I speak about a ***political revolution***.  No president, not Bernie Sanders or anyone else can do it unless millions of people say \"you know what, this country belongs to all of us.  Our government must represent all of us and not just a handful of billionaires.\"  It can't be done within the Beltway itself.  We need a ***mass movement***, and that's what we are trying to create and are succeeding in creating right now.\"\n\nThis isn't the first time Sanders has used this language.  [In his candidacy announcement](https://berniesanders.com/bernies-announcement/), Sanders said:\n\n>Today, with your support and the support of millions of people throughout this country, we begin a ***political revolution*** to transform our country economically, politically, socially and environmentally.\n\nNearly a month before he officially announced his candidacy, Sanders issued a press release with the title [\"***Mass Movement*** Forming for Bernie Sanders Campaign\".](https://berniesanders.com/press-release/mass-movement-forming-for-bernie-sanders-campaign/)\n\nAll three of these sources (the CNN interview, his candidacy announcement, and the press release one month beforehand) contain the statement ***\"Enough is Enough!\"***, which seems to be his unofficial campaign slogan.\n\n---\n\n**Definitions**\n\n[This political science textbook](http://college.cengage.com/polisci/miroff/dem_debate/2e/students/chapters/chap10/overview.html), which advocates for a place for **mass movements** in a functioning democracy, has this to say about them:\n\n> Although interest groups and mass movements are both forms of ***extra-electoral politics***, interest groups tend to focus on material goals, whereas ***mass movements seek broad moral and ideological objectives that affect the entire society.*** Consequently, the goals of mass movements are not easily subject to compromise. Also, the tactics that mass movements employ distinguish them from interest groups. These include ***demonstrations, boycotts, strikes, sit-ins, civil disobedience, riots, and even violence. Mass movements do not specifically target decision makers as do interest groups; rather, they seek to inform and activate broader publics who will then pressure decision makers.*** By broadening the scope of the conflict protesters hope to gain power in order to overcome institutional obstacles. Mass movements, then, carry potential for large-scale participation and offer the underrepresented a chance to be heard. They are necessary because no democracy is fully attentive to all its citizens all the time.\n\n> Given their confrontational and participatory nature, mass movements have been the subject of heated debate between elite and popular democrats. ***Elite democrats are suspicious that mass movements can quickly become lawless mobs. Passions, as the Federalists said, need to be filtered through representative institutions.*** Elite democrats claim that the goals of mass movements are often utopian and impractical. To elite democrats, mass movements lack concrete programs for reform, seeking instead moral goals that are unrealizable and threaten democratic rule. Elite democrats believe that the tactics that mass movements use encourage society to divide into warring camps, undermining the norm of tolerance necessary for a healthy democracy. Movements are not expressions of people's natural desire to participate in politics; instead, elite democrats charge, people are drawn into them by clever leaders who play upon their emotions.\n\n> Whereas elite democrats see protest tactics as leading to irrational actions, popular democrats view mass movements as both beneficial and necessary for democracy. Within the rules of American politics, periodic elections and interest group bargaining do not capture the full promise of American democracy. ***For popular democrats, mass movements are ways for citizens to communicate directly with government. Protest politics is necessary to bring about greater equality in the political system. Previously neglected groups or causes are organized in mass movements to overcome the inertia of the American system of checks and balances.*** Popular democrats believe mass movements are not threats to democracy. Rather, mass movements fulfill the expectations of democracy by bringing more and more groups into full-fledged American citizenship.\n\n[This abstract](http://www.jstor.org/stable/2765544?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents) seeking to define **political revolutions** says this:\n\n>The term \"revolution\" is variously defined within and without the social science field. At least three distinct conceptions are discernible. Revolution as a political phenomenon.-Bodin, Small, Adams, Sorokin, Ross, Martin Dewe, Edwards, Webster, the Pauls, and Spargo appear to consider revolution ***a purely political phenomenon, a change in the location of sovereignty.*** Revolution as abrupt social change.-Le Bon and Ellwood suggest that the term includes any sudden or apparently sudden social change, so that political revolution is but one of several types. Revolution as change in the entire social order.-A third conception is that of change so drastic as to involve all phases of the social organization. Revolution may be political, but it has also religious, economic, industrial, and other aspects. Hyndman states this conception, and Summer, Parsons, and Finney appear so to use the term. Revolution a change in attitudes.-An explanation of such variation in the current conceptions of revolution appears in the fact that no writer has described revolution in its entirety. When normal social change is, for any reason. obstructed, there develops a widespread unrest which attaches itself to the most obviously offensive aspects of the social structure. ***The unrest and the collective behavior which often follows represent, to most writers, revolution.*** The more significant chages [sic] have, however, already occurred in the attitudes fundamental to the traditional institutional order.\n\nAt its most benign, a \"political revolution\" equates to regime change.  The academic consensus paints \"unrest\" and \"collective behavior\" as being defining traits.  When combined with \"mass movements\", this behavior can manifest violently.\n\n---\n\n**Questions**\n\n***Using available evidence, especially Sanders's own statements, as support***, how \"benign\" do you consider Bernie Sanders's candidacy to be?  Do you think the language he is using is purely rhetorical in that the above definitions are too literal to explain Sanders's positions?  Or, do you think that, especially given that he has been explicit that he believes mass movements need to foment ***after*** he is elected POTUS (and thus are not relevant to the electoral process), that he is engaging in something far beyond politics in a representative democratic setting?  Do you think he would advocate for violence?  How disruptive do you think a Sanders presidency would be for the United States?  How much change will be \"enough\" for Bernie Sanders?",

      "text": "In honor of the seventh birthday of /r/NeutralPolitics, the mods have asked me, a frequent poster, to make a post addressing one of the long-standing issues with submissions: most posts don’t get approved, and a few break the rules in such a way that they can’t be fixed. \n\nThe rules for /r/NeutralPolitics are [well laid out](https://www.reddit.com/r/NeutralPolitics/wiki/guidelines), and /u/huadpe did a great job making a [submission-tip-list last year](https://www.reddit.com/r/NeutralPolitics/comments/7u6j4f/meta_some_tips_for_composing_a_successful/), but if you’re like me, you probably don’t check the rules as you're making your post, or you do so sparingly. \n\nSo since /u/huadpe's post is so good (really the post is very specific and quite helpful - I suggest you check it out) and the rules so well laid out, I’m going to take a slightly different and more informal approach from last year: I have 3 general tips for help organizing questions and setting your expectations.\n\n**1: Figure out who said the thing**\n\nWhether you heard it at work/school or read it on the internet, there’s a good chance you first came across an interesting topic as:\n\n> “The left/right/Republicans/Democrats/scientists/ a conservative think tank/ a liberal economist, said...”\n\nAs you're laying out the background for the topic in your post, start by sourcing who introduced the topic. You don't necessarily need to give a specific name in in all cases, but I find starting with sources that correctly attribute where ideas came from helps organize the question with relevant background info. Including a source with the person who said something also tells their relative position within an organization and helps assess how serious a move or statement it is. \n\n**2: You're asking for explanations for things on the internet**\n\nDon’t ask for the impossible. The thing that /r/NeutralPolitics's commenters do best is synthesize multiple internet sources to provide a coherent answer to your narrow questions, but if your question doesn't require outside sources to answer, it's in the wrong place. If a poster can't answer a question with something on the internet, you might instead be seeking speculation or pure opinion from redditors.\n\n**3: Already approved posts offer great instructions for how to frame new topics**\n\nThe subreddit's [wiki page](https://www.reddit.com/r/NeutralPolitics/wiki/guidelines) does a great job covering the specifics of post submissions, but if you're still unsure about how to frame your question, simply look to recently approved posts. You can use approved posts to get a sense of how the subreddit's rules work in action, and then use the same language to frame your own question.\n\n----\n\nThanks to /u/nosecohn for help with this post. We want this to be an interactive thread so please ask the mods or me any questions you may have.\n\nThanks!",

      "text": "At the [2015 GLACIER conference in Alaska yesterday,](http://www.state.gov/r/pa/prs/ps/2015/07/245241.htm) President Obama made a speech on climate change ([transcript and video](http://www.ktuu.com/news/news/full-text-of-president-obamas-speech/35027560)). In it, he touted the efforts made so far to address the problem, but admonished all nations for \"not acting fast enough\" to avoid a catastrophic outcome. He continued, \"This year, in Paris, has to be the year that the world finally reaches an agreement to protect the one planet that we’ve got while we still can.\"\n\nWhat are the obstacles to an international deal being struck at [the Paris conference later this year?](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2015_United_Nations_Climate_Change_Conference) Which countries are the holdouts and what are their objections? Given our current understanding of the problem, what are reasonable reduction targets for carbon and other greenhouse gas emissions? If an agreement is struck that hits those targets, can we stop or reverse climate change, or is the idea just to diminish the worst effects? If a global deal is not struck, can individual agreements between nations, such as [last year's agreement between the US and China,](http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/everything-you-need-to-know-about-the-u-s-china-climate-change-agreement/) achieve enough carbon reduction to address the problem?\n\n*(Note: For the purposes of this discussion, I am assuming that [anthropogenic global climate change](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_warming) is real and happening. Reasonable people may disagree, but this post is not the place to debate that. I'm asking more about the political realities of making the proposed changes, whether or not you believe they're warranted.)*\n\n**Second note:** There's some early downvoting of comments here.

      "title": "For what real reasons are some members of the US political body and other Western countries (such as the UK and France) calling for intervention in Syria?",
      "text": "With the allegation that Assad forces are using chemical weapons and the [increasing number of refugees](http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/mar/10/syrian-refugees-could-triple-to-3m), the cry to push the US military to intervene in some manner has gotten louder. The Conservative government of Prime Minister David Cameron of the UK, the French government under President Hollande, and the Israelis have been quite vocal about the possibility of some form of intervention in Syria. Russia would like to prevent Western intervention and to see Assad's government prevail. However, what are the real geopolitical reasons that these various countries have invested in Syria?\n\nHere are some of my thoughts:\n\n* Israel: The continued war in Syria is driving more and more people out. There is now a major refugee problem in the neighboring countries. This can become a major anti-Israeli breeding ground. The inevitable poverty and destitution in these refugee camps may be funneled to act against Israel. A destabilized Syria could have a domino affect on other countries and Israel may suffer the consequences. The best case scenario would be for Assad to fall out of power and a pro-Western government rises. This would remove a long time enemy of Israel and decrease the influence of Iran in Middle Eastern politics. The downside is that the new government may not be very friendly to Israel. Stability above all is what Israel desires since they exist in a volatile region. \n* Iraq: Many of the [refugees fleeing to Iraq are Kurds](http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/08/26/us-syria-crisis-iraq-idUSBRE97P09G20130826). These Kurds have relocated to Northern Iraq, an area dominated by Kurds who have long called for the formation of an independent Kurdistan. Adding more Kurds into this region may potentially reignite this debate and fan the flames for the creation of some sort of Kurdish state. It would be in Iraq's interest to prevent an uprising of Kurdish nationalism. Already, there are [Iraqi Kurds who are coming to the aid of Syrian Kurds](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-23650894).\n* USA: It isn't in the interest of the US for Iraq to become even more divided, which could happen if more refugees pour into Iraq. A strong Iraq provides a counterbalance to Iran and provides a stable neighbor for Israel, Saudi Arabia, Jordan, and Turkey (who has its own significant Kurdish population). Moreover, if the Russians and Iranians were to lose influence in the region, it would be an added benefit. For the last decade or so, the US has been waging a global effort at weakening radical Islam. If Syria were to become more theocratic than it is currently under Assad, that would be a major failure in US foreign policy. Intervention to shape a non-Islamist state might be preferable although this would be difficult to pursue given current domestic attitudes. The US does not believe that Assad can come out on top without heavy handed methods, otherwise this conflict would have ended months ago (Gaddafi was able to nearly crush the Libyan rebels in a matter of weeks to months). The longer this conflict prolongs, the more likely it will pour over and affect American allies in the region. Additionally, the humanitarian problem is growing rapidly. This can become a major breeding ground for anti-Americansm and needs to be addressed soon. Because of how the Obama Administration worded its reasons for not intervening (chemical weapons being a red line), it may be forced to commit military resources or else it is opening itself up to criticism in the upcoming midterm elections. Having so many allies in the region, the US needs the Syrian civil war to come to an end soon so that the problem is contained. Lastly, I should also point out that the US being in the position that it is, it must contend with the demands and requests of all its allies. The problems that I highlighted about Israel in effect become the US' problems as well; likewise with everyone else.\n* Turkey: Agitating the Kurdish issue is not in their interest. Having Assad remain in power would probably have been preferable to a more populist government that might ensue since ethnic and religious tensions may flair up. Of the number of refugees fleeing to Turkey, [many are anti-Assad rebels](http://www.spiegel.de/international/world/turkey-fears-nato-action-will-spark-syrian-gas-attacks-a-918694.html). This is a powder keg slowly building up.\n* Jordan: A long time US ally, Jordan is currently housing the second largest number of refugees, just behind Lebanon. If more refugees continue to pour into Jordan, they will only face greater problems of all kind. It is in their interest to bring about a resolution of some kind so that the refugees can return home.\n* Russia: Syria has been in Russia's sphere of influence since the Cold War. Russia has several military treaties with Syria, the most significant one that I can recall off the top of my head is a [Russian naval base in Syria](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia%E2%80%93Syria_relations) to give Russia a Mediterranean presence. Additionally, Russia is a major arms provider to the current Syrian government. Another matter is that Russia is becoming more concerned about Assad's government falling and the new government becoming pro-West. The fall of Assad would almost certainly mean that Russia's footprint in the region would become much smaller. One of the long term strategies of Russia is to prevent Western encroachment on its sphere of influence, [which they perceive as an attempt to surround and weaken Russia](http://www.reuters.com/article/2011/04/27/oukwd-uk-russia-nato-idAFTRE73Q3GH20110427). Russia will likely do whatever it can to delay or prevent Western intervention. Additionally, [Russia is very wary of radical Islam, a prospect that might come to dominate Syria if Assad falls](http://consortiumnews.com/2012/06/26/what-russia-fears-in-syrian-conflict/). Whatever Assad's politics are, he has been able to keep a lid on the theocratic factions, something that the Russians would prefer. And lastly, Russia allowed the West to intervene in Libya which resulted in Russia losing significant political and economic investments (Russia had plans to [open up military bases in Libya](http://www.abc.net.au/news/2009-01-16/russia-plans-navy-bases-in-libya-syria-yemen-report/268898) and was [closely involved in Libya's oil production and defense acquisitions](http://oilprice.com/Geopolitics/Middle-East/Russia-Set-To-Lose-Billions-In-Libya.html)). Russia is not likely to allow the West to repeat this episode in Syria.\n* France: Syria used to be a French protectorate so France has a certain history in the region. Regional stability in Europe's near abroad is crucial. If Assad's government were to fall and the rebel factions gain power, France could potentially become more influential in this region. [As with Libya](http://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/sep/01/libya-oil), France could potentially open new markets and earn lucrative contracts with a new Syrian government. In matters of EU politics, France wishes to assert itself as the military power of Europe. It cannot compete with Germany when it comes to economic issues but it can definitely make it clear to the rest of Europe who leads military matters. Ensuring France's position within the EU is paramount as France has historically viewed itself as one of the leaders of Europe. With the talk of France declining in various manners, France asserting itself  would remind its EU partners of what it is able to do, to carve out a space whereby it can project its voice onto the global stage, and signal to its domestic audience France's history of promoting humanitarian missions to appeal to nationalist sentiments.\n* China: China has historically favored a hands off approach when it comes to dealing with the internal matters of other countries because it could potentially open themselves up to such matters (due to foreign intervention in China during the 19th century, they're skittish about such matters). Moreover, China has [close economic ties](http://nationalinterest.org/commentary/why-china-would-intervene-syria-7197) to the current Syrian government. Over the last several years, [China has been investing significant capital in Syria](http://www.thenational.ae/news/world/asia-pacific/chinas-influence-in-syria-goes-beyond-trade-boom) and has won numerous contracts. The removal of Assad's government may endanger China's economic activity there. A pro-Western government is not in China's interests. China is already anxious of the US expanding its influence in the Pacific and will not sit idly as the US potentially expands its influence even more greatly in the Middle East. Like Russia, China fears Western encroachment and encirclement as they view the West (the US in particular) as trying to hinder China's rise. Ideally, China would prefer no intervention and for Assad to come out on top. China also has fears about radical Islam (seeing as they have a significant Muslim population).\n* Saudi Arabia: Syria is a long time ally of Iran, an arch nemesis of Saudi Arabia. If Assad falls, Iran's influence in the region will be greatly weakened. It is in Saudi Arabia's interest to do whatever it can to prevent Iran from challenging Saudi Arabia's position. The Saudis already suspect Iran of fomenting dissent in Qatar, Yemen, and Bahrain, [all close Saudi allies](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peninsula_Shield_Force). In fact, [Saudi Arabia and Iran have been in a cold war](http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748704116404576262744106483816.html) of sort for the last decade or so. Also paramount to Saudi Arabia's long term security is the political stability of its neighbors. Any unrest nearby could potentially spill over into Saudi Arabia. For this reason, Saudi Arabia was angry at the US's support of the overthrow of Mubarak. Therefore, from the Saudi perspective, it is imperative to act soon to prevent greater destabilization of the region.\n* The UK: As with France, regional stability in Europe's near abroad is crucial. Replacing Assad with a pro-Western government is preferable to the current situation. Ideally, the UK would like for some kind of Libya scenario where Western forces force the collapse of the ruling government and the rebel forces quickly seize power. This resulted in the UK winning several lucrative contracts and new markets being opened for UK companies. Additionally, the UK being a long time ally of Israel, the removal of Assad would remove a thorn from Israel's side. Weakening Iran's and Russia's influence in the region can only benefit the Western/Arab coalition. The removal of Assad's government could also provide the UK with the opportunity to move in and influence the new government. An interesting alternative view may be that it is in the interests of the UK for the US to remain geopolitically strong. The UK has had a long history of being able to influence US foreign policy, to their advantage at times. If the region becomes destabilized, the US will certainly lose influence in the region and this will affect the UK's own influence. In terms of domestic politics, David Cameron has long been criticized as being weak. Being one of the loudest voices for Syrian intervention, Cameron could use Syrian intervention to boost his party's standing in the next general election and signal to the world that the UK is still a great power and an advocate of solving humanitarian problems.  \n* Germany: Long skittish about using its military, the [Germans would prefer to not be involved, especially with a parliamentary election](http://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/issue-of-possible-syria-intervention-becomes-campaign-issue-in-germany-a-918727.html) coming up soon. However, Germany realizes that if the civil war is not brought to a conclusion soon, the region may become more destabilized, not in the interest of anyone. Additionally, Germany has been a long time ally of Israel. A post-civil war scenario could potentially yield lucrative contracts for German companies and open markets. And lastly, if Assad's government were to fall, Germany would not want to be on the losing side. Geopolitically, Germany attempts to be neutral so that it can get its companies to win contracts abroad (as in Iran) but if forced to side, Germany will cooperate with the Western powers. It is important for Germany to appease both its domestic audience (who tends to be highly reactive) and its Western partners. Merkel's government was heavily criticized for not helping out in Libya; this resulted in significant [diplomatic damage with its Western partners](http://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/setback-for-franco-german-relations-paris-and-berlin-at-odds-over-libya-operation-a-752992.html). Germany is unlikely to be less involved as they were in Libya if some sort of intervention takes place.\n* Iran: A long time ally of Assad, Iran has significant influence in that region of the world. Iran would above all else want assurances of its security from Saudi Arabia and the US. However both countries are unlikely to acquiesce to Iranian demands and vice versa. Therefore, ensuring that Assad stays in power gives Iran additional bargaining chips against the Western-Arab coalition. \n\n-----\n\nRegarding the nuclear issue: The Western-Arab coalition cannot tolerate an Iranian state that can even potentially produce nuclear weapons as the benefits of such technology to Iran dramatically outweigh the costs and Iran does not feel that it will ever be secure if it does not acquire such technology. Libya has already demonstrated that giving up nuclear technology is not a means to long term security. In fact, had [Libya had that nuclear technology, the West may have shied away from attacking it](http://www.nytimes.com/2011/03/25/world/asia/25korea.html?_r=0). With North Korea acquiring their pseudo-nuclear weapons, they have been able to disproportionately increase their diplomatic maneuvering room. This is something that Iran would greatly desire and something that the Sunni Arab states would absolutely oppose. If Iran gains even the ability to make nuclear weapons, the Sunni states will be forced to pursue their own programs to maintain parity. This is the worst case scenario for the West: the Middle East and a nuclear arms race.\n\n-----\n\nIs this an accurate summary? What other reasons do these various players have in Syria?\n\nADDENDUM: One other issue which I did not address regarding the European powers is that of immigration. If these refugees cannot be repatriated to Syria, countries from abroad will have to take them in. The Europeans will be very reluctant to accept these refugees. The faster the Syria problem is resolved, the more easily the refugees can be repatriated. \n\nAlso, added some sources to spice it up.",

      "title": "What is the viability of a Centrist third party whose immediate political goals are focused on the Senate?",
      "text": "As I’m sure many of you can relate, I’ve been growing increasingly frustrated with the political gridlock arising from excessive polarization coming from both parties. I stumbled upon Charles Wheelan’s book, The Centrist Manifesto, (http://www.thecentristmovement.org/big-idea/) and he proposes an interesting method of battling the plague of partisanship. (Give this page a read for a more in-depth summary).\n\nThe basic premise is based around a Centrist Party that isn’t a halfway point between the two current parties, but rather one that builds off the best of the two parties’ core ideologies and leaves the extremist baggage behind.\n\nRelevant sections from The Centrist Manifesto:\n\n“After all, there is a lot to like about the Republicans: a belief in personal responsibility, a respect for markets and the forces of wealth creation, an understanding of the economic costs of taxation and regulation, and a healthy skepticism of what government can and cannot accomplish.\n\nAnd there is a lot to like about the Democrats: a concern for working people, a commitment to a strong social safety net, an impressive record of social tolerance, a long-standing concern for the environment, and a recognition that government can play a crucial role in protecting us from the most egregious abuses of capitalism.”\n\nRather than focusing on the House or the Presidency, Wheelan believes the most effective path for such a party is by obtaining around five “Centrist seats” in the Senate. Without a majority, both parties need to garner support from the Centrists in order to pass legislation.\n\nWheelan notes that, historically, America has not been particularly receptive to third parties, but these tend to be parties emerging from the political fringe or ones whose ideology is tied to single issues (e.g. Green Party). Such parties, he argues, are incapable of appealing to the moderate American population at large. When you consider the races to the political fringe which occur during political primaries and the subsequent race back to the center during the general election, Wheelan argues that this provides an interesting opportunity for moderates. Why tailor your party to ideas which are not necessarily successful in general elections? Instead, why not create a party that would be successful in a general election from the get-go, one that occupies the political middle and is built around pragmatism and compromise?\n\n**With America’s current winner take all voting structure, is such an infant party even viable today?**\n\n**Although such a party could potentially appeal to the “big, fat middle” of American voters, is this enough to overcome the challenges traditionally faced by third parties?**\n\n**EDIT:** There seems to be a lot of cynicism here. I'm just curious as to what people think a better option to a moderate third party would be. Right now, the current system is one large positive feedback loop. The more polarized the political environment gets, the less likely moderates are to get involved in the political process (and the more the system is left to be run by those with more extreme positions). Something like this doesn't look like its going to fix itself. \n\nWhen you just say \"nope, no chance something like this could work,\" what else is on the table? If not this, what then? I don't disagree that there are plenty of structural changes that would help the government operate better, but some of the suggestions here (e.g. abandoning the two current parties for state parties) don't seem remotely feasible. I agree with calls to \"change the rules\" by going to systems like IRV, but those sorts of reforms would be extremely slow moving compared to some kind of moderate grassroots movement. I'm happy to be proven wrong, but a \"radical center\" (even if a Centrist Party isn't the way it manifests itself) that energizes the middle actually sounds somewhat realistic. \n\nAlso, even if you disagree, I'd give the book a read, its short (only about 130 pages) and Wheelan is actually a pretty funny guy.",

      "text": "**Mod note:** We have been getting a large number of submissions on gun control related subjects due to [the recent shooting in Florida.](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/14/us/parkland-school-shooting.html)  This post is made on behalf of the mod team so that we can have a rules-compliant submission on the subject.\n\n---\n\nThe United States has [the highest rate of guns per capita in the world](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Estimated_number_of_guns_per_capita_by_country) at about 1 gun per resident, nearly twice as high as the next highest country, Serbia, which has about 0.58 guns per resident.\n\nThat number however masks a fairly uneven distribution of firearms.  [Roughly 32-42% of Americans report that they live in a household with guns,](https://www.cnn.com/2018/02/15/politics/guns-dont-know-how-many-america/index.html) though the only data we have come from surveys, and therefore there is a margin of error.\n\nBoth of the principal surveys showed that rates of gun ownership declined from the 1970s-1990s and have been about steady since.\n\nSurveys also estimate that among gun owners, the number of firearms owned is highly skewed, with a very small portion of the population (about 3%) [owning half of all firearms in the US.](https://qz.com/1095899/gun-ownership-in-america-in-three-charts/)\n\nThe US also has a very high rate of homicide compared to peer countries, and an about average suicide rate compared to peer countries.  [Firearm homicides in the US are much more common than all homicides in any peer country](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/how-u-s-gun-deaths-compare-to-other-countries/) however even US non-firearm homicides would put the US above any western country except the Czech Republic.  The total homicide rate of 5.3 per 100,000 is more than twice as high as the next highest (Czech) homicide rate of 2.6 per 100,000.\n\nThe US has a much higher firearm suicide rate than peer countries (6.3 per 100,000) but a fairly low non-firearm suicide rate, which puts the US about middle of the pack on suicides. (same source as above paragraph)\n\nGiven these differences, is there any good evidence on different measures relating to guns which have been effective in reducing violent crime, especially homicide, and suicide?  Are there any notable failures or cases where such policies backfired?",

      "title": "What Effect Does Institutional Neutrality Have on Politics?",
      "text": "As I've watched the increased divisiveness in US politics, I've become interested in historical and modern examples of institutional neutrality. I'm particularly interested in whether those examples have had a unifying effect on the underlying political system, haven't had much effect, or have caused disruption.\n\nPlease reply to this post with examples of institutional neutrality you are aware of and any documented effect of that neutrality. I will add one example to start us off:\n\nSpeaker of the House of Commons in the UK ([link](https://www.parliament.uk/business/commons/the-speaker/speaker-and-the-chamber/)): I was not initially aware that the UK had institutionalized complete neutrality in their Speaker of the House of Commons. The person who fills this office must resign from their political party and cannot be part of a political party for the rest of their life, even after retirement. They have relatively neutral rules on who can talk when. The speaker doesn't take part in debate or vote, except as a tie-breaker, but even then, there are a set of [rules](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speaker_Denison's_rule) they traditionally follow in order to maintain their relative neutrality.\n\nAs to whether the neutrality of the speaker is seen as unifying or disruptive, the claim is given (on the official speaker's website, so likely some bias there) that it is universally considered \"one of office's most important features - and most emulated or aspired to outside the UK.\" ([link](https://www.parliament.uk/about/living-heritage/evolutionofparliament/parliamentwork/offices-and-ceremonies/overview/the-speaker/procedures-and-impartiality/)) That site also claims this is accepted by all sides in the UK. I'm not terribly familiar with the effect of the neutrality on parliament, but I tend to believe that claim, considering I couldn't find any substantive sources online complaining about that neutrality or calling for non-neutrality of that office. I would be interested in folks from the UK discussing this from their better-informed position.\n\nPlease add any other examples you are aware of. I am especially curious about people from countries or localities listed on [this](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-partisan_democracy) Wikipedia page. Apparently those countries/localities have institutionalized non-partisan democracy to some extent.",

      "title": "[META] r/NeutralPolitics: passing 60k subscribers, new mods and some adjustments to the rules",
      "text": "Dear visitors to /r/NeutralPolitics,\n\nA few days ago, we passed **60,000 subscribers!**\n\nIt took us 18 months to get from 30k to 40k. It took us 11 months to get from 40k to 50k. And it took us 28 days to get from 50k to 60k. We're growing quickly.\n\nThat growth allows us to involve more people in the type of dialog we try to foster and to spread the message that it's actually possible to have productive and respectful political discussions on the internet.\n\nBut, as always, with growth comes risk. The mods don't have a reliable way to brief new visitors on the rules before they start participating, and sometimes we get a flood of comments that don't comply. That's where you all come in. We count on long-time users to *politely* remind others of the need for courtesy, good logic, sources to support assertions of fact, and the other comment rules in the sidebar.\n\nWe also rely on users to use the report button for comments that are in violation of the rules. This helps us find problems that we might never come across, because there's simply no way for mods to read every comment on every post.\n\nHowever, a situation has come up a couple times recently where someone has gone through another user's history and reported nearly all of his/her comments. **Please don't do this.** It creates a flood of unnecessary work for the mod team and it's just kind of crummy. If you think a particular user is frequently in violation of the rules or is negatively affecting the tone of dialog in the subreddit, just message the mods with your concerns and we'll look into it.\n\nThanks for all the great posts and comments lately! After our last big flood of users, it took the mods a few days to steer the ship back on course, but then we had some really great discussions; and they weren't all directly related to the US elections either.\n\nSpeaking of which, we always try to encourage more submissions on non-US issues, so if you've got any ideas, review the submission rules and put something up.\n\nNo matter what the topic of your post, mods will review it and help you bring it into compliance with the rules if necessary. *We want your post to succeed.*\n\n----\n\n## Rule changes\n\nThe [full set of rules and guidelines](https://www.reddit.com/r/NeutralPolitics/wiki/guidelines) for /r/NeutralPolitics is a constantly evolving document. We've recently instituted some changes that we want to let you know about:\n\n1) **No sarcasm.** We have long considered sarcastic comments to be outside the limits set by Rule 1 in the sidebar, but it wasn't explicitly prohibited. It now is.\n\n2) **Posts or comments on reddit are not considered acceptable sources.** Again, this restriction has long been part of the way we moderate, and if you read the [source quality requirements,](https://www.reddit.com/r/NeutralPolitics/wiki/guidelines#wiki_source_quality) it's clear that reddit comments don't meet them, but that was never explicitly stated. We've had an uptick lately in submissions that support their underlying premise with things OP has read elsewhere on reddit, so we decided to make this point absolutely clear.\n\n3) **Broadening the restriction on survey style questions.** The \"posts that will get removed\" section of the guidelines used to restrict:\n\n> *\"Survey\" style questions* that inherently cannot have a definitive answer, such as, \"Who are the most trustworthy politicians?\"\n\nThat has now been replaced with a broader restriction against:\n\n> Questions that cannot be answered with evidence or logic, which includes (but is not limited to) surveys and solicitations of pure opinion.\n\nThanks to /u/fuel_units for bringing the issue with the old wording to our attention.\n\n4) **No requests for speculation.** For a long time, the guidelines prohibited posts that were \"requests for speculation.\" As an experiment, we decided to allow them again under some narrow restrictions, but the resulting discussions have proven very problematic to moderate. Although counter-factual examinations are useful exercises for examining the potential outcome of policy, they are not suited to the evidence-based culture we try to foster on this subreddit. We have reverted the rule. Requests for speculation are once again prohibited: \n\n> Requests for speculation do not meet the standards, because there's no way to provide supporting evidence for answers to \"What would happen if...?\"\n\n----\n\n## New mods!\n\nAs the subscriber base expands, so must the mod team.\n\n/u/huadpe joined us about a month ago and has proven invaluable in instituting some of the changes you've seen. In the last couple weeks, we've also added /u/402ndtry, /u/hwagoolio and /u/pepperonifire to the team.\n\nIt's great to have them all here!\n\n------\n\n\nAs always, user feedback is welcome and encouraged. Thanks for helping us keep /r/NeutralPolitics great.",

      "text": "This whole conversation stems from a TED talk (edit: on suggestion of the mods - [it can be found here](http://www.ted.com/talks/michael_sandel_the_lost_art_of_democratic_debate.html)) I saw in which the speaker insisted that the debates we see in politics today are just dressed up philosophical debates that were being considered by Plato and Aristotle, and that  the way to get back to effective political discourse rather than just mudslinging was to acknowledge these fundamental debates and have them instead, instead of having proxy-war debates over every practical issue.\n\nI think the speaker rather misses a central point here though. The reason we're still having the same fundamental debates is because **there is no right answer**.  \n\nWhile I don't want any specific debate to be the central topic here (I'm talking more about political debate in general), take the recent example of whistleblowing on intelligence services.  At a very fundamental level, this is a debate about which of two values is more important - liberty versus national security.  When I last brought this up in /r/NeutralPolitics, it was interesting to see how many people (I can only assume Americans) automatically assumed they had the factually correct answer here - that national security is irrelevant compared to liberty and/or freedom of the press. The truth is that we are often so blind to our own value systems that we presume they are correct automatically.\n\n*(NB: I'm not saying that Edward Snowden was a serious risk to national security.  I'm not saying the NSA helps national security.  I'm not saying I value national security over freedom of the press.  And yes, I've heard the Benjamin Franklin quote.  Just because it sounds nice and intellectual to say doesn't mean it's right. I just want to shut down those lines of conversation before they start.)*\n\nWe have many examples of value debates at the core of politics; for example, the right to life of a foetus vs the right to freedom of choice of the mother in the case of abortion, or, a very major one, the right to equality vs the right to liberty with regards to redistributive taxation.  There are many other debates that have long since died, in the western world at least, such as over the right of the governed to a say in that governing, but that isn't because we decided it was *correct*.\n\nNone of these debates have a right answer that can be reached.  How can they ever end? Well, some value debates are no longer matters of contention in the Western world, but by and large that's only because we've come to a consensus on them. They aren't settled with any kind of permanence.\n\nI think we really need to just accept some of these facts. Some debates will not and cannot be settled.  But what are the repercussions of that?\n\nWell, let's dig down a bit deeper. The essential problem is the is-ought distinction which states that there is a separation between facts about the world and statements about how the world should be which is uncrossable.  I can't look at the world and use that to tell you how things should be.  At least, that's my personal position. I think we should assume it to be correct for the purpose of this debate - I'm happy to have the moral naturalism debate but I don't think this is the right place.\n\nWe can catch values out when they seek to intrude onto the real world in the form of facts - for example, if we say that we wan the best economy or if either side claims their model provides it then we can try to do research about what kind of tax model gives the best economic results and get an actual answer.  But at that point either side can retreat to the world of value and say \"personal liberty/equality is more important than economic growth\" and we're back to square one.\n\nMy question is this - given these value debates can never really be resolved, what effect does that have on politics?",

      "text": "Hi all. I had a question I was hoping some could take a swing at. As I get older (38 now), I am finding it harder and harder to fit my political leanings into a box. I also think I'm not alone, as many people I know are nearly identical to me in their political beliefs. I understand that the 2 US parties aren't the full view of the political spectrum. I have studied papers about Anarchism, Socialism, Libertarianism, Communism, and many other isms. However, I don't seem to fit into any of those. I would like to lay out my main political beliefs, and if you could tell me if I fit any \"ism\" you have heard, I would greatly appreciate it.\n\nNote: I have at times considered myself a libertarian, liberal, and at one point an establishment conservative. But, I tend to have real issues with each of those groups as I try to square up my feelings and their tenets. I have even heard of \"South Park Conservatives\". Not sure if I feel like I line up with that either.\n\nCommence brain dump!\n\n* Pro-choice. I don't think my wife and I would ever get an abortion, our personal choice, but I think that other women should be able to choose for themselves.\n* Pro-gay rights. They should all be able to marry. The world can always use more love, and equal treatment should be built into our laws.\n* Atheist, but not hostile to religion. I was raised religious, but am no longer. However, I'm not bitter about it. I get that religion plays an important social role for people (community) and that it is a place to celebrate milestones in life like birth, marriage, death. I also think it can be horribly harmful. Like any \"tool\" it has its uses for some, and can be abused by others. I choose not to partake, but can't get into the circlejerk that is /r/atheist.\n* Pro-environment, when well established and prudent science is there to back it up. Call me a \"skeptical environmentalist\". I love the beauty all around us. I hunt and fish, and therefore want to protect the natural world that is the habitat for us all. But, environmental regulations can be overkill when done based on emotion rather than science.\n* I think everyone in America should have medical insurance that isn't tied to their employment. I understand why this happened, but I don't believe it is the correct way to do it. Medical care should be universal. It is the right thing to do. It should be high quality, and everyone should simply get it.\n* I think everyone in America should have a government based pension, based mainly on contributions you have to make. Like social security, but more comprehensive. Americans, by and large, are horribly bad at saving for retirement. This will cause a crisis in the future in this country, as most of us don't save enough to support ourselves. If we were required to save more, then we would be in a better position as a whole. If my neighbor decides to buy fancy cars instead of saving, I will end up having to bail him out with my taxes. I don't think that is right, especially if I was prudent and didn't buy fancy cars. Nothing against fancy cars. If you can affort both, great. I just don't agree that I should have to subsidize his reckless behavior.\n* Government sponsorship of programs if they are for the common good, and don't make business sense for private industry to do. This applies not only to civil services (police, fire) but also to things like studying disease epidemics and how we as a nation should respond, including researching drugs for major issues that would require a huge capital outlay to fund privately and therefore isn't done in the private sector.\n* All education in public schools should be completely free. That includes colleges/universities. I also think all school food, including breakfast, should be free at the schools. The last thing a child should be worried about is how to study when they haven't had a decent breakfast. Also, we would make more progress as a country if anyone could go to college without getting into debt for tuition, books, etc. All of that should be free, all the way up to a terminal degree, if attended at public institutions.\n* Higher attention/prestige paid to the field of education. Teachers should be highly trained, paid well, and it should be looked at with the same prestige as a doctor or lawyer.\n* I think businesses should be able to decide for themselves many of the rules we regulate. Don't want to serve minorities? Your choice, but your reputation will precede you, and you can't be mad when people stop going (nowadays any business acting like that would get immediate online attention and reaction). Want to allow people to smoke in your bar? Go ahead. It is your bar. But, if it leads to a drop in business as non-smokers head to voluntarily smoke free bars, you may reconsider.\n* Pro marijuana legalization. Although I am wary of the \"War on Drugs\", I get why as a society we wouldn't want to legalize drugs that can wipe out towns (Watch the documentary Oxyana. So depressing). However, lighter drugs like marijuana are so not the problem, and should be allowed.\n* I am EXTREMELY skeptical of most government programs that fall outside the lines of what I have just stated above. My views sometimes make me look like a pissy conservative, but so be it. In the end, we should have a comprehensive fundamental system of education, equality, retirement, health care, and science-backed environmental protection. Most other programs seem to me like pork barrel projects to buy a politician's re-election. In this vein, I am usually labelled a conservative, even though my family considers me a liberal. I am for self responsibility, but want to make sure the path to a successful life (education and healthcare) is as free from obstacles as possible. I think you should be able to spend your money on whatever you want, but guard rails to ensure you will not overly burden others if you get sick (and that you are taken care of, to give a more compassionate perspective) and that you can retire without huge financial issues.\n\nSo, what do you all think? What the hell am I? I seem to line up with a lot of Scandinavian people's views. Generally conservative with money, but with great government programs that seem logical to me.\n\nThanks for listening. I am interested in your responses.",

We will be evaluating the candidates over the coming days and make an announcement soon.**\n\n----\n\nSince the last time we brought on new moderators, just four months ago, the number of total subscribers to /r/NeutralPolitics is up 25%. That growth has created the need to once again expand the mod team, so if you're interested in helping us out, please read on.\n\n**Here are the requirements:**\n\nFirst, you need to have time. /r/NeutralPolitics is a heavily moderated subreddit and moderating it requires a time commitment. Plan to check in multiple times a day. Some days there won't be much to do, but others you'll have to spend up to an hour reading posts and messaging people. For our regulars, that's probably close to their participation pattern anyway, but applicants should understand that moderators are expected to pull their weight. \n\nSecond, you need to understand and agree with the underlying philosophy of our subreddit, as outlined in our mission statement:\n\n>We're building an environment where political ideas can be exchanged in a safe, smart and neutral way. This is a community where evidence and open-mindedness are valued above all. In /r/NeutralPolitics, we try to learn about opposing positions and see their merits, possibly even changing our opinions in the process. Posts and comments that lack these important qualities will be removed.\n\nFinally, applicants should be familiar with the [guidelines](https://www.reddit.com/r/NeutralPolitics/wiki/guidelines) (or at least be willing to put the time into a cram session learning them). The guidelines are the rules of the subreddit, and understanding them is crucial to moderating effectively.  \n\n**Responsibilities include:**\n\n* Policing comments for compliance with the guidelines\n* Fielding feedback from users\n* Soliciting opinions of other mods when you're unsure what action to take\n* Joining discussions with other mods about ways to improve the subreddit\n\nIf you are interested in joining /r/NeutralPolitics mod team, please [message us](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FNeutralPolitics) with a brief explanation of why you'd be a good fit.\n\nThanks and we look forward to hearing from you!\n\nCheers,\n\nThe NeutralPolitics Mod Team\n\n----\n\n**EDIT:** Please include your *time zone* in your application message. Please do *not* include your political leanings. We don't care about that stuff. You just need to be able to enforce the rules even-handedly.",

He than goes on about the theory on political ignorance and the reasons why people are irrational about politics. He ends up by explaining some signs that might indicate that you are irrational about political issues and by citing the following references:\n\n* [The Myth of the Rational Voter, by Bryan Caplan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Myth_of_the_Rational_Voter)\n* [Why People Are Irrational About Politics](http://spot.colorado.edu/~huemer/irrationality.htm)\n\nThe second reference is his personal essay about the topic.\n\nHe did a quick hands up test during the presentation to gauge how politically informed his audience was. He asked:\n\n* How many of you know who your congressman is?\n* How many of you think that you can identify the last vote that he [your congressman] made in congress?\n\nCan you answer those questions? Do you think that you personally are irrational about politics? What about other people around you? Do you think irrationality is a problem in politics?\n\nEDIT: Adding the wikipedia link for the book reference",

      "text": "You can call me a cynic, but these are the conclusions that I've come to. I will try to keep it as organized and rant-free as possible, but please be patient with me. That being said, this won't be upvoted for anybody to see anyway, so who cares.\n\n**The people who are in charge of this country don't want to fix it**\n\nWe have a whopping two ideologies to choose from out of an entire political spectrum. Why is this?\n\nNobody makes policy for the good of the country anymore. They can't. It's all about making money for your next campaign. Republicans are in bed with oil, Democrats are in bed with the pharmaceutical and healthcare industries, and every other large corporation and industry in between lobbies on both sides. You want to change the system? You can't. The only way to get into power is to come up through one of the two major parties because the parties contribute to financing the campaign and their support is needed to win. (See Ron Paul). So who actually makes the policy? It depends on who has the largest check book.\n\n**Politicians take advantage of a population that is consistently and progressively becoming more and more ignorant and/or apathetic..**\n\nLook at what's going on in the media right now. Both candidates are talking about the economy. There are other issues, but more on that later. On one side you have the Republicans talking about their budget that they've made and criticizing the president for not having a plan. Meanwhile, the Republican side has revealed no specifics about their budget and the majority of the populous is too stupid to realize that as the president of the country, you already have a budget as is. If that is their only plan to fix things in terms of jobs and the economy, it won't help. Personal debt is a much more significant factor than the national debt in how far the economy has fallen.\n\n\nEDIT: *People being in debt leads to less money being invested in the economy and less faith in the economy. Low faith in the economy results in lesser investment in government bonds which leads to a greater rate in our debt being bought up, thus causing higher inflation. In other words, although a larger national debt leads to inflation and currency depreciation, a large amount of personal debt within the economy only accelerates the process. If the internal economy was healthy, it could help hinder it. In addition, private debt undermines supply side economics due to the government's inability to mandate where stimulus money is spent (as it should be). As a result, that money goes into paying off personal debt as opposed to, let's say, a small or growing business that would take that money and use it to expand and further grow the economy.*\n\n You would think that Obama would point this out, right? No. Instead, he's asking why Romney made a birther joke. Do you know how much policy that affects? None. Not an iota. Meanwhile, the people are completely buying into each side bashing the other and nobody seems to realize that *if each side just talks about who they aren't, what's wrong with the other side, and what they wouldn't do, there is NO motivation to change ANYTHING.* Every promise will already have been fulfilled just for being who they are because the only promise that was made was to not be the other guy. It's a perpetual cycle of bullshit.\n\n\n**The media has no integrity anymore**\n\nThis is obviously on a relative scale to how things used to be. Everything is based on ratings. Everything. It determines you budget for your programs and your resources as a result. What happens when you mix what should be an objective presentation of information with a desire to be entertaining? Two things: First, you get sensationalism on every single story and issue. This makes it easy for politicians. They can bring up one issue for an entire election season and have these news networks go on and on about it. They run on planks instead of platforms now. Obviously platforms are developed at each convention, but they are only guidelines and how many citizens out there are really educated or interested enough to know or care? Second, you get subjective viewpoints from people which sways the news in one direction with a massive amount of bias. This is how we get networks like Fox News and MSNBC. Eventually, that bias gets so mixed in with the sensationalism that it's just lie after lie after lie. Just look at Fox during the healthcare debate or MSNBC on Romney's companies. How do people fulfill their duty to be informed when news outlets are all swayed to one radical viewpoint and the politicians all spin in the same way? And this is just assuming that these people are intelligent enough to recognize it and care enough to want to.\n\n\n**People keep saying what's wrong but nobody says how to fix it.**\n\nThis is the most tiresome part of politics. It happens in the news. It happens in the house. It happens in the senate. It happens on this sub. Well I'm going to provide a few points of reform to fix these issues:\n\n**1. Exclusively public financing of campaigns.**\n\nI'd say that we cut out the middle man, but corporations don't speak for us either. Now, candidates have to actually campaign on issues instead of special interests. Corporations aren't people, and even if they were, it wouldn't matter anymore. Not to mention the fact that more limited funds for campaigning would make candidates use their money more wisely.\n\nCurrently in this country, 1% of the population holds 35% of the wealth. Congress is composed 50/50 of people within and outside of this 1% group. That's completely disproportional. By doing this, we can put the common man in power so that this Aristocracy stops forming. It will also allow for third parties to get more involved instead of just being a distraction.\n\n**2. Ban negative ads.**\n\nCrazy, right? What else is there? Now we can actually hear each candidates ideas on how to fix things instead of why the other guy won't. And I know, it would never work, right? My philosophy: If Mexico can do it, then why the hell can't we?\n\nEDIT: Has been addressed several times. See other comments please.\n\n**3. Eliminate the ratings system for media outlets.**\n\nReplace it with something else. Keep it private, but base it off of accuracy of information instead of how entertaining it is. Fox News is the top rated news network on cable, but according to several polls, those that subscribe to it are consistently the most uninformed citizens out there. \n\nWhat does that tell you?\n\n**4. Eliminate the electoral college.**\n\nThe electoral college is an archaic part of our system that was around back when counting the popular vote was implausible. What's more? The people that vote \"for us\" are all people that were involved in somebody's campaign. If you can count our votes, do so. Period.\n\n**5. Hold congressional elections every four years offsetting the presidency, and create term limits of 2 or 3.**\n\nThis is a good idea for a few reasons: First, people undervalue the power of congress, especially during a presidential election year. Though it is limited, there is more variety in congressional political viewpoints, and this should be fostered. If congressional elections are not overshadowed by the presidential elections, people should pay more attention to them. Furthermore, congress has substantially more power to make significant changes to the things that we want to change in government than the president does. The federal branch is nothing more than a tool to enforce what the legislative branch decides. By ensuring that terms are four years long, we will avoid repeating the cycle of one year of action and one year of campaigning. Term limits also foster a better work ethic and motivation to get things done.\n\n**6. Make philosophy a core subject in our school systems.**\n\nI firmly believe that this is the only way to save our next generation. We teach our children logic and we give them the ability to distinguish objective and subjective information. They will be able to reason things and come up with ideas in an intelligent manner, and they will pass this on to their kids. This is a very minor change to our educational system relative to what we need, but it's a start.\n\nThis is just what I see and think. If you disagree, that's fine. I just really hope that we're at a point where you can at least read this and consider it before you bury it though. If you really read all of this, thank you for your time.\n\n[/initial post]\n\nSince posting this, I've had some other ideas too, but I just wanted to see some intelligent discussion on what I've already got to make sure that it wasn't just people's bias getting in the way of discussing them the first time.\n\n**Edit:** For those who have not seen it, I have accepted that the second point on this list is a direct violation of the first amendment. The first point is too. That being said, if anybody else has a way to try to get to the same point by different means, I would be very happy to hear it. Just because I don't have an answer doesn't mean that I'm not still opening to finding one.",

In spite of a good rate of growth and a constant influx of new users, we’re glad to see lots of great threads being posted by the userbase on a regular basis. More importantly, the NeutralPolitics community has been doing a fantastic job of fostering good discussion on a consistent basis, so the mod team wants to thank every one of you Neutrons for making our community so great! When this sub was original founded over three years ago, the moderators had a vision of an evidence-based, balanced and respectful forum for political discussion. As of today, we believe that at least part of this goal has been achieved.\n\nBut as is true for any growing subreddit, we’re worried that as our userbase expands that the quality of the community will eventually decline. Several moderators have already expressed concerns on this matter, and we recently had to add three new moderators to deal with the growing moderation workload. While the community is usually exemplary, there have been instances where we have had to delete entire threads because discussion had degenerated to an uncomfortable level, and we fear that these problems will only get worse. Most significantly, we are concerned that while the community is certainly respectful and constructive in its discussion, standards for evidence and rigour of responses have not been at the level we hope for them to be. So as NeutralPolitics approaches 50,000 subscribers, we are coming to you, the community, for feedback and advice!\n\nCurrently, there are several proposals on the table that have been floating around modmail for some time:\n\n* *Drafting of a new rule requiring all top level comments to contains sources, with more free discussion allowed in child comments;*\n\n* *Introducing weekly “casual” stickies to allow some more relaxed interaction in the community while keeping ordinary threads more strictly moderated;*\n\n* *Inviting knowledgeable users from other parts of reddit to comment on topics they are familiar with.*\n\nSo let us know what you think! Do you have any ideas on how to maintain or improve the quality of our great community? Are the proposals already on the table any good, or how can they be improved? How can we best encourage our community to remain constructive and respectful while encouraging evidence and rigour to be central to discussions? And what are your general thoughts on the direction of the subreddit as a whole?\n\nAnd as always, rock on you Neutron stars. Rock on.\n\n-**Your NeutralPolitics Moderators**",

The compact currently has 172 electoral votes in 11 states, and more states will hold votes to join. Is this constitutional? What power do states have over their chosen electors?",
      "text": "Several states have banded together to effectively overturn the [Electoral College](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Electoral_College) through passage of the [National Popular Vote Interstate Compact](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Popular_Vote_Interstate_Compact).\n\nCurrently representing [172 electoral votes in 11 states and the District of Columbia](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2019/02/26/popular-vote-could-decide-presidential-election-if-these-states-get-their-way/?noredirect=on&utm_term=.13ea77579088), the Popular Vote Compact would de-facto turn national Presidential elections into a popular vote should states representing 270 electoral votes join.\n\n---\n\nIn practice, the way this would work is your state electors would go to the winner of the national popular vote instead of your state vote.\n\n**For example, if you live in California and a Democrat won the state popular vote 57%-43%, the Democrat would typically be given the whole 55 electoral votes California has.**\n\n**In this new system, California would look to the winner of the national popular vote. If California still voted 57%-43% for a Democrat and the national vote was 51%-49% in favor of a Republican, the state would give their 55 votes to the Republican.**\n\n---\n\nOn the mechanism (from 2nd source):\n\n> The compact would modify the way participating states implement Article II, Section 1, Clause 2 of the U.S. Constitution, which requires each state legislature to define a method to appoint its electors to vote in the Electoral College. The Constitution does not mandate any particular legislative scheme for selecting electors, and instead vests state legislatures with the exclusive power to choose how to allocate their states' electors (although systems that violate the 14th Amendment, which mandates equal protection of law and prohibits racial discrimination, would be prohibited). States have chosen various methods of allocation over the years, with regular changes in the nation's early decades. Today, all but two states (Maine and Nebraska) award all their electoral votes to the candidate with the most votes statewide (the \"winner-take-all\" system).\n\nOn enactment (from the 3rd source):\n\n> “When we hit 270, all these bills take effect simultaneously. Then there’s a pool of 270 electoral votes that’s going to go to whomever gets the most votes in all 50 states,” Koza added.\n\n\n---\n\nSomewhat relevant, [the United States has been willing to move towards direct elections in the past](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seventeenth_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution), at least in the case of Senators.\n\n---\n\nI have a couple of questions:\n\n1: Is this constitutional? When and where will this be determined if it's not?\n\n2: States aren't exactly getting rid of their electoral votes - they're just writing legislation that changes the prerogative of their electors. What power do states have over their electors?",

      "text": "Today House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Judiciary Committee Chairman Nadler [announced](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/10/us/politics/trump-impeachment-articles.html) the introduction of articles of ompeachment against President Donald Trump.\n\n[Those articles of impeachment are available here.](https://judiciary.house.gov/sites/democrats.judiciary.house.gov/files/documents/Articles%20of%20Impeachment.pdf) (PDF)\n\nThere are two articles.  I will briefly excerpt the core allegations from each:\n\n* **Article I: Abuse of Power**\n\n>Using the powers of his high office, President Trump solicited the interference of a foreign government, Ukraine, in the 2020 United States Presidential election. He did so through a scheme or course of conduct that included soliciting the Government of Ukraine to publicly announce investigations that would benefit his reelection, harm the election prospects of a political opponents, and influence the 2020 United States Presidential election to his advantage. President Trump also sought to pressure the Government of Ukraine to take these steps by conditioning official United States Government acts of significant value to Ukraine on its public announcement of the investigations. President Trump engage in this scheme or course of conduct for corrupt purposes in pursuit of personal political benefit. In so doing, President Trump used the powers of the Presidency in a manner that compromised the national security of the United States and undermined the integrity of the United States democratic process.  He thus ignored and injured the interests of the Nation.\n\n* **Article II: Obstruction of Congress**\n\n>The House of Representatives has engaged in an impeachment inquiry focused on President Trump's corrupt solicitation of the Government of Ukraine to interfere in the 2020 United States Presidential election. As part of this impeachment inquiry, the Committees undertaking the investigation served subpoenas seeking documents and testimony deemed vital to the inquiry from various Executive Branch agencies and offices, and current and former officials.  \n\n>In response, without lawful cause or excuse, President Trump directed Executive Branch agencies, offices, and officials not to comply with those subpoenas. President Trump thus interposed the powers of the Presidency against the lawful subpoenas of the House of Representatives, and assumed to himself the functions and judgments necessary to the exercise of the \"sole Power of Impeachment\" vested by the Constitution in the House of Representatives.\n\nThe articles then proceed to describe the means by which the alleged actions were undertaken.  \n\n\n\n*  Are the factual claims in the two articles of impeachment supported by evidence from testimony, documentation, or other sources?  Is there any countervailing evidence that shows them to be in doubt?\n\n* Are the legal claims in the two articles of impeachment accurate? Do they comport with past cases of impeachment, criminal law, or other sources of law?\n\n---\nMod footnote: I am submitting this on behalf of the mod team because of the very high level of interest in the subject.  We will be very strictly moderating the comments here, especially concerning not allowing offtopic comments or unsourced or unsubstantiated speculation.",

I do my research and I want people to know I do my research. I have opinions, but they are based in research as much as possible.\n\nI really want to be more open and more engaged the opposing view to mine. I've been through some pretty fundamental shifts in my views when I've read up on things and taken time out to really contemplate them. So I want to know more about the right, so perhaps I can broaden my personal politics, and also answer and engage better in political debate.\n\nThanks!  \n\n\nEdit: Edited to comply with the moderators request to remove personal political views.

That will be signed very soon.”\n\nThe Washington Post [sought comment from Cynthia Miller-Idriss](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2019/03/02/trump-says-new-executive-order-could-strip-colleges-funding-if-they-dont-support-free-speech/?noredirect=on&utm_term=.51af49457a05), an associate professor of education at American University.

For example, she said, the U.S. government imposes ethical guidelines on studies involving human subjects.\n\n---\n\nI have a couple of questions:\n\n1: How many Colleges and Universities seek Federal research money? Specifically, what percentage of Universities and Colleges seek Federal research money?\n\n2: The written order has not yet been released, so there's some ambiguity to what \"support free speech\" means, but the President left little ambiguity that he believes there is a free speech problem on America's campuses. \n\nWhat specifically have Colleges and Universities done to limit free speech? Is this a new occurrence? Have they stated why they are doing it?",

In addition, he said his statement could serve as an example to others not to do the same.\n\n> CNN reserves the right to publish his identity should any of that change.\n\nMany are claiming that [this is blackmail](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-intersect/wp/2017/07/05/the-reddit-user-behind-trumps-cnn-meme-apologized-but-cnnblackmail-is-the-story-taking-hold/)\n\nSo: Is it blackmail?

      "text": "We are getting a ton of questions about the AHCA and so we have decided to make a megathread on the subject.\n\nA few basic Q&As to start:\n\n**What is the AHCA?**\n\nIt is the [healthcare bill](https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/house-bill/1628) the Republican leadership in Congress has proposed to replace Obamacare.\n\n**What does it do?**\n\nLots of stuff.  [Here's an article on the version of the bill first put forward in March.](https://insight.kellogg.northwestern.edu/article/a-healthcare-policy-expert-on-four-key-differences-between-the-aca-and-the-ahca)\n\n**What are the recent amendments to it?**\n\nThere have been a couple of amendments to the bill in the last few days.  The big ones are:\n\n* [The MacArthur Amendment](http://www.politifact.com/florida/article/2017/apr/28/politifacts-guide-gop-amendment-health-care-bill/) which would allow states to opt out of some essential health benefits requirements, as well as the requirement that insurers not charge more for people with pre-existing conditions.\n\n* The [Upton Amendment](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/03/us/politics/gop-eyes-8-billion-addition-to-win-a-crucial-vote-to-the-latest-health-bill.html) which provides $8 billion in additional funding over 5 years, with the intention that it be used for \"high risk pools\" for persons with pre-existing conditions.\n\n**What's going on with it now?**\n\nHouse leadership is currently planning a vote on the bill today.  If it passes, it would move to the Senate.\n\n**Edit 1:26 PM EDT** The New York Times is reporting a vote is expected around 1:30 PM.  [They have a live tracker of how members are voting here.](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/05/04/us/politics/house-vote-republican-health-care-bill.html)\n\nThe House of Representatives has a livestream available at [houselive.gov](http://houselive.gov/)\n\n**Edit: 1:59 PM** The House is currently voting on [HR 2192](https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/house-bill/2192) which would change a provision which had exempted members of Congress from the MacArthur Amendment.  It currently looks to be passing easily with support from Republicans and Democrats.\n\n\nThe AHCA vote is scheduled next I believe.\n\n**2:11 PM** THE VOTE IS ON.\n\n**2:19 PM** The AHCA has been passed by the House by a vote of 217-213.  \n\n\n\n---\n\nThis is a reminder in the comments to **please provide sources** for anything you're saying.  Even if your question is something like \"I heard X about the bill, is that true?\" Please link to where you heard X so people can see the context etc.\n\nBecause this is a megathread on a controversial issue, we will be stricter than usual on comment moderation.  And usual is pretty strict.  So please keep your comments civil, substantive, and well sourced.",

Moderators will be transcribing live, so we ask for patience as we will do our best to capture as many substantial, relevant and verifiable claims as we can. AutoMod will remove all top level comments not by mods.\n\n***USER REPLIES TO TOP LEVEL COMMENTS***\n\nUsers (you) can reply to the stated claims by laying out the related facts and [linking to qualified sources](https://www.reddit.com/r/NeutralPolitics/wiki/guidelines#wiki_sources), but **we discourage those replies from judging the veracity of the claim**. Leave that determination to the readers.\n\nSo, instead of stating whether a claim is \"true\" or \"false,\" a good a second level response would be something like, \"Candidate A seems to be referring to this study [source], which has been called into question by some experts [source].\"\n\n*Second level comments without links will be summarily removed.*\n\n***DISCUSSION BETWEEN USERS***\n\nUsers can then reply to each other in third-level comments and below.\n\n---\n\nPlease remember that /r/NeutralPolitics rules still apply and all participants should adhere to the standards you have asked us to enforce.

      "text": "Amidst high levels of violence, directed at both politicians and civilians, Pakistan [held an election](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2018/07/pakistan-elections-2018-latest-updates-180724055555410.html) that seems to indicate Imran Khan's PTI has won, albeit not a majority. This opens the possibility of a civilian-to-civilian transfer of power, which has been infrequent in Pakistani history.\n\nThere exist opinions that this victory was influenced by the decisions of Pakistan's powerful military. Shamila Chaudhary, who was an official under the Obama administration and now is an adviser at Johns Hopkins, [describes](https://www.npr.org/2018/07/27/632673383/opinion-imran-khan-has-declared-victory-in-pakistans-election-but-the-military-w?t=1532734461945): \n\n>But the legitimacy of Khan's government will undoubtedly be questioned for the duration of his tenure. Ironically, in shaping the political environment to favor Khan, the establishment has effectively handicapped its own candidate.\n\n>With Sharif's party sidelined and Khan having to defend his legitimacy, the establishment has taken a page out of a playbook from the 1990s, when the military would pit politicians against each other to ensure weak coalition governments wouldn't unify against military influence. This era ended in 1999, when Musharraf ousted Sharif in a military coup.\n\n>The return to 1990s-style party politics has ushered in a backsliding of Pakistan's democratic culture, which begs the question: Could it also eventually lead to another coup? The makings of it are already underway, with Pakistan's politicized judiciary, compromised media, an exhausted and untrusting electorate, and a fractured political elite.\n\nPakistan is one of numerous states that have experienced cycles of civilian rule and military coups. Turkey [has had several](https://eu.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2016/07/15/turkey-military-coup-history/87153106/), including a failed one in 2016. [One study found 475 attempted coups](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2016/07/22/map-the-world-of-coups-since-1950/?utm_term=.9cb00a51d2b6) worldwide since 1950, with about half succeeding- though not all coups are conducted by the military.\n\n**How have states dealt differently with this instability and the balance between military and civilian power?** Some states have had decades since their last coup, others have had them in the last few years. There is a process whereby militaries can have expanded or limited powers, with varying levels of success. An example is in Indonesia, where the military has historically had its own business holdings that provided revenue independent of the national budget. The [process of civilian regulation is complicated and incomplete](http://jakartaglobe.id/archive/whats-the-indonesian-militarys-business/).",

      "text": "*Note that this is mostly a US-centric point of view, but all viewpoints are welcome*\n\nFor example, the [World's Smallest Political Quiz](http://i.imgur.com/jpR4FSn.jpg) has a 2-dimensional scale, **economic freedom and social freedom** (the labels are a bit weird on this image, but it should be obvious what it's talking about).  \n\nThen there's [political compass](http://i.imgur.com/Cpry7.png), which uses **left vs. right and libertarian vs. authoritarian**, where the definition of \"libertarian\" is non-US-centric, so it's kind of like the world's smallest political quiz rotated 45 degrees.\n\nThere are also \"Which party do you belong to?\" quizzes, but I find those are the most uninteresting due to the one-dimensional nature of the results.\n\nHowever, I was thinking that there would be a better way to describe  political beliefs, such as dividing social and economic into multiple parts each, and perhaps taking foreign policy into consideration.\n\nFor example,\n\n1. Social - Substances and lifestyle choices (e.g., drugs, sex, gambling)\n\n2. Social - Other freedoms (speech, obscene depictions, protest)\n\n3. Social - Privacy & due process (e.g., wiretapping, warrants, juries)\n\n4. Economic - Regulatory (e.g., minimum wage, health permits, carbon emissions limit)\n\n5. Economic - Welfare (e.g., food stamps, corn subsidies, social security)\n\n6. Foreign policy (e.g., foreign aid, military intervention, foreign bases)\n\nOf course, this is nowhere near perfect, but these categories are more descriptive than the 2 categories.  \n\nOne issue that I can think of is where do I put gun ownership?  I would consider putting it in the second category, since it is similar to freedom of speech as it's part of the second amendment.  Would it go into the first category because it's something quite a few people don't approve of, like using cocaine?  Heck, gambling could even be put in the first economic category depending on how you look at it, and prostitution could be in either one.\n\nSimilarly, does it make sense to combine corporate welfare (for lack of a better term) with welfare for certain demographics (usually poor, handicapped, or old)?  \n\nOf course there are other facets of people's political beliefs, such as environmental issues, but I figure that it's possible to divide a large number of them into a few categories for analytic purposes.\n\nWhile the facets I described above stem from the World's Smallest Political Quiz, what other ideas do you have for classifying beliefs, whether similar or completely different from above?\n\nAlso, if you think that trying to do this is a moot endeavor, I'd like to hear why.\n________________\n*As a disclaimer, I am planning on applying this to a survey I am in the process of designing.*  *I figure that it would be helpful to discuss this when considering what parts of people's political beliefs are part of a factor.*",

      "text": "[Controlled substances](http://www.deadiversion.usdoj.gov/schedules/) (often referred to generically as drugs) are controlled at the federal level by \"scheduling\" them.  They are placed into 5 bands that limit access based on addictiveness, potential to abuse, and medical usage.  Drugs which are considered medically useful generally are scheduled lower.  Schedule I drugs are considered to have no accepted medical use, have a high potential for abuse, and are unsafe even under medical supervision.  Currently, the list is at least somewhat political in nature.  Many point to marijuana being listed as a Schedule I as a sign of this politicization, when drugs such as methamphetamine are Schedule II.  \n\nHow should evaluation of drugs be done by the government?  Should it be handled as a purely political issue, a purely medical issue, or some hybrid of the bother?  Should the federal government be able to handle scheduling for every state, or should it be a states' rights issue?",

As Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense, she called in to speak about the mechanisms behind Ukranian aid and also the fallout from the White House's suspension of said aid over the summer. However, shortly before her testimony could begin, members of the House Freedom Caucus, led by Republican Matt Gaetz of the Flordia 1st, held a short press conference in the \"basement of the Captial\" in which they laid out complaints about the secrecy of the testimony and of the impeachment inquiry itself. [\\[Fox News\\]](https://www.foxnews.com/politics/gop-lawmakers-in-blasting-secret-impeachment-probe-before-attempting-to-storm-the-proceedings)\n\nAfter this short conference, Gaetz and what was reported to be around 30 House Republicans entered the House Intelligence Committee's Sensitive Compartmented Information Facility, or SCIF, while outside members of the press heard the chanting of \"Let us in.\" It has also been reported that Schiff has made contact with both the Sergeant of Arms and Capitol Police who are attempting to end the standoff.

What are the actual rules surrounding how it can be used and who can enter the room? What are the house rules on closed-door hearings and who can enter those? Many Republicans seem to be basing criticism on the rules and how unfair they are to the American voter whose representative can't get information about these hearings and testimonials, so how were these rules decided on if there is such a huge issue around representatives not having access to information? Finally, were any actual laws broken or is this an issue of ceremony where we might see censure, but no actual charges?",

In part, the policy states\n\n\"The Attorney General directed United States Attorneys on the Southwest Border to prosecute all amenable adults who illegally enter the country, including those accompanied by their children, for 8 U.S.C. § 1325(a), illegal entry.\n\n\"Children whose parents are referred for prosecution will be placed with the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), Office of Refugee Resettlement (ORR).\"\n\nWhile the separation of children from their parents has been widely condemned by [people on both sides of the aisle](https://www.dallasnews.com/news/immigration/2018/06/18/beyond-laura-bush-texans-saying-separating-immigrant-children-parents-border), there seems to be considerable disagreement about what is actually happening, and why\n\n[This ](https://www.nationalreview.com/2018/05/illegal-immigration-enforcement-separating-kids-at-border/)article by the National Review claims, in part, that the only children being separated from their parents, are family units who did not seek asylum at the border (crossed illegally) and are being referred for criminal prosecution, a misdemeanor (for first time crossers). If they plead guilty, they and their child are returned to the country of origin. However, in many of these cases, aliens then make an asylum claim, which begins a more lengthy process, where the children continue to be separated from their parents. Per the  Flores Consent Decree of 1997, the government is not allowed to hold unaccompanied children longer than 20 days, and, per a 9th circuit ruling, this includes children held as part of a family unit. The article claims that, historically, family units were released at or before the 20 day limit, pending asylum adjudication, but they often failed to attend their hearing, and remained in the U.S. illegally.\n\nAdditionally, Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen in a series of [Tweets](https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/politics/dhs-secretary-defends-trump-administrations-migrant-policies/ar-AAyMAZ7?OCID=ansmsnnews11), claimed that asylum seekers who sought asylum at a port of entry would not be separated from their children, and/or there is no policy of doing so.\n\nThe \"zero tolerance\" policy supporters, including Attorney General Jeff Sessions, maintain it is necessary to discourage families from putting their children in danger via illegal border crossings, and that \"[Orderly and lawful processes are good in themselves and protect the weak and lawful](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2018/06/16/jeff-sessions-bible-romans-13-trump-immigration-policy/707749002/). \"\n\nOn the flip side, even if an alien entered the country illegally, they may still file an [asylum claim within one year](https://www.uscis.gov/humanitarian/refugees-asylum/asylum/questions-and-answers-asylum-eligibility-and-applications). The previously cited NPR source also claims that the ORR is having trouble placing the children, because \"the parents are being incarcerated or otherwise held\", and the family of these children are unwilling to come forward, out of fear they will be arrested. ORR is currently sharing sponsor information with DHS, further stoking these fears. According to [this](https://www.cnn.com/2018/06/18/politics/immigration-trump-congress-family-separation/index.html) CNN article, the House is currently debating a bill that would overrule the 20 day limit, allowing families to be kept indefinitely at ICE family facilities.\n\nSo, to restate the question, under what circumstances are children being separated from their family? What alternatives are available under existing or proposed laws?",

As [conservative legal experts](https://lostnotstolen.org/), [Stanford researchers](https://www.cato.org/blog/two-scholars-revisit-trumps-election-fraud-claims), and many other analysts have shown, these are lies. Not only lies, but transparent lies.

While there's nothing illegal or even necessarily wrong with challenging election results in court, the basis of these challenges were lies, which Trump and the GOP continue to endorse. In part fueled by those lies, the Republican party attempted to overthrow the 2020 election and appoint Trump for a second term. Those events culminated most dramatically on January 6th, when, according to the [January 6th committee](https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/GPO-J6-REPORT/html-submitted/index.html):\n\n> Based on false allegations that the election was stolen, Donald Trump summoned tens of thousands of supporters to Washington for January 6th. Although these supporters were angry and some were armed, Donald Trump instructed them to march to the Capitol on January 6th to “take back” their country.\n\nHowever, the attempts to overturn the 2020 election were not limited to the riot on January 6th.

The plot also was much larger than the riots of January 6th. The indictment and [other reporting](https://americanoversight.org/investigation/the-alternate-electors-plot-to-overturn-the-2020-election/) has detailed the \"fake electors\" scheme, in addition to attempts to overturn the votes of individual states.

The plot (or plots) to overturn the election were not supported by all Republicans, with key Republican elected officials and judges refusing to comply. Many, however, did, including [147 congress members](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2021/01/07/us/elections/electoral-college-biden-objectors.html).

Trump is both the Republican presidential nominee and de-facto [leader of the RNC](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/trump-officially-takes-over-republican-national-committee-rcna142362), so these plots aren't just fringe groups, they are backed by the Republican Party and [financed by](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/apr/05/heritage-foundation-election-voting-rights-republican-states) wealthy conservative groups and individuals.

      "text": "Hi folks,\n\nI'd like to break down the memo away from the major political subreddit megathreads a bit. [The memo can be read from this  Scribd link.](https://www.scribd.com/document/370599381/Nunes-Memo)\n\nWith all the speculation bouncing around prior to the release of the memo, it has become difficult to separate what was known vs speculated on regarding the memo and to what degree. I'd like to sort that out to some degree.\n\nI'd also like to sort out where material presented in the memo changes the picture of the ongoing investigations, and where the memo may be misleading. Four possible starting points are: (1) the timing of surveillance on Carter Page, (2) the role of Bruce Ohr in the investigations, (3) the relationship to the Papadopoulos investigation, and (4) the necessity of the Steele dossier to the investigation. I'd love to discuss any other points as well.\n\nRegarding (1), we've heard previously that [Page was under FISA surveillance since 2014](http://www.washingtonexaminer.com/former-trump-adviser-carter-page-under-fisa-warrant-since-2014-report/article/2630576), but I'm not sure where that info comes from (the above has no corroboration in the link). Is the application mentioned in the memo a continuation or a new warrant? If a continuation, wouldn't that make the memo's assertions about the necessity of the Steele dossier misleading? If a new warrant, was he being surveilled earlier? And why was this a new warrant, not a continuation?\n\nRegarding (2), Steele is said to have contacted DoJ through Bruce Ohr. Do we have any additional info on this contact? Was he Steele's only DoJ contact or were there others? What is Ohr's role now? How much do potential conflicts-of-interest regarding Ohr's wife and the DNC matter?\n\nRegarding (3), the Papadopoulos info provided doesn't seem to gel with the rest of the memo's narrative. The memo states the investigation into Papadopoulos began in July 2016, but the FISA warrant for Page didn't begin until October. Is info on Papadopoulos in the dossier, and was the dossier used to begin that investigation? I'm not entirely sure what I'm asking here; it seems to me to be another chance to bring up Strzok's name more than anything else, but I'm open to discussion.\n\nRegarding (4), do we have corroboration that McCabe stated the investigation into Page required the dossier information? If true, that might make the FISA warrant originally issud questionable, [or it might not](https://lawfareblog.com/dubious-legal-claim-behind-releasethememo) as discussed in this lawfareblog post from before the public release of the memo. Essentially, the post states that bias in the evidence used to obtain the warrant is not enough to stop the warrant from being issued if the biased information is precise and from a reliable source.\n\nThat's just to get a discussion started - I'm hoping to break down the memo some more and draw connections to info we had before the release of the memo as well.",

      "text": "*See follow-up. Original observations:*\n\n----\n\nThe following are some observations based on this 2012 infographic, [How Powerful Is Your Vote?](http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/map_of_the_week/2012/11/presidential_election_a_map_showing_the_vote_power_of_all_50_states.html)\n\nIn a presidential election, the vote of a person in California counts for:\n\n* 2/5 of a person in Montana\n\n* 1/3 of a person in North Dakota\n\n* 1/4 of a person in Wyoming\n\nSimilar discrepancies exist when it comes to representation in ~~Congress and~~ the Senate. The overall effect is that:\n\n* In Europe, votes from rural and small-town populations count for about the same as votes from metropolitan areas.\n\n* In the US, votes from rural and small-town populations can count for up to four times (!) as much as votes from cities.\n\nIn all countries I'm aware of, it is the largest cities that tend to lean progressively; whereas small towns and rural populations tend to lean conservatively.\n\nThe result of these discrepancies appears to be that progressive policies tend to win in Europe, but they meet strong opposition in the US, due to the voting power of small-town and rural populations.\n\nWhen it comes to climate change, this effect appears to be especially concerning. Large populations in low-lying cities that are likely to be most affected by global warming are leaning politically toward taking this problem seriously. However, these votes are being neutered by votes from small-town and rural states, where people's votes count for up to 4 times as much. And these just happen to be located at elevations that aren't as likely to be strongly affected.\n\n----\n\nSupport:\n\n1. [Distribution of population in the US](http://i.imgur.com/ukeSb65.jpg) &ndash; most people live on East Coast and West Coast.\n\n2. [Elevations of the 50 largest cities in the US](http://egsc.usgs.gov/isb//pubs/booklets/elvadist/elvadist.html) &ndash; 6 out of 10 largest US metropolises are at sea level\n\n3. [Red states and blue states](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_states_and_blue_states) &ndash; low-population states in the middle of the US vote overwhelmingly Republican\n\n4. In support of the claim that metro areas lean progressive, and non-metro areas lean conservative elsewhere than the US &ndash; in Slovenia, there was recently a referendum, which succeeded to block progressive legislation that would grant rights to same-sex couples. Here's a [map of the results](http://i.imgur.com/QRwju12.png). Red are areas that voted to block gay rights; blue are areas that voted to grant them. The blue areas correspond to Slovenia's cities.\n\n5. In further support of this claim, here's a map of [population in France](http://i.imgur.com/BiIYUuY.jpg), and here is a map of how the country voted in a [2005 EU referendum](http://i.imgur.com/wHL6YSb.png). Note Paris: all green, compared to all red in most lower-populated parts of the country.\n\n6. In further support that low-pop and rural areas lean Republican and metro areas lean Democrat in the US &ndash; CityLab article: [What Is It Exactly That Makes Big Cities Vote Democratic?](http://www.citylab.com/politics/2013/02/what-makes-some-cities-vote-democratic/4598/)\n\n-----\n\n# Follow-up:\n\nI made a [big spreadsheet](https://i.imgur.com/O8Hf8vH.png) comparing electoral college votes in the 2000 and 2008 elections, with what the outcomes would have been if the numbers of electoral votes were normalized by population. I also made this comparison for the current Senate.\n\nData sources: [US states](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_U.S._states_by_population), [2000 election](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:ElectoralCollege2000.svg), [2008 election](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:ElectoralCollege2008.svg), [current senate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_current_United_States_Senators).\n\nIn presidential elections, the impact of the smaller states is too small to make much of a difference. Neither the 2000 nor the 2008 elections would have had a different outcome if the number of electoral college votes was normalized by population.\n\n(This is even though the 2000 election would have had a different outcome by [popular vote](http://www.archives.gov/federal-register/electoral-college/2000/popular_vote.html). By its nature, the electoral college &ndash; whether population-normalized, or in its current form &ndash; creates a similar effect as inadvertent gerrymandering.)\n\n*However...*\n\nThe effect of small state power is exacerbated **in the Senate.** Currently, each state has 2 senators regardless of population. Of the 100 senators, 54 are Republican, 44 Democratic, 2 independent. This allows Republicans to obstruct the House and President.\n\nIf the voting power of senators was adjusted based on populations of their states, California would have two senators with 12.2 votes, vs. Wyoming's 0.18. *Keeping the same senators*, there would be 46.6 Republican votes, 52.9 Democratic, and 0.31 independent.\n\nIn Senate, voting power proportional to population would completely alter the political landscape; it seems in favor of progressives.",

We on the mod team have noted the same, and would like to remind everyone of a few key rules that are critical to the success of the sub.\n\n## Assume good faith\n\nWe are all here because we want the best for our respective country and collective world. We don't always agree - in fact, we shouldn't always agree. This space is for us to bounce ideas off of a variety of perspectives, and to gain understanding based on how they respond.\nAs such, assume good faith when interacting with other members of the NeutralPolitics community. The fact that you and another user advocate for different solutions doesn't mean that you aren't both trying for the best outcome. You may view their solution as bad, and they probably view yours likewise. Accept that and look at the evidence together.\n\n\n## Sweat the details\n\nEach of us has wide-reaching opinions built on mountains of small facts and assumptions that accumulate to form a worldview. It's all too easy to avoid questioning those assumptions, but this community is an opportunity to test them in order to expand our own understanding of politics and society. If a discussion seems to have come to an impasse, try exploring the components that make up your respective opinions.\n\n\n## Show your work\n\nThis community is dedicated first and foremost to quality information and clear presentation of solid logic. Only with those can we fuel quality discussion. Take the time to understand why you believe what you believe, show us the evidence or underlying logic, and cite your sources.\n\n\n## Engage with the argument, not the person\n\nThings can get heated when discussing hot-button topics, but please stay focused on the argument, not on making attacks against the person. Even when that doesn't result in a flame war, it still shuts down productive discussion.\n\n\nWe will be increasing our presence in the subreddit, including distinguished posts to provide pointers when we see comments that may not merit removal, but are still not in line with the standard of quality that you all have (hopefully!) come to expect of this subreddit. If you have any questions or suggestions, we are as always happy to chat.\n\nThank you for reading and let's keep up our reputation as the best place for political discussion on reddit!",

An opinion has some wiggle room, but if you're going to phrase a comment as a statement of fact, you need to back it up with a link to a reliable source.\n\nWe've also occasionally seen users taking a combative attitude. Please keep the discourse about the topic, not about other users. The first person in an exchange to change the subject of his sentence to \"you\" instead of \"the evidence\" or \"this source\" or some other noun directly related to the topic of conversation, is suspect.\n\nFinally, top-level comments receive extra scrutiny. Please make sure they're on topic, respectful and that you provide sources.\n\nThank you for helping us keep this a great discussion space.\n\nThe /r/NeutralPolitics mod staff.",

I will obviously find out more, but I still wanted to ask the question about this community to potentially refine elements that I would not have thought of. \n\nOf course, I am aware that each state has different structural parameters.

      "text": "The U.S. is currently using tariffs and trade restrictions as primary tools to influence trade relationships and protect domestic industries. According to the Council on Foreign Relations, tariffs are designed to protect local industries by making imports more expensive, thereby encouraging consumers to buy domestically produced goods. However, tariffs can also increase prices for consumers and reduce national income. A 2019 study published in the *Quarterly Journal of Economics* found that tariffs imposed by the U.S. in 2018 led to a $51 billion increase in costs for U.S. consumers and firms, and a net real income loss of $7.8 billion.² Similarly, the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) reported in 2020 that tariffs implemented between 2018 and 2020 would reduce U.S. real GDP by 0.5% and increase average consumer prices by 0.5%, with an average household income loss of $1,277.\n\nWould it be more effective or sustainable for the U.S. to negotiate trade access using a different mechanism — such as requiring partner countries to remit a small percentage of tax revenue collected from goods exported to the U.S.?\n\nFor example, if a country exports $20B of goods to the U.S. annually and agrees to remit 1.5% from those goods, the U.S. could collect $300M without directly impacting consumer prices. This structure would maintain price stability while reinforcing the idea that access to the U.S. consumer market is a privilege with associated obligations. The exporting country is still generating tax revenue from those goods — this model would simply give the U.S. a share of the pie. It's similar to the Apple App Store: developers gain access to a massive marketplace, but pay a percentage in return.\n\nHas any government ever implemented a model like this? Would it be practical or beneficial as an alternative to tariffs?\n\n**Sources:**  \n¹ Amiti, M., Redding, S. J., & Weinstein, D. E. (2019).

      "title": "What are the goals and legality of US President Trump's 'Liberation Day' tariffs?",
      "text": "**Background**\n\nToday, the US President [announced tariffs](https://www.axios.com/2025/04/02/trump-tariffs-april-2-liberation-day) on 76 countries (49 plus the European Union), bringing the average effective US tariff rate to the [highest since 1872.](https://budgetlab.yale.edu/research/fiscal-economic-and-distributional-effects-20-broad-tariff)\n\nThis is a two-part question. \n\n**Goals?**\n\nFirst, what are the goals of the tariffs? \n\nIn the announcement, Trump said, \"We will supercharge our domestic industrial base, we will pry open foreign markets and break down foreign trade barriers.\" \n\nI can see a certain kind of logic in the first point there. If imported goods become more expensive, it stands to reason that at least *some* production would move to domestic facilities. For example, 18 car companies already [have plants in the US.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_automobiles_manufactured_in_the_United_States) If their imported models are subject to higher tariffs, they could theoretically shift production of those to US sites. Is that feasible? I don't really understand how tariffs pry open foreign markets.\n\nThe announced tariffs also claim to pursue \"fairness\" and \"rebalancing\" in trade. What's the evidence that US trade is unfair and imbalanced now?\n\nAre those the main goals of this policy shift and is there historical precedent for tariffs achieving them? \n\n**Legality?**\n\nMy second question is about the legality of this action. \n\nThe US Constitution explicitly [grants the Congress,](https://constitutioncenter.org/the-constitution/articles/article-i#article-section-8) not the President, the power to levy duties. \n\nIn the [executive order](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/04/regulating-imports-with-a-reciprocal-tariff-to-rectify-trade-practices-that-contribute-to-large-and-persistent-annual-united-states-goods-trade-deficits/) announcing today's moves, Trump claims authority under the [International Emergency Economic Powers Act,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Emergency_Economic_Powers_Act) which authorizes the president to regulate international commerce after declaring a national emergency in response to any unusual and extraordinary threat to the country. What is the threat on which the president is declaring a national emergency?\n\nThe order also claims authorities under the \"section 604 of the [Trade Act of 1974,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trade_Act_of_1974) as amended (19 U.S.C. 2483), and section 301 of title 3, United States Code.\" Is today's action a covered or typical use of those extra-legislative authorities?",

      "text": "What are the PROS and CONS of voting for H.R.1968 - *Full-Year Continuing Appropriations and Extensions Act, 2025*? \\(Specifically, in the Senate, now that the House has passed it\\)  \n  \nMy particular concern is in regards to constitutional checks and balances: whether the Executive and the Legislative branches are wielding proportionate power that can rein in one another; but feel free to point out pros and cons in other political contexts.  \n  \nI have heard a lot of chatter advocating for voting \"no\" on this Continuing Resolution \\(CR\\).  \nOver [an interview with Chris Hayes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJDHET0MAz8&t=59), Senator Schumer \\(D-NY\\) claimed voting \"no\" leads to a shutdown, and this would allow the Exec. branch to arbitrarily and unilaterally (albeit temporarily, see below) determine which government functions are essential \\(or not\\), quickly shutting down a wide swarth of agencies and forcing workers out by furlough (unpaid time-off).  \n\nHowever, on [his opinion piece published on NY times](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/13/opinion/trump-musk-shutdown-senate.html), he claimed that should the shutdown drag on, it would be up to Congress to make those determinations.  \n>In a protracted shutdown, House and Senate Republicans could bring bills to the floor to reopen only their favored departments and agencies while leaving other vital services that they don’t like to languish[,]  \n  \nwrote Sen. Schumer. It seems to me that is one way for the Legislature to retain some measure of control.  \n\nOn the other hand, should the CR pass, it will mean strengthening the Exec. branch and weakening the Legislative.  \n>“It is not a simple stopgap that keeps the lights on and the doors open,” said Rep. Rosa DeLauro, the top Democrat on the House Appropriations Committee. “This is Republican leadership handing over the keys of the government, and a blank check to Elon Musk and to President Trump.”  \n[Source: AP](https://apnews.com/article/congress-budget-funding-government-shutdown-e027a644af4152377b8cf99f6a91102f)  \n\nWhile the dollar amount is much smaller, in [an interview with CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2025/03/13/politics/ocasio-cortez-schumer-democratic-shutdown-plan/index.html), Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez \\(D, NY-14\\) emphasized that it would mean Congress codifying its abdication of power to the Executive.  \n  \nI am not an expert in any shape or manner. Can any constitutional scholar comment on the actual benefits and drawbacks of the \"Yay\" and \"Nay\" votes in the Senate?  \n  \nLink to CR: https://www.congress.gov/bill/119th-congress/house-bill/1968/text",

It includes US government payments to countries like Serbia, Bangladesh, and Cambodia for the promotion of civil rights, gender rights, voting rights, etc. in those countries. \n\nSuch programs are often referred to as a way for the US to project [\"soft power:\"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soft_power) *the ability to influence the behavior of others to get the outcomes you want... [through] economic and cultural influence, rather than coercion or military strength.*\n\nOne argument that often appears in commentary on this subject is that [China will supposedly swoop in and become the new \"soft power\" in these regions.](https://foreignpolicy.com/2023/09/29/congress-shutdown-us-china-ccp-soft-power-competition-biden-xi-jinping-beijing/)\n\nMy question is, what actual tangible benefits is the US getting from \"soft power\" in Cambodia or Serbia? In what ways does the US having soft power in those countries directly benefit American taxpayers? Does it provide a good return on the [billions of dollars](https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2025/02/06/what-the-data-says-about-us-foreign-aid/) the US pays for it? \n\nI should clarify, I am asking for a realpolitik answer that considers tangible benefits for US tax payers, not a moral answer (\"it's a nice ethical thing to fund\"). \n\nAlthough many online articles explain the virtues and benefits of cultural soft power (exported Film, TV, music, pop-culture), I am struggling to find a definitive answer on the benefits of the types of programmes that Musk is apparently uncovering.",

      "text": "And as a secondary question, what direct evidence is there that Musk exaggerated or was flat out wrong about fraud, waste, and abuse he claimed existed?\n\nI've largely spent the past couple days combing through social media and the news surrounding Elon Musk's DOGE, and I have to say it's absurd how hard it is to actually verify all the claims that both sides are making in this debate. It's honestly beyond frustrating how much time it takes to attempt to be informed, and I think it's a real problem for our democracy that quality information is so hard to come by.\n\n**Here's a sample of a few things I've found evidence for on the \"Musk and Trump's are eliminating fraud, waste and abuse side\"**\n\nDOGE has done everything it could to shut down USAID, and it does seem that USAID made some questionable spending decisions (among doing some quality work as well). First, it seems they were at least negligent in preventing funds intended for aid for ending end up in the hands of terrorists such as Hamas in Palestine, the Taliban in Afghanistan, [Source](https://dailycaller.com/2025/02/04/biden-admin-terrorist-1-3-billion-trump-foreign-aid/) and Al-Qaida in Syria. [Source](https://oig.usaid.gov/node/7283?utm_source=chatgpt.com). To be clear, this happened over the course of multiple administrations, not just Biden's.\n\nSecondly, they gave millions for different projects to an organization called Eco Alliance, before ceasing the grants when the organization was ultimately found to have run research with a lab with Wuhan, China without proper oversight. [Source](https://oversight.house.gov/release/breaking-hhs-formally-debars-ecohealth-alliance-dr-peter-daszak-after-covid-select-reveals-pandemic-era-wrongdoing/?utm)\n\nThird, USAID did use American taxpayer funds to develop DEI initiatives abroad, including $1.5 million in Serbia for advancing DEI and economic empowerment for LGBTQI+ people [Source](https://www.usaspending.gov/award/ASST_NON_72016922FA00001_7200) and $2 million for an organization that funds gender affirming care and advocates for LGBTQ+ rights in Guatemala. [Source](https://editorials.voa.gov/a/realigning-foreign-assistance-with-american-interests/7953297.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com) (you can argue whether this was waste/abuse, but it was done).\n\nUSAID's budget is roughly $40 billion, so you could make the case shutting it down saves taxpayers this amount - whatever we spend on foreign aid through any replacement mechanisms (foreign aid can still be distributed in other ways, like by the State Department, so it's almost certain even if USAID was totally shut down the savings would be less than $40 billion).\n\n**Here's a sample of a few things I've found evidence for on the \"Fake news/exaggeration by Musk/Trump about fraud, waste and abuse\":**\n\nDOGE eliminated the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), but according to their records, the CFPB has gotten back nearly $20 billion for American consumers who were defrauded or taken advantage of by corporations ([Records](http://consumerfinance.gov/enforcement/enforcement-by-the-numbers/)).\n\nMusk and Trump have also claimed USAID and other federal agencies were stealing $8 million a year from taxpayers, and giving it to Politico to write positive stories about Democrats. However, Politico has provided evidence that the fees were merely subscriptions that both Republican and Democratic policy makers had with the outlet ([Article](https://www.npr.org/2025/02/07/nx-s1-5290282/politico-subscriptions-usaid-x-musk-trump)).\n\nOn top of that, Musk has claimed that DOGE discovered FEMA decided to give $59 million to house immigrants in luxury hotels, instead of providing hurricane relief to Americans. But people pointed out these funds were publicly authorized by Congress separate from any disaster relief funding, and only distributed FEMA in accordance with Congress’s orders ([Post](https://x.com/David_J_Bier/status/1888976312456417373) and [Law](https://www.congress.gov/118/plaws/publ47/PLAW-118publ47.pdf)) In other words, DOGE didn't discover anything and this was Congress’s decision not FEMA’s. And FEMA officials have said the amount spent on standard and temporary housing for migrants was $19 million in accordance with Congress’s direction. On top of that, they note 13,000 North Carolinian households stayed in hotels FEMA paid for after the hurricane, and 3,000 still remain in those hotels ([Press Release](https://www.fema.gov/press-release/20250207/north-carolina-153000-families-receiving-fema-help?)).\n\n**I'm curious what others have found on both sides of this debate. It feels like it take a village to curate the news these days, and this seems like a community that is dedicated to that sort of noble effort. Please let me know what you've found!**\n\n**\\[Edit\\] Just want to thank everyone for all the comments and engagement! I'm new to reddit obviously, so I'm very excited about the potential to work together here to find the best answers on everything going on in our world.**",

Thirty years later, the [Supreme Court ruling in *United States v.

Wong Kim Ark* have been a net detriment or benefit to the country?\n* The cited executive order claims that its interpretation of the law is not new, but if that were the case, it seems there would be no need for an executive order, so what is it changing?\n* Does the executive branch have the power to change the interpretation of a law in this way?",

      "text": "A recent published study by the  respected \"Institute of Labor Economics\", sheds light on the fiscal contributions of immigrants in the Netherlands over their lifetimes. It offers some intriguing insights that raise important questions for discussion. The data show that labor migrants, particularly from Western countries, tend to contribute positively to public finances, with an average lifetime contribution of €42,000. In contrast, non-Western immigrants often face challenges, resulting in an average fiscal deficit of €167,000 over their lifetime. Native Dutch citizens, by comparison, contribute an average of €98,000.  \nInterestingly, even the second-generation immigrants that achieved education levels similar to native citizens, their earnings still lag behind, maintaining negative fiscal contributions.\n\nThis makes wonder: why it happens ? Do we need to revisit how newcomers are integrated into the labor market, ensuring they have the opportunities to contribute more effectively ?  \nThis study doesn’t provide all the answers but serves as a starting point for constructive dialogue. \n\nWhat policies have been implemented to enhance the economic impact of immigration and what's the evidence for their efficacy?\n\nStudy available here:  \n[https://www.iza.org/publications/dp/17569/the-long-term-fiscal-impact-of-immigrants-in-the-netherlands-differentiated-by-motive-source-region-and-generation](https://www.iza.org/publications/dp/17569/the-long-term-fiscal-impact-of-immigrants-in-the-netherlands-differentiated-by-motive-source-region-and-generation)",

      "text": "**Background:**\n\nThe [North Atlantic Treaty Organization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NATO) (NATO) is an intergovernmental military alliance of 32 member states. At the core of its deterrent functions is [Article 5,](https://www.nato.int/cps/en/natohq/topics_110496.htm) whose collective defense principles mean that an attack on one ally is considered as an attack against all allies. Article 5 has long been considered a successful deterrent to aggression in Europe, at first countering the Warsaw Pact countries, and later Russia.\n\nBut things changed with the rise of Donald Trump, who has been [openly critical of NATO.](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/02/11/us/politics/trump-nato.html) It was widely reported that soon after Trump took office, NATO's mutual defense obligations were explained to him and he responded, \"You mean, if Russia attacked Lithuania, we would go to war with Russia?\" adding, \"That’s crazy.\" Just the suggestion that the United States could not be depended on would compromise the value of such an alliance, but in 2020, Trump went a step further, reportedly [telling the European Commission President,](https://www.politico.eu/article/donald-trump-vow-never-help-europe-attack-thierry-breton/) \"You need to understand that if Europe is under attack we will never come to help you and to support you.\" He then added, \"By the way, NATO is dead, and we will leave, we will quit NATO.\"\n\nNow, despite Russia [annexing part of Georgia in 2008, Crimea in 2014, and fomenting a war in Donbas,](https://mwi.westpoint.edu/countering-russian-aggression-twenty-first-century/) all prior to [invading Ukraine in 2022,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_invasion_of_Ukraine) nine NATO countries have still [not met their recommended military funding targets.](https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/blogs/econographics/whos-at-2-percent-look-how-nato-allies-have-increased-their-defense-spending-since-russias-invasion-of-ukraine/) And after nearly three years of war in Ukraine with an intensive [sanctions regime against Russia,](https://carnegieendowment.org/research/2024/03/why-russia-has-been-so-resilient-to-western-export-controls?lang=en) weapons production in NATO countries still [lags way behind Russia.](https://www.lemonde.fr/en/international/article/2024/07/11/the-scale-of-russia-s-rearmament-has-nato-worried_6681537_4.html#)\n\nOn the other hand, NATO countries still have the [nuclear umbrella](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_umbrella) that didn't extend to Ukraine. Some argue this alone, with some updating, would be [enough to deter aggression.](https://www.nato.int/docu/review/articles/2023/09/29/the-urgent-imperative-to-maintain-natos-nuclear-deterrence/index.html)\n\n\n**Questions:**\n\n* Is NATO still a credible deterrent?\n* Are member countries right to doubt the commitment of other members, especially the U.S., to Article 5?\n* Is it appropriate for [smaller countries to have a credible fear](https://news.sky.com/story/ukraine-war-why-the-baltic-states-on-natos-frontline-with-russia-are-urging-their-allies-to-wake-up-13084332) that the rest of NATO would not come to its aid if attacked?\n* In a NATO with less political commitment and military industrial output than Russia, is the nuclear umbrella still a sufficient deterrent?",

It feels like something foundational is changing in how people engage with their governments. Now, I’m not one for conspiracy theories, but I do believe that long-term plans and global strategies play a role here. https://www.lemonde.fr/en/international/article/2024/06/13/european-elections-the-far-right-gained-ground-in-eu-founding-countries_6674740_4.html\n\nWhat concerns me most is the rise of far-right ideologies and a growing acceptance of authoritarian / fascism thinking across the West. Is democracy itself eroding from within, with parts of the population becoming increasingly skeptical or even hostile toward it?\n\nCould superpowers like Russia and China be benefiting from this? We know Russia has been highly effective in disinformation campaigns, influencing divisions and amplifying social rifts in democratic societies. ( https://publications.armywarcollege.edu/News/Display/Article/3789933/understanding-russian-disinformation-and-how-the-joint-force-can-address-it/ ) But there also seems to be a deeper, internal shift going on that might go beyond any foreign influence, or maybe not?\n\nSo, where is this paradigm shift really coming from? Are these long-standing societal issues that are only now coming to the surface? Or is this part of a larger strategy by external powers to destabilize the West? \n\nI’m really interested in hearing different perspectives, especially from those who follow global geopolitics / history closely.

The election will be determined by voters - there is no skill, chance, or luck involved, and certainly not to the degree of something like a professional sports match.\n* If a predictive model can't really tell who wins the election at 70%+ probability, then what value does it provide and what insight does it provide and what value does it add to the conversation? I understand a 30% chance of something happening is a far cry from \"impossible\" but what value does it add when we can simply look at polls to understand who is likely to be ahead?\n* Would we be better served and informed by looking at individual polls to make a guess at who is ahead?\n* What do the \"predictive models\" add to the conversation?\n\nI can see models adding some value to the discussion by calling out inaccurate polls or polls with flawed methodology ([Nate Silver's post calling out \"herding\" is a great example](https://www.natesilver.net/p/theres-more-herding-in-swing-state)). I'm not sure how the \"predictive models\" themselves add anything to the conversation.",

      "text": "After the 2000 election, in which there were controversies over absentee ballots being counted in Florida, the New York Times completed a landmark investigation into the process around counting ballots and uncovered several irregularities which allowed Bush to be declared the winner in the state over Gore.\n\n[EXAMINING THE VOTE; How Bush Took Florida: Mining the Overseas Absentee Vote](https://www.nytimes.com/2001/07/15/us/examining-the-vote-how-bush-took-florida-mining-the-overseas-absentee-vote.html)\n\nThe article calls out several process failures which would not necessarily fall under the commonly considered \"voter fraud\" umbrella (whereas voter fraud is commonly referring to things like double voting, voting with a stolen identity, voting on behalf of a deceased person, etc).\n\n>In an analysis of the 2,490 ballots from Americans living abroad that were counted as legal votes after Election Day, The Times found 680 questionable votes. Although it is not known for whom the flawed ballots were cast, four out of five were accepted in counties carried by Mr. Bush, The Times found. Mr. Bush's final margin in the official total was 537 votes.\n\n>The flawed votes included ballots without postmarks, ballots postmarked after the election, ballots without witness signatures, ballots mailed from towns and cities within the United States and even ballots from voters who voted twice. All would have been disqualified had the state's election laws been strictly enforced.\n\nThere is information about high level, abstract \"ballot rejection\" statistics, such as this MIT paper:\n\n[A Deep Dive into Absentee Ballot Rejection in the 2020 General Election](https://elections-blog.mit.edu/articles/deep-dive-absentee-ballot-rejection-2020-general-election)\n\nAnd this article applying regression models to voting intentions:\n\n[No evidence for systematic voter fraud: A guide to statistical claims about the 2020 election](https://www.pnas.org/doi/full/10.1073/pnas.2103619118)\n\nBut similar models were also applied to the 2000 election in Florida and did not uncover statistically significant conclusions based purely on the data:\n\n[Statistical Issues in the 2000 U.S. Presidential Election in Florida](https://scholarship.law.ufl.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1253&context=jlpp)\n\nThe conclusions of the statistical analysis stands in stark contrast to the process irregularities uncovered by the New York Times report from 2001.\n\nWhat I am looking for is a deep dive into the actual specifics and potential inconsistencies in actually applying different standards across ballots to influence a winner (process irregularities, process fraud). Has there been any journalism with a similar level of detail to the 2000/2001 New York Times investigation regarding the 2020 election, potentially as a result of either legal discovery owing to the various lawsuits or research uncovered via investigative journalism, one way or the other?",

      "text": "This coming Tuesday, November 5th, is the last day of voting in the [U.S. general election.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_United_States_elections) \n\nIf you're a potential voter and haven't cast your ballot yet, you may want to check out our [voter information post.](https://www.reddit.com/r/NeutralPolitics/comments/1g4rpq8/info_the_rneutralpolitics_voter_information_post/)\n\nMany people (especially those living outside the U.S.) are looking forward to this election season being over. Unfortunately, Tuesday is not likely to be the end of it, so this post is designed to let people know what to expect moving forward.\n\n----\n\n* **Votes take time to be counted.** Many states [do not even begin counting their absentee/mail-in ballots](https://ballotpedia.org/When_states_can_begin_processing_and_counting_absentee/mail-in_ballots,_2024) until the polls close on Election Day, meaning they will take an especially [long time to report and certify a full count.](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2024-election/when-race-called-election-2024-harris-trump-president-rcna175473) In 2020, fifteen states [didn't certify until at least four weeks after the election,](https://ballotpedia.org/Election_results_certification_dates,_2020) and in 2016, [some were even later.](https://ballotpedia.org/Election_results_certification_dates,_2020)\n* As the results are coming in, **changes to the count are normal**. The fact that someone is leading at one point and then behind at another is entirely a function of which ballots from which districts are being counted. It doesn't indicate that anything unusual has happened. Moreover, areas with higher population density logically take longer to process their ballots and they [tend to lean left,](https://www.econlib.org/why-are-there-zero-republican-mega-cities/) so [late shifts leftwards are quite common.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_shift_\\(politics\\))\n* Based on the [polling,](https://www.realclearpolling.com/polls/president/general/2024/trump-vs-harris) this could be [**one of the closest races** in the last 60 years.](https://edition.cnn.com/2024/09/22/politics/closest-presidential-race-harris-trump/index.html) Don't let anyone tell you it should be a landslide just because they're immersed in communities, social circles, or media silos that unflappably support one side. It's a big country. Just because someone only knows people who support one of the candidates does not mean that candidate will win.\n* Polling is an inexact art and **discrepancies between polling and voting are normal.** Donald Trump has [outperformed his polling](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/05/04/why-election-polls-were-wrong-in-2016-and-2020-and-whats-changing.html) in both his previous campaigns. Democrats have [outperformed their polling](https://www.npr.org/2024/05/02/1248599739/abortion-democrats-independents-republicans-voting-2024-election) since the Dobbs decision overturned *Roe v. Wade.* We do not know who will win.\n* Similarly, betting odds and prediction markets are [**not reliable** indicators of outcome.](https://time.com/7095708/financial-scam-political-prediction-election/) Their [lines shift based on the incoming bets,](https://quantian.substack.com/p/market-prices-are-not-probabilities) not probabilities. (We [discussed this in depth](https://www.reddit.com/r/NeutralPolitics/comments/1g1fg2j/discrepancy_between_polling_numbers_and_betting/) a few weeks ago.)\n* [**There will be legal challenges**, likely from both campaigns.](https://edition.cnn.com/2024/10/29/politics/election-lawsuits-trump-harris/index.html) It's common for campaigns to challenge issues they feel were not handled properly. Some challenges have already been filed and there will assuredly be others up until and after the polls have closed. This is not unusual, though given the political climate, the volume may be higher this year. More claims does not indicate malfeasance or unreliability in the system.\n* **Legal challenges are not the same as \"election denialism,\"** which can be [defined as](https://reason.com/volokh/2022/08/29/three-reforms-to-protect-democracy-from-election-denialism/) a willingness \"to deny *the lawfully determined outcome* of an election.\" If a candidate is unwilling to accept the results *after* the challenges have been filed and adjudicated, *that* is denialism.\n* **There may be recounts and runoff elections** in some races. [Recounts](https://ballotpedia.org/Election_recount_laws_and_procedures_in_the_50_states) are triggered by small margins of victory and/or successful recount requests, [depending on the jurisdiction.](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2024-election/recount-laws-provisions-swing-states-trump-harris-election-rcna175476) There's no such thing as a runoff election in the presidential race, but in some states, there may be runoffs for other offices, depending on the margin of victory.\n* The voting age population of the country has been rising every year for over a century, which means that if turnout rates are consistent, [more people vote in each successive election.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voter_turnout_in_United_States_presidential_elections) Based on national polling, each major party candidate is projected to garner around 80 million votes this year. And if turnout is high, even the losing candidate could set a new record for most votes received.\n* The [electoral college system](https://www.britannica.com/story/how-does-the-electoral-college-work) decides who wins, not the popular vote.\n* Some election laws have changed since 2020. The [Electoral Count Act was revised](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electoral_Count_Reform_and_Presidential_Transition_Improvement_Act_of_2022) to clarify the role of the Vice President in the process. Quite a few [state laws have changed as well,](https://penntoday.upenn.edu/news/political-science-marc-meredith-voting-law-changes-since-2020) some more restrictive and some more expansive of the franchise.\n* **Beware disinformation.** Social media, assisted by generative A.I., is being used, mostly by foreign adversaries, to undermine confidence in our elections and to stoke discord, so as to pit Americans against each other. Past incidents have been [investigated and proven.](https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/4952349-ai-generated-deepfakes-threaten-election/) Expect even [more in the future.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6dxogtpHTk)\n* Among the public, [confidence in election administration](https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2024/10/24/views-of-2024-election-administration-and-confidence-in-vote-counts/) is slightly higher than in the last couple cycles, but still considerably below historical norms. Among some election experts, however, [confidence is high.](https://time.com/7096453/election-2024-security/) Here's [an interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O7upNGzjg40) with some of them.\n\nThe point of all this is that we should expect some degree of controversy and we may not know the final results for a while. Strap in, monitor reliable sources like [AP News,](https://apnews.com/hub/election-2024) and be patient.\n\n----\n\n*This is an informational post for our users.*",
