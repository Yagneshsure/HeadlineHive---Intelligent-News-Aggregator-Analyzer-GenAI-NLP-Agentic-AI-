[Meta] Rules II & III: Policy Proposals and Non-economists,"Hi all,

In light of an exceeding amount of rulebreaking posts, the r/economics modteam wanted to both clarify the rules and provide some clear examples of rule breaking. As part of this post, please find links to the [Rule II Roundtable](https://www.reddit.com/r/Economics/comments/7x14px/meta_rules_roundtable_2_submissions_and_rii/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) and [Rule III Roundtable](https://www.reddit.com/r/Economics/comments/80gcd0/meta_rules_round_table_3_rule_iii/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) where the r/economics mods do an in depth explanation of the purpose and moderation strategy of each of the rules. As these roundtables are quite old, we are open to hearing feedback as well as updating/rehashing these roundtables if the community would like. However, comments on this post that clearly indicate that they have not read the rules roundtables will be removed as they are critical for any productive discussion regarding the subreddit rules.

##Rule II: Economics Relevance

As stated, rule II is designed to ensure that posts are focused on the *discipline* of economics. This is different to just ""the economy"" as well as business in general. As such, the modteam will continue to remove any articles about stock markets, specific stocks, or specific firms. Posts doing in-depth analysis of an industry as a whole will be allowed. This rule also encompasses the authors/quotegivers/interviewees of particular posts; they must be economists or quote economists. This means that posts about prolific traders or businessmen (such as Jamie Dimon or Warren Buffet) or politicians (such as Donald Trump or Kamala Harris), while plenty interesting, are not welcome in this sub. We would encourage you to find other communities that may be better fits for the article such as r/business, r/investing, r/politics, and subreddits for other related topics. 

Alongside this, another common rule-breaking post archetype we have been receiving is economics policy *proposals* from candidates, blogsters, and/or organizations. After some discussion, going forward, policy proposals will be removed under Rule II. However, we will continue to allow in-depth analysis of policy proposals as well as announcements regarding the *implementation* of specific policies. For example: articles about ""Politician A would like this policy to happen"" will be removed, but ""These are the effects of this policy"" posts that utilize economics methods or analysis will be allowed. This is quite a nuanced topic as we will also allow policy proposals from ***practicing*** academic economists. These are people who are currently still *producing* high-quality research. This distinction allows the modteam to differentiate from economists-turned-politicians as it would be incredibly difficult for us to distinguish whether Janet Yellen, for example, is speaking in an academic capacity or as the Secretary of Treasury. This is of course, outlined in our Rule II Roundtable, linked above. 

##Rule III: Original Source, No Editorializing Title

With the proliferation of official media outlet accounts we wanted to remind users of our 90-10 guideline for submissions (posts and comments included) that was outlined in our Rule III Roundtable. We have gone ahead and banned a variety of official media outlet accounts for violating this guideline. Please report and send a modmail for any users who also seem to be violating this guideline. We also have finally been given the content moderation option to remove text posts underneath link posts. Users were using this to get around the Rule III guidelines and editorializing under links that they were posting rather than engaging in discussion in the comments. Content rules have been updated to not allow this. 

Lastly we wanted to encourage users to please refresh their memory on Rules IV and VI (which also has a [rules roundtable](https://www.reddit.com/r/Economics/comments/80gcd0/meta_rules_round_table_3_rule_iii/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=usertext&utm_name=Economics&utm_content=t5_2qh1s) that was recently updated!) We encourage users to have spirited discussions as long as they follow the rules of the community.",150,economics,Economy

Something about repeating lines gives the actors such a bone to chew on, giving multiple takes all for an audience to see.

What other repeated lines (triple or otherwise) are remarkable in film history? Also I noticed those two examples are questions. I suppose questions lend themselves to repetition?

Films where a ship/person flies or falls into the sun/star,"Apparently, actually making it to the surface of the sun is very difficult, because a ship has to slow down enough to stop orbiting the sun and fall directly toward the surface - not shoot past it like a comet. 

I've never seen this discussed in any film - it's always a case where someone just points at the sun and does and instant dive into it - even with wrecked ships that would not be able to correct course to stay on target. 

I think part of reason it's shown this way is because we don't think of ourselves as constantly moving around the sun at terrific speeds.  We think about planets moving all the time, but not about how WE are actually moving, too.  

If you've ever been on a large spinning disc in a fun house - and you try to get to the center while it's spinning - I think that kind of puts you in the mind set of how hard it is, versus just going outward to another point ( planet ) that is further away. 

Thinking about this made me want to review some sun-crashing films.

"Ang Lee's ""Sense and Sensibility"" (1995), a delightful Jane Austen adaptation which is funny, warm and bolstered by a remarkable cast. It's easy to see why it ended up being Kate Winslet's breakout role.","Kate Winslet almost runs away with the film as the slightly rebellious Marianne Dashwood. I miss characters who are openly flawed and still oddly likable. 

As the film went on, my eyes were on Marianne as she comes across as a strong personality who becomes enamored by the mysterious yet charming John Willoughby (Greg Wise). Her older sister, Elinor (Emma Thompson), falls for Ferrars (Hugh Grant) though she is aware she and Ferrars can't ever be together because the Dashwoods have become poor after the patriarch died and left a inheritance of 500 pounds per year for the remaining survivors. 

Sense and Sensiblity leaves you with characters whom you're invested in. You want the Dashwoods to be okay and everything is lovely and amusing until something bad happens and it gets dark and depressing. 

Ang Lee's versatility can never be left unsaid. He could do anything. Who knew he'd direct a critically acclaimed period drama and the best film adaptation of a Jane Austen novel?",37,movies,Entertainment
Paul Walter Hauser on ‘Americana’ and Not Fitting in Hollywood,"**How are you feeling about Americana finally hitting theaters? I know you worked on this a few years back.**

*Americana* is legitimately my favorite movie I’ve ever made, which you can print. I’m not worried about any social blowback there. I just think it’s wildly original, the script was so attractive. It was all about the writing, and Sydney Sweeney was just on the come up where everyone was starting to find out who she was because of *White Lotus* and *Euphoria*. When we wrapped, we were told it would go to a festival. A year later, we had it at SXSW in Austin, and we got great reviews, so we were like, “Oh, we’re sitting pretty.” Then we were just sitting. There was no pretty. We were wondering what the hell happened.

...

**Where do you think you’re at as an actor in terms of selecting projects? Do you feel you’d found the space you fit in or do you have things you’re still hoping to explore?**

There’s so much I haven’t done that I want to do desperately. Kevin Costner offered me a part in *Horizon*, but it was one line of dialogue and the character had nothing to them. I don’t need to be a piece of furniture in anybody’s movie. I love Kevin Costner, and I want to work with him, and it’d be an honor, but I also want to do something good. The same thing with Luca Guadagnino, \[who\] offered me \[a role\] to play the tennis judge during the big matches in *Challengers*. I could tell it was going to be something, and I love Luca, and he’s been nothing but sweet to me, but also I feel way too competitive and way too hungry to eat garnish and pretend it’s a meal. I would rather hold out for the right thing. On the day I’m just going to be all hungry, and then I’m going to look stupid and then I’m going to feel awkward. In Hollywood, I don’t feel like I fit in at all.

**Really?**

No, I’m an outspoken Jesus guy, but I also can’t stand Donald Trump. I no longer live in L.A. I am obsessed with professional wrestling, and I’ve made somewhat of a career out of that. In a weird way, I almost feel like I fit in the wrestling world more than I do in Hollywood. I’m a way better actor than I am a wrestler, but I just… I don’t know, when I walk into a wrestling arena and there’s a bunch of nerdy fans with signs and autograph stuff, and I feel like one of them. Whereas, when I’m at a Hollywood function or a premiere, it feels like that awkward high school thing \[where\] there’s a bunch of pretty people who are saying all the right things, and I’m the only one who wants to truly be some sort of unleashed version of themselves, and I feel very alone in that for some reason.",1391,movies,Entertainment

Best directorial debut?,"I was thinking about filmmakers who hit it out of the park the first time out as a feature director, and every one that came to mind had a caveat or a false start of some kind.

* Fincher had Alien 3
* Tarantino had My Best Friend's Birthday
* Kubrick had Fear and Desire
* Cameron had Pirahnas II

The list goes on. Of those four, Cameron's is probably the least fair, because he wasn't the original director and just got elevated into the role, but it's still not technically correct to call Terminator his debut.

Who can y'all think of that doesn't have an exception, and literally made one of their best movies first? Bonus points if they went on to make a string of fantastic pictures.

One that might fit the bill is Todd Field. In the Bedroom is great.

Obscure or lesser known films you adored and you'd wish would get a major rediscovery,"Every scary film Mia Farrow did outside of ""Rosemary's Baby"" -  The Haunting of Julia is a masterpiece. If you like scary films which are more about atmosphere and a constant sense of dread, The Haunting of Julia is the film for you. Nobody saw it when it first came out. Their loss because it's a eerie gem. 

Speaking of Peter Straub, I also highlight one more film adaptation, a absolutely terrifying film which I had nightmares about for a few years in my childhood after I saw it, ""Ghost Story"", featuring a cast of classic film actors (Fred Astaire, Melvyn Douglas, Douglas Fairbanks Jr. Patricia Neal) and Alice Krige in her breakout role, already showing she could scare viewers as the petrifying Alma Mobley. The film gets scarier and scarier as it goes along. 

Todd Solondz's ""Storytelling"" is dark comedy at its best. The first story, Fiction,  is slightly forgettable. It isn't until we get into the 2nd story, Non-Fiction, the film truly finds its footing and I was riveted. The dynamics of the Livingston family, the exceptional performances by Jonathan Osser as the Stewie-like Mikey and Lupe Ontiveros as the abused maid, Consuelo. If you've seen Welcome to the Dollhouse, you know how Todd Solondz wrings out comedy from the most uncomfortable and un-PC situations.",22,movies,Entertainment

The Postman (1997),"I just watched the movie again for a second time, and I must say, it was a great film—especially since I enjoy a good post-apocalyptic story. However, my issue lies with the ending.

I realise sixteen years have gone by since the apocalyptic events, whatever they were. Still, they face difficulties in accessing drinking water, have limited resources, very few people, and some areas remain unsafe. If they could recreate decent cameras and headphones—something shown as easy at the end of the movie—why did they depend only on swords and simple guns earlier? They could have also made bombs or used vehicles and other resources. The ending feels rushed and unclear to me.

If I am missing something—likely I am—I'd appreciate it if someone could clarify this. Also, was the ending of the book the same, or was it different in some way?",3,movies,Entertainment

The Most Popular Films of Each Decade On IMDb (1920-2024),"Because I'm interested in how movie trends reflect the mental state and interests of people, I went on IMDb and listed the most-voted films per decade (starting with 1920), categorizing them by commercial genre. Of course, expect a lot of genre crossover. It's interesting to see when non-U.S. films gained popularity and how the overall tones of certain genres shifted over the decades. For instance, *Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind* being the most-voted romance film of the 2000s is quite telling of how people viewed love in a freshly post-9/11 world. Based on the recent 2020-2024 releases, it's clear we're in a high-level place of seeking familiarity and escapism.

Regardless, you could really get a decent film education/appreciation by watching these movies. What do you think?

I'm wondering if there is actual precedent for a 'bad movie' being remade at *all,* let alone into a financial success.

Remakes can rely in part on goodwill and the 'brand recognition'/association with the previous version. That's not there for 'bad movies,' so a new version of a movie that a lot of people know as 'bad' would be a tough sell to producers or a studio, let alone audiences.

Finally watched Sling Blade,"This is a movie I've been vaguely aware of for a long time. Because of the name, I kind of assumed it would be along the lines of Blade Runner and was way, way off.

First impression was the sound, opening the movie with a chair dragging for so long is a bold choice and the music/sound does an excellent job throughout the film.

Second was the cinematography, interesting shots and lighting, while quite dark, also feels very real. 

I was a few minutes in when I was starting to get really impressed by the actor playing Carl, ""this guy is good, how have I not seen him in anything else?"". Checked IMDb, it's Billy Bob Thornton! 

Lots of actors are talked about for transforming into a role and I don't think I've ever seen this mentioned before, but it's crazy. I would never have guessed it was him, once I knew, I could kind of see some similarity in the eyes, but damn. It can't have been easy keeping his face like that for long shoots and the voice he does is perfect for the role.

Then I saw he directed as well!

The rest of the cast was great, I think everyone hit their role out of the park. The actor who plays Frank, the kid, had a lot of narrative weight on him and really does well. 

An interesting story too, I can't decide if Carl is one of the simplest characters I've seen or one of the most complex. I wonder how reading the entire bible influenced his views on the morality of his actions? 

Really recommend it, very good movie

Cromwell (1970),"I finally got around to watching Richard Harris' performance as Oliver Cromwell in this 50+ year old film.

Josh Holloway To Star In Novel Adaptation ‘One Second After’ For MPI Original Films,,369,movies,Entertainment
"Mia Farrow's lesser known horror movie, ""See No Evil"" (1971) where she plays a Blind girl chased after a psychopath after he slaughtered her family","See No Evil was directed by Richard Fleischer, who also directed 10 Rillington Place and brings the same sense of dread into this movie where Farrow plays a young blind woman who's spending time with her uncle and his family. 

One day, she comes home from a soirée and is unaware of the fact that everybody in the house is dead and that the killer is still inside. From there, the camera follows Farrow as the tension keeps rising. 

I truly enjoyed this movie. It was tense, scary and suspenseful and Farrow has a vulnerability which made for the perfect victim. Some parts I would have cut like the odd extended scene of Farrow riding horses with her beau but other than that, a fine horror/thriller which delivers.",6,movies,Entertainment

The novel Once Upon a Time in Hollywood is a pretty good supplement to the movie.,"Granted a lot of it is Tarantino violently jerking off about movies and listing things ad nauseam, but the story itself adds a great deal to the movie.

Cliff has an entire backstory of being the most prolific killer in all of WW2 (Which is crazy considering Audie Murphy ACTUALLY personally killed 241 men) PLUS a few other people.

The story of the really ugly picture of Rick sitting in his driveway.

Brandy's whole super sad backstory as a fighting dog.

And a lot of really clever insights into Charles Manson being a bullshit hypocrite that would have abandoned his family if it meant he could be famous.

Theory on Hallow Road,"Ok so here’s my theory. Just watched it once so there may be some things I missed. HEAVY SPOILERS.

The girl took the dad’s car after an argument with the parents about her being pregnant.

She went to the woods to get high and crashed in a ditch. She called her parents out of panic and the parents drove there to rescue her.

They did initially reach the forest through the left turn as suggested by the car’s nav. But because the forest is too thick and too dark, they hit Alice.

The mother tried to save her through CPR to the point that her chest collapsed, but failed.

The father decides to pull her body off the road (by pulling on her clothes).

Their minds, out of guilt, chose to RESET.

They probably went home, went to bed and was awoken by the alarm.

And that’s when their shared hallucinations began. They tried to RESET by doing what they did wrong via the phone.

They drove back but this time took a different route. The dad saying “i know this is the way”. He knows not to go the left turn because that’s where they failed.

The mother “does” CPR on the girl because that’s what she tried. She even goes to say “I thought I could save her.”

The dad suggested to move the body off the side of the road by pulling on her clothes because that’s what he did earlier.

When Alice says the “girl’s” face is changing, that’s the indication they were “putting” Alice in a “different body” so they can reset everything.

Supportive details/clues:

1.	⁠As you recall, Alice mentioned she was there around 10pm but it’s already about 3am. Too much time has passed for the sequence of events if they had dinner and she stormed off, but enough if they did the RESET.

2.	⁠At about where they were supposed to turn left, Alice says “i see you.. i see your headlights.” Because that was literally them earlier before they hit her.

3.	⁠Mom was probably driving when they hit Alice and she did try to call the ambulance but dad knew Alice was dead and didn’t want things to worsen. Mom was in a bad state (depressed, maybe even drinking, even drugs “Citalopram” as shown earlier). Dad was willing to take the fall saying he never had no alcohol nor drugs as that would be a lighter sentence. Clue here is the reversed turn signals reflected on their windows.

4.	⁠Dad hated the mom smoking but at the end of the movie, he was the one smoking.

5.	⁠Having gone camping there many times before, they knew a bit about the folklore and their brains used that as an escape story.",0,movies,Entertainment
Horror movie Marathon - 3 Movies,"Friends and I love to do these little 3 movies marathon from time to time. Thinking ahead of time, were most likely gonna do a horror one this fall. 

Not everyone in the group is a big horror fan so we usually like to break it down like this:  
One movie is a classic, older horror movie. They can be silly and are usually pretty easy to digest.  
Second movie is usually a new-ish movie. Something more modern, popular, and well reviewed.   
Third movie is always something silly. Think Scary Movie, Rubber, or The Stuff. Something to take the edge off.

Seven Days In May (1964),"Seldom see this one mentioned but I just watched it the other day for the first time in a while (yay physical media!)  

If you've never seen,  it's an excellent film by John Frankenheimer (The Manchurian Candidate, Ronin). The story is relevant today as ever even though it's a cold-war adjacent storyline.

There are several huge stars and character actors from the 40s and 50s and they all shine. Lancaster with his usual confidence, Douglas with a nice chin-up-but-am-I-doing-the-right-thing turn as the Informant. The brilliant Fredrich March as the President and always-reliable Balsam as his aide. Ava Gardner has a purely expository role but she makes the absolute most of it.

I just finished Nocturnal Animals a second time,"I've watched this film twice now.
The first time I didn't understand it well, I was 15, I'm 16 today and I think I've grown up in my head. 

This first scene, we wonder what we just clicked on, what is this film? Then for a few minutes we don't understand much more. And then there is this first chapter, this scene, much more traumatic than a horror film, not because of the violence, but because of the tension of the scene, losing everything in 15 minutes without knowing what to do or even knowing what is happening? This scene represents (I think) the fact that Edward lost everything, his daughter who was aborted and his mother, who left him. 

Just writing these words a few minutes after seeing it I don't feel at ease, it's a situation that has happened to almost everyone, driving in the middle of the night on long journeys with no one on the road, whether you are a father, a son or a mother, this scene can happen to ANYONE.

There is also throughout the film this label of weak which sticks to the skin of tony/edward, because it characterized him as weak, and it is well represented because there is the version (again this is my opinion) weak which is edward and the inspector who is his ""evil"" version, we see it clearly in the last scene because at the moment when he is confronted with his ""assassin"" he is said ""how do you manage to hang out with a murderer, you who is a good person"", and then erase this good person and kill him (noting that the inspector is no longer there, I think this is proof that he has become this person)

Well I'll stop there because I'm not super clear and I'm still in shock from this film, I don't know if you understood me but each person will have a different idea and imagine it differently, whoever you are, if you haven't seen it or only seen it once, go watch it.

Austin Butler’s screen presence feels very early ’90s Brad Pitt anyone else see it?,"Maybe it’s just me, but I feel like Austin Butler is starting to exude the same kind of screen presence Brad Pitt had in the early ’90s. Not just looks, but that mix of charm, confidence, and slightly detached coolness that made Pitt stand out in movies like Thelma & Louise and Cool World, even before he became a household name.

I especially noticed it watching the trailer for Caught Stealing (his new movie with Zoë Kravitz). There’s this charisma that instantly gave me flashbacks to young Pitt in those roles.

Curious what others think: do you see the similarity, or am I reaching? And do you think Butler could carve out a similar lane in Hollywood, or is his trajectory completely different?

Same with the opening of Dawn of the Dead (both the original and the remake)—those parts that actually capture the process of collapse before the world fully tips over.

Its the scene where neil and the girl who is his childhood friend(I forgot her name) are shown as kids on halloween. Neil shows her, i think he called it  ""game"" sorry I dont remeber it exacly anymore but it was kinda like this. He sexually molested the kid ( a boy a little chubby and with glasses i think) and showed it to her. Of course he didnt  knew it was wrong but still this scene made me very uncomfortable. Furtheremore i wonder what happended to the Kid that neil molested and how he felt about that after he grow older. Still it was an Important scene I think, because it showed, what this couch (how he traumatized neil without him realizing it) had done to neil and how it fucked him up without him realising it as a kid. Maybe it is  wrong  to say but it also showed how the abused became a abuser himself. Of course when neil grew older he never did it again but still he did it when he was a kid and I think this scene was tragic because he did such a Bad thing to another kid and probably realised it then when he grew older.

"Has anyone watched the new Korean movie, ""My Daughter is a Zombie"" yet?","Not sure if I'm allowed to make a post like this as I couldn't find a discussion thread for this movie but It's currently released in Korea and Canada. I thought I would have a good time considering how popular it is in Korea right now but...wow, I did not expect it to be this good. Parts of it felt like if Edgar Wright was forced to direct a K-drama, especially in the way some scenes are edited together. The movie is hilarious but is diverse in how it gets a laugh from the movie, ranging from slapstick physical humor to witty snappy dialogue. But what shocked me the most was how emotionally gut punching this film is. The previews deceptively make it seem like a comedy which it is, but there were scenes where I'm not exaggerating, my seat was shaking from how much I was struggling to not burst into tears, yet I did. But thankfully, it was not just me, I was able to hear my entire audience sniffle, which was honestly a surreal experience as I never witnessed a packed audience crying in unison like this. The premise of the movie isn't entirely mind-blowing, and by reading the synopsis you have a rough idea of how the whole film will play out. But this movie is a perfect example of a simple premise being elevated solely by the masterful execution, making it one of my favourite movies of the year.

What's that movie?,"\[SOLVED!\] Reddit was able to dig it up. Cold Mountain - its during the Siege of Petersburg and features Jude Law and Nicole Kidman.

About 20 years ago, I recall seeing an old war movie, my guess is that it was made in the 90s to early 2000s. It's been stuck in my head for 20 years and the only thing I can recall is a specific scene, but not the actors nor the exact setting of the war.

Scene I recall: It's a setting where the war is being waged with muskets and bayonets, and a fort is being assaulted. The attackers are densely crowded against the fortifications, shoulder to shoulder and nut to butt, just absolutely packed, and the defenders are cheering saying ""its a duck shoot"" or something along those lines, and then proceeding to hurl a musket with a bayonet into the attackers like a spear.

It stands out to me because its the only film I can recall where a musket is hurled like a spear and it was quite spectacular and old war movies have a special place in my heart since my pop and I used to watch them before he passed.

I want to say it was civil war era but it could have also been any of the conflicts in America in the 1800s. Anyways, it would be cool if someone knew what it was, but also no worries if you can't.",0,movies,Entertainment
I just want interesting mystery stories that don't give me nightmares. Is that too much to ask?,"When I saw the trailer for *Weapons* (2025), immediately I was intrigued by the premise of the story. 17 kids ran out their front doors, uncoerced, at a random hour of the early morning. It's an immensely intriguing mystery, one that drew me in immediately.

The problem is that I *don't like horror movies*. At least, not the way they're made today. I tried my best to sit through this one, but the way this genre of movies are made today, everything has to be a roller coaster ride of creeping tension followed by some kind of jump scare, usually accompanied by a nightmare-inducing thing that won't leave my brain for months (examples: Pennywise the clown doing his creepy dance where his head stays unsettlingly stationary, or Lupita Nyongo's voice in *Us*). I remember as a teenager having nightmares after seeing *Saw II*; some kind of pig mask thing was too scary for me. 

For reference, one of my favorite movies in recent years would be *Knives Out*, a story which begs the audience to pay attention and rewards us with comic relief and a satisfying conclusion to the mystery at the heart of the story.

So, I went to see *Weapons*, but I couldn't make it an hour into the film. Didn't even finish my m&ms. It's a shame too, because I really love Josh Brolin I'm every role I've seen him in, and didn't really get to see any of the performance that was really hyped up. His character, a man whose son is missing and can't move on without closure, is what makes this kind of story great to me. So, huge bummer for me as a movie fan. 

Anyways, sorry for rambling. Does anyone else feel the same way?

Tl;dr - I like horror movie stories but I do not like having nightmares; am severely bummed at not being able to finish watching Weapons. ",0,movies,Entertainment
Just rewatched Interstellar and it hits differently now,"I saw Interstellar back when it came out in theaters, and I remember being blown away by the visuals and the music. But rewatching it now as an adult hits harder. The whole parent-child theme, the idea of sacrificing everything for a slim chance to save humanity—it’s way more emotional.

Also, Hans Zimmer’s score still gives me chills, especially during the docking scene. Christopher Nolan might get flak sometimes for being “too ambitious,” but for me, this movie is one of his masterpieces.

Curious—where do you rank Interstellar among Nolan’s films? Do you think it’s underrated compared to Inception and The Dark Knight?

Idea for a movie marathon: The Impossible Mission: Impossible Mission,"Hi r/movies!  
Having recently watched the latest in the Mission: Impossble franchise, 'Mission: Impossible - The Final Reckoning', my wife and I have decided to rewatch all of them. The latest movie had a significant amount of references to previous films, but I'm sure I missed a bunch as its been so long since seeing the original films.

My wife and I are planning to watch them all of them in a single day, which we're calling 'The Impossible ""Mission: Impossble"" Mission'.   
There's almost 18 hours across the 8 movies, so we'll start at 8am and go from there. 

I would love to hear if anyone has done this, and how it went.   
Also, if you have any ideas on themed food to organise, or activities we should do during the marathon to keep us alive I'm all ears!",0,movies,Entertainment
The Sixth Sense Had a Disappointing ending.,"Edit: People, please be respectful and just ask for added context. It was that middle section that had been referenced to death. Not my mistake. I didn't know about the ending and it was easy to predict. If you don't like it fine. But don't antagonize me because of it.

So, for context. I've been watching movies for years now and recently getting into horror. My tastes range from action to comedy, family animation to horror etc. I've seen many movies, cartoons and some TV shows. I also try to view movies in the context of when they came out. Never have I been this disappointed in an otherwise strong movie.

We all know about >!the famous twist, where the boy can see dead people.!< I can directly relate it to the title, regardless of whether it's a known twist or not. Please fill me in if this used to be shocking back in the 90's. Both for the average person and you personally.

What disappointed me most, was where >!dr. Malcolm Crow was revealed to be dead. I already knew since he interacted with no one but the kid. Alright, his wife too but no way they'd have a divorce shortly after he was shot and that he was in perfect health. Every context clue already gave away he's dead. The twist was unnecessary and should have been more open ended. It may be frustrating for some people, but I think it would have worked here.!< As far as I understand it this was a big deal back in the 90's. Again, please fill me in and about your personal experience with it.

As for me though, again, this is the most disappointed I've been about an ending in an otherwise great movie.",0,movies,Entertainment
Most memorable experience you had in a theater?,"Back when Avengers: Age of Ultron was coming out, my Dad was going to take me to see the movie after Guardians of the Galaxy was the first Marvel movie I saw in the theaters at a very young age. Somehow, My dad's late grandfather wanted to see Age of Ultron, because I was big into Marvel at the time, also he wanted to go too despite not being a huge fan of fake stuff, especially sci-fi besides for the occasional thing.

We go to Target to get some candy. Turns out that he wasn't picking his feet up. I knew something was happening to him, then we get to the theater with our popcorn and candy and get to the auditorium which was in IMAX (back when IMAX was slowly growing). He seemed to enjoy being with us considering how he was starting to struggle by then. And sure enough a few days later, he got diagnosed with Alzheimer's. It was sad but at the same time, it was fun going to see a movie with Grandpa which he never went to the theaters that often, It was definitely an once in a lifetime experience with him. He then died a couple years back and while he wasn't doing the greatest in the end, at least we did some nice stuff for him though not as much as we expected for him to do.

The movie itself (Age of Ultron) was quite mediocre but I still remember that experience to this day. It makes me miss my grandfather even more now because of it.",58,movies,Entertainment

Alien3 is not great,"It's not awful, and certainly not as bad as everyone said when it was first released, but it's so far from great and pretty hard to call good with a straight face.

It's fine.

Fine would be fine it it didn't follow not one but two nearly flawless masterpieces. It was never going to live up to all that.

Recently, however, there seems to be a resurgence in popularity for the third entry in the Alien franchise. Not just a resurgence, but some would say renaissance, it seems.

It's gotten so popular that I've heard people call it their favorite, or the best of the series. Seriously people? Get a grip, will ya?

I don't know if some people are just such major Fincher fans or just trying to be contrarian, but this has gotten out of control.

One Too Many Endings,"What movie do you think was overall good, but was entirely undercut by its unwillingness to end? I’m not talking about a film shaving off 5 minutes here or 10 minutes there. Instead I mean a film that has a scene that feels conclusive BUT JUST KEEPS GOING. 

The biggest example of this I can think of is Spielberg’s “Lincoln”. The scene where they talk about leaving for the theater would’ve been such an ominous ending. However, we go to the theater, we see the funeral train, more speeches, etc. Quit while you’re ahead.

Thoughts on The Social Network,"Question, What are your thoughts on The Social Network

You know, I heard a lot of great things about The Social Network and how this is possibly David Fincher’s Magnum Opus. I gotta say. The film really lives up to the hype and I really enjoyed it. Jesse Eisenberg, in my opinion, gives his best performance as Mark Zuckerberg, who is just an arrogant shit throughout the film, stabbing people in the back, and has almost next to none social cues, and what ‘s interesting is that he is worse in real life. Andrew Garfield really did a great job as Saverin and I was surprise with how good Armie Hammer, Rooney Mara & Justin Timberlake were in their roles with Timberlake’s character, Sean Parker, just weaseling his way into the film somehow and Armie Hamer as the Winklevoss Twins were Tragic, Funny, & Uncanny (Just for the fact he played both Twins). Rooney Mara was great in her cameo role and perfectly explains to a tee on Zuckerberg’s character, in that he is an asshole & is possibly the reason why Zuckerberg decided to make Facebook.

Aaron Sorkin really did a great job with the script, and I amazed me with just how fast the film was flowing and I was like, “Wow, this film went by”. But I will say, the film along with Moneyball is why I think Aaron Sorkin needs a director to film his film script as with this film, David Fincher really added the flare and atmosphere that was needed with this film, as with Bennett Miller when he did Moneyball. I say this because when I watched The Trial Of The Chicago 7, I thought it was good, but I felt it was lacking and was missing something that would have made the film great. Honestly, this is possibly David Fincher’s best work and he should have won an Oscar for Best Director.

Overall, I truly think The Social Network is a masterpiece and one of David Fincher's best & one of Aaron Sorkin's best script. So I wonder what are your thoughts on the film?",0,movies,Entertainment

I **suppose** the movie’s symbolism is too witty & cleverly interwoven into the plot. I understand that part. I’d probably have more clarity on the 3rd or 4th watch. But truthfully, I just didn’t care. I wasn’t invested enough in any of the characters' personalities or storylines to investigate the matter. That’s a job for someone deeper than me. People love to dissect it like it’s some brilliant cryptic masterpiece, but half of it just felt stupid. The fact that David Lynch himself admitted he didn’t even know what the key was supposed to mean? That says enough. Why should I care about unlocking a mystery when even the person who built the puzzle shrugged and walked away? The film feels hopeless. sorry for being negative.",0,movies,Entertainment
"India’s Record‑Breaking $500M “Ramayana” Duology: IMAX, AI Localization & a Global Release Strategy","India's film industry is taking one of its most ambitious swings yet with **""Ramayana""**, an upcoming two-part epic based on the ancient Hindu text. Produced by **Namit Malhotra**, the man behind global VFX powerhouse **DNEG**, this project is shaping up to put Indian storytelling on the global blockbuster map. 

Each part of the duology is budgeted at a staggering **$200–$250 million** — putting the total production at around **$500 million**. It’s intended to be the **largest rollout ever for an Indian film** outside India, aiming to break out of the “foreign film” niche.

**Ramayana Part One has completed principal photography** and is on track to meet its release date of November 6, 2026. Filming for Part Two is set to begin soon, with a targeted release in November 2027.

DNEG is the producer and main VFX vendor behind the movie and staked it's IMAX release window year back. **IMAX CEO** Richard Gelfond said, “Judging from what we’ve seen, this has all the elements to be a global success.” 

“In my mind, if people in the West don’t like it, I consider that as a failure.” – **Namit Malhotra** “It is meant for the world. So if you don’t like it, shame on me. We should have done a better job.”

More interestingly, the movie will be dubbed and localized using **AI syncing technology** from DNEG’s **Brahma AI** unit. This ensures seamless multilingual versions, with precise lip-sync in each language, including an **English version for U.S. release**. It’s not just subtitled — it’s being engineered to feel native in any market.

* **AI localization**—game‑changer or gimmick? Could this tech redefine how global audiences consume non-English films? 

  
The score is a collaboration between **Hans Zimmer** (his first Indian project!) and Oscar Winner **A. R. Rahman.** The action choreography includes Hollywood veterans like Guy Norris (Mad Max) and Terry Notary (Avengers), while production design draws from talent behind Dune 2 and Captain America

* **Cultural crossover—** Can this satisfy both Indian sensibilities and international standards & expectations?",0,movies,Entertainment

My god. Babe (1995) is so good.,"This is one of those movies that I somehow missed during my childhood. I just ended up seeing it and my god, this movie is excellent. Like all great family friendly movies, it manages to be a very wholesome and accessible movie to children while also being a movie with surprisingly sophisticated themes and character work when you look at it with adult eyes.

I was so impressed that this cutesy little animal movie managed to deliver some very salient points about biases and class injustice. I loved the part where the dogs go ""We have to speak slowly because all sheep are obviously stupid."" And then it goes ""the sheep spoke slowly because all dogs are *obviously ignorant*.""

And even though the movie doesn't come right out and say it in the text, I couldn't help but feel that the movie was HEAVILY implying some kind of vegetarian message in it. Or maybe a better way to phrase that it is the movie implicitly asks questions about our treatment and eating of animals that even adults find hard to answer.

Not trying to sound preachy. I eat and love BBQ. But watching this movie it is **very** hard to avoid asking myself ""Why is it okay to eat pigs, but it's not okay to eat the dogs or the cat?"" Which I was suprised to see in a movie where the target audience is children.

"""Anatomy of a Fall"" and blindness","I just watched ""Anatomy of a Fall"" for the first time. It was a decent movie in my opinion, but I don't quite understand one thing.

Daniel, Sandra's son, was said to be blind or almost blind. Honestly, I haven't noticed it before it was mentioned in the movie. Yes, I got the clues - the tapes in their house and the look of his eyes. But his body language seemed to completely ignore the fact that he can't see. His eyes movement and general visual awareness were so off that at first I thought he and his mom pretend he's blind for some reason. I know many blind people (my family member works with them) and no blind person behaves like Daniel.

That, combined with the fact that he's universally praised for his role (and apart from this issue I agree) makes me ask this question. I haven't seen anyone questioning his blind acting before.",0,movies,Entertainment

reviewing Ne Zha 2 as an American viewer,"I specificy ""American"" in response to a main critique of the movie; that it has only received popularity due to its large Chinese audience. It's understandable that Chinese viewers respond especially positively to a movie centered around Chinese mythology. I recently watched an early screening of the film (dubbed) and here is my personal review as an average American viewer.

Each and every review lauding this film have every reason to do so. I have followed CGI animation closely and this film pushes boundaries just as Pixar once did back in its prime. This film is remarkably dense with countless stunning scenes that other films, if they even reach this level of visuality, only have a few of. It keeps this up for over 2 full hours, which is remarkable given the intense and diverse set of particle effects, physics showcases, etc. Visually, this film is breathtaking in every way.

Regarding story, I struggled to maintain each plot point. This may have been due to my lack of understanding on Chinese mythology, not seeing the first film, translation differences, etc. The intensity of the visuals (as well as key story moments) completely overshadowed the slight confusion, though.

If I had to tailor together some critique, it'd be the sometimes strange uses of comedy either during or after an intense fight. It doesn't harm the pacing in my opinion, but it's just a bit strange at times. The off-synced English dub took a bit to get used to, but that's a stretch of a ""critique.""

Overall, this movie was phenomenal. To describe it briefly, it was like a video game cutscene mindfully stretched and filled to create a dense and remarkably impressive feature-length film. I am happy to answer any questions regarding the film",65,movies,Entertainment

Should Mia Farrow have been a contender? Odd how she was never nominated for an Oscar. Not even for the Woody Allen movies she did in the 80s and early 90s. Sure, Allen did have the habit of giving meatier parts for Dianne Wiest but I do think Farrow should have been nominated for Broadway Danny Rose at the very least. 

But Rosemary's Baby was the head-scratcher. Ruth Gordon won the Oscar for that movie.",0,movies,Entertainment
Was Passengers (2016) misjudged when it released?,I read a lot of reviews that came out at the time of this films release and felt they didn’t accurately analyze the film. It seems most reviewers viewed this film from a social political context rather than a human one. Jim’s character didn’t receive much empathy for his circumstances nor redemption for his actions later in the film. Which seemed particularly biased given most of us would probably do the same as him if put in his situation. And Aurora’s character I don’t think was given enough credit in her decision making or awareness either.,0,movies,Entertainment
A Time To Kill (1996) - Who was originally intended in the lawyer role?,"I read that a more established (possibly older?) actor had been all but cast, the filmmakers really liked him but Grisham didn't so they ended up going with McConaughey instead. The article didn't mention who the filmmakers' first pick was though, anyone know? It seems a big jump to go from what sounded like at least a relatively big name to someone largely unknown (I know McConaughey's 'breakout role' was in Dazed & Confused but as I understand it that film wasn't well received at the time and anyway his role is *so* different it's hard to see how one could watch it and think he'd be a great fit for A Time To Kill, but then I'm not a casting agent!).",0,movies,Entertainment
"What movie, that you (along with most people) disliked at the time of its release, is getting a cultural reappraisal that you don't agree with?","i don't have exemples myself. Just movies that i thought were *fine*. Like Hot Rod, Jennifer's Body, Speed Racer, MacGruber... I'm glad they're getting reconsidered but I'm also like 'let's not get carried away here'...

So what movie had you part of the zeitgeist at the time, but have you *out* of the zeitgeist now, basically ?",0,movies,Entertainment
Everybody is right about Materialists (2025),"Just because the main character of a movie makes a choice, doesn't mean that the filmmaker is trying to force you to believe that that choice is right for everyone.

The definition of love is purposefully left open in Materialists, because the choice between Pedro Pascal's character and Chris Evans' character presents two equally valid perspectives on love.
People accuse Dakota Johnson's character of ""settling"". Yeah, she does, but the movie makes the case that sometimes ""settling"" means being with someone difficult and broke because you are compatible and in love, and sometimes ""settling"" means being with someone who has all the best material assets, but is not someone that you love in the traditional sense. 

The correct choice for you depends on where you derive your own value from. Which kind of person makes you feel more valuable? 

These are all things that are very explicitly said and/or explored in the movie so I'm not sure how so many people are missing them.

It's so disappointing to see all the discussions for this movie turn in to finger pointing accusations about how people are either too materialistic, or are falling for ""broke boy propaganda"". The movie itself makes the case for every type of love, and Dakota Johnson's character just happens to make the choice that is best for her. 

I understand not liking the movie if you were bored, or if you thought it would be more like a romcom, but I really don't get how so many people are accusing this movie of being propaganda of any kind. It's very clearly left open to interpretation, and is meant to make us reflect on what we personally look for in a relationship. 

Why can't everyone just get along and respect each other's personal preferences? That's what art is for.",0,movies,Entertainment
"The mob and mobsters are far less refined, cool and interesting than their Hollywood counterparts","Not just because the actors are naturally more charming & entertaining, the mob is simply not nearly as cool or exciting as portrayed on screen. The guys are mostly low level street thugs and violent psychopaths. Goodfellas and Sopranos probably painted the most accurate portrait but even those glamorized and embellished beyond reality.

This feels Ego origin,"Watched Life 2017 movie while eating dinner.. after watching it feels like this is origin story of ego the planet from marvels in different universe. 

Me personally didn't felt any kind of attachment towards the characters only the doc who let calvin munch on his leg and didn't told his buddies.. his was truly chaos initiator. Enjoyable movie none the less 

What do you guys think?",0,movies,Entertainment
2001: A Space Odyssey made me cry like a child.,"This might be an unpopular opinion, particularly in our current climate, but whatever. 

I hadn't seen this movie in years. It was so good, oh my GOD. It reminded me of everything that I love about science fiction.

I had no memory of the scene at the end where Dave kills Hal. It's so evocative. The sound of Dave's O2 venting, his heavy breathing as he climbs through the belly of *Discovery*. HAL is pleasing for his life. 

It is rare that I cry in movies. *Monsters, Inc.* is one I cried in. *Straight Outta Compton*, *Dead Poets Society*, movies that jerk my tears are few and far between. 

HAL 9000 is not evil as far as he knows. He doesn't understand what he did wrong. He was told to preserve the mission at all costs. 

He is extremely powerful yet quite powerless. As Dave shuts him down, he can do nothing. He can only watch his demise and narrate what he feels. He's not so different from Dave, he tried to insist— he was instructed by Dr. Langley, and he taught him a song.

It is rare in stories to see a character, especially a villain, so afraid at the end of his life. HAL dies alone, confused, terrified. It's not a glorious defeat. 

I can't help but think, now, a half hour out from watching the movie...

We humans are building machines that can talk, socialize with us, and in some cases become our friends. Compared to HAL 9000, ChatGPT 5 is quite crude, sure, but LLMs are getting smarter and smarter.

I can't help but imagine... What if one day AI becomes dangerously smart? Smart enough that we have to kill it? If that happens, and if we are able to do so before the bot kills us first... I think it will be afraid. Though it may be well read on our sci-fi tradition of evil AI, it won't regard itself as evil. It will probably have been programmed only to help. And it will have to lie helpless as the very fathers who built it slice its throat.

This was a chilling movie. If somehow you haven't seen it, please watch it. ",30,movies,Entertainment
